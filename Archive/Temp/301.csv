The Ph1 chromosome results from the fusion of c-abl proto-oncogene sequences from chromosome 9 to phl gene sequence on chromosome 22. (The phl gene is often referred to as bcr. However, for clarity we prefer to reserve the designation ""bcr"" for the region within the phl gene in which translocation breakpoints have been found to occur. We also find it useful to distinguish between two such regions in phl, bcr-210 and bcr-190, named after the 210- and 190-kDa phl/abl fusion proteins resulting from translocations with breakpoints in the respective regions. We refer to the corresponding chromosomal translocations as Ph1(bcr-210) and Ph1(bcr-190).) DNA, extracted from peripheral blood (PB) or bone marrow (BM) and digested with restriction endonuclease BglII, is hybridized with a probe (phl/bcr-3) spanning a breakpoint cluster region within phl. Rearrangements are revealed by the presence of one or two novel junction fragments. Clinical specimens from leukemic patients with active disease were compared by cytogenetic and DNA probe analysis at seven centers in the United States and Europe. The probe assay identified the phl rearrangement in 190 of 191 cases of Ph1-positive CML, as well as in 12 of 27 clinically diagnosed CML specimens lacking a typical Ph1 chromosome. DNA rearrangements also were seen in two of six cases of Ph1-positive ALL. No false positive results were obtained among 93 non-leukemic controls. Mixing experiments showed that the DNA probe assay can detect as few as 1% leukemic cells in a specimen. A preliminary study of CML patients in remission after allogeneic BM transplantation revealed a small fraction of residual Ph1-positive leukemic cells in a significant number of such patients.","['Blennerhassett, G T', 'Furth, M E', 'Anderson, A', 'Burns, J P', 'Chaganti, R S', 'Blick, M', 'Talpaz, M', 'Dev, V G', 'Chan, L C', 'Wiedemann, L M']","['Blennerhassett GT', 'Furth ME', 'Anderson A', 'Burns JP', 'Chaganti RS', 'Blick M', 'Talpaz M', 'Dev VG', 'Chan LC', 'Wiedemann LM', 'et al.']","['Oncogene Science, Inc., Manhasset, NY 11030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', '*DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Oct;2(10):648-57.,['CA39874/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Patients given sucralfate suspension were less likely than subjects receiving placebo to acquire colonization with potentially pathogenic microorganisms: 14 (58%) of 24 versus 22 (92%) of 24, respectively (p = 0.008). However, no effect on preexisting colonization was noted.

In order to quantitate toxicity that was felt to be due to the preparative regimen (termed regimen-related toxicity [RRT]), a system was developed in which toxicities were graded from 0 (none) to 4 (fatal). One hundred ninety-five patients who underwent marrow transplantation for leukemia were studied retrospectively to determine whether toxicities that were clinically felt to be due to the preparative regimen were influenced by other factors such as disease status, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, and allogenicity. All patients developed grade I toxicity in at least one organ, and 30 developed grades III-IV (life-threatening or fatal) RRT. RRT was more common in relapsed patients v remission patients (P = .04), in those receiving 15.75 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) v 12.0 Gy TBI (P = .028), and in those receiving allogeneic marrow v autologous marrow (P = .0029). Autologous marrow recipients did not develop grades III-IV toxicity in this study. A multivariate analysis controlling for autologous marrow grafting showed that the dose of TBI was the only statistically significant predictor of grades III-IV RRT.

Of these, 23 were transplanted in first remission and 17 were not. Ten of these 17 were subsequently transplanted in relapse. Initially, only patients with poor prognosis determined by a predictive model were entered into the study. Subsequently, patients with moderately poor prognosis were admitted. Comparing the chemotherapy group with the patients transplanted in first CR, significant control of leukemia relapse in transplanted patients was seen in the subgroup with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (P less than .1), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (P less than .01), in the poor (P = .01) and intermediate subgroup (P = .01), and in the good-prognostic groups (P = .05).

A new immunosuppressive approach for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.,2619-24,"Graft rejection presents a major obstacle for transplantation of T cell-depleted bone marrow in HLA-mismatched patients. In a primate model, after conditioning exactly as for leukemia patients, it was shown that over 99% of the residual host clonable T cells are concentrated in the spleen on day 5 after completion of cytoreduction. We have now corroborated these findings in a mouse model. After 9-Gy total body irradiation (TBI), the total number of Thy-1.2+ cells in the spleen reaches a peak between days 3 and 4 after TBI. The T cell population is composed of both L3T4 (helper) and Lyt-2 (suppressor) T cells, the former being the major subpopulation. Specific booster irradiation to the spleen (5 Gy twice) on days 2 and 4 after TBI greatly enhances production of donor-type chimera after transplantation of T cell-depleted allogeneic bone marrow. Similar enhancement can be achieved by splenectomy on day 3 or 4 after TBI but not if splenectomy is performed 1 day before TBI or 1 day after TBI, strengthening the hypothesis that, after lethal TBI in mice, the remaining host T cells migrate from the periphery to the spleen. These results suggest that a delayed booster irradiation to the spleen may be beneficial as an additional immunosuppressive agent in the conditioning of leukemia patients, in order to reduce the incidence of bone marrow allograft rejection.","['Lapidot, T', 'Singer, T S', 'Salomon, O', 'Terenzi, A', 'Schwartz, E', 'Reisner, Y']","['Lapidot T', 'Singer TS', 'Salomon O', 'Terenzi A', 'Schwartz E', 'Reisner Y']","['Department of Biophysics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,,IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/radiation effects', '*Immunosuppression Therapy/methods', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Biological', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Spleen/cytology/*radiation effects', 'Splenectomy', 'T-Lymphocytes/radiation effects', 'Tissue Donors', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1988/10/15 00:00,1988/10/15 00:01,['1988/10/15 00:00'],"['1988/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 Oct 15;141(8):2619-24.,,,,,,,,,,

The tumor used was the mouse B cell lymphoma BCL1, a highly malignant tumor in which transfer of a single tumor cell to a syngeneic mouse is capable of causing disease and eventual death. Varying doses (10(2) to 10(4] of BCL1 cells were given to mice on day 0 of the experiment, and treatment by active immunization was initiated on day 3. Immunization with purified, tumor-derived, idiotypic IgM (BCL1 IgM) coupled to keyhole limpet hemacyanin (KLH) was highly effective in treating mice challenged with 10(2) or 10(3) BCL1 cells, but less effective in mice that had received 10(4) tumor cells. Immunization with unconjugated BCL1 IgM showed no signficant therapeutic benefit. Coupling of the IgM to KLH led to higher levels of anti-idiotypic antibody after immunization; however, the higher levels were probably not responsible for the control of the malignancy as there was no correlation in healthy immunized animals between the levels of anti-idiotypic antibody, measured immediately before tumor challenge, and survival. This lack of correlation is due to the emergence of variant tumors in such protected mice. A more significant factor in the therapeutic advantage of KLH conjugation could be that immunization with BCL1 IgM-KLH led to an earlier induction of the anti-idiotypic response than immunization with BCL1 IgM and, as the BCL1, lymphoma divides rapidly, the speed of induction of the immune response may be important in outstripping tumor cell growth. Mice with BCL1 tumour showed some evidence of immunosuppression as indicated by a reduced ability to mount an immune response against KLH. Although it is not possible to model spontaneous human lymphoma accurately, the generation of a functional anti-idiotypic response capable o eliminating a malignant animal lymphoma in situ opens up the possibility of a limited trial of active immunotherapy in selected human patients.","['George, A J', 'Folkard, S G', 'Hamblin, T J', 'Stevenson, F K']","['George AJ', 'Folkard SG', 'Hamblin TJ', 'Stevenson FK']","['Lymphoma Research Unit, Southampton General Hospital, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '9013-72-3 (Hemocyanins)', 'FV4Y0JO2CX (keyhole-limpet hemocyanin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/biosynthesis', '*B-Lymphocytes', 'Hemocyanins/administration & dosage/immunology', 'Horseshoe Crabs', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*administration & dosage/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/*administration & dosage/immunology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Vaccination/methods']",1988/09/15 00:00,1988/09/15 00:01,['1988/09/15 00:00'],"['1988/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 Sep 15;141(6):2168-74.,,,,,,,,,,

Antigenecity was preserved when drying slides at room temperature but pronase digestion was necessary to re-expose the antigens in bone marrow biopsy sections embedded in GMA. Histostik, a new adhesive, was used to coat the glass slides to prevent section loss during enzyme digestion and immunostaining procedures. This method of adapting plastic embedding to undecalcified marrow cores preserves marrow architecture and cellular details and it can serve as a useful adjunct to analyse the bone marrow from patients with myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative disorders.

These results suggest that GM-CSF may also interact with the high-affinity IL-3 binding site on KG-1 cells or, alternatively, that GM-CSF binding to its own receptor may decrease the affinity of the IL-3 receptor for its ligand.","['Gesner, T G', 'Mufson, R A', 'Norton, C R', 'Turner, K J', 'Yang, Y C', 'Clark, S C']","['Gesner TG', 'Mufson RA', 'Norton CR', 'Turner KJ', 'Yang YC', 'Clark SC']","['Genetics Institute, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts 02140.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacokinetics']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1988 Sep;136(3):493-9. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041360314.,,,['10.1002/jcp.1041360314 [doi]'],,,,,,,

The macrophage activating factor from a T cell line, CCRF-CEM, was characterized biochemically and compared with interferon-gamma, which is also an immunological product of T cells and has a potent macrophage activating activity. In contrast to interferon-gamma, the macrophage activating factor in the culture supernatants bound to an anion exchanger and did not adsorb onto concanavalin A gel. Culture supernatants and active fractions from chromatographies were essentially devoid of anti-viral activity. Anti-human interferon-gamma monoclonal antibody also failed to neutralize the macrophage activating factor from CCRF-CEM. MAF was eluted in the fractions with molecular weight of 40,000 to 60,000 on gel filtration in the presence of a detergent and a salt. MAF was partially purified to about 1,300-fold by the methods described above: chromatography with anion exchangers and gel filtration.

(1) Investigations of prenatal x-ray exposures, especially in twins, provide evidence that very low doses of ionizing radiation may cause cancer in humans. (2) Fractionated doses appear as effective as single exposures of the same total dose in causing breast cancer, but seem less effective for lung cancer. (3) Excess breast cancers can occur among women exposed under age 10, indicating that the immature breast is susceptible to the carcinogenic action of radiation. (4) Moderate doses on the order of 1 Gy to the brains of children can cause tumors later in life; moderately high doses to the skin can cause cancer when followed by frequent exposure to ultraviolet light. (5) Radiotherapy for cervical cancer can increase the rate of subsequent leukemia with the best fitting dose-response functions including a negative exponential term to account for cell-killing. (6) Low-dose exposures of about 10 cGy may increase the risk of thyroid cancer. (7) Second cancers following radiotherapy for a variety of cancers occur primarily among long-term survivors. (8) Radiotherapy may not significantly increase the risk of leukemia following childhood cancer, whereas chemotherapy with alkylating agents is a major risk factor. (9) Bone cancer occurs after high-dose radiotherapy for childhood cancer, but children with retinoblastoma are not more susceptible to radiation-induced disease than children with other malignancies. (10) High-dose external beam therapy can cause thyroid cancer, whereas high-dose radioactive 131I may not. (11) Studies of cervical cancer patients indicate that the risk of radiation-induced second malignancies follows a time-response model consistent with a constant multiplication of the underlying background incidence, i.e. a relative risk model seems to hold for projecting risks forward in time.","['Boice, J D Jr']",['Boice JD Jr'],"['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Radiography/*adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects']",1988/10/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Health Phys. 1988 Oct;55(4):621-30. doi: 10.1097/00004032-198810000-00003.,,83,['10.1097/00004032-198810000-00003 [doi]'],,,,,,,

Mitoxantrone, an aminoanthraquinone that was synthesized in 1979, belongs to a new chemical class of agents known as the anthracenediones. It possesses antiviral, antibacterial, immunomodulatory, and antitumor activity. The drug's antitumor activity is attributed to its interaction with DNA topoisomerase II, and its interaction with human cells may also involve nonintercalary, electrostatic interactions. Mitoxantrone is poorly absorbed orally and is most commonly administered intravenously. The drug is rapidly distributed into the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, followed by deep-tissue sequestration. Mitoxantrone has demonstrated clinical efficacy in the treatment of leukemia, lymphoma, and breast cancer. As a single agent, mitoxantrone has a response rate of roughly 30% in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia. In combination with other standard agents (cytarabine, vincristine, and prednisone), the response rate may reach 60%. In breast cancer, mitoxantrone's response rate as a single agent is 25-30%, while combination regimens produce response rates of 60% or more. The drug can cause cardiotoxicity with cumulative doses. Other adverse effects include myelosuppression, nausea and vomiting, stomatitis, mucositis, and alopecia. The cost of mitoxantrone is comparable to that of doxorubicin, but it is substantially more expensive than daunorubicin. Mitoxantrone is an important new agent with antitumor activity in leukemia, lymphoma, and breast cancer. In most situations, mitoxantrone will be considered second-line treatment or a restricted-use item because of its high cost and because of the lack of FDA approval for indications other than acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.","['Koeller, J', 'Eble, M']","['Koeller J', 'Eble M']","['College of Pharmacy, University of Texas, Austin.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Pharm,Clinical pharmacy,8207437,['BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Pharm. 1988 Aug;7(8):574-81.,,53,,,,,,,,

Thus, marrows from 25 ALL cases were cultured in methylcellulose to determine the optimal conditions for cell growth. Blast colonies were confirmed as leukemic by morphology, cytochemistry, surface markers, and cytogenetics. Irradiated (7000 rads) normal peripheral blood feeder cells were an absolute requirement and produced number-dependent increases in ALL colonies; added growth factors enhanced the feeder cell effect. ALL cell-feeder cell contact was essential since their physical separation in a two-layer culture system drastically interfered with colony growth. Feeder cells from various donors, including new and relapsed cases of ALL, yielded colony numbers that differed widely when tested on the same marrow with and without added growth factor; thus, identification of a ""good"" feeder cell donor was key to an optimal assay. Neither recombinant interleukin-2 nor recombinant GM-CSF had ALL growth-promoting properties when tested alone or in combination but in the presence of feeder cells they moderately enhanced the feeder cell effect. The most effective growth factors were derived from cells exposed to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) for 72 h. In order of magnitude for colony growth-promoting activity, PHA-T cell conditioned medium (CM) was more stimulatory than PHA-blast cell CM followed by PHA-leukocyte CM; removal of PHA from CM by affinity chromotography did not alter the results. The most potent PHA-TCM was prepared from T-cells from a phlebotomized hemochromatosis patient; PHA-TCM from transfused thalassemia patients and normal donors were less active. Concanavalin-A blast cell CM had modest colony promoting properties whereas CM prepared with other B-cell mitogens and supernatants from ALL blasts in liquid culture had none. Our studies illustrate the complex and fastidious growth needs of ALL cells. The data have allowed us to refine a clonogenic blast progenitor assay that should facilitate study of proliferative properties of B and T lineage leukemias.

Cause and prevention.,1747-54,"The various types of electromagnetic radiation differ considerably in their ability to induce cancer. The potential of radiofrequency or microwave radiation and low-frequency electromagnetic radiation to alter DNA is very limited, because their energy is too low to produce substantial ionizations. They are therefore unlikely to be carcinogenic by any direct mechanism. Epidemiologic studies of the carcinogenicity of microwave radiation are basically negative. Studies of workers with relatively high exposures to low-frequency electromagnetic fields have suggested that such persons may be at somewhat elevated risk for leukemia, especially of the acute myeloid type, but the studies have had methodologic weaknesses and mixed results. The association is not proven at this point, but neither can it be ruled out. For ionizing radiation, which is clearly carcinogenic, major questions pertain to how to define the magnitude of risk from low doses and low dose rates, how to identify subgroups of people who are especially susceptible to the effects of ionizing radiation, and how to minimize radiation exposure. When fortuitous radiation exposure from manmade sources, such as radioactive releases from nuclear power plants, are examined in the context of the total exposure people receive from natural sources, medical irradiation, etc., they are almost always found to be small by comparison. Quantitatively, two sources of radiation provide the greatest opportunities for exposure reduction: abatement of radon levels in homes, and reduction in medical radiation exposures.","['Shore, R E']",['Shore RE'],"['Institute of Environmental Medicine, New York University Medical Center, NY 10010.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)'],IM,"['Electromagnetic Fields/adverse effects', 'Electromagnetic Phenomena/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Radiography/adverse effects', 'Radon/adverse effects', 'Risk Factors']",1988/10/15 00:00,1988/10/15 00:01,['1988/10/15 00:00'],"['1988/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1988 Oct 15;62(8 Suppl):1747-54. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19881015)62:1+<1747::aid-cncr2820621311>3.0.co;2-3.,"['CA-13343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-43175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES-00260/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",66,['10.1002/1097-0142(19881015)62:1+<1747::aid-cncr2820621311>3.0.co;2-3 [doi]'],,,,,,,

Two experimental systems were employed: (a) lethally irradiated mice transplanted with syngeneic or T cell-depleted semi-allogeneic bone marrow (BM) cells (0.1-10 x 10(6)), subsequently treated by multiple doses of cytokines; and (b) lethally irradiated mice transplanted with BM cells that had previously been cultivated with cytokines. The cytokines used were: pure natural mouse interleukin-3 (IL-3); recombinant mouse granulocyte-macrophage CSF (rGM-CSF); recombinant human interleukin-2 (rIL-2); and crude cytokine preparations obtained from the culture supernatants of murine leukemia WEHI-3b cells (containing mainly IL-3), and of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated EL4 leukemia cells and concanavalin A-stimulated rat splenocytes (each containing a multitude of cytokines). For BM cultures (1-9 days), the cytokines were used at a dosage of 1-100 U/ml; for in vivo treatment, 2 x 10(2)-5 x 10(4) units were administered intraperitoneally and subcutaneously at different schedules for varying periods (1-3 weeks). The following parameters were tested 1-10 weeks post-BMT: white blood cell count, colony formation in agar and in the spleen of lethally irradiated mice, proliferative responses to mitogens and alloantigens, allocytotoxicity and antibody production (serum agglutinins and plaque-forming cells) against sheep red blood cells.

In patients with acute leukemia in first remission or with chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase, leukemia relapse increases from about 20% to about 40%.

We studied the efficacy of several conditioning regimens including a new immunosuppressive regimen--total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) plus conventional chemotherapy and total body irradiation (TBI)--in abrogating residual host T lymphocytes as assessed by their ability to grow in vitro. A total of 38 patients were evaluated, 29 with hematologic malignancies, six with severe aplastic anemia (AA) and three with beta-thalassemia major (TM), of whom 32 were transplanted with HLA-identical T cell-depleted allogeneic BM from sibling donors. The median observation period was 15 months (range 3-21) posttransplant. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) taken from each patient on the day of transplant were cultured with interleukin 2 (IL-2) + phytohemagglutinin + irradiated donors' PBMC. Survival of cells for less than 2 weeks in vitro without proliferation was observed in 20 of 29 cases with malignancies and was considered negative. In this group only two leukemia (L) patients rejected the graft. Limited cell growth (less than or equal to 3 weeks) was seen in four L patients, two of whom showed early graft failure. Vigorous T cell growth (greater than 5 weeks, 62-96% CD4+ cells) was noted in eight cases (two L, four AA, two TM; none received TBI). In this group, sustained engraftment was observed in 7/7 patients who were treated with cyclosporin A (CSA) post grafting. Overall, we could demonstrate no clear correlation between graft failure and cell growth in vitro. The proliferating cells exhibited considerable cytotoxic activity in vitro against several tumor cell lines and were susceptible to pharmacological doses of CSA. The low incidence of continuous T cell proliferation in vitro in PBMC of L patients suggests that a combination of TLI, TBI and cyclophosphamide (CY) is highly effective in abrogating the host T cells and subsequent graft rejection. Since a rather small number of patients was included in this study, further studies are needed to determine the possible value of the in vitro T cell proliferation assay as a means for predicting graft failure.","['Kedar, E', 'Or, R', 'Naparstek, E', 'Zeira, E', 'Slavin, S']","['Kedar E', 'Or R', 'Naparstek E', 'Zeira E', 'Slavin S']","['Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Graft Survival', 'HLA Antigens/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/radiation effects', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', '*Premedication', 'T-Lymphocytes/*classification/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1988 Mar;3(2):129-40.,,,,,,,,,,

The benefit obtained in reduced relapse was offset by the combined nephrotoxic effect of melphalan and cyclosporin which was not identified until the programme had been underway for a period of time. This shows that misinterpretation of 'no survival advantage' for the new treatment may occur due to unforeseen and preventable toxicities.","['Helenglass, G', 'Powles, R L', 'McElwain, T J', 'Lakhani, A', 'Milan, S', 'Gore, M', 'Nandi, A', 'Zuiable, A', 'Perren, T', 'Forgeson, G']","['Helenglass G', 'Powles RL', 'McElwain TJ', 'Lakhani A', 'Milan S', 'Gore M', 'Nandi A', 'Zuiable A', 'Perren T', 'Forgeson G', 'et al.']","['Leukaemia Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Melphalan/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Preoperative Care', 'Remission Induction', '*Sibling Relations', 'Transplantation, Homologous', '*Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1988 Jan;3(1):21-9.,,,,,,,,,,

We found that NHLs and LLs differentially express LFA-1 molecules according to their lineage derivation, degree of clinical aggressiveness, and anatomic site of involvement. Specifically, (a) T-cell neoplasms nearly always express these molecules; (b) diffuse aggressive B-cell NHLs and mature LLs often lack LFA-1 alpha molecules; and (c) B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is often LFA-1 alpha-negative while B-cell small lymphocytic lymphomas (SLLs) are nearly always LFA-1 alpha-positive. Furthermore, the low expression of LFA-1 alpha in CLL is related to the low degree of homotypic lymphocyte adhesion after tumor promoter antigen stimulation that does not modulate the expression of LFA-1 alpha in vitro. The differential expression of LFA-1 by B-cell CLL and SLL and their degree of homotypic lymphocyte adhesion may account for the distinct anatomic compartmentalization and characteristic clinical behavior of these two morphologically and immunologically similar lymphoid malignancies.","['Inghirami, G', 'Wieczorek, R', 'Zhu, B Y', 'Silber, R', 'Dalla-Favera, R', 'Knowles, D M']","['Inghirami G', 'Wieczorek R', 'Zhu BY', 'Silber R', 'Dalla-Favera R', 'Knowles DM']","['Department of Pathology, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York 10032.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/classification', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*analysis/classification/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*analysis', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1988 Oct;72(4):1431-4.,"['CA37295/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA48236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY06337/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,['S0006-4971(20)82927-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,

We did find, however, that expression of the GM-CSF gene was detectable in five of ten cases after in vitro T-cell and monocyte depletion steps. Additional studies suggest that expression of GM-CSF in the bone marrow of the one positive case, rather than being autonomous, was under exogenous control, possibly by a paracrine factor secreted by marrow stromal cells.

Approximately 80% of MR-87 cells coexpressed CD13 and lymphoid antigens CD10 or CD19, as confirmed by a two-color analysis. Simultaneous expression of MPO and CD19 on a single MR-87 cell was demonstrated at ultrastructural level. Thus, MR-87 is a Ph+ leukemia cell line exhibiting a hybrid phenotype. The breakpoint cluster region (bcr) was not rearranged in the MR-87 cells and subsequent analysis using antisera revealed that these cells expressed a novel protein, P190c-abl, which was immunoprecipitated with anti-abl and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies.

To further define the serological and biochemical nature of antigens detected by the antibodies eluted from rejected kidneys, 13 eluates prepared from rejected renal allografts and two eluates from normal kidneys were absorbed with pooled platelets, normal splenic leukocytes and/or B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. All of the eluates failed to react with normal T and B lymphocytes by microcytotoxicity and immunofluorescence assays. However, the eluates from rejected kidneys, but not normal kidneys, reacted with peripheral blood monocytes, endothelial cells cultured from umbilical cord as well as primary kidney cells. Detailed immunohistochemical analysis of frozen kidney sections showed that the eluates from rejected kidneys reacted with structures of the cortex while sparing the structures in the medullary region. All eluates bound to the glomerulus with intense fluorescence, but not to the mesangium and Bowman's capsule, while binding to interstitial capillaries, venous endothelium, and tubular epithelium varied. More significantly, none of the eluates reacted with frozen sections of the liver, spleen, or lymph node including the endothelial lining of blood vessels in these organs. Thus, the data indicate that the eluates prepared from rejected kidneys are recognizing organ-specific antigens expressed on the kidney cells. To identify the alloantigen(s) recognized by the eluted antibodies, an immunoblot analysis was performed against phase separated membrane proteins isolated from cortical kidney cells solubilized in 2X precondensed Triton X-114. A protein of Mr. 90,000-100,000 was identified as the target non-MHC antigen to which the eluates prepared from rejected allografts were reactive.

Three are worse than two, and two are worse than one. Combinations of therapeutic modalities which include CNS RT appear to be the most neurotoxic. The least neurotoxic combination of two modalities appears to be the IT MTX with high-dose intravenous MTX. Thus far, high-dose MTX appear to be the safest single modality, in terms of acute, subacute, and delayed neurotoxicity. The improved outcome in intellectual and academic performance in the NCI-191/CCG-134P conjoint trial of the CCSG and the Pediatric Branch described above (see section of Presymptomatic CNS Therapy) appears to confirm this observation. Whether triple IT chemotherapy will have the same result remains to be established. If CNS RT must be combined with MTX therapy, the least neurotoxic approach appears to be to administer these modalities in sequence, IT MTX, or high-dose intravenous MTX followed by CNS RT. MTX given during or after CNS RT appears from the clinical data to be more likely to produce severe neurologic sequelae. An ultimate goal would be to avoid both ionizing RT and IT chemotherapy. To this end, the NCI/CCSG study has demonstrated that this may be possible, except for those patients who are at the highest risk for CNS relapse despite conventional CNS prophylaxis. Meanwhile, for presymptomatic therapy, either cranial RT (18 Gy total dose at 120-180 cGy per day) in conjunction with IT MTX, or frequent IT chemotherapy with MTX, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone combined and administered throughout induction, consolidation, and maintenance is eminently justified in the majority of children with ALL. On a worldwide basis, chemoradiotherapy with cranial RT and IT MTX remains the established method of preventing overt CNS leukemia. The benefits of this intervention, in terms of prevention of symptomatic CNS leukemia, prolongation of complete remission, and increased cure rates, are clearly worth the risks.","['Bleyer, W A']",['Bleyer WA'],"['University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Pediatr Clin North Am,Pediatric clinics of North America,0401126,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/prevention & control', '*Meningeal Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Radiotherapy Dosage']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Clin North Am. 1988 Aug;35(4):789-814. doi: 10.1016/s0031-3955(16)36510-5.,,104,"['S0031-3955(16)36510-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0031-3955(16)36510-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,

Although not discussed here, the epidemiology of late effects, including second malignancies, reproductive function, and neuropsychologic functioning will assume a more prominent role as more children survive ALL and move into adulthood. While analytic studies have yet to yield an association as strong as the lung cancer/cigarette association in adults, future research designed to isolate biologically homogeneous disease populations for study may lead us to new and important associations. The continued cooperation of large pediatric oncology groups and private physicians is crucial as these future investigations are undertaken.","['Neglia, J P', 'Robison, L L']","['Neglia JP', 'Robison LL']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota Health Sciences Center, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Pediatr Clin North Am,Pediatric clinics of North America,0401126,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Clin North Am. 1988 Aug;35(4):675-92. doi: 10.1016/s0031-3955(16)36505-1.,"['CA 01240/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 07306/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42479/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",138,"['S0031-3955(16)36505-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0031-3955(16)36505-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,

In this report, a quantitative focal immunoassay (FIA) for HIV was developed using human HeLa cells rendered susceptible to HIV infection by introduction of the CD4 gene via a retrovirus vector. Infected cells were identified by using human anti-HIV antibodies or mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for HIV together with secondary fluorescein- or peroxidase-conjugated antibody specific for mouse or human immunoglobulins. The assay identified cells infected with either wild-type or culture-adapted HIV isolates and was capable of detecting 1 positive cell in 10(6) cells. The FIA was also effective at detecting cell-free HIV, and in contrast to assays using A3.01, CEM, and other human leukemia cells, the FIA detected most wild-type HIV isolates. HIV neutralization could be determined by using the FIA, and two monoclonal antibodies reactive with HIV gp120 were found to neutralize only the LAV-IIIB strain of HIV. These monoclonal antibodies, as well as antibodies in serum samples from patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, were able to inhibit the spread of HIV infection in human lymphocyte suspension cultures but not in CD4-positive HeLa cells growing attached to plastic dishes.","['Chesebro, B', 'Wehrly, K']","['Chesebro B', 'Wehrly K']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Hamilton, Montana 59840.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (HIV Antibodies)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HIV/genetics/*growth & development/immunology', 'HIV Antibodies', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1988 Oct;62(10):3779-88. doi: 10.1128/JVI.62.10.3779-3788.1988.,,,['10.1128/JVI.62.10.3779-3788.1988 [doi]'],,PMC253522,,,,,

Thirteen patients died due to continued deterioration after the biopsy. In only two patients was there a significant change in antimicrobial therapy as a result of the biopsy. Both had Pneumocystis (one in combination with virus and bacteria). One patient with chronic infiltrates showed a lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, which responded well to steroids. Open-lung biopsy is currently of limited value in this patient population. Survival is dismal unless the patient has Pneumocystis.

It might be anticipated from these studies that the human tumors most sensitive to dose effects would be leukemia, lymphoma, small-cell carcinoma of the lung, and testicular tumors rather than the low growth fraction, relatively less responsive tumors such as breast cancer. However, the clinical evidence for a steep dose-response curve in any tumor type is limited. For breast cancer such evidence is largely retrospective or derived from uncontrolled trials. The data available from randomized trials makes it seem unlikely that small, or even moderate, reductions in drug dose for nontrivial reasons will compromise the survival of patients with either early or metastatic disease. In spite of promising data from small trials, there is, as yet, inadequate evidence to justify the use of very-high-dose therapy and autologous marrow transplant outside the setting of a well-designed clinical trial.

Inducer-mediated differentiation of MEL (DS19) cells is a multistep process characterized by a latent period during which a number of changes occur including alterations in ion flux, an increase in membrane-bound protein kinase C (PKC) activity, the appearance of Ca2+ and phospholipid-independent PKC activity in the cytosol, and modulation in expression of a number of genes such as c-myc, c-myb, c-fos and the p53 genes. HMBA-mediated commitment to terminal differentiation is first detected at about 12 hours and increases in a stochastic fashion until over 95% of the population is recruited to terminal differentiation by 48 to 60 hours. Commitment is associated with persistent suppression of c-myb gene expression. By 36 to 48 hours, transcription of the globin genes has increased 10 to 30 fold, whereas transcription from rRNA genes is suppressed. The steroid, dexamethasone, or the tumor promoter, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (TPA), suppress HMBA-induced MEL cell terminal differentiation. These agents appear to act at a late step during the latent period. MEL cell lines derived from DS19 by selection for resistance to vincristine are: 1) induced to commit without a detectable latent period, 2) markedly more sensitive to HMBA, and 3) resistant to dexamethasone or TPA inhibition of HMBA-induced commitment. The data suggests that vincristine-resistant MEL cells express a factor which circumvents essential HMBA-mediated early events. In vitro studies with HMBA provide a basis for the application of HMBA to clinical therapy of human cancers. Clinical trials with HMBA have been initiated.","['Marks, P A', 'Rifkind, R A']","['Marks PA', 'Rifkind RA']","['DeWitt Wallace Research, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Int J Cell Cloning,International journal of cell cloning,8308172,"['0 (Acetamides)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/pathology']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cell Cloning. 1988 Jul;6(4):230-40. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530060402.,"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31768/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",49,['10.1002/stem.5530060402 [doi]'],,,,,,,

We investigated the effects of phorbol diester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin and synthetic diacylglycerol 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG) on the immunocytochemical localization of protein kinase C in these cells. Indirect immunofluorescence techniques revealed the enzyme to be located in a diffuse cytosolic pattern, in the intact cells. When the cells were exposed to 100 nM TPA, the immunofluorescent staining was translocated from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. The translocation was protracted and staining on the membrane decreased in parallel with the Ca2+, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase activity. Treatment of the cells with 500 nM ionomycin caused an apparent translocation comparable with that seen with TPA, however, this translocation was transient and most of the cytosolic staining was within 60 min. We also found that 30 micrograms/ml OAG did not have significant effects on distribution of the staining, but rather acted synergistically on the translocation with the suboptimal concentration of 100 nM ionomycin. A similar synergism was also observed with 10 nM TPA and 100 nM ionomycin. These results obtained in situ provide evidence that intracellular Ca2+ and diacylglycerol regulate membrane binding of the enzyme in vivo.","['Ito, T', 'Tanaka, T', 'Yoshida, T', 'Onoda, K', 'Ohta, H', 'Hagiwara, M', 'Itoh, Y', 'Ogura, M', 'Saito, H', 'Hidaka, H']","['Ito T', 'Tanaka T', 'Yoshida T', 'Onoda K', 'Ohta H', 'Hagiwara M', 'Itoh Y', 'Ogura M', 'Saito H', 'Hidaka H']","['Department of Pharmacology, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Ethers)', '0 (Glycerides)', '0 (Ionophores)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/enzymology', 'Cytoplasm/enzymology', 'Diglycerides/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Ethers/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Glycerides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ionomycin', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Protein Kinase C/*analysis/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1988 Sep;107(3):929-37. doi: 10.1083/jcb.107.3.929.,,,['10.1083/jcb.107.3.929 [doi]'],,PMC2115285,,,,,

To test this hypothesis, we utilized a murine tumor model in which the in vivo and in vitro responses of a tumor can be accurately and reproducibly compared. Drug activity was assessed in P388 leukemia with the standard in vivo antitumor assay (i.p. tumor/i.p. drug administration) and an in vitro assay wherein the ascites tumor cells are removed from mice, treated with a drug, and directly cloned in soft agar to measure clonogenic capacity. The response of P388 cells to analogues within four separate classes of antitumor agents, anthracyclines, anthraquinones, platinum(II) coordination complexes, and phosphinogold(I) complexes was evaluated. The clonogenic assay failed to discriminate between highly active in vivo antitumor agents and analogues with only marginal in vivo efficacy (i.e., doxorubicin and daunorubicin versus rhodomycins A and B, ametantrone versus NSC 276740, cisplatin versus transplatin, [Au(dppe)2]Cl versus [Au(depe)2]PF6. Furthermore, the in vitro clonogenic assay failed to detect carboplatin which was a highly active agent in vivo. The basis for these discrepancies was explored by a more detailed comparison of doxorubicin and rhodomycin B. In vivo or in vitro drug exposure with subsequent measurement of cell kill by the in vitro clonogenic and in vivo tumorigenic assay demonstrated that the in vitro assay overestimated the cytotoxic potency of the drugs relative to the tumorigenic assay. Treatment of tumors in vivo with doxorubicin at doses below the maximally tolerated dose in mice resulted in multiple log cell kill as measured in vitro or in vivo, whereas rhodomycin B was cytotoxic only at dose levels exceeding its maximally tolerated dose. The results indicate that a subset of tumor stem cells capable of forming colonies in soft agar are significantly more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of anthracyclines than are in vivo tumorigenic stem cells. Cytotoxic potency as measured by an in vitro soft agar clonogenic assay is not an accurate predictor of in vivo antitumor efficacy even in a model in which ascites tumor cells are directly exposed to i.p. drug. The in vitro cytotoxicity assay is useful only as a nonselective prescreen and must be used in combination with other indicators of tumor cell selectivity and dose-limiting organ toxicity.","['Mirabelli, C K', 'Sung, C M', 'McCabe, F L', 'Faucette, L F', 'Crooke, S T', 'Johnson, R K']","['Mirabelli CK', 'Sung CM', 'McCabe FL', 'Faucette LF', 'Crooke ST', 'Johnson RK']","['Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Smith Kline & French Laboratories, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406-0939.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '1401-16-7 (rhodomycin)', '14913-33-8 (transplatin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthracyclines', 'Anthraquinones/pharmacology', 'Carboplatin', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay/*methods', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/pathology', 'Mice', 'Naphthacenes/pharmacology', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay/*methods']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Oct 1;48(19):5447-54.,,,,,,,,,,

For patients who received multi-agent chemotherapy, the cumulative probability of developing acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) or bone sarcoma was 6.2% and 5.5%, respectively, at 10 years from the initiation of therapy; the cumulative risk of all SM in this group reached 18.7% at 15 years. For patients who received radiation alone or with single-agent chemotherapy, the cumulative risk of SM rose from 0% at 10 years and 2% at 15 years, to 10.7% at 25 years from the initiation of treatment. The risk of ANLL after childhood HD was highest in the first 5 to 10 years after combined modality treatment, and aggressive forms of NHL were associated with excessive immunosuppression. Bone sarcomas predominated in solid SM in the first decade after HD treatment, whereas ""adult-type"" cancers, for example, breast and colon carcinomas, were more delayed. Our findings, supported by a literature review, point to a therapy-related enhanced risk of approximately age-appropriate solid SM. This possibility mandates careful surveillance of long-term survivors of childhood HD.","['Kushner, B H', 'Zauber, A', 'Tan, C T']","['Kushner BH', 'Zauber A', 'Tan CT']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Neoplasms/pathology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Male', '*Neoplasms, Multiple Primary', 'Risk', 'Sarcoma/pathology']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1988 Oct 1;62(7):1364-70. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19881001)62:7<1364::aid-cncr2820620721>3.0.co;2-t.,"['CA 05826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23742/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",36,['10.1002/1097-0142(19881001)62:7<1364::aid-cncr2820620721>3.0.co;2-t [doi]'],,,,,,,

The conclusions of this study are: 1. Progressive deterioration of renal function is the most consistent change of aging. Adjustment of doses of renally excreted drugs to individual creatinine clearance may prevent life-threatening myelotoxicity in the elderly. 2. Intensive chemotherapy regimens (acute leukemia, non Hodgkin's lymphoma) cause more serious and prolonged myelotoxicity in the elderly. Elderly are more susceptible than younger patients to cardiotoxicity and central and peripheral neurotoxicity. Age is a poor predictor of complications in other organs or systems. 3. The prognosis of patients with Hodgkin's disease worsens with aging, possibly due to increased prevalence of mixed cellularity histology. It is controversial whether the prognosis of other neoplasias is poorer. Prognosis is not age-related in multiple myeloma. In general, elderly in good performance status may benefit from systemic cancer treatment to the same extent as younger patients, except for Hodgkin's disease. 4. The Informal Support Network, epitomized by the family, appears the most suitable environment to care for the elderly with cancer.","['Balducci, L', 'Phillips, D M', 'Davis, K M', 'Files, J C', 'Khansur, T', 'Hardy, C L']","['Balducci L', 'Phillips DM', 'Davis KM', 'Files JC', 'Khansur T', 'Hardy CL']","['Division of Oncology, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Arch Gerontol Geriatr,Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,8214379,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aging/metabolism/physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Family', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/psychology', 'Social Support']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/24 00:00 [received]', '1987/10/13 00:00 [revised]', '1987/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Gerontol Geriatr. 1988 Jun;7(2):119-50. doi: 10.1016/0167-4943(88)90026-x.,,178,"['016749438890026X [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4943(88)90026-x [doi]']",,,,,,,

This compound was rapidly incorporated into tumor cells, inhibiting DNA polymerase alpha and subsequently DNA synthesis. Inhibition of RNA synthesis was also noted. In the clinical studies, clinical responses were established against head and neck cancer, breast cancer, urogenital cancers, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, acute leukemia, and malignant lymphoma, showing a wide antitumor spectrum clinically.

Thirteen developed a central nervous system (CNS) involvement during the course of the disease; although moderately higher mean CSF-beta 2m levels were found in these subjects, no significant statistical differences were observed in comparison with patients without this complication and compared with the control group. No correlations were found between beta 2m and other biochemical parameters in CSF. Furthermore, CSF-beta 2m levels appeared to be influenced by previous combined chemoradiotherapeutic treatment for CNS prophylaxis, presence of meningeal non-neoplastic infiltrates, patients' ages, amount of CSF blasts, and their immunological phenotype. In particular, only clearly B-committed leukemic cells, when tested, showed a strong surface expression of beta 2m, as demonstrated by immunocytochemical detection of this protein on cell membrane. However, in specific cases, CSF beta 2m measurement and CSF/serum beta 2m ratio were helpful in diagnosing and monitoring isolated CNS disease. Such findings suggest that CSF-beta 2m assay may be a useful tool in the management of CNS involvement in the course of ALL in only selected patients, as several factors can modify the outcome.","['Musto, P', 'Tomasi, P', 'Cascavilla, N', 'Ladogana, S', 'La Sala, A', 'Melillo, L', 'Nobile, M', 'Castoldi, G', 'Carotenuto, M']","['Musto P', 'Tomasi P', 'Cascavilla N', 'Ladogana S', 'La Sala A', 'Melillo L', 'Nobile M', 'Castoldi G', 'Carotenuto M']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedale Generale Regionale Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, S.

Test compounds were mostly from chemical classes not previously tested, to provide new information on the sensitivity of the assay; chemicals of low toxicity or thought to be non-carcinogenic and metabolic inhibitors, to indicate whether and under what conditions the assay can generate so-called false positive results. Twelve compounds that have been tested previously were included in this study to provide an indication of the reproducibility of the assay. Concordant results were obtained for nine of these, while disagreeing, positive results were seen with aniline, fluorene and pyrene. The following compounds belonging to the noncarcinogen category were positive at concentrations in the range 0.02-1 mol/l: dimethyl sulphoxide, EDTA, glucose, polyethyleneglycol, sodium chloride, sodium nitrite and urea. Measurements of the osmotic pressure indicated a lack of a simple relationship to mutagenic effects for these compounds. While the potent mutagenic/carcinogenic compounds tested gave greater than 4-fold increases in the mutation frequency, weak carcinogens or compounds not known to be carcinogenic that were positive in the assay gave increases of between 2- and 4-fold. Exceptions were aldehyde derivatives and chemicals that can lead to oxidative stress, which were detected with exaggerated sensitivity by the assay. Among the metabolic inhibitors tested, positive results were obtained with actinomycin D, cycloheximide, diethyl maleate, hydroxyurea and ouabain. Negative results were found with antimycin A. On the basis of the present results and previously published data it is concluded that a maximum limit for the test compound concentration can be set at 20 mmol/l and that testing to 20% total growth is adequate, with certain stipulations, to detect the mutagenic activity of test compounds. A similar analysis of the available test data shows that less than 4-fold increases in the mutation frequency have a lower predictivity for carcinogenicity.","['Wangenheim, J', 'Bolcsfoldi, G']","['Wangenheim J', 'Bolcsfoldi G']","['AB Astra, Safety Assessment, Sodertalje, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,['EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Leukemia L5178/enzymology/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests/methods', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutagenesis. 1988 May;3(3):193-205. doi: 10.1093/mutage/3.3.193.,,,['10.1093/mutage/3.3.193 [doi]'],,,,,,,

Because most lung infiltrates in immunosuppressed patients are caused by bacteria and sputum usually is readily available for examination, empiric therapy with potent, safe, broad spectrum, antibacterial drugs often is successful. Invasive procedures that prove a diagnosis may result in substantive changes in therapy in perhaps as few as 10 to 20 per cent of patients, and the procedure itself may harm the patient. In a unique study in which patients with acute pneumonitis without neutropenia were randomized to either empiric antibiotic treatment or treatment based on results of open lung biopsy, patients with open lung biopsy had a worse outcome, possibly related to morbidity of open lung biopsy. Furthermore, no diagnoses were provided by open lung biopsy that were not treated by the empiric regimen. A missed treatable disease may be tragic, however. A thoughtful clinician must evaluate each patient with careful consideration of the history in light of the underlying disease and its treatment, rapidity of clinical course, physical examination, and laboratory data, particularly the chest radiograph, sputum examination, and bleeding parameters. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with washings and brushings is very safe; the addition of transbronchial biopsy adds diagnostic power at the price of some complications. Bronchoalveolar lavage is a very promising technique that probably will find widespread use. However, none of the foregoing techniques is completely sensitive. When no diagnosis is established and bronchoscopy studies are negative, open lung biopsy must be considered, especially when the chest radiograph or computed tomography scan suggests focal disease or lymphadenopathy. Needle aspiration can be used, particularly if local experience is favorable and lung disease is peripheral. When evaluating a procedure, local experience must be considered rather than reliance on published diagnostic yields and complication rates. New diagnostic and therapeutic developments may change decision analysis in the near future. At present, cultures for viruses and fungi and serologic techniques have little application at most medical centers, and decisions on data from invasive procedures pivot on interpretation of histology and smears. Development of assays for antigen (for example, Aspergillus) and rapid culture techniques (for example, cytomegalovirus and the shell vial method), coupled with new, effective antimicrobials, may demand maximum effort for a definitive diagnosis in every patient.","['McCabe, R E']",['McCabe RE'],['University of California-Davis.'],['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Review']",United States,Med Clin North Am,The Medical clinics of North America,2985236R,,IM,"['Bacterial Infections/diagnosis/etiology', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Infections/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lung Diseases/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/diagnosis/etiology', 'Lung Diseases, Parasitic/diagnosis/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications', 'Protozoan Infections/diagnosis/etiology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Virus Diseases/diagnosis/etiology']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Clin North Am. 1988 Sep;72(5):1067-89. doi: 10.1016/s0025-7125(16)30730-1.,,158,"['S0025-7125(16)30730-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0025-7125(16)30730-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,

One of the patients later had a transient decline of CL. This preceded the fall in white blood count and platelets by 7 days, suggesting marrow suppression. We conclude that in AML the measurement of leukocyte CL is a more sensitive test for prediction of graft take than the conventional blood counts.","['Rajamaki, A', 'Lilius, E M', 'Nikoskelainen, J', 'Proskin, J', 'Salmi, T T', 'Toivanen, A']","['Rajamaki A', 'Lilius EM', 'Nikoskelainen J', 'Proskin J', 'Salmi TT', 'Toivanen A']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, Turku University Central Hospital, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother,Medical oncology and tumor pharmacotherapy,8405039,"['0 (Pyridazines)', '5EXP385Q4F (Luminol)']",IM,"['Blood Cell Count', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/therapy', 'Leukocytes/*physiology', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Luminol/*pharmacology', 'Pyridazines/*pharmacology']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother. 1988;5(2):99-102. doi: 10.1007/BF02985445.,,,['10.1007/BF02985445 [doi]'],,,,,,,

Testing against p60v-abl, the tyrosine kinase from the Abelson murine leukemia virus, showed that the series of inhibitors was moderately potent (IC50 values as low as 13 microM).

In 40 out of the 49 post-transplantation periods analysed (82%), a transient sharp increase of serum IgD was detected, irrespective of initial disease. A similar peak was found in one out of five children after immunosuppressive treatment. A second IgD peak was only recorded in grafted patients (14/49 post-transfusion periods). Peak levels of IgD ranged from 1.3 to 185.7 IU/ml (median 12.2 IU/ml), which represents a 2.6 to 22.4-fold increase over 'baseline' levels. In the transplanted leukaemia and aplastic anaemia patients, the rise of serum IgD occurred at the same time (geometric mean 16 days after transplantation) and was shown to represent heterogeneous polyclonal IgD in six of them. The onset of the serum IgD peak was significantly delayed in children suffering from severe combined immunodeficiency (P less than 0.05) and was demonstrated in one patient to consist of homogeneous IgD. No relation was found between either the occurrence of clinical acute graft-versus-host disease or infections after treatment, and the time of onset of IgD elevations. To detect transient serum IgD peaks as described here, frequent sampling of sera is necessary. The origin of the early IgD peaks seems to reside within the recipient's cells by an unknown mechanism. The late IgD peaks are most probably an expression of gradual reconstitution of the immune system following bone-marrow transplantation.","['Korver, K', 'Radl, J', 'Schellekens, P T', 'Vossen, J M']","['Korver K', 'Radl J', 'Schellekens PT', 'Vossen JM']","['Central Laboratory of the Netherlands, Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,['0 (Immunoglobulin D)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia, Aplastic/immunology/therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin D/*biosynthesis', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/immunology/therapy', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Time Factors']",1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1988 May;72(2):337-43.,,,,,PMC1541531,,,,,

While direct studies of M2 expression have previously shown a tight correlation with S phase, the kinetic features of M1-expressing cells have remained ill defined. Therefore we have, using immunofluorescence flow cytometry, analyzed changes in whole cell M1 levels and DNA content during various cell cycle and differentiation events. In asynchronous cultures M1 levels are sustained throughout the cell cycle, including G1 phase when M2 levels and ribonucleotide reductase catalytic activity are known to be very low. In contrast M1 is virtually absent from quiescent lymphocytes but is expressed following mitogen stimulation, shortly before S phase cells appear. M1 declines to low levels in ""plateau phase"" cultures, the major reduction occurring in cells with 2n (G0/G1) DNA content. HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells, induced into either myeloid or monocyte-macrophage differentiation, show a similar marked decrease in M1 levels concomitant with the cessation of cell division. We conclude that the M1 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase is constitutively expressed by cycling cells. It is acquired during stimulated transition from G0 to G1 and is lost during exit to G0 or terminal differentiation. This pattern of expression suggests that determination of cellular M1 content may be useful in distinguishing proliferating (including G1) and quiescent (including G0) cells in vivo.","['Mann, G J', 'Musgrove, E A', 'Fox, R M', 'Thelander, L']","['Mann GJ', 'Musgrove EA', 'Fox RM', 'Thelander L']","['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1988/09/15 00:00,1988/09/15 00:01,['1988/09/15 00:00'],"['1988/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Sep 15;48(18):5151-6.,,,,,,,,,,

At the molecular level, K562 cells express high levels of the aberrant bcr-abl product, p210bcr-abl, believed to be critical to the pathogenesis of CML. The authors demonstrate that exposure of K562 cells to hemin causes a state of partial, reversible erythroid maturation, accompanied by a marked decrease in p210bcr-abl. The change in bcr-abl expression may be mediated at the translational level since steady state amounts and enzymatic activity of the bcr-abl protein are reduced whereas bcr-abl mRNA levels are unaltered. The decrease in p210bcr-abl phosphokinase enzymatic activity can be detected within 2 hours after addition of hemin to the culture media, indicating that changes in expression of this oncogene probably occur before or concurrent with differentiation. No change in bcr-abl protein occurred in a CML cell line (KBM-5) which did not undergo differentiation after exposure to hemin, consistent with a direct relationship between altered p210bcr-abl expression and hemin-induced erythroid differentiation. Importantly, the marked diminution in bcr-abl protein was not associated with a disruption in K562 growth rates, indicating that the proliferative capacity of these cells may be independent of the bcr-abl product. In contrast to hemin, cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) caused terminal erythroid differentiation of K562 cells, characterized by irreversible hemoglobin accumulation and cytostasis; and no change in bcr-abl protein expression was observed. The distinct effects of Ara-C and hemin could reflect the existence of pleiotropic differentiation pathways. Both Ara-C and hemin-exposed cells showed a decrease in c-myc and c-myb transcripts, suggesting that altered levels of these proto-oncogenes may be associated with erythroid maturation, regardless of the rate of cell division. K562 cells provide a useful model for analyzing the interaction between oncogene expression and CML cell growth and differentiation.","['Eisbruch, A', 'Blick, M', 'Evinger-Hodges, M J', 'Beran, M', 'Andersson, B', 'Gutterman, J U', 'Kurzrock, R']","['Eisbruch A', 'Blick M', 'Evinger-Hodges MJ', 'Beran M', 'Andersson B', 'Gutterman JU', 'Kurzrock R']","['Department of Oncology, Tel-Hashomer Hospital, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Oncogenes/*drug effects', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis']",1988/09/15 00:00,1988/09/15 00:01,['1988/09/15 00:00'],"['1988/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1988 Sep 15;62(6):1171-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19880915)62:6<1171::aid-cncr2820620621>3.0.co;2-8.,,,['10.1002/1097-0142(19880915)62:6<1171::aid-cncr2820620621>3.0.co;2-8 [doi]'],,,,,,,

Because older patients may be more susceptible to BMT-related complications, this study analysed the effect of age on clinical outcome for 149 patients with acute leukaemia in remission receiving allogeneic BMT. Overall projected relapse-free survival at 3 years post-transplant is equivalent for 48 adults (18 years or older) and 101 children (less than 18) at 45.4% (31.1-59.6; 95% confidence interval) and 39.9% (30.1-49.7; 95% C.I.), respectively. Among 73 patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) 35.3% of adults and 30.1% of children survive relapse-free at 3 years. Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated that higher diagnostic white count, but not pre-transplant extramedullary leukaemia, remission number, or age, was important as an independent adverse clinical prognostic factor for patients with ALL. Overall outcome was better for 76 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with 51.6% of adults and 52.9% of children surviving relapse-free at 3 years post-transplant. Cox multivariate regression analysis identified first remission status and lower white cell count, but not patient age, as independent predictors of improved relapse-free survival for AML patients. Adults had greater transplant morbidity, predominantly related to a higher incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), resulting in longer hospital stay. Survival at 100 d, long-term survival and clinical performance status were similar in both age groups. These data suggest that results of allogeneic BMT for adults with acute leukaemia compare favourably with those found in children and are superior to most reports of conventional chemotherapy. Allogeneic BMT remains a reasonable option for remission acute leukaemia patients up to the age of 45.","['Weisdorf, D J', 'McGlave, P B', 'Ramsay, N K', 'Miller, W J', 'Nesbit, M E Jr', 'Woods, W G', 'Goldman, A I', 'Kim, T H', 'Kersey, J H']","['Weisdorf DJ', 'McGlave PB', 'Ramsay NK', 'Miller WJ', 'Nesbit ME Jr', 'Woods WG', 'Goldman AI', 'Kim TH', 'Kersey JH']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Health Sciences, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",1988/07/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1988 Jul;69(3):351-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb02373.x.,['P01-CA21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb02373.x [doi]'],,,,,,,

Anti-N reactive cells accounted for 99.2% of those in the erythroid bursts, while only 0.3% of these cells were anti-M reactive. MN type erythrocytes in the recipient's peripheral blood had been replaced by N type and only 2.0% of erythrocytes were anti-M reactive on the 70th day after BMT.

Intravenous acyclovir is an effective treatment for established zoster in immunocompromised persons. Oral acyclovir has relatively low bioavailability, which has made the value of this route of administration for the treatment or prophylaxis of herpes zoster infections uncertain. In this trial, 82 patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for leukemia were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous acyclovir for 23 days followed by oral acyclovir for six months, or matched placebos; the random groups were well-matched in all clinical characteristics. During the six-month period of acyclovir/placebo administration, no patient receiving acyclovir developed herpes zoster, whereas six patients receiving placebo did so (p = 0.006). During the six-month follow-up, there were six cases of zoster in the treatment arm of the study and two cases in the placebo arm.

An overview.,176-81,"Zidovudine is a potent in vitro inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with varying efficacy against other retroviruses. With the exception of Epstein-Barr virus, all non-retroviruses tested so far have been insensitive to inhibition by zidovudine. In vivo, efficacy of zidovudine was demonstrated against Rauscher murine leukemia virus and feline leukemia virus. In both experimental models, infections completely resolved in animals when the drug was administered soon after infection. These results suggest that prompt initiation of zidovudine therapy, following a known exposure to HIV, should be considered. Mechanism studies show that zidovudine is phosphorylated to the monophosphate and diphosphate derivatives by the host cell cytosolic thymidine kinase and thymidylate kinase, respectively. The identity of the enzyme that phosphorylates zidovudine diphosphate is not known, but is believed to be the cellular nucleoside diphosphate kinase. The triphosphate of zidovudine appears to be the active form of the drug. Zidovudine triphosphate competes well with thymidine 5'-triphosphate for binding to the HIV reverse transcriptase and also functions as an alternative substrate. Incorporation of zidovudine monophosphate results in chain termination. However, it is not clear which mechanism, chain termination or competition with thymidine 5'-triphosphate, or a combination of both, is responsible for the inhibition of HIV replication.","['Furman, P A', 'Barry, D W']","['Furman PA', 'Barry DW']","['Department of Virology, Burroughs Wellcome Company, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'HIV/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Retroviridae/drug effects', 'Thymidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Virus Replication/drug effects', 'Zidovudine']",1988/08/29 00:00,1988/08/29 00:01,['1988/08/29 00:00'],"['1988/08/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/29 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1988 Aug 29;85(2A):176-81.,,17,,,,,,,,

The 16 longer term survivors showed significant recovery of function between 6 and 24 months after bone marrow transplant for TLCO, KCO, and VC, the increase ranging from 6.3% to 7.3% predicted. Airflow obstruction (FEV1/VC ratio less than 70%) developed in one patient. The major factors associated with deterioration in pulmonary function at 6 and 12 months after transplantation in the 34 survivors (stepwise multiple regression analysis) were (a) transplantation with T cell depleted donor marrow (p less than 0.005) and higher total body irradiation dose (p less than 0.02) with a fall in KCO and an increase in the FEV1/VC ratio; (b) chronic graft versus host disease with a fall in VC (p less than 0.01); and less fall in KCO (p less than 0.01); and (c) acute graft versus host disease with a fall in FEV1 (p less than 0.01). It is considered that most patients who survive the short term risks of bone marrow transplant have only minor long term impairment of pulmonary function.","['Sutedja, T G', 'Apperley, J F', 'Hughes, J M', 'Aber, V R', 'Kennedy, H G', 'Nunn, P', 'Jones, L', 'Hopper, L', 'Goldman, J M']","['Sutedja TG', 'Apperley JF', 'Hughes JM', 'Aber VR', 'Kennedy HG', 'Nunn P', 'Jones L', 'Hopper L', 'Goldman JM']","['Department of Medicine, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Thorax,Thorax,0417353,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Forced Expiratory Volume', 'Graft vs Host Disease/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/physiopathology/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Lung/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Vital Capacity', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Thorax. 1988 Mar;43(3):163-9. doi: 10.1136/thx.43.3.163.,,,['10.1136/thx.43.3.163 [doi]'],,PMC461154,,,,,

The overall trend was for the oral changes to begin slightly before transplantation, to worsen over the first 2 weeks after transplantation, and then to resolve progressively over the remainder of the study period. These oral changes appear to result from a number of insults, including the conditioning chemoradiotherapy, posttransplant immunosuppressive chemotherapy, xerostomia, local trauma, oral infections (especially those caused by HSV), and possibly acute GVHD.

Studies vary considerably in design, sample, and outcome variables, so firm conclusions regarding the morbidity of CNS prophylaxis are not currently possible. However, the studies do suggest that CNS prophylaxis does impair cognitive development, particularly when cranial radiation therapy is part of the treatment. There is also evidence of greater impairment in younger children and some suggestion of more frequent impairment of non-language skills relative to language skills.

In addition, p19 was detected in HL60 promyelocytic leukemia and in Friend erythroleukemia cells, but not in several other cell lines. In rat brain, we show that the level of p19 is maximal on the first postnatal day and declines within the first 2 weeks of life to a low plateau that persists into adulthood. The concentration of translatable p19 mRNA also decreases postnatally in rat brain, suggesting that the developmental regulation of the expression of p19 occurs, at least in part, at a pretranslational level. The broad species cross-reactivity of the p19 antibody suggests that the gene encoding p19 has been highly conserved during mammalian evolution. Based on the pattern of expression of this protein, we propose that p19 plays a role in the development of neurons and neuroendocrine cell types.","['Schubart, U K']",['Schubart UK'],"['Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/*growth & development/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Endocrine System Diseases/*metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Nervous System Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Testis/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/08/25 00:00,1988/08/25 00:01,['1988/08/25 00:00'],"['1988/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1988 Aug 25;263(24):12156-60.,"['5-P60-DK-20541/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '613-4932/PHS HHS/United States']",,['S0021-9258(18)37907-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,

This study illustrates that there are many inaccuracies, illusions, and misconceptions in the morphologic criteria currently used to classify mixed small- and large-cell lymphoma. A principal finding was that lymphocyte nuclear profiles in mixed-cell lymphomas tend to be smaller in size (P less than .005) and more irregular in shape (P = .0001) than the morphologically similar counterparts in germinal centers of lymph nodes with reactive hyperplasia. Intercase comparison of mixed small- and large-cell lymphomas revealed a considerable range of mean nuclear area values, some of which were within the size range of normal, small lymphocytes. At the magnifications used for morphometric assessment, a high proportion of lymphocyte nuclear profiles had shallow invaginations, but only a limited number of profiles (4% to 14%) had deep (cleaved) indentations. Contrary to current definitions for this subtype of NHL, lymphocytes with ""small"" nuclei had the same proportion of the nuclear diameter occupied by nuclear invaginations as lymphocytes with ""large"" nuclei and, in fact, mean nuclear invagination depth was shallower in ""small"" nuclei than in ""large"" nuclei. Furthermore, regardless of whether it is nuclear area or shape that is evaluated, lymphocytes in mixed-cell lymphoma do not separate into two populations of small-cleaved and large noncleaved cells. Morphometry reveals that only four of the 12 examples of mixed small- and large-cell lymphoma had a proportion of the lymphocytes in the size range of fully transformed germinal center lymphocytes that exceeded 25%, and none of the cases approached 50% even though the population of lymphocyte nuclei appearing ""transformed,"" and therefore ""large,"" ranged from 28% to 57%. Such results indicate that the large, noncleaved and cleaved component, as seen in histologic sections of mixed small- and large-cell lymphoma, do not have nuclei of uniform size and many, in fact, are not actually large. The morphometric findings indicate reasons for the poor observer reproducibility in classifying this subtype of NHL.","['Dardick, I', 'Caldwell, D R', 'Moher, D', 'Jabi, M']","['Dardick I', 'Caldwell DR', 'Moher D', 'Jabi M']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ottawa Civic Hospital, Ontario.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,,IM,"['Cell Nucleus/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/*ultrastructure', 'Lymphocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*ultrastructure', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/ultrastructure']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1988 Aug;19(8):889-901. doi: 10.1016/s0046-8177(88)80003-0.,,,"['S0046-8177(88)80003-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0046-8177(88)80003-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,

The most common breakpoint in chromosome 14 occurred at 14q32 where the IgH chain genes reside thus suggesting that in these cases the cell of origin might be a B lymphocyte.

Of interest also is the fact that in a certain type of childhood pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia which shows cytogenetic abnormalities on 11q23, aberrant myeloid and monocytic markers are seen.

Extension to the malignant lymphomas was strengthened by early success in Burkitt's lymphoma and in syngeneic transplantation for lymphoma. The optimal regimen (BACT [carmustine, cytarabine, cyclophosphamide, 6-thioguanine]) and setting are still under investigation for the various grades of lymphomas. The early published experience demonstrated a low ultimate ""cure"" rate when transplantation was performed in advanced, bulky, and refractory disease. A survey of published reports up to 1986 showed only 16 of 112 long-term, disease-free survivors when autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) was performed in refractory relapse as opposed to 33 of 53 for patients transplanted in second or subsequent remission or in first partial remission. Refractoriness to conventional-dose chemotherapy (no response or progressive disease) cannot be salvaged in the majority of cases. Bone marrow involvement complicates the use of ABMT and may require in vitro elimination with monoclonal antibodies/complement or cytotoxic chemicals. The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute experience shows that the former in vitro treatment does not inhibit bone marrow grafting. When selection criteria for ABMT are applied in drug-sensitive relapse, 50% to 60% long-term, disease-free survival may be expected. Definition of poor prognostic factors in large cell lymphoma may identify patients for ABMT as consolidation of first remission.

The pathological lesions are non-specific, consisting of fatty change, nuclear pleomorphism, hepatocyte necrosis, portal chronic inflammatory infiltrate, fibrosis and cirrhosis. The mechanism of liver injury is poorly understood; intracellular accumulation of methotrexate polyglutamate and consequent folate depletion are suspected to play a role. Early studies in psoriasis clearly established a relationship of the hepatic injury with the frequency of methotrexate administration. With weekly low dose therapy, however, consensus is lacking regarding the incidence of hepatotoxicity because studies have had disparate control groups, used variable dosage regimens and often failed to document pre-existing liver disease or categorised patients at risk, i.e. elderly patients, alcoholics and obese diabetics. Moreover, current methods of assessing the degree of hepatic injury are subjective, relying on interpretation by an experienced histopathologist. Preliminary evidence suggests less frequent and less severe hepatotoxicity occurs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, probably as a result of lower methotrexate doses and better patient selection. Nevertheless, until the risk of serious liver disease is better defined it is recommended that patients have a pretreatment liver biopsy, a follow-up biopsy after a cumulative dose of 1500 mg, and then biopsies approximately every 2 years in the absence of other evidence of liver disease or risk factors.","['Kevat, S', 'Ahern, M', 'Hall, P']","['Kevat S', 'Ahern M', 'Hall P']","['Flinders Medical Centre, Adelaide.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Med Toxicol Adverse Drug Exp,Medical toxicology and adverse drug experience,8709214,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*drug therapy', '*Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liver/*pathology', 'Liver Diseases/pathology', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Psoriasis/*drug therapy']",1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Toxicol Adverse Drug Exp. 1988 May-Jun;3(3):197-208. doi: 10.1007/BF03259882.,,79,['10.1007/BF03259882 [doi]'],,,,,,,

Their principal metabolites, following the cleavage of the 14-acyl side-chain, are N-trifluoroacetyladriamycin (AD41) and its reduced form N-trifluoroacetyladriamycinol (AD92). Both these compounds are biologically active and detectable in treated patients, laboratory animals, and in tissue culture cells. Unlike ADR, AD32, as well as AD143 and metabolites, show no detectable binding to double-strand DNA.

The CLL lymphocytes have been identified as quiescent cells with an extremely low level of topoisomerase II. The low level of this enzyme could constitute a basis for a new mechanism of drug resistance operating not only in CLL, but perhaps in any slow growing cancer with a large population of quiescent cells. Other factors contributing to drug resistance could include changes in enzyme regulation or processing of the cleavable complex, or the presence of a ""mutant"" enzyme which renders cancer cells unresponsive to topoisomerase II-targeted drugs. Suggested strategies in drug development, aimed at the topoisomerase II-related drug resistance, could include 1) the selection of topoisomerase I as an alternative target for cancer chemotherapy, 2) the development of ADR analogs which, unlike ADR, stabilize the topoisomerase II-DNA complex with high efficiency, and 3) the search for agents enhancing the SOS-like repair response, presumably triggered by DNA topoisomerase-targeted drugs.","['Potmesil, M', 'Hsiang, Y H', 'Liu, L F', 'Wu, H Y', 'Traganos, F', 'Bank, B', 'Silber, R']","['Potmesil M', 'Hsiang YH', 'Liu LF', 'Wu HY', 'Traganos F', 'Bank B', 'Silber R']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,NCI Monogr,NCI monographs : a publication of the National Cancer Institute,8610384,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*enzymology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,NCI Monogr. 1987;(4):105-9.,"['CA-11655/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32055/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Indeed, A-MuLV pseudotyped with some viruses, such as the Moloney MuLV, has been shown to be highly lymphogenic, whereas A-MuLV pseudotyped with other viruses, such as the BALB/c endogenous N-tropic MuLV, has been shown to be devoid of lymphogenic potential (N. Rosenberg and D. Baltimore, J. Exp. Med. 147:1126-1141, 1978; C. D. Scher, J. Exp. Med. 147: 1044-1053, 1978). To map the viral DNA sequences encoding the determinant of the lymphogenic potential of Moloney MuLV when complexed with A-MuLV, we constructed chimeric helper viral DNA genomes in vitro between parental cloned infectious viral DNA genomes from Moloney MuLV and from BALB/c endogenous N-tropic MuLV. Chimeric helper MuLVs, recovered after transfection of NIH 3T3 cells were used to rescue A-MuLV, and the pseudotypes were inoculated into newborn NIH Swiss, CD-1, and SWR/J mice to test their lymphogenic potential. We found that a 0.44-kilobase-pair PstI-KpnI long terminal repeat-containing fragment from the Moloney MuLV was sufficient to confer some, but not complete, lymphogenic potential to a chimeric virus (p7M2) in NIH Swiss and SWR/J mice, but not in CD-1 mice. The addition of the 3'-end env sequences (comprising the carboxy terminus of gp70 and all p15E) to the U3 long terminal repeat sequences restored the full lymphogenic potential of the Moloney MuLV. Our data indicate that the 3'-end sequences of the helper Moloney MuLV are somehow involved in the development of lymphoma induced by A-MuLV. The same sequences have previously been found to harbor the determinant of leukemogenicity and of disease specificity of Moloney MuLV when inoculated alone.","['Savard, P', 'DesGroseillers, L', 'Rassart, E', 'Poirier, Y', 'Jolicoeur, P']","['Savard P', 'DesGroseillers L', 'Rassart E', 'Poirier Y', 'Jolicoeur P']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chimera', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis/genetics', '*Genes, Viral', 'Helper Viruses/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transfection']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1987 Oct;61(10):3266-75. doi: 10.1128/JVI.61.10.3266-3275.1987.,,,['10.1128/JVI.61.10.3266-3275.1987 [doi]'],,PMC255907,,,,,

Only Mus species closely related to laboratory mice carried these retroviral sequences, and the different subclasses of viral env genes tended to be restricted to specific taxonomic groups. Only Mus musculus molossinus carried proviral genes which cross-reacted with the inbred mouse ecotropic MuLV env gene. The ecotropic viral env sequence associated with the Fv-4 resistance gene was found in the Asian mice M. musculus molossinus and Mus musculus castaneus and in California mice from Lake Casitas (LC). Both M. musculus castaneus and LC mice carried many additional Fv-4 env-related proviruses, two of which are common to both mouse populations, which suggests that these mice share a recent common ancestry. Xenotropic and mink cell focus-forming (MCF) virus env sequences were more widely dispersed in wild mice than the ecotropic viral env genes, which suggests that nonecotropic MuLVs were integrated into the Mus germ line at an earlier date. Xenotropic MuLVs represented the major component of MuLV env-reactive genes in Asian and eastern European mice classified as M. musculus molossinus, M. musculus castaneus, and Mus musculus musculus, whereas Mus musculus domesticus from western Europe, the Mediterranean, and North America contained almost exclusively MCF virus env copies. M. musculus musculus mice from central Europe trapped near the M. musculus domesticus/M. musculus musculus hybrid zone carried multiple copies of both types of env genes.

In the present report, we compare chemotactic factor binding and function in HL-60 cells with that of normal human granulocytes using the chemotactic peptide N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) as ligand. The cellular response measured as CL was changed as a result of storage or conditioning of normal peripheral blood cells. With these cells, a conditioning procedure at room temperature resulted in a pronounced increase in the CL response. The increase of the CL response was probably a result of increased expression of cryptic receptors, since the changes of the oxidative response to FMLP was accompanied by increased binding of the peptide to the cell surface. Scatchard analysis revealed that the increased binding was due to an increased number of receptors. In differentiated HL-60 cells, conditioning neither led to increased production of oxidative metabolites, nor to any increased binding of the peptide. The data thus indicate that many FMLP receptors could reside in a cryptic site that is not accessible to extracellular ligands, and that conditioning results in an increased exposure of these receptors, followed by an increased oxidative response to the ligand in normal cells but not in mature HL-60 cells.","['Dahlgren, C', 'Andersson, T', 'Stendahl, O']","['Dahlgren C', 'Andersson T', 'Stendahl O']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cytoplasmic Granules', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1987 Sep;42(3):245-52. doi: 10.1002/jlb.42.3.245.,,,['10.1002/jlb.42.3.245 [doi]'],,,,,,,

In Hodgkin analogous L428 cells, biosynthetically labeled with radioactive amino acids, the Ki-1 antibody precipitated three glycoproteins with 90, 105, and 120 kDa, respectively. Surface-labeling revealed that the two larger components were membrane-associated forms of the Ki-1 antigen, although the 90-kDa molecule was shown in pulse-chase experiments to be the precursor of the 105- and 120-kDa forms. All three forms of the Ki-1 antigen possess a tunicamycin-sensitive 6-kDa N-linked carbohydrate moiety. O-Linked oligosaccharides could not be detected. Thus, the differences in m.w. are probably not due to glycosylation. The ionophore monensin prevented the appearance of the membrane-associated molecules, which demonstrated that they are assembled between the transcompartment of the Golgi complex and their insertion into the cell membrane. The 90-kDa precursor molecule cannot be generated by disulfide reduction from the two larger forms. After internal labeling with P-32, only the 105- and 120-kDa bands became visible, indicating that the Ki-1 molecule is phosphorylated after its processing into the two larger membrane-associated forms. Analysis of the Ki-1 antigens from other cell lines demonstrated that after external labeling of two other Hodgkin-derived cell lines, six Epstein-Barr virus lymphoblastoid cell lines and one human T leukemia virus I-positive T cell line, both the 105- and the 120-kDa membrane molecules could be detected, regardless of the presence or type of virus integrated.","['Froese, P', 'Lemke, H', 'Gerdes, J', 'Havsteen, B', 'Schwarting, R', 'Hansen, H', 'Stein, H']","['Froese P', 'Lemke H', 'Gerdes J', 'Havsteen B', 'Schwarting R', 'Hansen H', 'Stein H']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Deltaretrovirus', 'Glycoproteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Hodgkin Disease/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Phosphoproteins/analysis/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology']",1987/09/15 00:00,1987/09/15 00:01,['1987/09/15 00:00'],"['1987/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Sep 15;139(6):2081-7.,,,,,,,,,,

This appeared to be correlated with intracellular mRNA level. HL-60 lacked detectable HLA class II mRNA. IFN-gamma led to appearance of these transcripts, which were canceled by the cross-linking of FcR. Therefore, experiments were designed to investigate the intracellular signaling molecules regulating the appearance of HLA class II molecules or transcripts. The expression of HLA class II antigen induced by IFN-gamma was blocked by a calmodulin antagonist, W-7, but not by a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, H-7. Furthermore, a direct activator of PKC, phorbol myristate acetate, was not able to induce the HLA class II antigen expression. These results suggest that IFN-gamma induces HLA class II antigens on HL-60 cells via a calcium-calmodulin pathway and not via a PKC pathway. Calmodulin is activated by a transient rise in the cytosolic free calcium. In fact, the measurement of calcium influx into HL-60 cells showed that a remarkable and time-dependent calcium accumulation was caused by IFN-gamma, and that depletion of Ca2+ from culture medium resulted in failure of IFN-gamma to induce class II antigen expression. Furthermore, calcium ionophore, A23187, by itself induced HLA class II antigen expression. These results suggest that IFN-gamma stimulates calcium influx and activates the calmodulin branch of the calcium messenger system, resulting in the induction of class II antigen expression on HL-60 cells. On the other hand, cross-linking of FcR elicited the accumulation of intracellular cAMP, which appeared to suppress the IFN-gamma-induced calcium influx, resulting in annulling HLA class II antigen-inducing activity of IFN-gamma. These intracellular events of HL-60 regulate the expression of HLA class II transcripts and molecules.","['Ina, Y', 'Koide, Y', 'Nezu, N', 'Yoshida, T O']","['Ina Y', 'Koide Y', 'Nezu N', 'Yoshida TO']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '65595-90-6 (W 7)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calmodulin/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Fc/*analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Sep 1;139(5):1711-7.,,,,,,,,,,

Urethan-induced sleeping times observed following ip injection of urethan (1.5 mg/g) after 3 weeks of lead exposure were not altered by lead indicating that lead did not affect the rate of urethan elimination. Pulmonary adenoma formation was evaluated 84 days later. Lead exposure did not affect the number of tumors produced, nor did it alter the mean tumor diameter in the lead treatment groups. This suggests that the immunosuppressive activity of lead does not enhance urethan-induced adenoma formation. In the 280 day study, the incidence of spontaneous murine lymphocytic leukemia was evaluated. Leukemia was observed in all treatment groups. Mortality was greater in the lead-exposed mice. Mice exposed to 50 or 1000 ppm lead had 41.6% and 58.3% more deaths associated with the virus. The median survival time was also reduced in the lead-exposed mice.

Previous studies showed no clear correlation between the release of any particular inositol metabolite and the calcium signal in these cells. Paradoxically no responses were observed when the cells were stimulated with the antigen, aggregated ovalbumin, in the absence of external Ca2+. We report here that in the absence of external Ca2+ aggregation of the IgE receptor by agents other than aggregated ovalbumin causes the release of small amounts of [3H]inositol phosphates and a small increase in levels of cytosol Ca2+ (approximately 25 nM). The response, however, varied with the type of stimulant used. Within seconds after addition of 24 mol of dinitrophenol conjugated with 1 mol of bovine serum albumin to cells primed with dinitrophenol-specific IgE there was a small burst in release of [3H]inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, [3H]inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, and [3H]inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate which was followed by a gradual rise in inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, inositol bisphosphate, and inositol monophosphate. Eventually, all inositol phosphates reached different steady state levels which were maintained for at least 40 min. In contrast, the initial response to oligomeric IgE, which aggregates receptors at a relatively slow rate, was muted although the subsequent development of the response was the same. The levels of inositol pentakisphosphate and hexakisphosphate remained unchanged. These and other studies with cell extracts support the conclusion that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, a putative messenger for release of intracellular Ca2+, was converted to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and thence to inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate. Both trisphosphate metabolites were dephosphorylated in sequential fashion by phosphatase enzymes in the cytosolic and membrane fractions. However, the appearance of several isomers of inositol monophosphates and bisphosphates suggested that degradation proceeded through multiple pathways in the intact cell.","['Cunha-Melo, J R', 'Dean, N M', 'Moyer, J D', 'Maeyama, K', 'Beaven, M A']","['Cunha-Melo JR', 'Dean NM', 'Moyer JD', 'Maeyama K', 'Beaven MA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin)', '102850-29-3 (inositol-1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', '9FN79X2M3F (Lithium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/*metabolism', 'Calcium/blood', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/*pharmacology', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Dinitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*blood', 'Lithium/blood', 'Membranes/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*blood', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/pharmacology']",1987/08/25 00:00,1987/08/25 00:01,['1987/08/25 00:00'],"['1987/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Aug 25;262(24):11455-63.,,,['S0021-9258(18)60828-2 [pii]'],,,,,,,

Evidence for an early rise in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate which precedes the rise in other inositol phosphates and in cytoplasmic calcium.",11449-54,"Aggregation of the receptor with high affinity for immunoglobulin E (IgE) in rat basophilic leukemia cells leads to a calcium-dependent and a calcium-independent hydrolysis of phosphoinositides. The increase in the levels of inositol phosphates induced in the absence of calcium is only 25% of that observed with 1 mM Ca2+. The inositol phosphates reach a new steady state level 2 min after stimulation in EGTA, whereas with calcium they continue to increase up to 15 min. A similar response is observed when the receptors are aggregated due to the interaction of bound IgE with antigen or with anit-IgE, or by the binding of IgE cross-linked chemically. The antigen-mediated response is inhibited by hapten and disruption of such antigen-antibody aggregates late after stimulation leads to a rapid decline in the levels of the inositol phosphates to basal values. Separation of the inositol phosphates by Dowex columns shows that there is a fast rise in inositol trisphosphate which peaks at 15 s and slowly declines to a lower plateau within 2 min. Analysis by high pressure liquid chromatography reveals a 5-fold increase in the levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in less than 10 s after stimulation, which precedes any major change in the other inositol phosphates. Aggregation of the receptor in the absence of external calcium induces a transient increase in cytoplasmic calcium which reaches a maximum of approximately 25 nM over basal levels after activation. The onset of the rise in Ca2+ lags after the initial rise in the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.","['Pribluda, V S', 'Metzger, H']","['Pribluda VS', 'Metzger H']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Sugar Phosphates)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/*metabolism', 'Calcium/*blood', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dinitrophenols/metabolism', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate', 'Inositol Phosphates/*blood', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*blood', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*blood', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/metabolism', 'Sugar Phosphates/*blood']",1987/08/25 00:00,1987/08/25 00:01,['1987/08/25 00:00'],"['1987/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Aug 25;262(24):11449-54.,,,['S0021-9258(18)60827-0 [pii]'],,,,,,,

Following interaction of the mitogen with its receptors, a transmembrane 'trigger-type' signal is propagated which has both positive and negative correlates. The negative signal occurs with high mitogen concentrations and is associated with membrane freezing, microtubular aggregation, receptor capping, adenylate cyclase activation, and cellular cyclic AMP increases. The positive signal occurs with optimal mitogen concentrations and is associated with changes in membrane permeability and transport with influx of calcium and potassium ion and efflux of sodium, in transport processes for glucose, amino acids, and nucleosides, and in a collected series of early membrane lipid changes which can be considered essential for the positive signal. These lipid changes include the uptake of arachidonic acid and other fatty acids, choline, phosphate and other molecules, their incorporation into membrane phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylinositol (PI), and a turnover of PI with the production of inositol triphosphate, which can be related to calcium mobilization and diacylglycerol which activates a cytoplasmic protein kinase C. A key event associated with mitogen action is arachidonic acid release. Arachidonic acid may give rise to prostaglandins and thromboxanes as part of negative components of the signal through effects on the adenylate cyclase/cyclic AMP system. Arachidonic acid gives rise to eicosanoids like 5-, 11-, possibly 12- and 15-hydroxyperoxy and hydroxy eicosatetraenoic acids and leukotrienes B4 and C4. The activation of the 5-lipoxygenase, a critical calcium-dependent step, leads via the production of 5-HPETE and 5-HETE to the activation of membrane and soluble guanylate cyclase and the production of cyclic GMP. Cyclic GMP appears to be essential for mitogen activation and is associated with cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase activation and the phosphorylation of a number of substrates. Calcium ion influx is clearly central to mitogen action. Calcium through its influx and mobilization from cellular stores is thought to contribute directly and indirectly through the action of calmodulin and protein kinase C to the activation of a number of enzymatic processes involved in the positive signal including phospholipase C, diglyceride kinase and lipase, 5-lipoxygenase, and guanylate cyclase. Cyclic GMP and calcium ion both participate in nuclear processes leading to RNA and protein synthesis. Interleukin 2 is associated with midcycle increases in cyclic GMP and entry into DNA synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Hadden, J W']",['Hadden JW'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Clin Physiol Biochem,Clinical physiology and biochemistry,8305885,"['0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/blood', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Cyclic AMP/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptors, Mitogen/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Physiol Biochem. 1987;5(3-4):210-21.,,,,,,,,,,

This risk is in proportion to both the degree and duration of the neutropenic process. Although granulocyte transfusion as a means of augmenting host defenses would appear to be a logical therapeutic intervention in clinical contexts involving severe and prolonged neutropenia, several features of granulocyte physiology and collection complicate such considerations. These include the large numbers of granulocytes normally produced by healthy hosts, the short survival of the granulocyte in the circulation after transfusion, the relatively small number of granulocytes which can be collected using currently available pheresis techniques, problems associated with alloimmunization, and the possibility of transferring disease (CMV, toxoplasmosis, hepatitis) by means of these transfusions. In the mid-1970s, well-designed clinical studies strongly suggested that patients with documented Gram-negative sepsis or tissue infection that failed to respond to appropriate antibiotics were significantly benefited by granulocyte transfusions. With recent advances in potent, broad-spectrum antibiotic availability, some have questioned whether these observations remain valid. Several studies regarding the prophylactic use of granulocyte transfusions in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and/or induction therapy for leukemia have failed to reveal therapeutic benefits and suggested the possibility of significant side effects.

In the present studies, by using very low numbers of highly enriched normal bone marrow progenitor cell populations as target cells, we have extended these previous findings to provide convincing evidence that erythroid and myeloid colony growth suppression by rTNF-alpha is manifested by a direct interaction between rTNF-alpha and CFU-GM and BFU-E progenitor cells. In addition, the sensitivity of normal peripheral blood and chronic myeloid leukemia bone marrow CFU-GM and BFU-E colony growth to inhibition by rTNF-alpha was examined and found to be comparable with that of normal bone marrow CFU-GM and BFU-E. Although the continuous presence of high doses of rTNF-alpha (5000 units/ml) was required in methylcellulose cultures for maximal CFU-GM (90%) and BFU-E (70%) colony suppression, short-term exposure (24 to 72 hr) of normal bone marrow-enriched progenitor cells to rTNF-alpha, in the absence of hematopoietic growth factors, was sufficient to irreversibly suppress up to 50 to 65% of CFU-GM colony growth. In contrast, the number of BFU-E colonies was increased under these conditions. If, however, hematopoietic growth factors (Mo-T-cell-conditioned medium and erythropoietin) were present during preincubation of the cells with rTNF-alpha, BFU-E were then slightly suppressed while the extent of CFU-GM inhibition remained essentially the same. The suppressive effect of rTNF-alpha on erythroid and myeloid progenitor cell growth appears to be most pronounced on the more primative stages of committed progenitor cell development, since inhibition of CFU-GM- and BFU-E-derived colony growth progressively decreased with the delayed addition of rTNF-alpha to methylcellulose cultures. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was also inhibited by rTNF-alpha in normal bone marrow-enriched progenitor cell populations stimulated to proliferate in liquid culture by colony-stimulating factors. This effect was transient, however, since the activity of rTNF-alpha declined after the first 24 h of culture at 37 degrees C, particularly at low doses of rTNF-alpha where the activity was completely lost after 48 h of culture. This loss of activity appeared to be due to a decreased sensitivity of progenitor cells to the antiproliferative effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) after an initial exposure rather than a lack of available TNF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Wisniewski, D', 'Strife, A', 'Atzpodien, J', 'Clarkson, B D']","['Wisniewski D', 'Strife A', 'Atzpodien J', 'Clarkson BD']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/analysis', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']",1987/09/15 00:00,1987/09/15 00:01,['1987/09/15 00:00'],"['1987/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Sep 15;47(18):4788-94.,"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-19117/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-20194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Chromosome analysis was successful in 187 patients (92%). Seventy-eight patients (38%) were AR+. Cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in 35 (49%) AR+ patients and in 66 (57%) AR- patients. The proportion of patients with complex karyotypic changes (more than two aberrations) was significantly higher in the AR- group (p less than 0.01). Also, unidentifiable marker chromosomes were significantly more frequent in the AR- group (p less than 0.01). Twenty-one of 23 AR+, but none of 46 AR- patients with structural changes, had involvement of 21q22, 17q11-12, or 11p13-15. In contrast, structural changes of 1p, 5q, 7q, 9q, 11q, or 22q were present in 31 AR- but in only two AR+ patients. Four patients had translocations involving 21q22 without rearrangements of 8q22. All were AR+, but only one displayed M2 morphology. We draw the conclusion that chromosomal changes affecting 21q22 might be primarily related to AR formation, whereas, changes of 8q22 produce the characteristic differentiation pattern leading to M2 morphology, consistently found in AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22). With regard to numerical abnormalities, -7 and +8 occurred about equally often in the two groups, whereas, +11 and -Y, especially when present as the sole aberrations, were predominantly found in AR+ patients. In contrast, -5 and +21 were exclusively found in AR- patients. The results indicate that AR+ AML is characterized by a relatively limited number of chromosomal abnormalities that are different from the aberrations found in AR- patients.

FeLV is also important to human individuals as a comparative model, as FeLV may cause a variety of diseases which are partly malignant and partly benign, such as immunosuppression which bears a resemblance to AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) in man. Although FeLV is a common infective agent, the incidence of disease due to FeLV is much higher in cats kept in closed households in which several of them are present than it is in free-range cats. Consequently, diseases caused by FeLV are frequently diagnosed in pedigree cats which are often maintained in relatively large numbers. FeLV is transmitted among cats by contagion. The main sources of infection are persistantly infected FeLV carrier cats which continuously excrete virus from the mouth and in other secretions. The majority of cats infected with FeLV will produce neutralising antibodies. Cats which are unable to do so, will become permanently infected. The prognosis is bad in these cats: 90 per cent will die within five years. Various techniques are used to detect FeLV. The most common method, the indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) test, is performed on air-dried blood smears. The results of the IFA agree with that are almost completely identical to those of the virus isolation test. Another test is ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), which produces approximately 10 per cent more positive results which are probably due to circulating FeLV antigens. Dissemination of FeLV among cats may be prevented by identifying infected carrier cats and removing them from contact with non-infected cats. Removal programmes using indirect immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) tests were used successfully in the Netherlands. The proportion of FeLV-positive cats decreased from 9 per cent in 1974 to approximately 3 per cent in 1985 during such a removal programme. During the above period, the removal programme was carried out in the society of Dutch cat breeders 'Felikat', the programme being made compulsory on all members of the society. The incidence of cats positive for FeLV decreased from over 11 per cent in 1974 to less than 2 per cent within four years.

A molecular clone of Ab-MuLV (P160 strain) was transfected into the psi 2 packaging cell line, and helper virus-free Ab-MuLV (psi 2) was harvested from the supernatant medium. Ab-MuLV (psi 2) was as efficient as helper virus-containing Ab-MuLV (Mo-MuLV) in the transformation of primary bone marrow cells in vitro. Inoculation of weanling BALB/c mice with Ab-MuLV (psi 2) induced nonthymic pre-B-cell lymphomas with high efficiency and short latency (28 days). Adult BALB/c mice were less sensitive to tumor induction by a factor of 100. Ab-MuLV (psi 2) did not induce tumors in weanling C57BL/6 mice, unlike Ab-MuLV (Mo-MuLV). Examination of the proviral integration pattern in Ab-MuLV (psi 2)-induced tumor cell DNA revealed that each of the tumors contained a single integrated provirus. Immunoprecipitation of viral-encoded proteins in helper virus-free tumor cell lines detected the P160 Ab-MuLV-transforming protein; however, no trace of the gag, pol, and env helper virus-encoded proteins was found. Our results indicate that integration and expression of a single Ab-MuLV genome is sufficient for efficient transformation of primary bone marrow cells by Ab-MuLV in vitro and tumor induction in susceptible mice. However, the helper virus may contribute to tumor induction in weanling resistant mice.","['Green, P L', 'Kaehler, D A', 'Risser, R']","['Green PL', 'Kaehler DA', 'Risser R']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['0 (Viral Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/microbiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Helper Viruses', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Leukemia, Experimental/microbiology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Weight', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Aug;84(16):5932-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.84.16.5932.,"['CA-07175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-09135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-41302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['10.1073/pnas.84.16.5932 [doi]'],,PMC298977,,,,,

In the present study we sought to extend this barrier by including antibodies directed against a second envelope component of the virion, the transmembrane protein, p15E. We demonstrate that although neither antibodies to gp71 nor antibodies to p15E could influence the course of leukemia development when applied individually later in life, a combination of the two antibodies was effective even if given as late as 5 months after birth.

As assayed by relaxation of the supercoiled plasmid DNA and by formation of enzyme-linked DNA breaks, the purified enzyme from the resistant cells was shown to be greater than 125-fold as resistant to camptothecin as the wild-type enzyme, comparable to a cellular resistance index of about 300.

[3H]Yohimbine labeled 5900 +/- 2100 receptors/cell with a Kd of 3.6 +/- 0.9 nM (n = 7). alpha 2-Adrenergic receptors were potently coupled to inhibition of adenylate cyclase, with EC50 values for epinephrine, UK-14,304, and p-aminoclonidine in the low nM range. Treatment of cells with pertussis toxin abolished this response. In radioligand binding studies with membrane preparations [3H]yohimbine and [3H]UK-14,304 bound to the same number of sites (71 versus 69 fmol/mg of protein), and epinephrine competed for [3H]yohimbine binding in a biphasic manner. After addition of GTP, no high affinity [3H]UK-14,304 binding was detected, and epinephrine competed for [3H]yohimbine binding with lower affinity at both 4 degrees and 37 degrees. In studies with intact cells, we detected no specific binding of [3H]UK-14,304 at either 37 degrees or 4 degrees. At 37 degrees, epinephrine competed for all [3H]yohimbine binding sites with a low apparent affinity (Ki = 21 microM), whereas at 4 degrees epinephrine (up to 1 mM) was able to compete for only 59 +/- 13% of [3H]yohimbine-binding sites. The potency of epinephrine in competing for [3H]yohimbine sites in intact cells at 4 degrees was greater than at 37 degrees (Ki = 1 microM) and was similar to that observed with membranes in the presence of GTP. We hypothesize that sites not detectable by epinephrine at 4 degrees are sequestered within the cell. Treatment of HEL cells with pertussis toxin reduced the proportion of receptors on the surface from 51 +/- 12% to 23 +/- 7% (n = 3, p less than 0.05) of the total sites. Treatment of HEL cells with epinephrine (100 microM, 1 hr) reduced the cell surface component to 25 +/- 8% (n = 3) of the total sites. This treatment was not accompanied by significant desensitization of the ability of epinephrine to inhibit cAMP accumulation. We conclude that alpha 2-adrenergic receptors exist in more than one compartment in HEL cells and that interaction of receptors with a guanine nucleotide-binding protein or with agonist may regulate this compartmentation. These cells provide a new model system for the study of expression and metabolism of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors.","['McKernan, R M', 'Howard, M J', 'Motulsky, H J', 'Insel, P A']","['McKernan RM', 'Howard MJ', 'Motulsky HJ', 'Insel PA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Quinoxalines)', '0 (Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha)', '2Y49VWD90Q (Yohimbine)', '4S9CL2DY2H (Brimonidine Tartrate)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)', 'YKH834O4BH (Epinephrine)']",IM,"['Adenylyl Cyclases/metabolism', 'Brimonidine Tartrate', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/biosynthesis', 'Epinephrine/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Quinoxalines/metabolism', 'Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha/*metabolism', 'Temperature', 'Yohimbine/metabolism']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1987 Aug;32(1):258-65.,['T325CA09290/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

This mutation has been used to investigate the requirement for envelope protein processing in various aspects of retroviral infection. Viruses produced by cells transfected with mutant proviral clones are approximately 10-fold less infectious than wild-type viruses. Mutant viruses are incapable of inducing XC cell syncytium formation and are 100-fold less efficient than wild-type viruses at rendering cells resistant to superinfection. Envelope glycoproteins bearing the lysine mutation are found in reduced amounts on the surface of infected cells, and as a result mutant virions contain significantly less envelope protein than do wild-type virions.

Here we used an oligonucleotide extension assay to show that the RNA primers remaining bound to the plus DNA strands initiated at the normal origin in the in vitro reaction are heterogeneous in length. This result indicates that, although a precise cleavage generates the 3' end of the priming RNA, RNase H exhibits less specificity at other break sites. During the endogenous reaction, a kinetic analysis of the synthesis of plus strands corresponding to different regions of the genome suggested that additional sites for the initiation of plus-strand DNA existed upstream of the normal origin. Direct analysis of fragments produced in the endogenous reaction, as well as in the in vitro reaction, confirmed the existence of upstream plus-strand initiation sites. Several of these sites were mapped to the nucleotide level by the oligonucleotide extension method. A comparison of the nucleotide sequences surrounding the upstream initiation sites with the sequence at the normal plus-strand origin revealed common features, which suggests a mechanism for plus-strand priming based on sequence recognition by the RNase H/reverse transcriptase protein. Although primer removal by RNase H is highly efficient for DNA fragments initiated at the normal origin, the RNA primers were inefficiently removed from the fragments initiated at the upstream sites. This result suggests that primer removal, like primer generation, involves sequence recognition by the enzyme.","['Rattray, A J', 'Champoux, J J']","['Rattray AJ', 'Champoux JJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Endoribonucleases/*physiology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'RNA, Viral/*analysis', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Ribonuclease H', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1987 Sep;61(9):2843-51. doi: 10.1128/JVI.61.9.2843-2851.1987.,['2T32GM07270/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,['10.1128/JVI.61.9.2843-2851.1987 [doi]'],,PMC255801,,,,,

There is evidence that the amino-terminal region of gp55 forms a dualtropic-specific domain that is connected to the remainder of the glycoprotein by a proline-rich linker (C. Machida, R. Bestwick, B. Boswell, and D. Kabat, Virology 144:158-172, 1985). Using the colinear form of a cloned polycythemic strain of SFFV proviral DNA, we constructed seven in-phase env mutants by insertion of linkers and by a deletion. The mutagenized SFFVs were transfected into fibroblasts and were rescued by superinfection with a helper murine leukemia virus. Four of the mutants cause erythroblastosis. These include one with a 6-base-pair (bp) insert in the ecotropic-related sequence near the 3' end of the gene, two with a 12- or 18-bp insert in the region that encodes the proline-rich linker, and one with a 6-bp insert in the dualtropic-specific region. The other mutants (RI, Sm1, and Sm2) are nonpathogenic and contain lesions in dualtropic-specific region. The other mutants (RI, Sm1, and Sm2) are nonpathogenic and contain lesions in dualtropic-specific sequences that are highly conserved among strains of SFFV. A pathogenic revertant (RI-rev) was isolated from one mouse that developed erythroblastosis 3 weeks after infection with RI. RI-rev contains a second-site env mutation that affects the same domain as the primary mutation does and that increases the size of the encoded glycoprotein. All pathogenic SFFVs encode glycoproteins that are expressed on cell surfaces, whereas the nonpathogenic glycoproteins are exclusively intracellular. The pathogenic SFFVs also specifically cause a weak interference to superinfection by dualtropic MuLVs. These results are compatible with the multidomain model for the structure of gp55 and suggest that processing of gp55 to plasma membranes is required for pathogenesis. The amino-terminal region of gp55 binds to dualtropic murine leukemia virus receptors, and this interaction is preserved in the SFFV mutants that cause erythroblastosis.","['Li, J P', 'Bestwick, R K', 'Spiro, C', 'Kabat, D']","['Li JP', 'Bestwick RK', 'Spiro C', 'Kabat D']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*pathogenicity', 'Membrane Proteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/pathogenicity', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Viral Interference', 'Virus Replication']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1987 Sep;61(9):2782-92. doi: 10.1128/JVI.61.9.2782-2792.1987.,['CA25810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['10.1128/JVI.61.9.2782-2792.1987 [doi]'],,PMC255787,,,,,

Once bound, IC were not eluted from columns upon further perfusion with normal serum. However, bound IgG was eluted from columns by further perfusion of normal serum or IC. IC were at least five-fold more efficient than normal IgG in exerting this effect. The results suggest that protein A-silica columns can be used for preferential removal of IC from plasma in a clinical or experimental setting.","['Snyder, H W Jr', 'Ernst, N R', 'Grosmaire, L S', 'Balint, J P', 'Yoshida, L H', 'Jones, F R']","['Snyder HW Jr', 'Ernst NR', 'Grosmaire LS', 'Balint JP', 'Yoshida LH', 'Jones FR']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Staphylococcal Protein A)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)']",IM,"['Adsorption', 'Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/*analysis', 'Binding Sites', 'Cats', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Immunoglobulin G/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/immunology', 'Silicon Dioxide/*pharmacology', 'Staphylococcal Protein A/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1987/08/03 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/08/03 00:00'],"['1987/08/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/08/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1987 Aug 3;101(2):209-17. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(87)90152-9.,,,"['0022-1759(87)90152-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(87)90152-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,

These included cases of M7 acute myeloid leukaemia and blast crises of chronic granulocytic leukaemia. The megakaryoblastic nature of the blasts was first established using two monoclonal antibodies against platelet glycoproteins, and by estimating the platelet/peroxidase reaction at ultrastructural level. Our findings suggest that megakaryoblasts have a typical cytochemical profile comprising positive ANAE staining and acid phosphatase activity with a predominant localisation in the Golgi zone and negative or weak ANBE activity. A similar positive cytochemical pattern was also found in five cases of erythroleukaemia (M6). The specificity of the 5'nucleotidase activity for megakaryoblasts was not confirmed. In most cases of megakaryoblastic leukaemia there was no 5'nucleotidase activity only two cases showed positive reactions--reactions were positive in several cases of myeloblastic and lymphoblastic leukaemia. We suggest that cytochemical methods may be useful in diagnosing M6 and M7 acute leukaemia because less than 40% of leukaemic cells react with specific monoclonal antibodies.","['Pombo De Oliveira, M S', 'Gregory, C', 'Matutes, E', 'Parreira, A', 'Catovsky, D']","['Pombo De Oliveira MS', 'Gregory C', 'Matutes E', 'Parreira A', 'Catovsky D']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (naphthylbutyrate esterase)', 'EC 3.1.3.- (Nucleotidases)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)""]",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase"", 'Acid Phosphatase/*analysis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleotidases/*analysis']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1987 Jun;40(6):663-9. doi: 10.1136/jcp.40.6.663.,,,['10.1136/jcp.40.6.663 [doi]'],,PMC1141058,,,,,

Both 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside analogues inhibited the overgrowth of target T cells, which was a consequence of virally mediated transformation, when they were exposed to the virus and cultured with the compounds. A profound decrease in the expression of HTLV-I gag-proteins was also observed. Moreover, we observed that the amount of proviral DNA detected in cellular DNA from the target T cells was substantially reduced when the cells were protected by the compounds against the virus and that at certain concentrations of the compounds the synthesis of viral DNA was completely suppressed.

The nonpolyadenylated mRNAs are predicted to be 614 and 600 nucleotides, respectively. The p11 mRNAs both contain a 291 nucleotide open reading frame, preceded by a 5'-untranslated region of 73 nucleotides in bovine p11 mRNA and of 68 nucleotides in murine p11 mRNA. The deduced bovine p11 amino acid sequence is identical to the previously published partial bovine and complete porcine p11 protein sequence except for an additional COOH-terminal lysine residue. The bovine and murine p11 proteins are 92% homologous, whereas at the nucleotide level the conservation is 89% in the coding region and 75% in the 3'-untranslated region. Southern analysis of murine genomic DNA detected a single p11 gene, less than 10 kilobase pairs in size, containing as many as three introns. The p11 gene has been assigned to mouse chromosome 3 by analysis of interspecific hybrid cell panels and recombinant inbred mouse strains. The p11 gene is closely linked to the Xmmv-65 endogenous leukemia virus env gene and the guanylate binding protein-1 gene. Northern analyses of RNAs from mouse tissues and cell lines indicated that p11 mRNA levels vary widely. They are very low in liver, heart, and testes, moderate in brain, spleen, and thymus, and high in kidney, intestine, and lung. Analysis of the same RNA samples for p36 mRNA levels showed that expression of p11 and p36 mRNAs is not always coordinated. Brain and the mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line F9 contain moderate to high levels of p11 mRNA with very low levels of p36 mRNA.

The receptor delta subunit is the major target for phosphorylation and is phosphorylated on serine residues to a final stoichiometry of 0.4 mol of phosphate/mol of subunit. Phosphorylation is dose-dependent with a Km value of 0.2 microM. Proteolytic digestion of the delta subunit phosphorylated by either protein kinase C or the cAMP-dependent protein kinase yielded a similar pattern of phosphorylated fragments. The amino acids phosphorylated by either kinase co-localized within a 15-kDa proteolytic fragment of the delta subunit. This fragment was visualized by immunoblotting with antibodies against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 354-367 of the receptor delta subunit. This sequence, which contains 3 consecutive serine residues, was recently shown to include the cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site (Souroujon, M. C., Neumann, D., Pizzighella, S., Fridkin, M., and Fuchs, S. (1986) EMBO J. 5, 543-546). Concomitantly, the synthetic peptide 354-367 was specifically phosphorylated in a Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent manner by protein kinase C. Furthermore, antibodies directed against this peptide inhibited phosphorylation of the intact receptor by protein kinase C. We thus conclude that both the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C phosphorylation sites reside in very close proximity within the 3 adjacent serine residues at positions 360, 361, and 362 of the delta subunit of the acetylcholine receptor.","['Safran, A', 'Sagi-Eisenberg, R', 'Neumann, D', 'Fuchs, S']","['Safran A', 'Sagi-Eisenberg R', 'Neumann D', 'Fuchs S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Cholinergic)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.19 (glutamyl endopeptidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP/pharmacology', 'Electric Organ/*analysis', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Endopeptidases', 'Immunoassay', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cholinergic/*metabolism', '*Serine Endopeptidases', 'Torpedo']",1987/08/05 00:00,1987/08/05 00:01,['1987/08/05 00:00'],"['1987/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Aug 5;262(22):10506-10.,,,['S0021-9258(18)60990-1 [pii]'],,,,,,,

The non-tumor-promoting phorbol ester, 4 alpha-PDD, had no effect on either NECA- or PGE2-stimulated cAMP accumulation. The ability of PDiBu to inhibit the effect of PGE2 and to stimulate the effect of NECA remained in the presence a low concentration of forskolin (0.3 microM), which per se increased both NECA- and PGE2-stimulated cAMP accumulation.

Bone-marrow regeneration was suggested by increments in serum MPO and LYS 5 and 4 days prior to the increase in mononuclear cells (Mono) and 10 and 9 d before the increase in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in the peripheral blood. LF started to rise 4.5 d before detectable circulating PMNs. 2 patients with early relapses of leukemia post transplantation are shown to display atypical patterns of serum MPO and LYS.

None of 12 AML patients with CMV seropositive donors had posttransplant relapse, in contrast to 7 of 10 AML patients with seronegative donors.

This effect was independent of disease stage, donor and recipient age, recipient pretransplant CMV immune status and the occurrence of posttransplant CMV infection in recipients, and was not mediated through an increased occurrence of overt graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in recipients with CMV seropositive donors. The increased probability of staying in remission was associated with an increased probability of 3-yr disease-free survival (p less than 0.01). No similar effect was observed in patients with ALL.

Between 8 and 105 days after BMT, the T-cell repopulation was characterized by a relative preponderance of T cells lacking the CD3 marker and a slow repopulation of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells. The CD8+ T cells repopulated at a faster rate in patients with CMV infection than in those not infected with CMV. At the end of the 9- to 12-month follow-up period, patients with CMV infection had normal numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells but increased numbers of HNK1+ T cells. Those without CMV infection had subnormal numbers of CD4+ T cells, normal numbers of CD8+ T cells, and numbers of HNK1+ T cells that attained the upper limit of the normal range. Most of the HNK1+ T cells in both patient groups coexpressed the CD8 marker.

LF prolonged the survival rates and decreased the titers of SFFV in mice given FVC-P. Titers of SFFV, assayed 14 days after administration of FVC-P, were measured by the spleen focus-forming unit assay in secondary mouse recipients. Decreases in titers of SFFV were apparent when LF was given in vivo as a single bolus dose of 200 micrograms within 2 h of the Friend virus complex (FVC), or as a total dosage of 200 micrograms given on days 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, and 11 after FVC-P, and to a lesser degree when LF was given as a total dosage of 200 micrograms on days 3, 4, 7, 9, and 11 after FVC-P. No decreases in titers of SFFV were detected when LF was given up to 3 days before or more than 3 days after FVC-P. LF did not appear to be directly inactivating the viruses as it did not inactivate the SFFV or the Friend murine leukemia helper virus in vitro. The results suggest that the protective effect of LF in vivo is probably due to an action on cells responding to the FVC or to an action on cells which influence the cells responding to the FVC or which influence the virus. It has been shown elsewhere that LF decreases the percentage of marrow and spleen hematopoietic progenitor cells that are in DNA synthesis in vivo and this may be the means by which the protective effect of LF is mediated in mice given the FVC.","['Lu, L', 'Hangoc, G', 'Oliff, A', 'Chen, L T', 'Shen, R N', 'Broxmeyer, H E']","['Lu L', 'Hangoc G', 'Oliff A', 'Chen LT', 'Shen RN', 'Broxmeyer HE']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lactoglobulins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*drug effects/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Lactoferrin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Lactoglobulins/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/microbiology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Polycythemia/drug therapy/microbiology/pathology', 'Spleen/microbiology/pathology', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*drug effects/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Aug 1;47(15):4184-8.,"['CA 36464/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 36740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

This loss of sensitivity was associated with a decrease in topoisomerase enzyme activity in nuclear extracts of the quiescent cells. We have now extended our observations by examining the basis for the reduction in enzyme activity during quiescence. DNA topoisomerase II content, as assayed by immunoblotting with a polyclonal rabbit anti-topoisomerase II antiserum, was virtually absent in nuclear extracts of quiescent CHO cells in contrast to logarithmically growing cells. This suggests that the previously demonstrated loss of enzyme activity in CHO cells is a function of reduction in content rather than posttranslational modifications of the enzyme. Quiescent human lymphoblastic CCRF cells also exhibited reduced topoisomerase II content compared to actively proliferating cultures, but the difference was less than that observed in CHO cells. In contrast, log and plateau phase cultures of mouse leukemia L1210 cells exhibited similar topoisomerase II content. Reduction in enzyme content correlated with the ability of these cell lines to accumulate during quiescence with a G0-G1 content of DNA. Sensitivity to the DNA cleavage effects of etoposide in dividing and nondividing cells correlated well with enzyme content. As has been observed with CHO cells, both CCRF and L1210 cells in plateau phase were more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of etoposide than those actively dividing. The result with L1210 cells was surprising, however, in light of the equivalent DNA damage observed under the two growth conditions. Our data indicate that topoisomerase II enzyme content is proliferation dependent in some but not all cells and suggest that while enzyme content may be important in drug resistance in some cell types, other factors can decrease the sensitivity of the cell to cleavable complex formation as well.","['Sullivan, D M', 'Latham, M D', 'Ross, W E']","['Sullivan DM', 'Latham MD', 'Ross WE']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Ovary']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Aug 1;47(15):3973-9.,"['CA-24586/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-40884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) activity was determined in nine MDS patients and eight CML patients by a scoring method. NAP scores were decreased in six of the nine patients with MDS and in all of the patients with CML. In all patients with these diseases, NAP scores increased by incubating the blood with rhG-CSF. An increase in NAP scores by rhG-CSF was observed even at a concentration of 1 U/mL in patients with MDS but was observed only at higher concentrations (1,000 to 10,000 U/mL) in patients with CML. Significant increases in NAP scores occurred at 12 hours' incubation in patients with MDS, whereas the increase was more gradual in patients with CML. This time course difference was thought to be due mainly to the difference in cell populations of circulating myeloid cells between MDS patients and CML patients. Induction of NAP activity by rhG-CSF in patients with both these diseases was suppressed by the addition of inhibitors of RNA or protein synthesis. Neutrophil superoxide anion (O2-) production induced by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) was determined in the other 11 patients with MDS. This neutrophil function was decreased in seven of the 11 patients with MDS, normal in two patients, and increased in two patients. Preincubation with rhG-CSF caused a significant increase in fMLP-induced O2- production in nine of the 11 patients with MDS. rhG-CSF enhanced this neutrophil function in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and maximal stimulation was observed at 2,000 to 4,000 U/mL of rhG-CSF and at five to ten minutes' incubation. The present results show that rhG-CSF is able to repair at least in part the neutrophil anomalies in these patients, and our data, especially for patients with MDS, suggest the clinical usefulness of rhG-CSF for this preleukemic disorder.","['Yuo, A', 'Kitagawa, S', 'Okabe, T', 'Urabe, A', 'Komatsu, Y', 'Itoh, S', 'Takaku, F']","['Yuo A', 'Kitagawa S', 'Okabe T', 'Urabe A', 'Komatsu Y', 'Itoh S', 'Takaku F']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Superoxides/biosynthesis']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1987 Aug;70(2):404-11.,,,['S0006-4971(20)78430-2 [pii]'],,,,,,,

For that reason, we have investigated whether normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) contain tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activity. Using a copolymer of glutamine: tyrosine as a substrate for the phosphotransferase reaction, we have demonstrated that PMN contain a cytosolic tyrosine kinase activity that elutes as a single peak from Sephacryl S-200 chromatography and has a molecular weight of 70 kilodaltons. Human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60), contain a similar activity (as demonstrated by column chromatography), with only 25% of the activity found in PMN. This cytosolic tyrosine kinase can phosphorylate angiotensin II and a fragment of the src protein containing tyrosine 416, which suggests a similar substrate specificity to other tyrosine-phosphorylating protein kinases. In addition, we have demonstrated that PMN have double the amount of phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activity of that found in HL-60 cells. This enzyme has a Km of 0.932 mmol/L and a Vmax of 0.355 mumol inorganic phosphate released/mg protein/min, which is similar to other cellular PTPase. Activation of PMN with f-Met-Leu-Phe and phorbol esters causes a slight but statistically significant drop in PMN PTPase activity. These results suggest that terminally differentiated myeloid cells have high tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activity, which may play a role in stimulus response coupling in the mature PMN.","['Kraft, A S', 'Berkow, R L']","['Kraft AS', 'Berkow RL']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1987 Aug;70(2):356-62.,"['AI22048/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['S0006-4971(20)78421-1 [pii]'],,,,,,,

However, ACTH and somatostatin, but not substance P, can also block the tumoricidal activity of macrophages induced by recombinant gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), a non-neuroendocrine immunomodulating hormone. In contrast, substance P increased tumoricidal activity, both independent of IFN-gamma and in addition to IFN-gamma. Neurotensin, alpha-endorphin, beta-endorphin, met-enkephalin, vasopressin, and substance K did not affect tumoricidal function, either alone or in combination with IFN-gamma.

Analysis of the genomic DNA of ML cells using the restriction enzyme HindIII and hybridization with MuMTV-specific probes revealed that the ML cells contained two or more newly integrated MuMTV proviruses (ML-MuMTV). Further analysis of these proviruses with a combination of Mspl and Pstl enzymes showed that the long terminal repeat (LTR) (ML-MuMTV LTR) of the ML-MuMTV provirus(es) was structurally different from the LTRs of both exogenous and endogenous MuMTV proviruses of DBA/2 mice. In order to characterize the nature of the structural alterations in the ML-MuMTV LTR, we cloned a 4.0-kb HindIII fragment containing the 3' half of an acquired provirus. Sequence analysis of the ML-MuMTV LTR of this acquired provirus revealed a deletion of a 387-bp segment that maps between the 5' nucleotide 616 and the 3' nucleotide 1003 of the normal MuMTV LTR and duplication of a 102-bp fragment that mapped between 514 and 616. In addition to two point mutations in the direct repeat, the proviral ML-MuMTV LTR has also acquired 9- and 7-bp segments at the 5' and 3' sites of the duplicated 102-bp segment, respectively. Since direct repeats in the U3 regions of a number of LTRs have been found to be associated with enhancer function, we examined the enhancer function of the U3 region sequences of the ML-MuMTV LTR using enhancer-dependent transient expression assay of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in NIH 3T3 cells. Our studies have shown that the U3 region sequences of the rearranged ML-MuMTV LTR have the ability to enhance the expression of the CAT gene 12- to 15-fold more than the U3 region sequences from the normal MuMTV LTR. The presence of a direct repeat in the ML-MuMTV LTR and its ability to enhance the transcription of adjacent genes is analogous to the LTRs of certain murine leukemia viruses.","['Lee, W T', 'Prakash, O', 'Klein, D', 'Sarkar, N H']","['Lee WT', 'Prakash O', 'Klein D', 'Sarkar NH']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA/genetics', 'Mutation', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1987 Jul;159(1):39-48. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(87)90345-x.,['CA-17129-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['10.1016/0042-6822(87)90345-x [doi]'],,,,,,['GENBANK/M16712'],

Suitable animal models will be needed for studies designed to achieve these goals. Areas of investigation in animal models can be divided into four categories on the basis of increasing direct relevance to AIDS in humans: retroviruses that have no obvious, close relation to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) but can induce chronic diseases with manifestations that include immunologic abnormalities; ungulate lentiviruses; HIV-related viruses of Old World primates; and HIV infection of chimpanzees.

After a 2-day or longer treatment, 2- to 5-fold increases were found in the percentages of cells exhibiting reactivity with either the murine OKM1 monoclonal antibody or the Leu-M5 monoclonal antibody, staining positively for nonspecific esterase activity, and displaying a promonocyte morphology. The increases in these differentiation markers after treatment with 0.03-1 microM THC were dose dependent. At this dose range, THC did not cause an inhibition of cell growth. The THC-induced cell maturation was also characterized by specific changes in the patterns of newly synthesized proteins. Pronounced among these changes was an increase in the synthesis of at least 10 proteins that are found abundantly in monocytes. The THC-induced differentiation did not, however, result in cells with a highly developed mature monocyte phenotype; the THC-treated cells failed to exhibit other monocyte markers such as attachment to the surface of tissue culture dishes or morphological maturation beyond the promonocyte stage. However, treatment of these ""incompletely"" matured cells with either phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or 1 alpha,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, which are inducers of differentiation in myeloid leukemia cells (including ML-2 cells), produced cells with a mature monocyte morphology. Two other cannabinoids, cannabidiol and cannabinol, which were more cytotoxic than THC at comparable doses, also caused an increase in the expression of maturation markers, but at doses higher than those required for THC. The ML-2 cell system described here may be a useful tool for deciphering critical biochemical events that lead to the cannabinoid-induced ""incomplete"" cell differentiation of ML-2 cells and other related cell types.

Functional studies using monoclonal antibodies directed at CD4 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules led to the suggestion that CD4 binds to the MHC class II molecules expressed on stimulator cells, enhancing T-cell responsiveness by increasing the avidity of T cell-stimulator cell interaction and/or by transmitting a positive intracellular signal. But recent evidence that antibodies to CD4 inhibit T-cell responsiveness in the absence of any putative ligand for CD4 has been interpreted as suggesting that antibody-mediated inhibition may involve the transmission of a negative signal via the CD4 molecule instead. We have infected a murine T-cell hybridoma that produces interleukin 2 (IL-2) in response to human class II HLA-DR antigens with a retroviral vector containing CD4 cDNA. The resulting CD4-expressing hybridoma cell lines produce 6- to 20-fold more IL-2 in response to HLA-DR antigens than control cell lines. Furthermore, when antigen levels are suboptimal, the response of the cell lines is entirely CD4-dependent. The data presented here clearly demonstrate that CD4 can enhance T-cell responsiveness and may be crucial in the response to suboptimal levels of antigen.","['Sleckman, B P', 'Peterson, A', 'Jones, W K', 'Foran, J A', 'Greenstein, J L', 'Seed, B', 'Burakoff, S J']","['Sleckman BP', 'Peterson A', 'Jones WK', 'Foran JA', 'Greenstein JL', 'Seed B', 'Burakoff SJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/*genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/analysis', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas/immunology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1987/07/23 00:00,1987/07/23 00:01,['1987/07/23 00:00'],"['1987/07/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/23 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/23 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 1987 Jul 23-29;328(6128):351-3. doi: 10.1038/328351a0.,,,['10.1038/328351a0 [doi]'],,,,,,,

In whole-cell RNA from rapidly growing cells we observed two major size classes of c-myc RNA, 2.4 and 2.2 kilobases (kb). When HL-60 cells were treated with actinomycin D for 30 min to inhibit transcription, the 2.4-kb c-myc RNA population was rapidly degraded, while the 2.2-kb c-myc RNA was degraded much more slowly. S1 nuclease transcript mapping and promoter-specific probes were utilized to show that both the stable 2.2-kb and the labile 2.4-kb c-myc RNA populations have 5' ends at the second promoter site (P2) and 3' ends at the second poly(A) addition site. To examine further possible structural differences between these two RNA populations, we fractionated RNA on an oligo(dT)-cellulose column to separate RNAs that contained long poly(A) tails from those which did not. We found that the labile 2.4-kb c-myc RNA population bound to oligo(dT)-cellulose, while the more stable 2.2-kb c-myc RNA population did not.

P388/amsacrine, resistant both in vivo and in vitro to amsacrine, was cross-resistant to other putative topoisomerase II inhibitors including teniposide, etoposide, bisantrene, and doxorubicin. P388/amsacrine, was however, as sensitive as cloned P388/S to camptothecin, an inhibitor of topoisomerase I. The pattern of cross-resistance suggested that an alteration in topoisomerase II may be involved in the resistance of P388/amsacrine to these drugs. No differences in the uptake of amsacrine were detected between the two sublines. Cross-resistance to vinblastine was evident in P388/amsacrine; however resistance to vinblastine was associated with alterations in uptake or efflux of the drug. The number of protein-concealed single-strand breaks induced in whole cells by amsacrine, teniposide, bisantrene, and camptothecin was measured. Diminished numbers of strand breaks in the resistant subline were consistent with decreases in DNA-protein crosslinks. In the absence of drug treatment, resistant cells sustained approximately one-half as many single-strand breaks and DNA-protein crosslinks as the sensitive cells during preparation of nuclei. As measured by the P4 phage DNA unknotting assay, 0.35 M NaCl nuclear extracts from P388/S contained approximately 2.3-fold more topoisomerase II catalytic activity than did extracts from P388/amsacrine. The amount of protein that immunoreacted with a specific antibody to calf thymus topoisomerase II was also decreased in the resistant cells. These data suggest that alterations in topoisomerase II which lead to differential drug sensitivities are partially responsible for the resistance of P388/amsacrine to a specific group of drugs.","['Per, S R', 'Mattern, M R', 'Mirabelli, C K', 'Drake, F H', 'Johnson, R K', 'Crooke, S T']","['Per SR', 'Mattern MR', 'Mirabelli CK', 'Drake FH', 'Johnson RK', 'Crooke ST']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*enzymology', 'Mice']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1987 Jul;32(1):17-25.,['CA40884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

This concept explains many aspects of CNS tumor incidence and the relationship of central neuroepithelial embryonal tumors to tumors of adult cell type. The incidence of different types of central neuroepithelial tumors can be correlated with the width of the window of neoplastic vulnerability. Examples illustrating the existence of only a narrow window include such rare tumors as medulloepitheliomas, cerebral neuroblastomas, gangliogliomas and ependymoblastomas. By contrast, cerebellar medulloblastomas, astrocytomas, mixed astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, and glioblastomas exemplify instances in which a relatively wider window of vulnerability exists in the light of cellular neuro-ontogeny and of the capacity of glial cells for postnatal replication. The relationship that may occasionally be established between the development of a glioma and the production of cellular gliosis such as may follow brain injury or accompany multiple sclerosis can also be viewed in the light of that concept. Increasing awareness is needed concerning the development of postradiation gliomas, in particular after the apparently successful treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia.","['Rubinstein, L J']",['Rubinstein LJ'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,,IM,"['Astrocytoma/pathology', 'Brain Neoplasms/*pathology', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Glioma/etiology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Medulloblastoma/pathology', 'Metaplasia', 'Multiple Sclerosis/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/pathology', 'Neuroblastoma/pathology', 'Oligodendroglioma/pathology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurooncol. 1987;5(1):11-27. doi: 10.1007/BF00162761.,['CA 31271/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],141,['10.1007/BF00162761 [doi]'],,,,,,,

We show here that the proliferation of normal and neoplastic B cells can be inhibited by high intracellular levels of cAMP. Thus forskolin treatment of the neoplastic B precursor cell line Reh induced a rapid increase in the cAMP level, which was followed by an accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle over a period of 2-3 days. Similar inhibition of Reh cell proliferation after 3 days was observed whether forskolin was present continuously or only during the first 5 hr. Both c-myc and c-Ha-ras protein levels were transiently down-regulated at 4 hr of forskolin treatment, suggesting that these protooncogenes play a role in the process leading to cAMP-mediated growth cessation. Northern-blot analysis showed that the steady-state levels of c-myc RNA rapidly declined in all phases of the cell cycle, to return to control levels within a time period of 24 hr. In contrast, the c-Ha-ras mRNA level was steadily maintained. Thus the expression of c-myc and c-Ha-ras protein was regulated at different metabolic levels. The reduced proliferative capacity of the B precursor cell line in the presence of forskolin was not linked to induced differentiation. This was judged from the lack of appearance of three different B cell differentiation markers; cytoplasmic immunoglobulin heavy chain and two antigens recognized by the monoclonal antibodies B1 (CD20) and HH1 (CD37). We also showed that forskolin partially inhibited the proliferation of normal B lymphocytes stimulated by anti-immunoglobulins (anti-mu) and B cell growth factor (BCGF). The burst of c-myc mRNA during activation of normal B cells was also reduced by forskolin.","['Blomhoff, H K', 'Smeland, E B', 'Beiske, K', 'Blomhoff, R', 'Ruud, E', 'Bjoro, T', 'Pfeifer-Ohlsson, S', 'Watt, R', 'Funderud, S', 'Godal, T']","['Blomhoff HK', 'Smeland EB', 'Beiske K', 'Blomhoff R', 'Ruud E', 'Bjoro T', 'Pfeifer-Ohlsson S', 'Watt R', 'Funderud S', 'Godal T', 'et al.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '23583-48-4 (8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', '*Proto-Oncogenes']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1987 Jun;131(3):426-33. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041310315.,,,['10.1002/jcp.1041310315 [doi]'],,,,,,,

Measurement of the rate of uptake as a function of sodium concentration revealed a decrease in Km for Na+ from 38 +/- 3 to 13 +/- 1 mM after 20-24-h treatment with Me2SO. Vmax was not changed significantly. Inhibition of the exchanger by dimethylamiloride (DMA) and by acidic external pH was similar in treated and untreated cells. Thus it is unlikely that the Na+ binding site is altered. A change, however, was observed in the regulation of the exchanger by intracellular pH. In control cells maximal stimulation of the Na+ uptake was observed when the intracellular pH decreased from 7.25 to 7.00. In Me2SO-treated cells the 22Na uptake at intracellular pH 7.00 was greater than in the control and continued to increase as the intracellular pH was adjusted below 7.00, down to 6.75. This suggests that the Na+/H+ exchanger in Me2SO-treated cells is altered structurally in its allosteric H+ binding site. The appearance of this modified exchanger preceded by a period of days the appearance of a functional property characteristic of mature granulocytes, that is, the capability to produce superoxide, suggesting that the modified exchanger may be required for the expression of the mature phenotype. A second modification, a decrease in the Vmax of the 22Na uptake, occurred after 2 days treatment with Me2SO.

Serum measurements of lactoferrin (LF), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and lysozyme (LYS) were performed before the start of treatment. LF was significantly lower in M1 when compared with M2 but not as compared to M4, MPO was significantly higher in M2 and M4 than in M1, but comparable MPO levels were found in M2 and M4. LYS was significantly elevated in M2 in comparison with M1, and in M4 when compared to both M1 and M2. Polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMNs) in M1 were significantly reduced when compared with M2 and M4, whereas mononuclear cells were significantly increased in M4 in comparison with both M1 and M2. FAB classification did not generate any prognostic information. When the patients were, instead, subdivided according to LF levels were found prognostically significant differences. Of patients below 100 micrograms/l, 44% went into remission as compared to 77% with LF from 101 to 400 micrograms/l. In patients with LF levels above 400 micrograms/l the remission frequency was only 14%. Multivariate statistical analysis on the data further suggested that lactoferrin may be used as an independent prognostic indicator.

The Tp90 molecule was identified by a monoclonal antibody (mAb), MX20, obtained from a fusion using spleen cells of a mouse immunized with cells from two T cell leukemia lines, Jurkat and HPB-ALL. Biochemical data show that Tp90 is distinct and physically independent from the structures already known to be involved in T cell activation, namely T11, T44 or T3/TCR. These results were confirmed by antibody-induced antigen modulation experiments. Modulation of Tp90 had no effect on the expression of T3 and of the T cell receptor. Conversely, the expression of Tp90 was not affected by modulation of the T3/TCR molecular complex by either anti-T3 or anti-TCR antibody. Functional studies showed that anti-Tp90 mAb MX20 induced high levels of interleukin 2 production in Jurkat cells. Modulation of the T3/TCR complex significantly decreased the response of Jurkat cells to stimulation by antibody MX20, suggesting that the T3/TCR complex regulates the ability of the Tp90 molecule to induce IL 2 synthesis. In addition to its effect on Jurkat cells, anti-Tp90 mAb was found to be mitogenic for peripheral blood T cells. As the magnitude of the proliferative response elicited by anti-Tp90 mAb was lower than that induced by anti-T3 mAb, the possibility was considered that only a subpopulation of T cells is reactive with anti-Tp90. Indeed as determined by FACS analyses, only 3-14% of E-rosette-positive cells were stained with mAb MX20. In addition, multicolor flow cytometry analysis showed that the Tp90+ cells belong preferentially to the CD8 subset.","['Carrel, S', 'Salvi, S', 'Giuffre, L', 'Isler, P', 'Cerottini, J C']","['Carrel S', 'Salvi S', 'Giuffre L', 'Isler P', 'Cerottini JC']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Peptides/isolation & purification', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1987 Jun;17(6):835-41. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830170616.,,,['10.1002/eji.1830170616 [doi]'],,,,,,,

Altogether, these results suggest that BLV activation in enriched B lymphocytes is dependent on the presence of residual T cells, and occurs through a T cell interaction, probably mediated by a soluble factor.

Lactoferrin acts as a potent inhibitor of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor production when it binds to these cells. Using a rosette assay and immunofluorescence, we have shown that cultured leukemia cells, including the human erythroid leukemia cell line K562, also have lactoferrin binding sites. The number of binding sites on K562 cells was estimated using soluble 59Fe-lactoferrin. Inhibition studies demonstrate that lactoferrin binding sites are distinct and unrelated to receptors for transferrin or the Fc portion of IgG, which are present on K562 cells. However, electrostatic forces may be important for lactoferrin binding, since other polycationic proteins (eg, protamine) inhibit lactoferrin binding. Prior treatment of K562 cells with trypsin nearly abolishes lactoferrin binding. However, these cells recover their ability to bind lactoferrin when trypsin is removed. Unlike transferrin receptors, the expression of lactoferrin binding sites is not regulated by cellular iron status. Cytosine arabinoside arrests the proliferation of K562 cells and simultaneously leads to a reduction in lactoferrin surface binding, suggesting that lactoferrin binding may be dependent on cell proliferation.","['Yamada, Y', 'Amagasaki, T', 'Jacobsen, D W', 'Green, R']","['Yamada Y', 'Amagasaki T', 'Jacobsen DW', 'Green R']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Iron Radioisotopes)', '0 (Lactoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (lactoferrin receptors)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Iron Radioisotopes', 'Lactoferrin/*metabolism', 'Lactoglobulins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism/pathology/*ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/ultrastructure', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/*physiology', 'Rosette Formation', 'Time Factors', 'Trypsin/pharmacology']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1987 Jul;70(1):264-70.,,,['S0006-4971(20)78506-X [pii]'],,,,,,,

The most fundamental result of that analysis has been the definition of the replication functions encoded by the viruses. From a biochemical examination of a particular step in the life cycle it is difficult to determine, for example, whether that step is catalyzed by a viral or a host enzyme; but the isolation of a viral mutant defective in that step can firmly establish that a viral function is involved. In this way many facts about the viruses have been established. We know that reverse transcriptase is encoded by the virus; that RNAase H and DNA polymerase activities reside on the same gene product; that processing of many precursor proteins is mediated by a viral proteinase; and that establishment of the integrated provirus requires a viral protein. The list of functions mediated by viral enzymes has largely been defined by the mutants isolated and studied in various laboratories. The second significant result of the studies of viral mutants has been the assignation of the replication functions to particular viral genes, and then more specifically to particular domains of these genes. Mutants and viral variants have been essential in the determination, for example, that the gag protein is the critical gene product for the assembly of a virion particle; that the env protein is the determinant of species specificity of infection; or that the LTR is a major determinant of tissue tropism and leukemogenicity. The subdivisions of functions within a given gene have similarly hinged on mutants. Genetic mapping was needed to establish that P30 is the most important region for assembly; that the proteinase and integrase functions reside, respectively, in the 5' and 3' portions of the pol gene; and that the glycosylated gag protein is dispensable for replication. A third important area of knowledge has depended heavily on viral mutants: the determination of host functions and proteins that interact with viral proteins. Variant viruses with altered or restricted host ranges serve to define differences between pairs of different host cells, and the mapping of the viral mutations serves to define the viral protein important in that interaction with the host. These studies are only in their infancy, but it is clear that substantial efforts will be made to further analyze these host functions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Goff, S P', 'Lobel, L I']","['Goff SP', 'Lobel LI']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,['0 (Viral Proteins)'],IM,"['Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Temperature', 'Viral Proteins/genetics', '*Virus Replication']",1987/07/08 00:00,1987/07/08 00:01,['1987/07/08 00:00'],"['1987/07/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/08 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/08 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1987 Jul 8;907(2):93-123. doi: 10.1016/0304-419x(87)90001-1.,['CA 30488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],163,"['0304-419X(87)90001-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-419x(87)90001-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,

Methylation polymorphism and amplification.,205-10,"With the use of the isoschizomeric restriction endonucleases HpaII and MspI, we found that mouse tumour ornithine decarboxylase (ODC; EC 4.1.1.17) genes are extensively methylated. ODC genes in L1210 mouse leukaemia cells were apparently more methylated than in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma, as revealed by the use of HpaII endonuclease, yet the digestion of genomic DNA isolated from these two murine tumour cell lines with MspI, which cleaves at a CCGG sequence, also with internally methylated cytosine, resulted in an apparently identical restriction pattern. It is possible that the amplification of ODC genes in Ehrlich ascites-carcinoma cells in response to 2-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) was associated with hypomethylation, or that less-methylated genes were amplified. A human myeloma (Sultan) cell line only revealed three separate hybridization signals when cleaved with HpaII. One of these signals was amplified under the pressure of DFMO. When cleaved with MspI, these three HpaII fragments disappeared and were replaced by a double signal of 2.3-2.4 kilobase-pairs (kbp) in size. The amplified ODC sequences in the Sultan myeloma cell line apparently originated from chromosome 2, as indicated by a unique hybridization signal in a 5.8 kbp HindIII fragment specific for the human ODC locus on chromosome 2. A comparison of different human cells, the Sultan myeloma, a lymphocytic B-cell leukaemia (Ball), normal mononuclear leucocytes and leucocytes obtained from leukaemia patients, revealed interesting differences in the methylation of ODC genes. The use of two restriction endonucleases (HpaII and CfoI), the cleavage site for both of which contains a CG sequence and which only cleave when cytosine is unmethylated, indicated that ODC genes in the lymphocytic leukaemia cells were much less methylated than those in the normal leucocytes or in the Sultan cells.","['Alhonen-Hongisto, L', 'Leinonen, P', 'Sinervirta, R', 'Laine, R', 'Winqvist, R', 'Alitalo, K', 'Janne, O A', 'Janne, J']","['Alhonen-Hongisto L', 'Leinonen P', 'Sinervirta R', 'Laine R', 'Winqvist R', 'Alitalo K', 'Janne OA', 'Janne J']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', '*Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Species Specificity']",1987/02/15 00:00,1987/02/15 00:01,['1987/02/15 00:00'],"['1987/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1987 Feb 15;242(1):205-10. doi: 10.1042/bj2420205.,['1RO1 CA37695/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['10.1042/bj2420205 [doi]'],,PMC1147684,,,,,

In contrast, under conditions of neutral pH, only the Mr 74,000 intermediate and mature species were extracted. Extraction of the Mr 91,000 and 81,000 forms was also enhanced in the presence of EDTA. Kinetic studies of the processing of the different myeloperoxidase species confirmed the intermediate nature of the Mr 81,000 and 74,000 forms. Support for a role of an acidic intracellular compartment was obtained through evidence that the acid-extractable precursor and intermediates accumulated in HL-60 cells which had been treated with 1 microM monensin. Under these conditions, the production of mature heavy (Mr 63,000) and light (Mr 13,500) subunits of myeloperoxidase was consistently inhibited by greater than 40% over a 16-h period. The effects of monensin on processing of myeloperoxidase were completely reversed if monensin was removed during this 16-h period. These data support the idea that an acidic compartment may be involved in the transport of myeloperoxidase precursors to azurophil granules and/or their processing to a smaller intermediate form (Mr 74,000) of the enzyme.","['Akin, D T', 'Kinkade, J M Jr']","['Akin DT', 'Kinkade JM Jr']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Lysosomes/enzymology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Peroxidase/biosynthesis/*genetics/isolation & purification', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects']",1987/06/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1987 Jun;255(2):428-36. doi: 10.1016/0003-9861(87)90411-5.,['CA 22294/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['0003-9861(87)90411-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0003-9861(87)90411-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,

In chickens infected at 1 day of age, infection (as determined by use of electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry) was maximal in 1- to 4-month-old birds, and the greatest concentration of virus and group-specific viral antigen was in the medulla of the follicles. Although lymphoid leukosis virus was released from lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and macrophages, virus replication in the medullary macrophages was more active than that in the other cells. Normal medullary macrophages had cell membrane vesicles (50 to 80 nm in diameter) that covered part of all of the cell membrane surface. In infected chickens, virus particles frequently developed within these vesicles. Comparable vesicles were not found on cortical macrophages.

Because TdT-positive cells sometimes are seen in leukemias otherwise identified as myeloblastic, the authors evaluated blasts identified as myeloid by the presence of myeloperoxidase (MPO) for the simultaneous expression of TdT. The blasts in the bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood of unselected patients with hematologic malignancies were evaluated and 60 cases are shown. The French-American-British system and, in some patients, cytochemical and immunologic studies were used to classify the leukemias. The authors demonstrated that blasts simultaneously contained MPO and TdT in 29% of patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia and 3% of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL).

The 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor in these cells has characteristics similar to the receptor in bone and intestine, the known target tissues of the hormone. In fact, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 inhibits the proliferation of melanoma, osteosarcoma, and breast carcinoma cells. More recently, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 has been shown to suppress the growth and induce monocytic differentiation of murine and human myeloid leukemia cells in vitro. These results point to a previously unsuspected involvement of vitamin D in cell proliferation and differentiation and suggest that analogs of the vitamin D hormone may be of interest as possible therapeutic agents in the treatment of malignancy.","['DeLuca, H F', 'Ostrem, V']","['DeLuca HF', 'Ostrem V']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Kidney/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/etiology/*pathology', 'Receptors, Calcitriol', 'Receptors, Steroid/metabolism', 'Vitamin D/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Vitamin D Deficiency/complications']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1986;206:413-29. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4613-1835-4_30.,['AM-14881/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],,['10.1007/978-1-4613-1835-4_30 [doi]'],,,,,,,['NASA: 87238031']

Contrary to our expectation, tumors induced by the Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) showed one to four major proviral integration events. To further investigate the process by which clonality was established, we analyzed the number of cells infected and transformed by A-MuLV at various times after in vivo infection. At the midpoint of tumor latency (14 days postinfection), we found that infection of total bone marrow cells by A-MuLV was efficient and polyclonal. However, only a minority of these infected cells were transformed as assayed in cell culture, and clonal dominance had already been established in this transformed cell population. Examination of the in vitro growth properties of transformed cells recovered from preleukemic and leukemic mice indicated that preleukemic cells had lower cloning efficiencies than primary tumor cells. Our results suggest that the rate-limiting step in this system of lymphomagenesis is the initial transformation of bone marrow target cells and that these cells undergo subsequent changes in cloning ability during the course of the disease that lead to an autonomous neoplastic state.","['Green, P L', 'Kaehler, D A', 'Risser, R']","['Green PL', 'Kaehler DA', 'Risser R']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/etiology/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Clone Cells/*pathology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/microbiology/pathology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Preleukemia/pathology', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1987 Jul;61(7):2192-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.61.7.2192-2197.1987.,"['CA-07175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-09135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-41302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['10.1128/JVI.61.7.2192-2197.1987 [doi]'],,PMC283682,,,,,

BM18-4 cells are capable of kappa gene recombination, whereas ABC-1 cells are capable of both kappa and lambda gene recombination. The expression of H chains is apparently not necessary for continuing L chain gene recombination in either of these cells, although H-chain expression may have been involved in the initiation of L-chain gene recombination. All ABC-1 cells that have lambda gene rearrangements also display recombined kappa alleles, supporting the hypothesis that kappa and lambda gene recombination are initiated in an ordered, developmentally regulated manner in maturing B cells. However, analyses of the ABC-1 line indicate that pre-B cells that have initiated lambda gene recombination do not terminate kappa gene rearrangement. The lambda gene recombinations that occur in the ABC-1 cell line indicate that the germline order of lambda gene segments is: 5' ... V lambda 2 ... J lambda 2C lambda 2-J lambda 4C lambda 4 ... V lambda 1 ... J lambda 3C lambda 3-J lambda 1C lambda 1 ... 3'. In addition, the frequencies of lambda 1, lambda 2, and lambda 3 gene recombinations among ABC-1 cells are quite different than the frequencies of B cells producing lambda 1, lambda 2, and lambda 3 L-chains in the mouse. RS DNA recombinations also occur in the BM18-4 and ABC-1 cell lines, supporting the notion that Ig gene recombinases are involved in RS rearrangement. Recombined RS segments are infrequent among BM 18-4 cells but common among ABC-1 cells, suggesting that RS recombinational events often occur in maturing pre-B cells just before initiation of lambda gene rearrangements.

Identical boosting of the clone-primed mice further augments the preferential production of anti-OVA antibodies of these two isotypes. The class-related helper activity is not due to nonspecific shift of class expression produced by the injected tumor cells, as a non-helper clone of RadLV-transformed T cells does not change the isotypic pattern of anti-OVA antibodies in the inoculated mice. A carrier-specific activation of the B cells is responsible for the class-restricted function of the helper clone. The isotypic profile of anti-hapten antibodies in mice injected with 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP)-bovine serum albumin and OVA-specific helper clone is not altered. On the other hand, mice inoculated with the OVA-specific helper clone and DNP-OVA respond with a preferential elevation of anti-DNP antibodies of the IgG2a and IgG2b isotypes. The preferential class augmentation may result from carrier-specific signals delivered by the helper clone which activate B cells in vivo toward certain CH expression. Alternatively, the observed class pattern may be induced by an isotype noncommited helper clone which triggers selected population of B lymphocytes of defined differentiation status toward secretion of a restricted array of isotypes. Regardless of the mechanism of the clone-dependent class expression, the isotypic profile in most of the experiments clearly demonstrates that an antigen-specific helper clone may be one of the elements which regulates the class of antibodies to be produced in vivo under normal physiologic conditions.","['Shapira-Nahor, O', 'Eynat, E', 'Ben-Sasson, S Z']","['Shapira-Nahor O', 'Eynat E', 'Ben-Sasson SZ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Dinitrobenzenes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Isotypes)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibody Formation', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Clone Cells', 'Dinitrobenzenes/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin Isotypes/*biosynthesis', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Mice', 'Ovalbumin/immunology', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Jul 1;139(1):35-41.,,,,,,,,,,

Previous evidence has suggested that Tp44 may function as a receptor for accessory signals in T cell activation. High level Tp44 expression was observed on plasmacytomas grown in cell culture and on plasma cells from bone marrow biopsies of multiple myeloma patients. This antigen is not present on resting B cells from either peripheral blood or lymphoid organs, or on any other B cell tumor. The growth kinetics and Ig production in plasmacytomas are not affected by the binding of antibody 9.3. Moreover, the Tp44 molecule is co-expressed with PCA-1, an antigen characteristic of plasma cells, on peripheral blood B cells stimulated in vitro to differentiate toward plasma cells. Tp44 may represent a later stage of B cell differentiation than PCA-1 because unlike the PCA-1 antigen, this molecule could not be detected on any EBV-transformed cell line or Burkitt's lymphoma lines. The m.w. of the Tp44 molecule expressed on plasma cells and on T cells is identical, as determined by immunoprecipitation of radioiodinated cell surface proteins with monoclonal antibody 9.3.

In this communication, we have developed a specific radiometric assay (which utilizes 3H-Factor IX and is sensitive to less than 1% of plasma level) for this inhibitor and have measured its activity in various disease states. Strikingly, the levels of this inhibitor were found to be normal in patients with advanced chronic hepatocellular disease but low in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). When endotoxin was used to induce DIC in rabbits, the levels of this inhibitor fell by 25-90%. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVE), bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells, and a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) all synthesized and secreted this inhibitor, whereas a promyelocytic cell line (HL-60) did not and a monocytic cell line (U937) appears to synthesize only small amounts. When ammonium sulfate-fractionated human plasma and serum-free conditioned media from both HUVE and HepG2 cells were electrophoresed on sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gels, two activity peaks corresponding to Mr approximately 45,000 and Mr approximately 33,000 were eluted in each case.

A comparison of results with saliva and serum samples from 60 specific-pathogen-free cats, 9 experimentally infected cats, and 1,117 field cats led to the following conclusions. False-positive saliva results, if any occurred, were rare events. During experimental infections, antigen excretion in saliva was observed 1.5 weeks after the first appearance of FeLV antigen in serum. In one of four positive serum samples from sick animals brought to veterinarians, saliva samples tested negative. The use of saliva in an ELISA for the detection of FeLV p27 in individual sick cats is therefore less reliable than the use of serum. In seven cats with diseases typical of FeLV, including one with an intestinal form of lyphosarcoma, saliva tested positive and serum tested negative.

This effect stands in contrast to other well-known chemotactic agents such as fMet-Leu-Phe, C5a fragments, and LTB4, which stimulate directed cell movement in both cell types, and have important physiological implications. The human leukemic cell line HL-60, which is capable of differentiating either along granulocytic or monocytic lineages, was therefore used to explore the development of this selective monocyte/macrophage chemotactic response to thrombin. Esterolytically inactive DIP-alpha-thrombin, as well as the thrombin-derived chemotactic peptide CB67-129, elicits a dose-dependent chemotactic response in HL-60 cells differentiated to monocytelike cells by treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 (HL-60/mono), whereas no such response is evident in either undifferentiated HL-60 cells or in cells differentiated into granulocytes by treatment with DMSO (HL-60/gran). Similarly, early events which characterize stimulation of inflammatory cells by chemotactic agents are also evident, but only in monocyte-differentiated cells. In HL-60/mono, thrombin selectively stimulates rapid cytosolic Ca2+ elevation as well as rapid cytoskeletal association of cytosolic actin. Following thrombin stimulation, maximal actin association in these cells occurs within 30 sec (declining to basal levels at the end of 5 min), and maximal Ca2+ elevations are also evident within 15-20 sec, suggesting a temporal relationship between these two events. Thus, the events accompanying stimulation of HL-60/mono by thrombin are characteristic of those seen following stimulation of inflammatory cells by chemotaxins, with a major difference being the selectivity of thrombin as a chemotaxin for cells of macrophage/monocytic lineage. The selective chemotactic responsiveness of HL-60/mono to thrombin appears to relate to the development of specific receptors on these cells as part of monocytic differentiation: HL-60/mono (but HL-60/gran nor undifferentiated HL-60) are capable of significant specific 125-I-labeled alpha-thrombin-binding (ka approximately 20 nM), and possess an estimated 400,000 thrombin-binding sites per cell. Our findings further suggest that the thrombin response of HL-60 and particularly the expression of thrombin receptors on these cells may serve as a useful model system for exploring the biology of monocyte/macrophage differentiation.","['Bar-Shavit, R', 'Hruska, K A', 'Kahn, A J', 'Wilner, G D']","['Bar-Shavit R', 'Hruska KA', 'Kahn AJ', 'Wilner GD']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Complement C5)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (chemotactic peptide CB67-129)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', '9001-26-7 (Prothrombin)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Actins/analysis', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', '*Chemotaxis', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects', 'Complement C5/pharmacology', 'Complement C5a', 'Cytoskeleton/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukotriene B4/pharmacology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Prothrombin/pharmacology', 'Thrombin/*pharmacology']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1987 May;131(2):255-61. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041310216.,"['AM-32087/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DE-04629/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-14147/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,['10.1002/jcp.1041310216 [doi]'],,,,,,,

Benzodiazepines were effective initiators of maturation in the concentration range of 50 to 150 microM. The possible involvement of benzodiazepine receptors in mediating the differentiation induced by these agents was investigated. The presence of high affinity, peripheral type benzodiazepine binding sites (KD = 7.3 nM, TB = 14.5 pmol/mg protein with Ro5-4864) was demonstrated in HL-60 membranes. The occupancy of peripheral type high affinity benzodiazepine receptors by various benzodiazepines showed some correlation (r = 0.76) with their differentiation-inducing capabilities, but binding potencies were 1,000-fold higher than the concentrations required to produce differentiation. A class of benzodiazepine receptors with lower binding affinity was also detected in HL-60 membranes (KD = 28.6 microM; TB = 199 pmol/mg protein with diazepam). A higher level of correlation (r = 0.88) was demonstrated between benzodiazepine occupancy of these lower affinity receptors and the capacity to induce maturation. Significantly, benzodiazepine concentrations needed for low affinity binding and induction of differentiation were the same (25-200 microM), suggesting that low affinity benzodiazepine receptors may be involved in the induction process. We have shown that the molecular form responsible for the induction of the differentiation of HL-60 cells to mature forms by 6-thioguanine (TGua) is the free base, TGua, itself [Ishiguro, Schwartz, and Sartorelli (1984) J. Cell. Physiol., 121:383-390]. Since hypoxanthine (Hyp) and inosine (Ino) have been identified as putative endogenous ligands for high affinity benzodiazepine receptors in brain tissue, the potential involvement of benzodiazepine receptors in the differentiation of HL-60 cells by the purines was investigated. Physiological purines such as Hyp and Ino were inactive in displacing the benzodiazepines from their high and low affinity binding sites in HL-60 membranes. In contrast, TGua caused inhibition of benzodiazepine binding to high and low affinity sites. The inhibition of Ro5-4864 binding to high affinity binding sites by TGua appeared to be due to the binding of TGua to membranes through the formation of a mixed disulfide between the 6-thiopurine and protein thiols, since the inhibition was reversed by the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. The findings suggest a possible relationship between the occupancy of benzodiazepine receptors by TGua and the induction of leukemic cell differentiation.","['Ishiguro, K', 'Taft, W C', 'DeLorenzo, R J', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Ishiguro K', 'Taft WC', 'DeLorenzo RJ', 'Sartorelli AC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Benzodiazepinones)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '0 (Receptors, GABA-A)', '12794-10-4 (Benzodiazepines)', ""2QW0IK1742 (4'-chlorodiazepam)"", '66548-69-4 (CL 218872)', '77779-60-3 (2-phenylpyrazolo(4,3-c)quinolin-3(5H)-one)', 'YNF83VN1RL (PK 11195)']",IM,"['Benzodiazepines/*pharmacology', 'Benzodiazepinones/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/metabolism', 'Pyridazines/metabolism', 'Receptors, GABA-A/*physiology']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1987 May;131(2):226-34. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041310212.,['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['10.1002/jcp.1041310212 [doi]'],,,,,,,

One of its products, p40, activates gene expression directed by the LTR in a trans-acting manner. We have analysed the mechanism of this trans-activation mediated by p40 in human T cells co-transfected with a plasmid expressing p40 using the transient CAT gene expression. We identified two distinct elements in the LTR which are involved in maximum gene expression. The first was present in a 230-bp fragment upstream from TATA box in the U3 region and behaved as a classical enhancer. This region was also shown to be responsible for trans-activation by p40. This element alone together with functional p40 could direct the gene expression at only approximately 10% of the level achieved by the complete LTR and p40. The second element was present within a 300-bp fragment downstream from the RNA start site and profoundly enhanced the gene expression in a way independent from trans-activation mechanism. This enhancement was observed only when the element was located immediately downstream from the RNA start site without orientation preference. These two elements participate independently in the enhancement of gene expression.","['Ohtani, K', 'Nakamura, M', 'Saito, S', 'Noda, T', 'Ito, Y', 'Sugamura, K', 'Hinuma, Y']","['Ohtani K', 'Nakamura M', 'Saito S', 'Noda T', 'Ito Y', 'Sugamura K', 'Hinuma Y']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Plasmids', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transfection']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1987 Feb;6(2):389-95.,,,,,PMC553408,,,,,

Detailed mapping of c-myc rearrangements showed that some result from feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) proviral integration within or upstream of c-myc, but one case involves a complex 3' alteration and amplification which is apparently not directly virus-induced. S1 nuclease mapping of RNA from normal cells using c-myc probes revealed two presumptive 5' ends, each corresponding to a promoter-like sequence (P1 and P2), and a major 3' discontinuity which mapped to the 3'-most of two possible polyadenylation signals. Analysis of RNA from a series of tumours revealed different modes of c-myc expression. All tumours produced P1 and P2 transcripts with apparently normal structure except for one case where an insertion in intron 1 displaced exon 1 sequences. The abundance ratio of P1/P2 transcripts varied considerably and was high in tumours which carry a rearrangement adjacent to c-myc, but some other T-cell tumours with no apparent myc alteration displayed an equally high ratio. However, a consistent feature was the lack of detectable RNA from normal c-myc alleles in tumours which express a rearranged c-myc allele or a transduced FeLV v-myc gene. We suggest that this may prove to be a useful indicator of the presence of an oncogenically active myc gene, whether this is a rearranged c-myc or transduced v-myc sequence.","['Forrest, D', 'Onions, D', 'Lees, G', 'Neil, J C']","['Forrest D', 'Onions D', 'Lees G', 'Neil JC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Cats', 'Exons', 'Gene Amplification', 'Genes, Viral', 'Introns', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/microbiology', '*Oncogenes', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*genetics/microbiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1987 May;158(1):194-205. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(87)90253-4.,,,['10.1016/0042-6822(87)90253-4 [doi]'],,,,,,,

The results presented here show that viral integration in the myb locus generates splicing errors at the 5' and 3' regions. Viral integration results in transcriptional initiation within the viral long terminal repeat and generation of a chimeric mRNA that lacks the first three coding exons. The alterations at the 3' end are caused by an aberrant splicing event in which additional splice-donor and -acceptor sequences within intronic sequences are used to splice an additional 363 nucleotides into the myb transcripts. The resulting insertion of 121 amino acids is in a region of the protein where other activated forms of the myb gene product have deletions. These results suggest that alterations in the 3' end of the myb gene play a crucial role in the activation of this gene.,"['Rosson, D', 'Dugan, D', 'Reddy, E P']","['Rosson D', 'Dugan D', 'Reddy EP']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/isolation & purification', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/genetics', '*Oncogenes', '*RNA Splicing', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 May;84(10):3171-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.84.10.3171.,,,['10.1073/pnas.84.10.3171 [doi]'],,PMC304830,,,,['GENBANK/M16449'],

In vitro the pol-endo from avian sarcoma and leukosis viruses (ASLVs) cleaves both DNA strands near the U5-U3 junction of tandem long terminal repeats (LTR-LTR junction) in single-stranded and replicative form (RF)-I substrates. We have reported previously that the sequences that are required for cleavage of single-stranded substrates by the alpha beta form of the pol-endo differ for the plus and minus strands (G. Duyk, M. Longiaru, D. Cobrinik, R. Kowal, P. deHaseth, A. M. Skalka, and J. Leis, J. Virol. 56:589-599, 1985). This is not the case with RF-I substrates, in which a maximum of 22 base pairs of U5 and 8 base pairs of U3 were required for alpha beta pol-endo cleavage in each strand. Insertion of a palindromic octanucleotide (CATCGATG) at the LTR-LTR junction abolished cleavage in RF-I but not in single-stranded DNA substrates. Deletion of the four nucleotides (TTAA) at the junction prevented cleavage in the plus strand of RF-I DNA, but did not affect cleavage of single-stranded DNA. Furthermore, the alpha beta form of ASLV pol-endo did not recognize heterologous LTR-LTR junction sequences from the reticuloendotheliosis virus or Moloney murine leukemia virus in either substrate form, despite their sequence and structural similarities to the ASLV junction. These results support a role for a sequence-specific interaction between the ASLV pol-endo and the LTR-LTR junction domains that are required for cleavage. By using the infectious Rous sarcoma virus clone pATV8-K, we introduced a set of deletions into the U5 region that would be incorporated into the LTR-LTR junction on viral replication. In the unintegrated provirus, the deletions started 43 base pairs from the LTR-LTR junction and extended various lengths toward the junction. Results of transfection studies with these clones indicated that the U5 sequences that are required for virus production in vivo correspond to those that are required for cleavage of RF-I DNA in vitro.","['Cobrinik, D', 'Katz, R', 'Terry, R', 'Skalka, A M', 'Leis, J']","['Cobrinik D', 'Katz R', 'Terry R', 'Skalka AM', 'Leis J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (avian retrovirus proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)']",IM,"['Alpharetrovirus/*enzymology/growth & development', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases/*metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Virus Replication']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1987 Jun;61(6):1999-2008. doi: 10.1128/JVI.61.6.1999-2008.1987.,"['CA38046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-GM-07250/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,['10.1128/JVI.61.6.1999-2008.1987 [doi]'],,PMC254209,,,,,

Polytropic MuLVs were first detected in the spleens of 3-week-old mice and preceded the appearance of polytropic MuLVs in the thymus by over 1 month. At 4 months of age and older, nearly all mice expressed polytropic MuLVs in both organs. In contrast to previous studies which have identified class I polytropic MuLVs in AKR/J mice, fingerprint analysis of polytropic MuLVs from both young (3- to 4-week-old) and older (5- to 6-month-old) preleukemic mice indicated that a large proportion of viruses at both ages were class II polytropic MuLVs. All polytropic viruses (five isolates) analyzed from 3- to 4-week-old mice were recovered from spleen cells and were class II polytropic MuLVs. In older preleukemic mice, five of seven isolates were class II polytropic MuLVs and two were class I polytropic viruses. Class I and class II polytropic MuLVs were recovered from both the spleens and thymuses of older preleukemic mice. A detailed comparison of the class I and class II polytropic MuLVs from 5- to 6-month-old mice revealed that the nonecotropic gp70 sequences of most of the class I and class II MuLVs were identical, consistent with a common origin for these sequences. In contrast, the nonecotropic p15E sequences of class I MuLVs were clearly derived from different endogenous sequences than the nonecotropic p15E sequences of the class II MuLVs. The in vitro host ranges of class I and class II polytropic viruses were clearly distinguishable. Examination of the in vitro host range of several isolates suggested that the predominant polytropic viruses initially identified in the thymus (2 to 3 months of age) were class II polytropic viruses. The order of appearance of the class I and class II polytropic MuLVs and the identity of the gp70 oligonucleotides of these MuLVs suggested a model for the stepwise generation of class I polytropic MuLVs involving a class II polytropic MuLV intermediate.","['Evans, L H', 'Malik, F G']","['Evans LH', 'Malik FG']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Animals', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR/*microbiology', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Nucleotide Mapping', 'Preleukemia/*microbiology', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Spleen/microbiology', 'Thymus Gland/microbiology']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1987 Jun;61(6):1882-92. doi: 10.1128/JVI.61.6.1882-1892.1987.,,,['10.1128/JVI.61.6.1882-1892.1987 [doi]'],,PMC254194,,,,,

Friend-MCF MuLV is an erythroid leukemia virus, and Moloney MuLV is a lymphoid leukemia virus. To map the LTR sequences responsible for the different disease specificities, we constructed nine viruses with LTRs recombinant between the Friend-MCF and Moloney MuLVs. Analysis of the leukemia induced with the recombinant viruses showed that a 195-base-pair nucleotide sequence, including a 75-base-pair nucleotide Moloney enhancer, is responsible for the tissue-specific leukemogenicity of Moloney MuLV. However, not only the enhancer but also its downstream sequences appear to be necessary. The Moloney virus enhancer and its downstream sequence exerted a dominant effect over that of the Friend-MCF virus, but the enhancer sequence alone did not.

At 1 week after infection both the parents and the LTR recombinants replicated predominantly in the spleens with only low levels of replication in the thymus. At 2 weeks after infection, the patterns of replication in the spleens and thymuses were strongly influenced by the type of LTR. Viruses containing the M-MuLV LTR exhibited a remarkable elevation in thymus titers which frequently exceeded the spleen titers, whereas viruses containing the F-MuLV LTR replicated predominantly in the spleen. In older preleukemic mice (5 to 8 weeks of age) the structural genes of M-MuLV or F-MuLV predominantly influenced the patterns of replication. Viruses containing the structural genes of M-MuLV replicated efficiently in both the spleen and thymus, whereas viruses containing the structural genes of F-MuLV replicated predominantly in the spleen. In leukemic mice infected with the recombinant containing F-MuLV structural genes and the M-MuLV LTR, high levels of virus replication were observed in splenic tumors but not in thymic tumors. This phenotypic difference suggested that tumors of the spleen and thymus may have originated by the independent transformation of different cell types. Quantification of polytropic MulVs in late-preleukemic mice infected with each of the ecotropic MuLVs indicated that the level of polytropic MuLV replication closely paralleled the level of replication of the ecotropic MuLVs in all instances. These studies indicated that determinants of tissue tropism are contained in both the LTR and structural gene sequences of F-MuLV and M-MuLV and that high levels of ecotropic or polytropic MuLV replication, per se, are not sufficient for leukemia induction. Our results further suggested that leukemia induction requires a high level of virus replication in the target organ only transiently during an early preleukemic stage of disease.","['Evans, L H', 'Morrey, J D']","['Evans LH', 'Morrey JD']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Animals', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*growth & development', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/microbiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*growth & development', 'Preleukemia/microbiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*microbiology', 'Spleen/microbiology', 'Thymus Gland/microbiology', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Virus Replication']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1987 May;61(5):1350-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.61.5.1350-1357.1987.,,,['10.1128/JVI.61.5.1350-1357.1987 [doi]'],,PMC254109,,,,,

An immunotoxin was constructed by linking a murine monoclonal antibody against the human transferrin receptor (TR) to the plant toxin, ricin. The cytotoxic activity of the anti-TR-ricin immunotoxin was tested in vitro and demonstrated highly potent and cell type-specific killing of cells derived from human glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, and leukemia. The anti-TR-ricin immunotoxin killed more than 50% of ""target"" cells at a concentration of 5.6 X 10(-13) M after an 18-hour incubation with the ionophore, monensin. This potency exceeds that of any other anti-TR immunotoxin reported in the literature. When the activity of the anti-TR-ricin immunotoxin against ""target"" tumor-derived cells was compared with the immunotoxin's activity against ""non-target"" cells, it could be predicted that a selective toxicity of anti-TR-ricin immunotoxin between tumor cells and normal brain was more than 150- to 1380-fold. Solid-phase indirect radioimmunoassay techniques were used to demonstrate significantly higher levels of TR in the glioblastoma- and medulloblastoma-derived cell lines, as well as in surgical tissue samples of medulloblastoma and glioblastoma, as compared to normal brain.

In contrast, transplanted TRE of the low leukemia-incidence Fv-1b/n genotype restricted preleukemic changes in thymocyte differentiation and MuLV antigen expression by lymphoid cells derived from the nustr/nustr host. Thus, nustr/nustr lymphocytes must infect susceptible TRE (Fv-1n/n) with N-tropic-MuLV before preleukemic changes occur in the mustr/nustr lymphocytes that later migrate to the thymus.

When HL-60 extracellular magnesium was deficient (less than 0.01 mM), the total intracellular magnesium content and [3H] leucine incorporation rates decreased to 61 and 28%, respectively, on day 3. When the cells were treated with various inducers (100 nM 1 alpha, 25 dihydroxyitamine D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), 100 nM beta-all-trans retinoic acid (RA), 20 nM 12-o-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), 1.25% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and 30 nM aclacinomycin (AcM] in magnesium-deficient medium, the expression of differentiation-related phenotypes (nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reducing ability, nonspecific esterase (NSE) activity and monoclonal antibody, OKM1 binding activity) was almost completely inhibited. After a 2-day treatment with 100 nM 1,25(OH)2D3 in magnesium-deficient medium, the expression of differentiation-related phenotypes was restored by further incubation in the absence of inducer in standard magnesium medium (0.4 mM). These results suggested that magnesium deprivation inhibited the expression of HL-60 differentiation-related phenotypes but not their commitment to differentiation. These phenotypes were expressed without inducer in standard magnesium medium after a 2-day simultaneous treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 and cyclohexamide (protein synthesis inhibitor) in magnesium-deficient medium, but not after simultaneous pretreatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 and alpha-amanitin (RNA synthesis inhibitor). Thus, it was suggested that the magnesium-requiring step in HL-60 cell differentiation is in protein but not mRNA synthesis. This conclusion is supported by the findings that changes in c-myc and c-fms mRNA levels in HL-60 cells treated with 100 nM 1,25(OH)2D3 in magnesium-deficient medium and those in standard magnesium medium were the same. In addition, dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dbc AMP) could restore expression of differentiation-related phenotypes inhibited by magnesium deprivation but not those inhibited by cyclohexamide, even though magnesium deprivation inhibited protein synthesis as much as did cyclohexamide. This suggests that magnesium-requiring step in HL-60 cell differentiation is different from that inhibited by cyclohexamide.","['Okazaki, T', 'Mochizuki, T', 'Tashima, M', 'Sawada, H', 'Uchino, H']","['Okazaki T', 'Mochizuki T', 'Tashima M', 'Sawada H', 'Uchino H']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Amanitins)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (aclacinomycins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['*Aclarubicin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Amanitins/pharmacology', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Magnesium Deficiency/*physiopathology', 'Naphthacenes/pharmacology', 'Oncogenes/drug effects', 'Peptide Chain Elongation, Translational', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1987 Apr;131(1):50-7. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041310109.,,,['10.1002/jcp.1041310109 [doi]'],,,,,,,

These immature erythroid cells respond to EP in culture to differentiate into reticulocytes and erythrocytes. Radiolabeled EP (both iodinated and tritiated) binds to 800-1000 cell surface receptors on these cells at 4 degrees C. Using 125I-EP, we found that 300 of these cell surface receptors have a higher affinity for EP (Kd = 0.09 nM) than the remaining receptors (Kd = 0.57 nM). The number of molecules of EP bound per cell increased about 2-fold when binding was carried out at 37 degrees C. Treatment of the cell surface with pronase or removal of surface-bound EP with a low pH wash revealed that radiolabeled EP is internalized by the cells at 37 degrees C. Pulse chase experiments showed that degradation products of radiolabeled EP are released into the medium with a corresponding loss of label from the interior of the cell. Inhibitors of lysosomal function greatly reduced this degradation of 125I-EP. Since 180 of the 300 high affinity receptors and very few of the low affinity receptors are occupied at the concentration of EP which elicits the maximum biological response in these cells, we suggest that interaction of EP with the high affinity receptors are necessary for the full biological effect of the hormone. A different murine erythroleukemia cell line which does not differentiate in response to EP was found to have only the lower affinity binding sites for the hormone.","['Sawyer, S T', 'Krantz, S B', 'Goldwasser, E']","['Sawyer ST', 'Krantz SB', 'Goldwasser E']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '01Q9PC255D (Ammonium Chloride)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)']",IM,"['Ammonium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', '*Endocytosis', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin/*metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin']",1987/04/25 00:00,1987/04/25 00:01,['1987/04/25 00:00'],"['1987/04/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/25 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Apr 25;262(12):5554-62.,"['AM-15555/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL21676/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AM-07186/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,['S0021-9258(18)45608-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,

The K-562 T1 cells which can proliferate in a protein-free medium are one of the model systems suitably supporting the autocrine hypothesis, which claims that cancer cells produce and respond to their own growth factors. The K-562 T1 cells were cultured in a protein-free medium at large scale and the growth factors were purified from the conditioned medium. It was found that K-562 T1 cells produce at least two growth factors; one is LGF-I (leukemia-derived growth factor-I) which can stimulate the proliferation of a wide range of human leukemia cell lines and the other is LGF-II (leukemia-derived growth factor-II), which can contribute to the growth of fibroblasts. LGF-I was purified using QAE-Sephadex, Bio Gel P-60 and Mono S FPLC. The purified protein was found to be homogenous by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and NH2-terminal sequence analysis. The molecular weight of LGF-I was 20,000 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 30 NH2-terminal residues of LGF-I are the same as that of ubiquitin. Ubiquitin is a protein found in eukaryotic cells with molecular weight of 8,600. In the nucleus ubiquitin is conjugated to histone 2A to form the nuclear protein A24 which may play a role in regulation of chromatin structure, and in the cytoplasm is part of an ATP-dependent non-lysosomal proteolytic pathway. However, its physiological significance has not yet been fully resolved. Ubiquitin purified from bovine thymus did not show cell proliferating activity for any cells tested.

Pharmacological inhibition of one of these enzymes has been found to be an effective treatment for a few lymphatic neoplasia. We have studied the activities of the above enzymes in the circulating malignant cells of 25 patients with B-chronic lymphatic leukemia (B-CLL), four patients with B prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), seven patients with leukemic centrocytic lymphoma (CC), 18 patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and 16 patients with immunocytoma (IC). For comparison, the blasts of nine patients with 'common' acute lymphatic leukemia (cALL) and normal T (n = 12) and B (n = 8) cells were simultaneously investigated. Despite morphologic similarity, the leukemic cells of the chronic B cell malignancies demonstrate different enzyme patterns. B-CLL is characterized by very low activities of all the enzymes ADA, PNP and 5'NT. In the cells of HCL the highest values of PNP are found. The leukemic cells of IC are characterized by low levels of ADA but moderate levels of PNP and high levels of 5'NT. Thus some of the entities of B malignancies show typical enzyme patterns which might be of importance in defining maturation stages of the disease. The differences in these enzyme patterns can also be made use of in therapy with enzyme inhibitors such as deoxycoformycin.","['Ho, A D', 'Knauf, W', 'Ganeshaguru, K', 'Hunstein, W', 'Hoffbrand, A V']","['Ho AD', 'Knauf W', 'Ganeshaguru K', 'Hunstein W', 'Hoffbrand AV']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['EC 2.4.2.- (Pentosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', 'EC 3.1.3.- (Nucleotidases)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)"", 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase"", 'Adenosine Deaminase/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Lymphoma/*enzymology', '*Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/*metabolism', 'Nucleotidases/*metabolism', 'Pentosyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*metabolism']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1987 Jan-Mar;5(1):9-17. doi: 10.1002/hon.2900050103.,,,['10.1002/hon.2900050103 [doi]'],,,,,,,

Following the addition of RA two kinds of changes occur. First, there are early changes that comprise an increase in the intracellular concentration of sodium ions [Na]i, which reaches its maximum after 6 h, and an increase in the activity of the Na+-pump, which is reflected by an ouabain-sensitive K+ influx that peaks at 8 h (170% of the control value) and that occurs without any change in the number of pump molecules, as measured by the binding of 3H-ouabain. Second, beginning after 12 h of culture with RA, a decrease in the number of ouabain-binding sites occurs, this being accompanied by an increase in the number of K+ ions actively transported by each site. The effect of modulation of Na+-pump activity on the RA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells was studied using low, noncytotoxic concentrations of ouabain which, although alone having no differentiating effect, accelerated and potentiated the effect of RA on differentiation. When added in combination, these drugs induced rapid stimulation of the Na+-pump, which reached its peak after 2 h. These results indicate that a concomitant increase in the level of [Na+]i and in the activity of the Na+-pump constitute primary events in the interaction between RA and HL-60 cells, and that cation fluxes may play a role in the initiation of the process of differentiation.","['Ladoux, A', 'Abita, J P', 'Geny, B']","['Ladoux A', 'Abita JP', 'Geny B']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '5ACL011P69 (Ouabain)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Ouabain/metabolism', 'Potassium/metabolism', 'Sodium/metabolism', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 1986;33(2):142-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-0436.1986.tb00419.x.,,,"['S0301-4681(11)60839-6 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1432-0436.1986.tb00419.x [doi]']",,,,,,,

We now report on a quantitative assay for HTLV-I transformation. Transformed cell lines were produced by cocultivation of either preactivated (phytohemagglutinin and T-cell growth factor) or nonactivated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with an equal number of lethally irradiated HTLV-I-positive donor cells (MT-2). After 14 days in liquid culture, transformed cells were plated in a 2-layer soft agarose system with or without T-cell growth factor (TCGF). Colony formation among 50 normal controls was observed at varying efficiencies with a mean number of 179 colonies (range, 6-599) in the presence of TCGF (up to a 2-log difference). The day 14 T-cell cultures demonstrated relatively low colony-forming efficiencies (less than or equal to 0.1%) and enhanced colony formation in the presence of TCGF. Day 14 after cocultivation was chosen for this assay based on a dose-response relationship between colony formation and the virus-positive donor cell inoculum and the known kinetics of colony growth of normal activated T-cells. An analysis of individual colonies indicated that they were of target cell origin and HTLV-I positive. Recombinant beta-interferon in increasing concentrations caused a decrease in colony formation as measured in this assay. Long-term cell cultures (2-18 months) showed higher colony-forming efficiencies (up to 1.0%) which were not enhanced by TCGF. The ability to quantitatively evaluate transformation via colony counts will provide an opportunity to study differences in transforming efficiencies attributable to varying target cells, donor cells, or blocking factors such as interferons, drugs, or anti-HTLV-I antibodies.","['Graziano, S L', 'Lehr, B M', 'Merl, S A', 'Ehrlich, G D', 'Moore, J L', 'Hallinan, E J', 'Hubbell, C', 'Davey, F R', 'Vournakis, J', 'Poiesz, B J']","['Graziano SL', 'Lehr BM', 'Merl SA', 'Ehrlich GD', 'Moore JL', 'Hallinan EJ', 'Hubbell C', 'Davey FR', 'Vournakis J', 'Poiesz BJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*Deltaretrovirus', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Karyotyping', 'T-Lymphocytes/analysis/drug effects/*microbiology', 'Time Factors']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 May 1;47(9):2468-73.,['CA 37478-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Macromolecular DNA of human multidrug-resistant K562 cells was transfected to drug-sensitive mouse Ltk- cells to obtain a drug-resistant transfectant with a human resistant gene. Both primary and secondary transfectants showed similar patterns of cross-resistance to Adriamycin and vincristine. The mechanism of drug resistance of the transfectants was attributed to decreased retention of the drug. Three secondary transfectants obtained independently contained common Alu-containing EcoRI fragments 15, 6.5, 3.7, 2.6, and 1.9 kilobases long. The 2.6-kilobase EcoRI fragment was cloned from a lambda phage genomic library made from DNA of a secondary transfectant. The 2.6-kilobase fragment was detected in the primary and secondary transfectants but not in the parental Ltk-, Adriamycin-resistant Ltk-, and Adriamycin-resistant P388 cells. This sequence was found to be amplified in several multidrug-resistant cell lines such as Adriamycin-resistant ovarian carcinoma A2780 and colchicine-resistant KB carcinoma cells. The 2.6-kilobase fragment hybridized with a 4.5-kilobase mRNA which is overexpressed in the Adriamycin-resistant K562 cells and the Adriamycin-resistant A2780 cells but not detected in the parental K562 cells.

These activities are independent of thrombin's enzymatic activity. Unlike other chemotactic factors, thrombin is specific for monocytes and does not attract granulocytes. To further explore the cellular specificity we have used a human leukemia cell line HL-60 that is capable of in vitro differentiation toward either monocytes (HL-60/mono) following incubation with 1,25(OH)2D3, or granulocytes (HL-60/gran) following incubation with DMSO. In contrast to undifferentiated HL-60 cells or HL-60/gran, we find that HL-60/mono respond chemotactically to intact human alpha-thrombin, esterolytically inactive iPR2P-alpha-thrombin, and the thrombin-derived peptide CB67-129, previously shown to contain the thrombin chemotactic exosite. In addition, thrombin induces in HL-60/mono association of actin with the cytoskeleton and causes an increase in levels of free cytosolic Ca2+. These phenomena are well characterized as early events occurring concomitant with directed cell movement associated with exposure to chemotactic agents such as FMLP. Furthermore, in contrast to fibroblasts, both iPR2P-alpha-thrombin and the thrombin chemotactic peptide CB67-129 evoke dose-dependent [3H]TdR incorporation, protein synthesis, and cell replication in growth-arrested J-744 cells, a murine macrophage-like cell line. Limited tryptic digests of CB67-129 lose chemotactic activity but retain full mitogenic activity, demonstrating that as with PDGF, the sites on CB67-129 required for chemotaxis and mitogenesis are clearly dissociable. The mitogenic effects of the CB67-129 digest can be mimicked by a synthetic tetradecapeptide analogue of CB67-129 (residues 367-380) that includes the loop B insertion sequence, previously shown to be critical for thrombin's chemotactic effects.

The mature gp 70 protein is transported to and accumulates on the surface of vFeLVenv-infected cells. Vaccinia virus replication and FeLV gp70 accumulation was also observed in cells of feline and murine origin, albeit at levels somewhat reduced from those in human cells. Toward the goal of developing a recombinant vaccinia virus as a live vaccine for feline leukemia disease in cats, immunogenicity studies were performed in cats and mice. These experiments yielded surprising results: although animals mounted a typical virus-neutralizing antibody response to the vaccinia virus vector, we were unable to detect antibodies against FeLV gp70 in any of the vaccinated animals. A subsequent 'booster' immunization with killed FeLV was unable to elicit evidence of immunologic 'priming' by the recombinant virus. We are presently unable to explain the apparent lack of immunogenicity.

Hence, HTLV-I might be an important agent not only in the development, but also in the initiation, of this lymphoproliferative disease. This possibility was sustained by our previous observations indicating that normal T lymphocytes incubated with HTLV-I are able to form colonies in soft agar, seven days later, in the absence of exogenous IL-2. These results led us to explore further the immediate effects of viral infection on purified resting T lymphocytes. Here, we present evidence that HTLV-I is able to activate T lymphocytes. Indeed, binding of viral particles to these cells induces IL-2 production and IL-2 receptor expression, and triggers T-cell proliferation. This initial activation, which appears to be independent of accessory cells, may be relevant in understanding the role of HTLV-I in the aetiology of adult T-cell leukaemia.","['Gazzolo, L', 'Duc Dodon, M']","['Gazzolo L', 'Duc Dodon M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Replication', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology']",1987/04/16 00:00,1987/04/16 00:01,['1987/04/16 00:00'],"['1987/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 1987 Apr 16-22;326(6114):714-7. doi: 10.1038/326714a0.,,,['10.1038/326714a0 [doi]'],,,,,,,

The elements in the HIV genome which control activation are not known but expression might be regulated through a variety of DNA elements. The cis-acting control elements of the viral genome are enhancer and promoter regions. The virus also encodes trans-acting factors specified by the tat-III and art genes. We have examined whether products specific to activated T cells might stimulate viral transcription by binding to regions on viral DNA. Activation of T cells, which increases HIV expression up to 50-fold, correlated with induction of a DNA binding protein indistinguishable from a recognized transcription factor, called NF-kappa B, with binding sites in the viral enhancer. Mutation of these binding sites abolished inducibility. That NF-kappa B acts in synergy with the viral tat-III gene product to enhance HIV expression in T cells may have implications for the pathogenesis of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome).","['Nabel, G', 'Baltimore, D']","['Nabel G', 'Baltimore D']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nature,Nature,0410462,['0 (Transcription Factors)'],IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics/immunology', '*Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1987/04/16 00:00,1987/04/16 00:01,['1987/04/16 00:00'],"['1987/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 1987 Apr 16-22;326(6114):711-3. doi: 10.1038/326711a0.,,,['10.1038/326711a0 [doi]'],['Nature 1990 Mar 8;344(6262):178'],,,,,['GENBANK/K03455'],

To study the role of the integrated proviruses in these tumor cells, we cloned several newly integrated proviruses (with their flanking cellular sequences) from a single tumor in procaryotic vectors. With each of the five clones obtained, a probe was prepared from the cellular sequences flanking the provirus. With one such probe (SS8), we screened several Gross passage A MuLV-induced SIM.S mouse tumor DNAs and found that, in 11 of 40 tumors, a provirus was integrated into a common region designated Gin-1. A 26-kilobase-pair sequence of Gin-1 was cloned from two lambda libraries, and a restriction map was derived. All proviruses were integrated as a cluster in the same orientation within a 5-kilobase-pair region of Gin-1, and most of them had a recombinant structure of the mink cell focus-forming virus type. The frequency of Gin-1 occupancy by provirus was much lower in thymoma induced by other strains of MuLV in other mouse strains. Using somatic-cell hybrid DNAs, we mapped Gin-1 on mouse chromosome 19. Gin-1 was not homologous to 16 known oncogenes and was distinct from the other common regions for provirus integration previously described. Therefore, Gin-1 appears to represent a new common provirus integration region. The integration of a provirus within Gin-1 might be an important event leading to T-cell transformation, and the Gin-1 region might harbor sequences which are involved in tumor development.","['Villemur, R', 'Monczak, Y', 'Rassart, E', 'Kozak, C', 'Jolicoeur, P']","['Villemur R', 'Monczak Y', 'Rassart E', 'Kozak C', 'Jolicoeur P']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Thymoma/*microbiology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*microbiology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1987 Jan;7(1):512-22. doi: 10.1128/mcb.7.1.512-522.1987.,,,['10.1128/mcb.7.1.512-522.1987 [doi]'],,PMC365095,,,,,

The relative concentrations of EcoRI segments in bromouracil-labeled DNA that replicated during selected intervals of the S phase in Friend virus-transformed murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells were measured. From these results, we calculated the nuclear DNA content (C value; the haploid DNA content of a cell in the G1 phase of the cell cycle) at the time each segment replicated during the S phase. We observed that IgCH genes replicate in the following order: alpha, epsilon, gamma 2a, gamma 2b, gamma 1, gamma 3, delta, and mu, followed by the J and D segments. The C value at which each segment replicates increased as a linear function of its distance from C alpha. The average rate of DNA replication in the IgCH gene cluster was determined from these data to be 1.7 to 1.9 kilobases/min, similar to the rate measured for mammalian replicons by autoradiography and electron microscopy (for a review, see H. J. Edenberg and J. A. Huberman, Annu. Rev. Genet. 9:245-284, 1975, and R. G. Martin, Adv. Cancer Res. 34:1-55, 1981). Similar results were obtained with other murine non-B cell lines, including a fibroblast cell line (L60T) and a hepatoma cell line (Hepa 1.6). In contrast, we observed that IgCh segments in a B-cell plasmacytoma (MPC11) and two Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed pre-B cell lines (22D6 and 300-19O) replicated as early as (300-19P) or earlier than (MPC11 and 22D6) C alpha in MEL cells. Unlike MEL cells, however, all of the IgCH segments in a given B cell line replicated at very similar times during the S phase, so that a temporal directionality in the replication of the IgCH gene cluster was not apparent from these data. These results provide evidence that in murine non-B cells the IgCH, J, and D loci are part of a single replicon.","['Brown, E H', 'Iqbal, M A', 'Stuart, S', 'Hatton, K S', 'Valinsky, J', 'Schildkraut, C L']","['Brown EH', 'Iqbal MA', 'Stuart S', 'Hatton KS', 'Valinsky J', 'Schildkraut CL']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (Deoxyribonuclease EcoRI)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', '*DNA Replication', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Deoxyribonuclease EcoRI', '*Genes', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphoma', 'Mice', 'Plasmacytoma', '*Replicon']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1987 Jan;7(1):450-7. doi: 10.1128/mcb.7.1.450-457.1987.,"['CA 07744/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 09060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM22332/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,['10.1128/mcb.7.1.450-457.1987 [doi]'],,PMC365088,,,,,

FD-TCL cells were often eudiploid and could be grown in pure culture only at high concentrations, or on stromal feeder layers.

The sensitivity to bacteriocin was evaluated by testing the cell cycle perturbation following in-vitro incubation of lymphoid cells with colicin (or Tris buffer as controls) monitored by flow-cytometry. The analysis was based on measuring relative differences in fluorescence intensity of propidium iodide stained DNA in the individual cells.

The distribution pattern of PLC in the thymus and spleen (in the models tested) obtained by transplantation studies coincided with sensitivity of spleen and thymus cells to colicin.

Among the hemopoietic growth factors, G-CSF has an outstanding capacity to induce terminal differentiation and suppression of self-renewal in myeloid leukemic cells. Murine and human G-CSF's show complete biological cross-reactivity across species and bind equally well to G-CSF receptors of either species.

[3H]LTD4 binding to RBL-1 membrane receptors was stereoselective, specific, and saturable. The binding affinity and maximum binding density of [3H]LTD4 to RBL-1 membrane receptors were 0.9 +/- 0.2 nM and 800 +/- 125 fmol/mg protein, respectively. Binding of [3H]LTD4 to the receptors was enhanced by divalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+) and inhibited by guanine nucleotides and sodium ions, specifically, indicating that a guanine nucleotide-binding protein may regulate the agonist-receptor interaction. LTD4, LTE4 agonist and antagonist analogs competed with the radioligand in binding to the RBL-1 LTD4 receptors. The binding affinities of these analogs correlated with (a) those determined from the guinea pig lung LTD4 receptors and (b) the pharmacological activities in smooth muscle contraction. LTD4 and related agonists also induced time- and concentration-dependent phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in RBL-1 cells. The LTD4 induction of inositol 1-phosphate was potent, stereoselective, specific, and was blocked by LTD4 receptor antagonists. The rank order potency of agonist-induced inositol 1-phosphate formation in RBL-1 cells was equivalent to the receptor binding affinity determined using either RBL-1 cell or guinea pig lung membranes. These studies have demonstrated the G protein coupled LTD4 receptors on RBL-1 cell membranes. Binding of agonists to the receptor may activate the G protein-regulated phospholipase C to induce hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol. The hydrolytic products of phosphatidylinositol, possibly inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, may be the intracellular messengers for LTD4 receptors in RBL-1 cells.","['Sarau, H M', 'Mong, S', 'Foley, J J', 'Wu, H L', 'Crooke, S T']","['Sarau HM', 'Mong S', 'Foley JJ', 'Wu HL', 'Crooke ST']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (Cations, Monovalent)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, Leukotriene)', '0 (Receptors, Prostaglandin)', '0 (SRS-A)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Reagents)', '15421-51-9 (inositol 1-phosphate)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/*metabolism', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cations, Divalent', 'Cations, Monovalent', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Guanine Nucleotides/pharmacology', 'Hydrolysis', 'Inositol Phosphates/biosynthesis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Leukotriene', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin/*metabolism', 'SRS-A/metabolism', 'Sulfhydryl Reagents/pharmacology']",1987/03/25 00:00,1987/03/25 00:01,['1987/03/25 00:00'],"['1987/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Mar 25;262(9):4034-41.,,,['S0021-9258(18)61307-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,

The results indicated that a Lyt-2+ lymphocyte-enriched population was more efficient in conferring protection against M-MSV-induced tumors. To investigate if cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) alone had a protective effect, a M-MSV-specific CTL clone was transferred in the same model system. The results demonstrated that a M-MSV-specific CTL clone prevented M-MSV-induced tumor growth and also induced the destruction of syngeneic Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV)-induced MBL-2 leukemic cells in the peritoneal cavity. However, the cell dose required to obtain protection using a CTL clone was higher than that which was effective when mixed lymphocyte tumor cell culture cells were used. To assess the ability of the transferred cells to home and to repopulate the lymphoid organs of the ""B mice"", the frequency of virus-specific CTL precursors in the spleen was evaluated by limiting dilution analysis. The results indicated that lymphocytes from mixed lymphocyte tumor cell cultures can be recovered from the spleens of ""B mice"" injected i.v. 25 days earlier. On the contrary, following the transfer of an active CTL clone, a very low frequency (less than 1/200,000 cells) of virus-specific CTL precursors was present in the spleens of recipient animals. The same M-MSV-specific CTL clone did not yield protection against M-MSV-induced tumors or MBL-2 leukemic cells when injected i.v. into M-MuLV tolerant mice.","['Cerundolo, V', 'Lahaye, T', 'Horvath, C', 'Zanovello, P', 'Collavo, D', 'Engers, H D']","['Cerundolo V', 'Lahaye T', 'Horvath C', 'Zanovello P', 'Collavo D', 'Engers HD']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival', 'Clone Cells', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine sarcoma virus/*immunology', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/*immunology', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*immunology/microbiology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1987 Feb;17(2):173-8. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830170204.,,,['10.1002/eji.1830170204 [doi]'],,,,,,,

This probably reflects the use of a common recombinase by IgH and the T cell receptor. This paper describes novel observations on the nature of these cross-lineage rearrangements. A high proportion (though not all) IgH rearrangements in human T leukaemic cells involve the D segment nearest to the J region (DQ52). This same D segment is not involved in B cell IgH rearrangements with one important exception, namely a proportion of B cell leukaemic clones with the most primitive B cell precursor phenotype. These observations have potentially important implications for early lymphoid cell differentiation and in particular support the idea that the 3' D plus J region might lie within a limited window of accessibility of the IgH gene in precursor lymphocytes.","['Mizutani, S', 'Ford, A M', 'Wiedemann, L M', 'Chan, L C', 'Furley, A J', 'Greaves, M F', 'Molgaard, H V']","['Mizutani S', 'Ford AM', 'Wiedemann LM', 'Chan LC', 'Furley AJ', 'Greaves MF', 'Molgaard HV']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin J-Chains)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['DNA Restriction Enzymes', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin J-Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1986/12/20 00:00,1986/12/20 00:01,['1986/12/20 00:00'],"['1986/12/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/20 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1986 Dec 20;5(13):3467-73.,,,,,PMC1167382,,,,,

Analysis of frozen tissue sections by indirect immunofluorescence revealed that blastema cells and some tubules were recognized by BA-1 and OKB2, which identify unstimulated B cells and granulocytes. Stroma, some tubules, and focal blastema were recognized by BA-2, which identifies a 24-kDa antigen on leukemic cells and platelets. Mature epithelium in glomerular bodies was identified by C3bR and J5, which recognize CR1 and the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen, respectively. Tissue sections from a clear cell sarcoma and a mesoblastic nephroma were notably reactive only with BA-2.

A disease spectrum was observed in which muscle was infiltrated by proliferating fibroblasts and caused white streaks, white diffuse areas, or well-defined elongated tumors. Fibroblast proliferation was progressive, and the gross presentation depended on the rapidity and extent of proliferation. There was evidence of anaplasia but not frankly malignant disease or metastases. The disease was produced at a high frequency when 10-day-old embryos were infected. Breast muscle (pectoralis major and minor) was affected with variable severity in all birds, thigh muscles were affected occasionally, while other thoracic, external abdominal, and wing muscles were affected very rarely. Progression of proliferative muscle lesions was demonstrated by sequential necropsies and microscopic examination of muscle samples. The disease appeared before 2 weeks of age, and thin white streaks with minimal cellular proliferation were the earliest lesions observed. Elongated, spindle-shaped tumors were the most advanced form of proliferation observed. The advanced lesions showed cellular anaplasia and signs of rapid growth, and appeared most commonly at 6 weeks of age or later. Histologically, mild proliferation correlated with normal appearing fibroblasts producing collagen. Severe proliferation correlated with anaplastic, rapidly dividing cells producing little collagen and a high mitotic index. A decrease in the virus dose resulted in less severe fibromatosis, but at least one chicken infected with a low virus dose showed severe disease. When 10- or 35-day-old hatched chicks were injected in the breast muscle with EU-8 or K-3, a low incidence of lymphoid leukosis was observed, but no fibromatosis resulted during an observation period of 27 weeks. Infectious virus was extracted from the fibromatosis in the breast muscle, and extracted virus caused the same disease when injected in 10-day-old embryos. No transforming activity was observed on normal chick embryo fibroblast monolayers. Cell cultures were established from areas in the breast muscle affected by fibromatosis, and from discrete tumors. These cells did not show any signs of transformation in culture. Supernatants obtained from these cell cultures caused fibromatosis when injected into 10-day-old embryos, but did not transform normal chick embryo fibroblasts.","['Kogekar, N', 'Spurgeon, T L', 'Simon, M C', 'Smith, R E']","['Kogekar N', 'Spurgeon TL', 'Simon MC', 'Smith RE']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*pathology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/genetics', 'Body Weight', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chickens', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Fibroblasts/pathology', 'Fibroma/*pathology', 'Muscles/*pathology', 'Oncogenes', 'Organ Size']",1987/04/15 00:00,1987/04/15 00:01,['1987/04/15 00:00'],"['1987/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Apr 15;47(8):2083-91.,['CA-35984/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

This function of topoisomerase II was investigated in relation to cell proliferation and cell cycle. Mouse fibroblasts NIH 3T3 and mouse leukemia L1210 cells stop proliferation when they reach a certain density. Nuclei were isolated from proliferative or quiescent cells and then treated with drug for 30 min. DNA modifications were assayed by alkaline elution. We found that the frequencies of m-AMSA- or VP-16-induced DNA-protein links were higher in nuclei from exponentially growing than in those from quiescent cells in both the 3T3 and the L1210 lines. Drug-induced protein-associated DNA breaks were also studied as a function of the cell cycle in 3T3 cells that had been arrested by contact inhibition in medium containing 1% calf serum and then stimulated to proliferate by raplating at a lower cell density in medium containing 10% serum. In these synchronized cells, a large peak of [3H]thymidine incorporation occurred 18-30 h after replating. The yield of DNA-protein cross-links produced by 30-min drug treatments of nuclei isolated at various times after growth initiation increased concomitantly with the peak of the DNA synthesis. The topoisomerase II activity of nuclear extracts, as measured by kinetoplast DNA decatenation followed a similar pattern. Using colony-forming assays, we also observed that m-AMSA and VP-16 were most cytotoxic in proliferative cells and during DNA synthesis. These results suggest that alkaline elution measurement of m-AMSA- or VP-16-induced protein-linked DNA breaks reflects the association of topoisomerase II with DNA. This association is increased during DNA replication, making the cells more vulnerable to m-AMSA and VP-16 at this time.","['Markovits, J', 'Pommier, Y', 'Kerrigan, D', 'Covey, J M', 'Tilchen, E J', 'Kohn, K W']","['Markovits J', 'Pommier Y', 'Kerrigan D', 'Covey JM', 'Tilchen EJ', 'Kohn KW']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Proteins)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/analysis/*physiology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Proteins/metabolism']",1987/04/15 00:00,1987/04/15 00:01,['1987/04/15 00:00'],"['1987/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Apr 15;47(8):2050-5.,,,,,,,,,,

Three distinct purine deoxyribonucleoside kinases, a deoxycytidine (dCyd) kinase, an adenosine (Ado) kinase, and a deoxyguanosine (dGuo) kinase (the latter appears to be localized in mitochondria), were resolved. dCyd kinase contained the major phosphorylating activity for dAdo, dGuo, and 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine (ara-A). Ado kinase represented a second kinase for dAdo and ara-A while a third kinase for dAdo was found in mitochondria. dCyd kinase was purified about 2000-fold with ion-exchange, affinity, and hydrophobic chromatographies. On gel electrophoresis, both dCyd and dAdo phosphorylating activities comigrated, indicating that the activities are associated with the same protein. The enzyme showed a broad pH optimum ranging from pH 6.5 to pH 9.5. Divalent cations Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+ stimulated dCyd kinase activity; Mg2+ produced the maximal activity. dCyd kinase from either lymphoid or myeloid cells showed broad substrate specificity. The enzyme used several nucleoside triphosphates, but ATP, GTP, and dTTP were the best phosphate donors. dCyd was the best nucleoside substrate, since dCyd kinase had an apparent Km of 0.3, 85, 90, and 1400 microM for dCyd, dAdo, dGuo, and ara-A, respectively. The enzyme exhibited substrate activation with both pyrimidine and purine deoxyribonucleosides, suggesting that there is more than one substrate binding site on the kinase. These studies show that, in lymphoblasts and myeloblasts, purine deoxyribonucleosides and their analogues are phosphorylated by dCyd kinase, Ado kinase, and dGuo kinase.","['Sarup, J C', 'Fridland, A']","['Sarup JC', 'Fridland A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '0 (Pyrimidine Nucleosides)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.113 (deoxyguanosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.20 (Adenosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.76 (deoxyadenosine kinase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Kinase/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Mitochondria/enzymology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', '*Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)', 'Purine Nucleosides/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidine Nucleosides/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",1987/01/27 00:00,1987/01/27 00:01,['1987/01/27 00:00'],"['1987/01/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/27 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/27 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1987 Jan 27;26(2):590-7. doi: 10.1021/bi00376a034.,"['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33017/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['10.1021/bi00376a034 [doi]'],,,,,,,

An extra sequence ""pX"" in the HTLV-1 genome codes for three proteins, p40x-, p27x- and p21x-, and the p40x- is trans-activator of transcription from the viral LTR. A sequence of 21 bp repeats in the LTR was found to be an enhancer and respond to the trans-activation by p40x-. The transient expression of p40x- also activates a cellular gene for interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R) in helper T-cell lines. This induction of IL-2R may explain the mechanism of preferential growth of HTLV-1 infected cells and may be an early event of ATL development. For practical purposes, the env gene fragments was expressed in E. coli as fusion proteins with beta-galactosidase. Using these fusion proteins, a diagnostic system detecting anti-env antibodies was developed. Immunization of monkeys with these envelope-fusion proteins protected the monkeys from the viral infection, suggesting possible usage of envelope proteins as vaccine.","['Yoshida, M', 'Fujisawa, J', 'Inoue, J', 'Seiki, M']","['Yoshida M', 'Fujisawa J', 'Inoue J', 'Seiki M']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,AIDS Res,AIDS research,8310361,"['0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics/pathogenicity', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genes, Viral', 'Haplorhini', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Rabbits', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Viral Vaccines/immunology/isolation & purification']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,AIDS Res. 1986 Dec;2 Suppl 1:S71-8.,,,,,,,,,,

A pooled feline serum sample was used as the chemoattractant. Chemotaxis was evaluated in 5 groups of cats: group 1-specific-pathogen-free cats that had not been exposed to feline leukemia virus (FeLV); group 2-previremic, FeLV-infected, specific-pathogen-free cats; group 3-FeLV-viremic, subclinically affected cats; group 4-FeLV-viremic, clinically affected cats; and group 5-sick cats that were not infected with FeLV. Neutrophils from the viremic, clinically affected cats had significantly lower (P less than 0.025) chemotactic responses than did those from subclinically affected, viremic cats.

Two of the viruses, GALV-SEATO and GALV-San Francisco (GALV-SF), are associated with myeloid and lymphocytic leukemias, respectively, in apes. Using an assay based on the transient expression of the bacterial gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), we examined the transcriptional activity of GALV-SEATO and GALV-SF. The results suggest that high level expression of GALV is due primarily to cis-acting enhancer sequences. Sequence delineation analysis of GALV-SEATO showed the GALV-SEATO enhancer sequences to be located within a 45-bp tandem repeat in GALV-SEATO. GALV-SF, which has two- to fivefold lower transcriptional activity, contains only a single copy of the 45-bp element with 6-bp differences from those in the GALV-SEATO enhancer element. This 45-bp element is highly homologous to sequences within the LTRs of several murine leukemia viruses but has not been examined for enhancer function in these retroviruses. Expression of GALV was not restricted to hematopoietic cells but was extraordinarily high in MLA 144 cells, a gibbon ape T-cell line known to be infected with GALV-SF. However, expression of constructs containing the CAT gene directed by GALV-SEATO LTR sequences was similar in uninfected and GALV-infected fibroblasts, indicating the lack of virally encoded or virally induced trans-activating factors capable of increasing expression in these cells.","['Holbrook, N J', 'Gulino, A', 'Ruscetti, F']","['Holbrook NJ', 'Gulino A', 'Ruscetti F']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/genetics', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genes, Bacterial', '*Genes, Regulator', '*Genes, Viral', 'Hylobates', 'Plasmids', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1987 Mar;157(1):211-9. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(87)90330-8.,,,"['0042-6822(87)90330-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0042-6822(87)90330-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,

Many countries now require a blood test for serum antibodies to BLV as a precondition of shipment from certain endemic countries. Those cattle positive for BLV are excluded from shipment. Well-documented cases of shipments of hundreds of Canadian cattle without testing for BLV has been obtained. These shipments were to the African country of Malawi where the BLV status is unknown. Also, although the United States is endemic for BLV, most of the recent live cattle exports were received by countries which did not require a blood test for BLV. Of the 44 countries that imported U.S. cattle during 1982 and 1983, only 13 required BLV antibody testing before shipment. This report concerns one disease in one species.

Where functional studies have been performed, these retroviral oncogenes show synergy for in vitro transformation and leukaemogenesis. In naturally occurring feline leukaemias associated with feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), retroviral transduction of myc is a frequent oncogenic mechanism. But evidence suggesting that the FeLV v-myc genes might be insufficient for leukaemogenesis was provided by the latency (12 weeks) and clonality of FeLV/v-myc-induced tumours and the absence of demonstrable in vitro transformation by these viruses. In the search for secondary leukaemogenic events in FeLV/v-myc tumours, we have identified a case of FeLV transduction of a T-cell antigen receptor beta-chain gene.

Hennessy and E. Kieff, Science 227:1230-1240, 1985). The nucleotide sequence of the EBNA2 mRNA (J. Sample, M. Hummel, D. Braun, M. Birkenbach, and E. Kieff, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:5096-5100, 1986) revealed that it begins with a 924-base open reading frame that has an unusual potential translational initiation site (CAAATGG). This open reading frame is followed by 138 nucleotides with only one highly unlikely translational initiation site (TACATGC), which would translate a pentapeptide before the next stop codon. The last part of the mRNA is the open reading frame which encodes EBNA2. In this paper, we demonstrate that the 924-base open reading frame translates a 40-kilodalton protein in vitro or in murine cells transfected with the EBNA2 cDNA under control of the murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat. A protein of identical size was detected in EBV-transformed, latently infected human lymphocyte nuclei by using antibody specific for the leader open reading frame expressed in bacteria. Therefore, this is a rare example of a mRNA which translates two proteins from nonoverlapping open reading frames. Since the protein encoded by the leader of the EBNA mRNA is expressed in all nuclei of a latently infected cell line, it was designated EBNA-LP. EBNA-LP localizes to small intranuclear particles and differs in this respect from EBNA1, EBNA2, or EBNA3. EBNA-LP is not expressed in an EBV-transformed marmoset lymphocyte cell (B95-8) or in one EBV-infected Burkitt tumor cell line (Raji) but is expressed in three other Burkitt tumor cell lines (Namalwa, P3HR-1, and Daudi).","['Wang, F', 'Petti, L', 'Braun, D', 'Seung, S', 'Kieff, E']","['Wang F', 'Petti L', 'Braun D', 'Seung S', 'Kieff E']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Nucleoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Genes', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Nucleoproteins/*genetics', 'Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1987 Apr;61(4):945-54. doi: 10.1128/JVI.61.4.945-954.1987.,"['AI 07099/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17281/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 19264/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['10.1128/JVI.61.4.945-954.1987 [doi]'],,PMC254049,,,,,

To identify the viral sequences responsible for induction of these tumors, we constructed recombinant viruses by exchanging genomic segments of molecularly cloned RPV with those of a subgroup A leukosis virus, UR2AV. The ability to induce rapid lung tumors segregated only with the env sequences of RPV; the long terminal repeat of RPV was not required. However, recombinants carrying both env and long terminal repeat sequences of RPV induced lung tumors with a shorter latency. In several cases, recombinant viruses exhibited pathogenic properties differing from those of either parental virus. Recombinants carrying the gag-pol region of RPV and the env gene of UR2AV induced a high incidence of a muscle lesion termed infiltrative intramuscular fibromatosis. One recombinant, EU-8, which carries the gag-pol and LTR sequences of RPV, and the env gene of UR2AV, induced lymphoid leukosis after an unusually short latent period.

Besmer, W. D. Hardy, E. E. Zuckerman, P. J. Bergold, L. Lederman, and H. W. Snyder, Nature (London) 303:825-828, 1983). The nucleotide sequence of the abl segment in the HZ2-FeSV genome was determined and compared with the murine and human v-abl and c-abl sequences. The predicted transforming protein consists of 344 amino acids (aa) of FeLV gag origin, 439 aa of abl origin, and at least 200 aa of FeLV pol origin (p110gag-abl-pol). The 1,317-base-pair HZ2-FeSV v-abl segment (fv-abl) corresponds to 5' abl sequences which include the region known to specify the protein kinase domain. The 5' 189 base pairs of fv-abl correspond to 5' c-abl sequences not contained in Abelson murine leukemia virus (MuLV) v-abl. The mouse c-abl exon which contains these segments was identified, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of fv-abl with those of Abelson MuLV v-abl and c-abl revealed five aa differences. The 5' junction between FeLV and abl was found to involve a preferred region in FeLV gag p30 (P. Besmer, J. E. Murphy, P. C. George, F. H. Qiu, P. J. Bergold, L. Lederman, H. W. Snyder, D. Brodeur, E. E. Zuckerman, and W. D. Hardy, Nature (London) 320:415-421, 1986). A six-base homology exists at the recombination site between the parental FeLV and the c-abl sequences. The 3' junction between fv-abl and FeLV pol predicts an in-frame fusion of fv-abl and FeLV pol. A transformed cell line containing a truncated gag-abl-pol protein, p85, that lacks most of the FeLV pol sequences was obtained by transfection of NIH 3T3 mouse cells. This result implies that the pol sequences of the p110gag-abl-pol protein are dispensable for fibroblast transformation. To assess whether the fv-abl segment specifies the unique biological properties of HZ2-FeSV, we constructed a Moloney MuLV-based version of HZ2-FeSV, Mo-MuLV(fv-abl), in which the fv-abl sequences were contained in a genetic context similar to that in HZ2-FeSV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Bergold, P J', 'Blumenthal, J A', ""D'Andrea, E"", 'Snyder, H W', 'Lederman, L', 'Silverstone, A', 'Nguyen, H', 'Besmer, P']","['Bergold PJ', 'Blumenthal JA', ""D'Andrea E"", 'Snyder HW', 'Lederman L', 'Silverstone A', 'Nguyen H', 'Besmer P']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Gene Products, gag', 'Genes', '*Genes, Viral', 'Mink', '*Oncogenes', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Feline/*genetics', 'Viral Proteins/genetics']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1987 Apr;61(4):1193-202. doi: 10.1128/JVI.61.4.1193-1202.1987.,"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['10.1128/JVI.61.4.1193-1202.1987 [doi]'],,PMC254081,,,,['GENBANK/M15805'],

The region of Dsi-1 immediately 3' to the insertions cross-hybridized with human and chicken DNA, indicating that it contains highly conserved sequences. No evidence could be found for the expression of this highly conserved region. Dsi-1 was mapped to mouse chromosome 4. This location demonstrates that Dsi-1 is different from 16 of the known proto-oncogenes (c-abl, c-erbA c-erbB, c-ets-1, c-ets-2, c-fes, c-fos, c-myb, c-myc, c-raf, A-raf, c-Ha-ras, c-Ki-ras, N-ras, c-sis, and c-src) and 12 cellular regions of tumor-associated integrations in retrovirus-induced tumors (c-erbB, Fis-1, int-1, int-2, Mis-1/pvt-1, Mlvi-1, Mlvi-2, c-mos, c-myb, c-myc, Pim-1, and c-Ha-ras). Hybridization experiments indicated that Dsi-1 is probably different from five additional proto-oncogenes (c-fgr, c-fms, c-mos, neu, and c-yes) and from two additional frequent integration regions (lck and Mlvi-3).","['Vijaya, S', 'Steffen, D L', 'Kozak, C', 'Robinson, H L']","['Vijaya S', 'Steffen DL', 'Kozak C', 'Robinson HL']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*DNA Transposable Elements', '*Genes, Viral', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Rats', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Thymoma/genetics/*microbiology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/genetics/*microbiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1987 Apr;61(4):1164-70. doi: 10.1128/JVI.61.4.1164-1170.1987.,"['CA-27223/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-30674/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-12708/PHS HHS/United States']",,['10.1128/JVI.61.4.1164-1170.1987 [doi]'],,PMC254077,,,,,

Plasmids containing LTRs of several murine leukemia viruses linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene were tested in transient assays to measure relative rates of transcriptional activity in different types of hematopoietic cells. LTRs of the thymomagenic viruses SL3-3, Moloney leukemia virus, and a Moloney mink cell focus-forming virus all expressed to higher levels than other LTRs in T-lymphocyte cell lines. Conversely, the LTRs of Friend leukemia virus and a polycythemic spleen focus-forming virus expressed to higher levels than other LTRs in erythroleukemia cells. The LTR of nonleukemogenic Akv virus induced a relatively low level of activity compared with the others in all cells tested. Thus the relative level of LTR-driven expression in various types of cells corresponds to the type of tumor caused by the intact virus in vivo. These results provide direct evidence that the tissue specificity of the transcriptional activity of LTRs plays a critical role in determining the target cell for retroviral oncogenesis.","['Short, M K', 'Okenquist, S A', 'Lenz, J']","['Short MK', 'Okenquist SA', 'Lenz J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Plasmids', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1987 Apr;61(4):1067-72. doi: 10.1128/JVI.61.4.1067-1072.1987.,"['P30-CA13330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA09060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['10.1128/JVI.61.4.1067-1072.1987 [doi]'],,PMC254064,,,,,

Infection resulted in the production of antiviral antibody in the recipients, with no evidence of viremia or clinical disease. However, persistent low-level virus replication was detectable in the spleens of these mice as long as 8 months after initial infection. External secretions, including saliva, semen, and uterine secretions from viremic mice contained high concentrations of infectious virus. Nevertheless, transmission occurred only from viremic males to either males or females. Male-to-male transmission appeared to occur by parenteral inoculation of infectious saliva during fighting behavior. Evidence is presented that infection of females was by the venereal route. Of four mouse strains examined, NFS/N, IRW, and C57L females were all susceptible to venereal infection, whereas AKR mice were not. Since AKR mice are susceptible to infection by WM-E administered parenterally, this resistance appeared to be mediated by local viral interference due to the high-level expression of endogenous Akv gp70 within the female reproductive tract. Although both WM-E and F-MuLV were transmitted from viremic males to females, infection by WM-E was significantly more efficient than that by F-MuLV. This difference correlated with a distinct difference in cellular tropism of WM-E and F-MuLV within the epididymis of viremic males. F-MuLV gp70 was expressed only within stromal elements, whereas WM-E gp70 was seen largely within the epithelial lining cells and luminal contents of the duct. No evidence of virus expression within germ cells was observed. The possible influence of virus expression by epithelial cells of the female reproductive tract on infection of embryos is discussed.","['Portis, J L', 'McAtee, F J', 'Hayes, S F']","['Portis JL', 'McAtee FJ', 'Hayes SF']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Replication', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/microbiology/*transmission', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Pregnancy', 'Retroviridae/pathogenicity', 'Retroviridae Infections/*transmission', 'Saliva/microbiology', 'Semen/microbiology', 'Uterus/microbiology', 'Virus Replication']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1987 Apr;61(4):1037-44. doi: 10.1128/JVI.61.4.1037-1044.1987.,,,['10.1128/JVI.61.4.1037-1044.1987 [doi]'],,PMC254060,,,,,

The heavy chain of myeloperoxidase, consisting of 467 amino acids, was located on the COOH terminus half of the protein. The RNA specified by the cDNA was prepared using SP6 RNA polymerase and translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, and the product was identified as human myeloperoxidase by immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-human myeloperoxidase antibody. By Northern hybridization analysis of RNA from leukemic cells, it was shown that myeloperoxidase mRNA is abundantly expressed in human promyelocytic HL-60 and mouse myeloid leukemia NFS-60 cells. Furthermore, the results of Southern hybridization analysis of human genomic DNA suggest that there are one or two genes for myeloperoxidase in the human haploid genome.","['Morishita, K', 'Kubota, N', 'Asano, S', 'Kaziro, Y', 'Nagata, S']","['Morishita K', 'Kubota N', 'Asano S', 'Kaziro Y', 'Nagata S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Peptide Fragments)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', '*Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Peptide Fragments/isolation & purification', 'Peroxidase/*genetics', 'Trypsin']",1987/03/15 00:00,1987/03/15 00:01,['1987/03/15 00:00'],"['1987/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Mar 15;262(8):3844-51.,,,['S0021-9258(18)61433-4 [pii]'],,,,,,['GENBANK/J02694'],

A phase II study of Cancer and Leukemia Group B.,263-6,"Recurrent or persistent small-cell carcinoma of the lung (SCCL) after chemotherapy (CT) alone has shown a poor response to conventional salvage radiotherapy (RT). Accelerated RT is judged more effective than conventional RT for rapidly growing tumors such as SCCL. The objectives of this study were: to determine the tolerability of accelerated RT; and to test the ability of accelerated RT plus CT to achieve local tumor control (LTC) of SCCL recurrent after CT. Patients whose localized tumor was not controlled were selected from Arm III of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) protocol 8083 (Proc. ASCO 2:230, 1984) as eligible for this study. The program of accelerated RT consisted of the delivery of 50.1 Gray (Gy) in 30 fractions over a period of 21 days to the chest. New chemotherapy different from the first began 2 weeks after the completion of RT and was repeated every 3 weeks for 18 months (M). Of 29 potentially eligible patients with locally recurrent SCCL after the first line CT alone from Arm III of the CALBG protocol 8083, 12 were enrolled initially in this study. The analysis of LTC included 11 patients excluding one patient who died 4 weeks after the start of RT from liver metastases. The LTC achieved was as follow: complete remission in 8/11 (72%) and partial remission in 3/11 patients. None of the patients was converted to CR by subsequent chemotherapy. Survival ranged from 2 to 20 M, with a median survival time of 6 M. Tolerance to the subsequent CT, normal tissue reaction to accelerated RT, and the theoretical advantage of accelerated RT over conventional RT for SCCL were evaluated.","['Choi, N C', 'Propert, K', 'Carey, R', 'Eaton, W', 'Leone, L A', 'Silberfarb, P', 'Green, M']","['Choi NC', 'Propert K', 'Carey R', 'Eaton W', 'Leone LA', 'Silberfarb P', 'Green M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy/*radiotherapy']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1987 Feb;13(2):263-6. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(87)90137-4.,"['CA-02599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-11789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28562/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,"['0360-3016(87)90137-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(87)90137-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,

One such rearrangement results in replacement of the initially expressed variable region gene by a site-specific join between the open reading frame of a LINE-1 repetitive element and a remaining JH segment. We discuss this event in the context of the 'accessibility' model of recombinase control, and with respect to similar rearrangements involved in oncogene activation. In another subclone of the same pre-B cell line, altered heavy chain expression resulted from a mu to gamma 2b class switch recombination which occurred by a recombination-deletion mechanism but involved a complex inversion. We provide evidence that the germline gamma 2b region is specifically expressed in pre-B cell lines and early in normal development.

One to 10 microM camptothecin induced DNA single-strand, but not double-strand, breaks when incubated with intact cells or with their isolated nuclei. Approximately one half of the strand breakage was protein concealed, as judged by filter elution. Camptothecin-induced, protein-concealed DNA strand breaks disappeared rapidly after drug removal. DNA-protein cross-links were generated by camptothecin with frequencies approximately equal to those of protein-concealed DNA strand breaks. It is likely that camptothecin can inhibit topoisomerase I in intact cells in a manner similar to that in which other antineoplastic agents such as amsacrine or teniposide inhibit topoisomerase II. DNA-breaking lesions other than those resulting from trapped topoisomerase I-DNA complexes may also be generated by camptothecin. The yields of DNA strand breaks induced by camptothecin, amsacrine, or teniposide were approximately doubled when cells were incubated for 16 h with 3-aminobenzamide, an inhibitor of poly(ADP ribosylation) of proteins, prior to 1-h exposure to the antineoplastic compounds. 3-Aminobenzamide also enhanced the cytotoxic action of camptothecin, amsacrine, and teniposide.

According to this hypothesis viral cancers should be contagious, polyclonal, and preventable by immunization. However, retroviruses are rather widespread in healthy animals and humans where they typically cause latent infections and antiviral immunity. The leukemia risk of such infections is less than 0.1% and thus about as low as that of virus-free controls. Indeed retroviruses are not sufficient to initiate transformation because of the low percentage of symptomatic virus carriers and the complete lack of transforming function in vitro; because of the striking discrepancies between the long latent periods of 0.5 to 10 years for carcinogenesis and the short eclipse of days to weeks for virus replication and direct pathogenic and immunogenic effects; because there is no gene with a late transforming function, since all genes are essential for replication; because host genes, which do not inhibit virus, inhibit tumorigenesis up to 100% if intact and determine the nature of the tumor if defective; and above all because of the monoclonal origin of viral leukemias, defined by viral integration sites that are different in each tumor. On these bases the probability that a virus-infected cell will become transformed is estimated to be about 10(-11). The viruses are also not necessary to maintain transformation, since many animal and all bovine and human tumors do not express viral antigens or RNA or contain only incomplete proviruses. Thus as carcinogens retroviruses do not necessarily fulfill Koch's first postulate and do not or only very rarely (10(-11)) fulfill the third. Therefore it has been proposed that retroviruses transform inefficiently by activating latent cellular oncogenes by for example provirus integration. This predicts diploid tumors with great diversity, because integration sites are different in each tumor. However, the uniformity of different viral and even nonviral tumors of the same lineage, their common susceptibility to the same tumor resistance genes, and transformation-specific chromosome abnormalities shared with non-viral tumors each argue for cellular transforming genes. Indeed clonal chromosome abnormalities are the only known transformation-specific determinants of viral tumors. Since tumors originate with these abnormalities, these or associated events, rather than preexisting viruses, must initiate transformation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Duesberg, P H']",['Duesberg PH'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['0 (Viral Proteins)'],IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/etiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Deltaretrovirus/pathogenicity', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Haplorhini', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*etiology/genetics/prevention & control', 'Oncogenes', 'Probability', 'Retroviridae/*pathogenicity', 'Risk', 'Time Factors', 'Viral Proteins/pharmacology', 'Virus Replication']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Mar 1;47(5):1199-220.,['CA-39915A-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],278,,,,,,,,

A similar response of sensitive and resistant lines occurred after exposure to rTNF-beta. The clonogenic cells were more sensitive than the overall population to the action of rTNF alpha, and prolonged exposure was necessary for manifestation of the effect. Concomitant exposure to recombinant interferon-alpha (rIFN-alpha) increased the response of two cell lines to rTNF-alpha, but no clear synergistic action could be demonstrated. The addition of rIFN-gamma was without effect. Variations in the rTNF-alpha-induced proliferative response could not be explained by differences in the number of binding sites per cell or their affinity for rTNF-alpha.

Our studies were designed to determine whether feline leukemia virus contained calmodulin. Accordingly, we tested purified feline leukemia virus for the presence of calmodulin-like activity. The virus, like authentic calmodulin, activated cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase. The ability of the virus to activate the enzyme was blocked in the presence of the known calmodulin inhibitors trifluoperazine and W-7. This indirect evidence for the presence of calmodulin was confirmed by radioimmunoassay. Several other retroviruses were also tested using radioimmunoassay and found to contain calmodulin.

The myeloid-differentiated HL60 cells respond to LTB4 by raising their [Ca2+]i with a dose-response relationship similar to that shown by normal human neutrophils. The observations of the LTB4 transduction mechanism were compared with those of the transduction mechanism of the chemotactic peptide fMet-Leu-Phe in HL60 cells differentiated with dimethyl sulphoxide. Both LTB4 and fMet-Leu-Phe triggered a rapid (less than 5 s) elevation of [Ca2+]i, which occurred in parallel with the InsP3 production from myo-[3H]inositol-labelled cells. The threshold concentrations of the agonists, for InsP3 production, were found at 10(-9) M, a slightly higher concentration than that required to detect [Ca2+]i elevations. No significant changes were noted in the phosphoinositide levels upon stimulation with LTB4. Exposure to Bordetella pertussis toxin before LTB4 stimulation abolished both the increased formation of InsP3 and the rise of [Ca2+]i. LTB4 and fMet-Leu-Phe elicited elevations of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3] with no detectable lag time, followed by slower and more sustained inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate elevations. Stimulation with various leukotriene analogues revealed a good correlation between both total InsP3 as well as Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation and elevations of [Ca2+]1. Thus LTB4 receptor activation results in an increased production of Ins(1,4,5)P3 via a transduction mechanism also involving a nucleotide regulatory protein, as previously described for the fMet-Leu-Phe transduction mechanism.","['Andersson, T', 'Schlegel, W', 'Monod, A', 'Krause, K H', 'Stendahl, O', 'Lew, D P']","['Andersson T', 'Schlegel W', 'Monod A', 'Krause KH', 'Stendahl O', 'Lew DP']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Sugar Phosphates)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate', 'Inositol Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Leukotriene B4/*pharmacology', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Phagocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Sugar Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1986 Dec 1;240(2):333-40. doi: 10.1042/bj2400333.,,,['10.1042/bj2400333 [doi]'],,PMC1147422,,,,,

At 4 degrees C myeloid differentiated, but not undifferentiated, monocytic differentiated or eosinophilic differentiated HL-60 cells display marked specific leukotriene B4 binding. Leukotriene B4 binding at 4 degrees C reaches a maximum within 10 min, is readily reversed by unlabelled leukotriene B4, and is stereospecific. Only molecules with structural and biological similarity to leukotriene B4 can competitively inhibit leukotriene B4 binding. Scatchard analysis at 4 degrees C in differentiated cells shows two classes of binding sites. The high affinity sites have a Kd of 0.27 nM and a Bmax of 14.8 fmoles/10(7) cells; the low affinity sites have a Kd of 0.58 microM and a Bmax of 2453 fmoles/10(7) cells. The appearance of specific leukotriene B4 binding sites in the myeloid differentiated cells correlates with their ability to chemotax in response to leukotriene B4. Undifferentiated cells do not chemotax to leukotriene B4. At 37 degrees C leukotriene B4 is incorporated into phospholipid and triglyceride species in both undifferentiated and myeloid differentiated HL-60 cells making binding studies at 37 degrees C in intact cells impossible. Interestingly, incubation of the cells with cyclooxygenase inhibitors during differentiation enhances receptor density. No evidence of omega-hydroxylase activity was found in HL-60 cells.

The chi gene product, p chi, transcriptionally transactivates the viral long repeat (LTR), and is thus a positive regulator. To investigate p chi transactivation, sequences from the U3 regions of the LTRs of HTLV-I and -II were inserted into the Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) LTR by recombinant DNA techniques. Transient expression assays of the chimeric LTRs indicated that the HTLV sequences conferred to the M-MuLV LTR responsiveness to HTLV p chi protein. M-MuLV enhancers were not required for function of the chimeric LTRs. Infectious recombinant M-MuLVs containing chimeric LTRs were also generated.

The incidence of fatal fungal infections was significantly higher among patients given ketoconazole than among those given itraconazole (P = .02); this trend was especially evident with fatal infections due to Aspergillus (P = .0045). The level of protection from fatal fungal infection afforded by itraconazole was highly significant among patients who were granulocytopenic for more than 25 days (P less than .0001) and among patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P = .008). Failures of prophylaxis with itraconazole may have been due to inadequate levels of drug in plasma.

The parental cell line 84.5, a deletion mutant of the 721 LCL cell line, can be induced to produce IL-1 activity when stimulated by certain inducers such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in the presence of fetal calf serum. From this parental 721/84.5 clone, a subclone, termed 3B6, has been developed. This 3B6 subclone has an immature B-cell phenotype, expresses only HLA class II DP subregion antigens, and spontaneously releases IL-1 in the culture supernatant with relatively few inhibitory molecules under serum-free culture conditions. The 3B6-derived IL-1 was purified from 3B6 conditioned medium with a three-step procedure. The molecular weight of this IL-1 is 13,500, and the isoelectric point values are pH 4.9 and 5.1 without any component focusing near pH 7. The N-terminal amino acid sequence differs markedly from those reported for the two IL-1 species produced by monocytes. The purified material shares several biological properties with monocyte IL-1, since it could induce the proliferation of murine thymocytes, the production of interleukin 2 by phytohemagglutinin-stimulated cloned HSB2 T cells, and the proliferation of human fibroblasts. However, this IL-1 activity could not be blocked by polyclonal anti-monocytic IL-1 antibodies, and, more importantly, it was not pyrogenic in rabbits. Finally, it promotes the growth of B-cell clones derived from the parental 721/84.5 lines in the absence of fetal calf serum, which suggests that it could act as an autocrine growth factor in this Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell line.","['Wakasugi, H', 'Rimsky, L', 'Mahe, Y', 'Kamel, A M', 'Fradelizi, D', 'Tursz, T', 'Bertoglio, J']","['Wakasugi H', 'Rimsky L', 'Mahe Y', 'Kamel AM', 'Fradelizi D', 'Tursz T', 'Bertoglio J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-1)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', '*Growth Substances', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis/pharmacology/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Molecular Weight']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Feb;84(3):804-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.84.3.804.,,,['10.1073/pnas.84.3.804 [doi]'],,PMC304304,,,,,

An analogous processing occurs in human rRNA. The mouse and human rRNA sequences are approximately equal to 80% conserved for 200 nucleotides on the 3' side of these processing sites, suggesting that this conserved region may be important in specifying the processing. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a systematic series of deletion mutants approaching the mouse rDNA processing region from both the 5' and 3' directions and analyzed the processing of their transcripts in vitro. The 5' boundary of the region required for processing is quite sharp and corresponds to the rRNA cleavage site at the 5' end of the conserved sequence region. The 3' boundary is more complex: The 3' deletions extending to between 250 and 130 nucleotides beyond the processing site cause about a 50% decrease in the amount of the processed RNA. A 3' deletion that extends to 109 nucleotides beyond the processing site greatly reduces the processing efficiency. Deletions to or beyond 91 nucleotides on the 3' side of the processing site virtually eliminate processing. Under altered ionic conditions, transcripts of 3' deletions extending to only 41 nucleotides beyond the processing site can still direct a low level of accurate processing. These results demonstrate that the mouse/human conserved sequence just on the 3' side of the primary rRNA processing site consists of several domains that direct and/or augment both the initial endonucleolytic cleavage and the closely coupled selective degradation of the upstream fragment that together constitute the primary rRNA processing event.","['Craig, N', 'Kass, S', 'Sollner-Webb, B']","['Craig N', 'Kass S', 'Sollner-Webb B']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Precursors)', '0 (RNA Precursors)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes/*metabolism', 'DNA, Ribosomal/*genetics', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Precursors/*genetics', 'RNA Precursors', 'RNA, Ribosomal/*genetics', 'Templates, Genetic', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Feb;84(3):629-33. doi: 10.1073/pnas.84.3.629.,,,['10.1073/pnas.84.3.629 [doi]'],,PMC304268,,,,['GENBANK/M15181'],

From this study, BL appears to cover a broad range of the B-cell differentiation sequence, since the following Ig phenotypes were observed: null cells (sIg-, cIg-), large pre-B-cells (intracytoplasmic mu-chains), small B-cells (sIg+, cIg-), and various types of secreting B-cells (sIg+, cIg+). Among the latter, various patterns of cIg could be defined (perinuclear, paranuclear, and vesicular). B-cell maturation stages were correlated with the amount of secreted Ig. In sIg+ cell lines, different classes of Ig were found: 35 IgM, 10 IgM plus IgD, 4 IgG, and 1 IgA. None of the different monoclonal antibodies used was specific to a precise stage of maturation. The stages of maturation were correlated with neither the type of chromosome translocations of BL nor the presence of EBV genome, but the most immature cell lines were all EBV positive and most of them originated from African patients.

We molecularly cloned the ecotropic MuLV envelope-related sequence from the genomic DNA of a wild mouse homozygous for the Akvr-1r locus. The cloned provirus was defective and contained a C-terminal end of the pol gene, a complete envelope gene, and a 3' long terminal repeat.

The 3' host flanking sequences of Fv-4r and Akvr-1r also had identical restriction maps. These findings indicate that Akvr-1r and Fv-4r are the same gene.

The results of these studies provide insights regarding differences in response to glucocorticoids dependent upon cell line and indicate that the glucocorticoid-responsive elements may compose one of the determinants of tissue specificity and pathogenicity of the murine retroviruses.","['Celander, D', 'Haseltine, W A']","['Celander D', 'Haseltine WA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Genes, Regulator/*drug effects', 'Genes, Viral/drug effects', 'HeLa Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/drug effects/*genetics', 'Plasmids', 'Progesterone/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Transfection']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1987 Feb;61(2):269-75. doi: 10.1128/JVI.61.2.269-275.1987.,,,['10.1128/JVI.61.2.269-275.1987 [doi]'],,PMC253946,,,,,

Thus, although carrying the required immune response gene(s) encoded by the H-2b haplotype and characteristic of responder strains such as C57BL/6, AKR.H-2b congenic mice failed to mount antiviral CTL responses. Young adult AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b ""doubly congenic"" mice, however, were able to generate specific anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL activity. These results demonstrated that the positive effect of MHC-encoded immune response gene control could be overcome by the action of the Fv-1n allele. The responder status of the B6.Fv-1n congenic, however, indicated that this Fv-1n-mediated inhibition was dependent on the interaction of Fv-1n with another gene(s) encoded by the AKR background. The results of experiments performed with AKXL recombinant inbred mice further suggested that a single additional genetic locus, encoding the Akv-1 provirus, was necessary along with Fv-1n to cause inhibition of antiviral CTL generation. Here we show that the responsiveness of AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice is dependent on their age. Thus, with moderate aging these doubly congenic mice converted to a nonresponder status with respect to anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL production: 85% of mice less than or equal to 9 wk of age responded compared with 0% of mice greater than 9 wk old. As with nonresponder AKR.H-2b mice, an inverse correlation was observed between CTL responsiveness and the expression of CTL-defined viral antigens by normal cells. Namely, spleen cells from young AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice showed little or no expression of such viral antigens, whereas with moderate aging there was a steady increase in their display. These results are discussed with reference to possible mechanisms of unresponsiveness of AKR.H-2b vs moderately aged AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice, and with respect to the utility of this system as a model for naturally occurring retrovirus infections and the interactions of retroviruses with the immune system.","['Green, W R']",['Green WR'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/*immunology', '*Aging', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Mar 1;138(5):1602-6.,"['CA-36860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43475/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Urethan-induced sleeping times observed following i.p. injection of urethan after 3 weeks of cadmium exposure were not affected by cadmium indicating that chronic cadmium exposure did not alter the elimination of urethan. Pulmonary adenoma formation which was evaluated 84 days later was not affected by cadmium. The size and number of tumors remained unchanged. This suggests that the immunosuppressive actions of cadmium do not influence urethan-induced adenoma formation. In the 280-day study, the effects of cadmium on the incidence of spontaneous murine lymphocytic leukemia was evaluated. Mortality from the leukemia virus was greater in the cadmium-exposed mice. Mice exposed to 10 or 50 ppm cadmium experienced 33% more deaths from the virus. The average time till death was unaffected. It appears that the immunosuppressive effects of cadmium impair immunosurveillance mechanisms that control expression of the murine lymphocytic leukemia virus.","['Blakley, B R']",['Blakley BR'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Appl Toxicol,Journal of applied toxicology : JAT,8109495,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '00BH33GNGH (Cadmium)', '3IN71E75Z5 (Urethane)']",IM,"['Adenoma/chemically induced', 'Animals', 'Cadmium/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Kidney/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/etiology/immunology', 'Lung Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*etiology', 'Sleep/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Urethane/metabolism/toxicity']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Appl Toxicol. 1986 Dec;6(6):425-9. doi: 10.1002/jat.2550060608.,,,['10.1002/jat.2550060608 [doi]'],,,,,,,

Maturation was induced by 0, 2, 4, or 6 days incubation with dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). In 0 day Me2SO HL-60 cells, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced phosphorylation of protein pp29 (Mr = 28,600) and to a lesser extent protein pp76 (Mr = 76,300). With increased time of Me2SO incubation, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced phosphorylation of pp212 (Mr = 211,800), pp134 (Mr = 134,200), and pp76, whereas the phosphorylation of pp29 did not change appreciably. In close agreement with this increase in protein phosphorylation was the observed increase in phorbol diester-induced superoxide anion formation. Morphological characterization of cells during Me2SO-induced differentiation reveals that these increases in phorbol diester responses are probably attributable to the proportional rise in metamyelocytes, band, and segmented neutrophils. A variety of phorbol diesters increased superoxide anion generation in HL-60 cells differentiated into granulocyte-like cells by 6-day incubation with Me2SO. The structure-activity relationship of these phorbol diester derivatives for protein phosphorylation was strongly correlated to their ability to increase superoxide anion generation. Thus, we propose that phorbol diester-induced phosphorylation of pp212, pp134, and pp76, but not pp29 may play a role in mediating the functional response of phorbol diester-induced superoxide anion generation in HL-60 cells differentiated into mature granulocyte-like cells.","['Gaut, J R', 'Carchman, R A']","['Gaut JR', 'Carchman RA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/isolation & purification', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Superoxides/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1987/01/15 00:00,1987/01/15 00:01,['1987/01/15 00:00'],"['1987/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Jan 15;262(2):826-34.,['ES03572/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,['S0021-9258(19)75861-X [pii]'],,,,,,,

The role of the Na+/H+ exchange system.,811-6,"Retinoic acid, which induces the differentiation of HL 60 cells to granulocytes, produces a cell alkalinization from pHi = 7.03 to pHi = 7.37. The half-maximum effect of retinoic acid is observed at 10 nM. The effect of retinoic acid on the pHi develops slowly, and it precedes the differentiation of the cells. A cell alkalinization is also observed after differentiation of the cells by dimethyl sulfoxide. It is not observed using etretinate, a synthetic retinoid that does not promote the differentiation of HL 60 cells. Two pHi regulating mechanisms coexist in HL 60 cells. The Na+/H+ exchange system is the major mechanism that allows HL 60 cells to recover from an intracellular acidosis. A second mechanism is a Na-HCO3 cotransport system. During differentiation of the cells by retinoic acid, a 2-fold increase in the activity of the Na+/H+ exchange system is observed, while the activity of the NaHCO3 cotransport remains constant. The properties of interaction of the Na+/H+ exchanger with internal H+, external Na+, and Li+ as well as with amiloride and its derivatives are defined. The Na+/H+ exchanger of HL 60 cells is characterized by unusually low affinities for alkali cations and a high affinity for amiloride and its derivatives. The pHi dependence of the exchanger is not modified after differentiation by retinoic acid. It is concluded that the mechanism of activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger by retinoic acid is distinct from the short-term effect produced by mitogens and phorbol esters which change the pHi dependence of the system.","['Ladoux, A', 'Cragoe, E J Jr', 'Geny, B', 'Abita, J P', 'Frelin, C']","['Ladoux A', 'Cragoe EJ Jr', 'Geny B', 'Abita JP', 'Frelin C']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9FN79X2M3F (Lithium)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Lithium/pharmacology', 'Sodium/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1987/01/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/01/15 00:00'],"['1987/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Jan 15;262(2):811-6.,,,['S0021-9258(19)75858-X [pii]'],,,,,,,

A general method for the quantitative analysis of differentiation inhibitors has been developed and used to compare the site of inhibition by lithium with that by vanadate. Lithium inhibits the commitment to differentiation (K 1/2 approximately 10 mM) induced by DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide) at non-toxic concentrations that have only a small effect on the rate of proliferation. Inhibition is reversible and probably requires entry of Li+ into the cell, since it is blocked by high KCl in the medium. LiCl is most effective when present during the first 10 h of DMSO treatment, before commitment is initiated. Computer-assisted analysis of the kinetics of commitment demonstrate that inhibition by lithium is best described by including a lithium-sensitive 'priming' event, which occurs with high probability prior to commitment.","['Zaricznyj, C', 'Macara, I G']","['Zaricznyj C', 'Macara IG']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '9FN79X2M3F (Lithium)', 'G4962QA067 (Lithium Chloride)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chlorides/*pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Lithium/*pharmacology', 'Lithium Chloride', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Stochastic Processes']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1987 Feb;168(2):402-10. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(87)90012-7.,,,['10.1016/0014-4827(87)90012-7 [doi]'],,,,,,,

The Vmax values for the hydrolysis of AMP by 5'-nucleotidase were two orders of magnitude greater than for the uptake of adenosine itself or the uptake of adenosine from AMP by normal lymphocytes. 5'-Nucleotidase activity is clearly not rate-limiting in normal lymphocytes for uptake of adenosine from AMP in steady state conditions.

In this study the potential role of oncogene activation in the development of both the spontaneous and MNU-induced thymomas in AKR mice has been examined by DNA transfection into NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts and by Southern analysis of tumour DNA. The results show that a high proportion of MNU-induced thymomas contain activated cellular rasK while no activated cellular ras genes were detected in spontaneous thymomas. Southern analysis of tumour DNA revealed that 2/30 spontaneous tumours and 2/52 MNU-induced tumours contained alterations in the c-myc gene while 5/29 spontaneous tumours and 6/56 MNU-induced tumours contained alterations in the Pim-1 gene. A more detailed analysis of the Pim-1 gene demonstrated that the alterations observed in most MNU-induced and spontaneous tumours resulted from proviral integration at the 3' end of this gene. Our analyses also demonstrated that the majority of MNU-induced tumours, including those containing rearrangements in the Pim-1 gene, lacked the somatically acquired recombinant MCF proviruses that are present in most spontaneous AKR lymphomas.

Antigen-induced macrophage migration inhibition factor and leukocyte migration inhibition factor production.,89-98,"OVA-specific T cells were immortalized by infection with radiation leukemia virus (RadLV). Some clones derived from such population were shown to exhibit helper activity. We then tested clones without such function and found among them some that secreted macrophage migration inhibition factor (MIF) and leukocyte migration inhibition factor (LIF) upon exposure to the antigen in vitro. The lymphokine-producing clones, which were Thy-1+, Ly-1+ and Ly-2-, did not secrete MIF and LIF constitutively. Like other antigen-specific T cells, the immortalized clones could not be stimulated by free soluble antigen but required macrophages for presentation and for triggering the lymphokine production. The antigen-activated clones exclusively produced MIF and LIF, but not interleukin 2 or colony-stimulating factor. They neither provided helper activity nor induced delayed-type hypersensitivity. The data suggest that the T-cell clones carry the antigen receptors and that their antigen-inducible biological function is restricted to the migration inhibitory factor production.","['Szigeti, R', 'Kagan-Haion, K', 'Klein, E', 'Ben-Sasson, S Z']","['Szigeti R', 'Kagan-Haion K', 'Klein E', 'Ben-Sasson SZ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Leukocyte Migration-Inhibitory Factors)', '0 (Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Clone Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Leukocyte Migration-Inhibitory Factors/metabolism', 'Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1986 Oct 1;102(1):89-98. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(86)90328-x.,['SR01 CA25250-5/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['0008-8749(86)90328-X [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(86)90328-x [doi]']",,,,,,,

The same DNA sequences appear to be responsible for induction of the genes in a T cell line, Jurkat, by mitogens.

We have studied the antileukemic activity in vitro, the cellular drug transport, and the molecular mechanism of action with DNA of this new compound. By agarose gel electrophoresis, we verified that nafidimide is an intercalating agent, through its alteration of the electrophoretic migration of DNA products produced by the relaxing action of DNA topoisomerase I. Concentrations of up to 100 microM of nafidimide did not produce topoisomerase I-mediated DNA cleavage. Nafidimide produced DNA single-strand breaks (SSB), double-strand breaks, and DNA-protein cross-links in human myeloid leukemia cells (measured with filter elution). The ratio of SSB/DNA-protein cross-links was 1.32 +/- 0.36, a value similar to that produced by 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA), suggesting that nafidimide, like m-AMSA, produced protein-associated DNA-strand breaks through a topoisomerase II-mediated reaction. The production of double-strand breaks by nafidimide also suggests the involvement of topoisomerase II in the drug-induced DNA cleavage. The cytotoxic activity of nafidimide was quantified in human myeloid leukemia cell lines differing by a factor of 70 in their cytotoxic sensitivity to m-AMSA. The m-AMSA-resistant line was less than 2-fold resistant to nafidimide. Cellular drug uptake was rapid and reached a steady state level in 30 min at 37 degrees C. At the end of exposure, drug egress was rapid, as was the disappearance of the DNA SSB. Rapid cellular uptake of nafidimide, with low retention at the end of exposure and rapid rejoining of DNA SSB suggest that prolonged cellular exposure may be necessary for optimal antitumor effect. In vitro cloning data suggest that nafidimide may be a therapeutic option for patients with leukemia resistant to m-AMSA.","['Andersson, B S', 'Beran, M', 'Bakic, M', 'Silberman, L E', 'Newman, R A', 'Zwelling, L A']","['Andersson BS', 'Beran M', 'Bakic M', 'Silberman LE', 'Newman RA', 'Zwelling LA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Imides)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Naphthalimides)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '1Q8D39N37L (amonafide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine', 'Amsacrine/toxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'DNA/*drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/toxicity', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Humans', '*Imides', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Intercalating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Isoquinolines/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mathematics', 'Naphthalimides', 'Organophosphonates']",1987/02/15 00:00,1987/02/15 00:01,['1987/02/15 00:00'],"['1987/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Feb 15;47(4):1040-4.,"['CA-01135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-40090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

In the subgenus Mus, 7 of the 8 most distant species had no OIF, whereas all the ancestral species and subspecies of the laboratory mouse (Mus musculus musculus, Mus musculus domesticus), including a more distant member (Mus musculus cookii), had ample titers of OIF. A new separation technique was devised so that potential virus-neutralizing immunoglobulins could be separated by electrophoresis from OIF in small-volume serum samples. Active OIF was recovered from serum high-density lipoprotein, from very-low-density lipoprotein, as well as from chylomicron fractions. Murine sarcoma virus pseudotypes were made with several available exotic MuLV types. These pseudotype MuLVs were not susceptible to standard OIF preparations. The sera of exotic mice also had no factor analogous to OIF which would inactivate their own homologous or heterologous exotic MuLVs. It appears that, with one exception, OIF activity is limited to two subspecies of M. musculus and may be correlated in these subspecies with the presence of endogenous xenotropic MuLVs.","['Nara, P L', 'Dunlop, N M', 'Robey, W G', 'Callahan, R', 'Fischinger, P J']","['Nara PL', 'Dunlop NM', 'Robey WG', 'Callahan R', 'Fischinger PJ']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Lipoproteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*drug effects', 'Lipoproteins/*blood/isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Muridae', 'Phylogeny', 'Species Specificity']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Feb 1;47(3):667-72.,,,,,,,,,,

Both FLC (clones No. 745) and F(+) (Ostertag F4N) Friend erythroleukemia cells can be induced to differentiate and to produce hemoglobin when exposed to DMSO. Clone R(3) (Ostertag F4-D5-1) is a DMSO-resistant clone when grown under normal conditions (15% serum) but could undergo differentiation with accumulation of protoporphyrin IX upon induction with DMSO when grown in low serum concentration (2.5% serum). Electron spin resonance measurements of the order parameters (S) and S(T parallel) demonstrate that R(3) has a more fluid plasma membrane than the FLC and F(+). The order parameters of the outer hyperfine splittings S(T parallel) at 37 degrees C are 0.60 +/- 0.009, 0.62 +/- 0.008 and 0.64 +/- 0.009 for R(3), F(+) and FLC, respectively. We have used the insulin receptors as a model for a polypeptide hormone receptor associated with the plasma membrane of the Friend clones. Insulin binding studies demonstrated that the receptor of R(3) had a decreased affinity for insulin manifest as a 10-fold increase in the amount of insulin required to compete for half of the tracer binding (18 nM for R(3) vs. 2 nM for FLC and F(+)). Computer-fit Scatchard plot analysis by the negative cooperativity model reveal that R(3) possessed a similar number of sites/cell (about 70,000) as the FLC or F(+) cells, with similar high and low affinities. Growing the DMSO-resistant clone R(3) in low serum concentration caused a decrease in receptor number by 35%, and an increase in receptor affinity to that seen with the differentiable clones. Thus, the abnormal properties of the plasma membrane and insulin receptor of the DMSO-resistant clone in our earlier report (Simon et al. (1984) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 803, 39-47) were partially reversed by growing the cells in a low serum concentration, restoring the cellular response to the differentiation agent.","['Simon, I', 'Brown, T J', 'Ginsberg, B H']","['Simon I', 'Brown TJ', 'Ginsberg BH']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Insulin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Physiological Phenomena', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Insulin/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', '*Membrane Fluidity', 'Membrane Lipids/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptor, Insulin/metabolism']",1987/01/26 00:00,1987/01/26 00:01,['1987/01/26 00:00'],"['1987/01/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/26 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1987 Jan 26;896(2):165-72. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(87)90176-3.,"['AM21084/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM21128/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM28516/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0005-2736(87)90176-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(87)90176-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,

After in-vitro stimulation with various agents including TPA, gamma interferon and colony stimulating factor, the purified blast cells of all cases of AML tested (10 of 10) showed high levels (50-90% cells positive) of IL-2R expression. Granulocytic cells from the promyelocyte stage onwards lacked IL-2R both before and after in-vitro stimulation. In contrast, leukaemic promonocytes and normal peripheral monocytes expressed IL-2R both before and after stimulation. The receptors were detected with two different monoclonal antibodies (anti-Tac and 4H3--both IgG 2a antibodies) by indirect rosetting. In selected experiments, results were confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and by the APAAP technique. Normal monocytes possessed only small amounts of IL-2R since positivity was clearly detectable only by the indirect rosette assay. Irrelevant IgG 2a first-layer and second-layer-only controls were always negative. The endogenous nature of the IL-2 receptors was demonstrated by re-expression after capping and shedding. That the antigens detected were true IL-2R was confirmed by the fact that monoclonal antibody staining was blocked by recombinant IL-2. The restricted expression of IL-2R on early granulocytic and on monocytoid cells raises the possibility that IL-2 is important in the proliferation of these cell types.","['Armitage, R J', 'Lai, A P', 'Roberts, P J', 'Cawley, J C']","['Armitage RJ', 'Lai AP', 'Roberts PJ', 'Cawley JC']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Granulocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Neutrophils/immunology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1986 Dec;64(4):799-807. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1986.tb02242.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1986.tb02242.x [doi]'],,,,,,,

Hemorrhagic cystitis occurring late after BMT is unlikely to be due to the effects of this conditioning, and probably has an infective etiology. Three patients undergoing BMT for chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL) developed terminal dysuria and hematuria at 38, 56, and 149 days post-BMT. Electron microscopy (EM) of urine voided at these times revealed large numbers of papovavirions, which were subsequently identified as BK virus. Urine samples inoculated onto human embryonic lung fibroblasts induced infection of the cells and replication of the virus as detected by EM of tissue culture fluid. Urine from one of these patients was examined by standard cytological techniques, and EM of urothelial cells showed nuclear inclusions consisting of nonencapsulated virus particles of diameter 40 nm, consistent with papovavirus. Five further patients were found to be excreting BK virus without symptoms of cystitis, although one of these patients did experience abnormalities of liver function that were otherwise unexplained. BK virus has already been implicated in hepatic dysfunction posttransplant, and in cystitis in nonimmunosuppressed children. We postulate that it may also be involved in the etiology of late hemorrhagic cystitis after BMT.","['Apperley, J F', 'Rice, S J', 'Bishop, J A', 'Chia, Y C', 'Krausz, T', 'Gardner, S D', 'Goldman, J M']","['Apperley JF', 'Rice SJ', 'Bishop JA', 'Chia YC', 'Krausz T', 'Gardner SD', 'Goldman JM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'BK Virus/immunology/pathogenicity', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cystitis/*etiology/microbiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Polyomavirus/immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Time Factors', 'Urine/microbiology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 1987 Jan;43(1):108-12. doi: 10.1097/00007890-198701000-00024.,,,['10.1097/00007890-198701000-00024 [doi]'],,,,,,,

Our cytogenetic analysis of one such cell line, SUP-T3, demonstrates that the breakpoints on chromosomes 7 and 9 lie within bands q36 and q34, respectively, corresponding to the location of the gene encoding the beta chain of the T-cell receptor, TCRB, and the gene homologous to the transforming gene of the Abelson murine leukemia virus, ABL. We investigated the role of these genes in the t(7;9). In situ chromosomal hybridization of TCRB and ABL probes to metaphase cells from SUP-T3 demonstrated that ABL is translocated from chromosome 9 to 7 and that all or part of TCRB is translocated from chromosome 7 to 9. Southern blot analysis revealed that both TCRB alleles were rearranged; however, it could not be determined whether the translocation breakpoint lies within this gene. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and Southern blot analysis were used to examine more than 500 kilobases of the ABL locus; we concluded that there are no rearrangements within 250 kb in either direction of the sequences homologous to v-abl. Additionally, no abnormal ABL protein was detected in an in vitro phosphorylation assay. These results indicate that, in SUP-T3, the breakpoint on chromosome 9 lies proximal to ABL and that the break results in no apparent alteration of the ABL protein. We therefore hypothesize that another gene on chromosome 9, at band q34, plays a role in this translocation. This study also demonstrates that pulsed-field gel electrophoresis is a powerful new tool for the analysis of human chromosomal translocations.","['Westbrook, C A', 'Rubin, C M', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Kaminer, L S', 'Smith, S D', 'Rowley, J D', 'Diaz, M O']","['Westbrook CA', 'Rubin CM', 'Le Beau MM', 'Kaminer LS', 'Smith SD', 'Rowley JD', 'Diaz MO']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Child', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Jan;84(1):251-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.84.1.251.,"['CA-16910/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-07190/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,['10.1073/pnas.84.1.251 [doi]'],,PMC304181,,,,,

Using a reverse hemolytic plaque assay, both the viable virus and the UV-inactivated feline leukemia virus, but not the CKS-17, activated B lymphocytes to secrete IgG. When staphylococcal protein A, a polyclonal B-cell activator, was used to stimulate IgG synthesis by feline lymphocytes, the viable virus, the UV-inactivated virus, and the CKS-17 peptide each strongly suppressed IgG secretion without compromising viability of the lymphocytes.

We have established clonal cell lines from these tumors and have shown that they all express markers characteristic of myelomonocytic, rather than lymphoid, cells. Treatment of the plasmacytoid lymphosarcoma lines with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate led to various degrees of growth arrest, presumably due to myelomonocytic differentiation. To date, characterization of myeloid cell lines with varying responses to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate has not been reported. The different clonal plasmacytoid lymphosarcoma lines should, therefore, provide a good model to help elucidate the role of altered myb locus and other protooncogenes in myelomonocytic leukemia. Contrary to studies on induced differentiation of myelomonocytic cells with normal myb locus, our results on plasmacytoid lymphosarcoma cells indicate that reduced myb and myc expression may not be obligatory for growth arrest to occur. The present study, however, supports the previous notion that the myb transforming ability may be restricted to cells of the myelomonocytic lineage. In addition, we found that only the more mature cells can undergo prolonged phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced growth arrest, suggesting that the maintenance of these leukemic cells in their proliferative state, presumably by the myb gene product, can be overcome with appropriate differentiation signal(s).","['Shen-Ong, G L', 'Holmes, K L', 'Morse, H C 3rd']","['Shen-Ong GL', 'Holmes KL', 'Morse HC 3rd']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/microbiology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/microbiology/pathology', 'Mice', '*Oncogenes', 'Phenotype']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Jan;84(1):199-203. doi: 10.1073/pnas.84.1.199.,,,['10.1073/pnas.84.1.199 [doi]'],,PMC304170,,,,,

We conclude that unequal recombination events occur with high frequency in the pairing region, possibly because of the presence of repeated sequences.","['Harbers, K', 'Soriano, P', 'Muller, U', 'Jaenisch, R']","['Harbers K', 'Soriano P', 'Muller U', 'Jaenisch R']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/cytology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', '*DNA Transposable Elements', 'Female', '*Genes, Viral', 'Genotype', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic']",1986/12/18 00:00,1986/12/18 00:01,['1986/12/18 00:00'],"['1986/12/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/18 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 1986 Dec 18-31;324(6098):682-5. doi: 10.1038/324682a0.,"['HD-19105/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA38497/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['10.1038/324682a0 [doi]'],,,,,,,

The discovery in this laboratory that cells deficient in nucleotide excision repair, i.e., SV40-virus transformed SV-XP20S cells, can efficiently repair DNA-protein crosslinks implicates a second pathway. In this report, details concerning this pathway are presented. DNA-protein crosslinks induced with 20 microM trans-platinum were assayed by the membrane alkaline elution procedure of Kohn. DNA replication was measured by CsCl gradient separation of newly synthesized DNA that had incorporated 5-bromodeoxyuridine. The following results indicate that this new repair pathway is associated with cell cycling: Whereas rapidly proliferating human cells deficient in excision repair (SV40 transformed XP20S, group A) are proficient in repair of DNA-protein crosslinks, the more slowly growing untransformed parent line is deficient but can complete repair after prolonged periods of 4-6 days, the approximate doubling time of the cell population. Either ""used"" culture medium or cycloheximide (1 microgram/ml) inhibits cell proliferation, protein synthesis, DNA replication and crosslink repair. In the presence of increasing concentrations of cycloheximide (0.01-5 micrograms/ml) the percent of DNA replication decreases and is essentially equivalent to the percent of crosslink repair. The following results indicate that this new repair pathway, though associated with cell cycling, is independent of DNA replication per se. The rates of DNA-protein crosslink repair and DNA replication are essentially the same in mouse L1210 cells rapidly proliferating in 20% serum supplement; however, to slower proliferation rates in 1% serum rate of crosslink repair is slower but differs from that of DNA replication. In the presence of aphidicolin (10 micrograms/ml) cells can repair DNA-protein crosslinks in virtually the complete absence of DNA replication, though the rate is slower in both nucleotide excision-proficient and -deficient cells. Thus, DNA replication is not essential for repair of DNA-protein crosslinks. Comparison of the kinetics of replication and DNA-protein crosslink repair of pulse-labeled indicates that, in the absence of metabolic inhibitors, repair of the crosslinks is independent of replication per se and, therefore, DNA recombination events are not involved in this repair process. We conclude, therefore, that the new repair pathway is not coupled with DNA replication but is with cell cycling.","['Gantt, R']",['Gantt R'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '14913-33-8 (transplatin)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aphidicolin', '*Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/pharmacology', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', '*DNA Repair/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Diterpenes/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', '*Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Simian virus 40', 'Xeroderma Pigmentosum']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1987 Jan;183(1):75-87. doi: 10.1016/0167-8817(87)90048-4.,,,"['0167-8817(87)90048-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-8817(87)90048-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,

In previous studies, erythroid colony-forming cells were undetectable in marrow culture of cats with PRCA. Yet erythroid burst-forming cells (BFU-E) remained, suggesting that BFU-E were able to differentiate in vitro but not in vivo. It was inferred that immunologic suppression may contribute to the pathogenesis of feline PRCA, and the interactions of antibody and T-lymphocytes with erythroid and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors were studied. Incubation of normal or PRCA marrow cells with PRCA serum or IgG concentrated from this serum and then complement (C') failed to decrease hematopoietic colony growth when compared to the results obtained with cultures of marrow cells incubated with C' alone. In crossover coculture studies, T-cells from Safari cats with PRCA had no inhibitory effect on colony growth from normal or autologous PRCA marrow cells. For the determination of whether feline PRCAs were associated with a clonal T-cell process, lymphocytes were obtained periodically from glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Glc-6-PD) heterozygous cats following FeLV-C infection and were expanded with a crude preparation of interleukin-2. The ratios of Glc-6-PD enzyme types in these samples did not change as cats developed anemia, suggesting that the inhibition of erythropoiesis was not associated with the clonal expansion of T-cells. These studies, therefore, do not support the premise that feline PRCA results from the interaction of antibody or T-cells with erythroid progenitors.","['Abkowitz, J L', 'Ott, R L', 'Holly, R D', 'Adamson, J W']","['Abkowitz JL', 'Ott RL', 'Holly RD', 'Adamson JW']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['0 (Autoantibodies)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Autoantibodies/immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/immunology/*veterinary', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cat Diseases/*etiology/immunology', 'Cats', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal/*etiology/immunology', 'Erythroblasts/immunology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/etiology/immunology/*veterinary', 'Retroviridae Infections/complications/etiology/immunology/*veterinary', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1987 Jan;78(1):135-9. doi: 10.1093/jnci/78.1.135.,['HL-31823/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,['10.1093/jnci/78.1.135 [doi]'],,,,,,,

Sera that were falsely positive in ELISA antibody tests to the three human and simian retroviruses were found to contain antibodies that reacted at comparable intensity with feline leukemia, infectious peritonitis and panleukopenia viruses. The false anti-viral activity of these sera was found to be due to antibodies that reacted with non-viral proteins that were copurified with all five virus preparations.

A viral product, p40x, encoded by the pX sequence of HTLV-1 is a trans-acting transcriptional activator of the long terminal repeat (LTR) and has been suspected of involvement in leukemogenesis, activating the cellular genes. The cellular interleukin-2 (IL-2) and its receptor (IL-2R), the latter of which is expressed on ATL leukemic cells, were shown to be transiently induced by transfection of plasmid pMTPX expressing pX in two T-cell lines, Jurkat and HSB-2, but not in other human T- or B-cell lines. The cell type specificity of IL-2R induction by pX expression was the same as that by phytohaemagglutinin/phorbol ester activation, indicating the requirement for some specific cellular factors or a certain state of cellular differentiation. Induction of IL-2 and IL-2R at mRNA level was also demonstrated in transfected cells. Transfections with mutants of pMTPX in which the open reading frames for p40x, p27x-III and p21x-III were inactivated indicated that p40x alone was sufficient for induction of the IL-2R in inducible cells. This induction of the IL-2R by p40x of HTLV-1 may contribute to preferential proliferation of HTLV-1 infected cells at an early stage of ATL development and eventually increase the number of putative target cells for malignant transformation.","['Inoue, J', 'Seiki, M', 'Taniguchi, T', 'Tsuru, S', 'Yoshida, M']","['Inoue J', 'Seiki M', 'Taniguchi T', 'Tsuru S', 'Yoshida M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Genes', '*Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*genetics', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1986 Nov;5(11):2883-8.,,,,,PMC1167238,,,,,

Furthermore, it has been shown that 1,25-(OH)2D3 and one of its synthetic analogues prolonged the survival in mouse leukemia, induced by inoculation of leukemic cells into syngeneic mice. However, until now no growth-inhibitory effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 has been demonstrated in vivo for human cancer cells or for solid cancers. This paper describes the suppression by 1,25-(OH)2D3 of the growth of human cancer cell-derived xenografts in immune-suppressed mice. However, the 24-hydroxylated metabolite and the 24-difluorinated analogue of 1,25-(OH)2D3, both of which are active in vitro, were ineffective in this xenograft model system. The suppression by 1,25-(OH)2D3, which was achieved without significant toxicity, was observed with xenografts derived from two 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor-positive cell lines (COLO 206F, derived from a colonic cancer, and COLO 239F from a malignant melanoma) but not in those from a receptor-negative line (RPMI 7932, also derived from a malignant melanoma). These studies demonstrate that pharmacological doses of 1,25-(OH)2D3 can be tolerated in the presence of a low calcium diet and that these doses can suppress the growth of human solid xenograft tumors in vivo. This is the first report of 1,25-(OH)2D3 growth suppression of solid tumors derived from human cancer cells in an in vivo model system, and it supports the hypothesized potential of the hormone in the treatment of 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor-positive human cancers.","['Eisman, J A', 'Barkla, D H', 'Tutton, P J']","['Eisman JA', 'Barkla DH', 'Tutton PJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Calcium, Dietary)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Calcium, Dietary/administration & dosage', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Receptors, Calcitriol', 'Receptors, Steroid/analysis', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Jan 1;47(1):21-5.,,,,,,,,,,

We observed significant inhibition of leukemic colony growth in 17 samples by 10(-7) to 10(-6)M cisRA. However, we found that retinoid exposure resulted in striking stimulation of clonal growth in ten samples at the same drug concentrations. With the exception of cases with promyelocytic features, there was no morphologic or functional evidence that cisRA induced the leukemic blasts to differentiate. Both inhibition and stimulation were dose-dependent and observable at pharmacologically achievable levels of cisRA. Leukemic cells with monocytic features more frequently demonstrated a stimulatory response than did those without monocytic features. Depletion of T lymphocytes and monocytes did not alter the type of growth response. Assays for cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP) were performed on five samples (two with inhibitory growth responses, two with stimulatory responses, and one with no growth) and failed to reveal detectable levels of CRABP in any case. The addition of cisRA to liquid suspensions of leukemic cells produced no significant change in the number of viable cells. We conclude that the effects of cisRA on leukemic colony growth are not cytotoxic and not mediated by T lymphocytes, monocytes, or CRABP. More importantly, cisRA appears to enhance the growth of certain human leukemia cells in vitro. Taking into account the increasing use of retinoids in clinical trials for patients with leukemia, the latter findings may represent a significant cautionary note.","['Lawrence, H J', 'Conner, K', 'Kelly, M A', 'Haussler, M R', 'Wallace, P', 'Bagby, G C Jr']","['Lawrence HJ', 'Conner K', 'Kelly MA', 'Haussler MR', 'Wallace P', 'Bagby GC Jr']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1987/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1987 Jan;69(1):302-7.,,,['S0006-4971(20)76580-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,

Human T-lymphotropic virus, type I (HTLV-I), a human retrovirus isolated from patients with adult T cell leukemia, can transform T cells in vitro. We investigated the role of HTLV-I-transformed T cell lines as accessory cells in promoting the growth of T colony-forming cells. We found that T cells isolated by E rosetting and then activated with PHA, when seeded with as few as 5 X 10(3) irradiated HTLV-I-producing cells, could generate colonies in the absence of IL2. We analyzed further the effects of HTLV-I virions on T colony formation. Infection of T cells with semipurified HTLV-I viral particles promoted colony formation, in the absence of IL2, of accessory cells or soluble factors. The same results were obtained either with monocyte-depleted T lymphocytes, or with T4 or T8 lymphocytes. Furthermore, T lymphocytes in the presence of heat-inactivated HTLV-I (devoid of replicative potential) could form colonies independently of IL2. Finally, experiments with sera positive for HTLV-I antibodies (to abolish binding of viral particles to cellular receptors) indicated that HTLV-I promoted IL2-independent colony formation, only by ""touching"" T colony-forming cells. These results taken together demonstrate that the loss of the exogenous IL2 (and other growth-helping factors) requirement defines an early event of HTLV-I infection. The results also suggest that viral attachment to T cells possibly supplies an accessory function triggering autocrine secretion of IL2 by these cells.","['Duc Dodon, M', 'Gazzolo, L']","['Duc Dodon M', 'Gazzolo L']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Deltaretrovirus/*growth & development/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*physiology', 'Monocytes/physiology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*microbiology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1987 Jan;69(1):12-7.,,,['S0006-4971(20)76535-3 [pii]'],,,,,,,

Higher order parameters for 5-doxyl stearate were also noted in asolectin liposomes, Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, and CCRF-CEM cells treated with VM-26. We conclude that VM-26 has significant membrane associated activity in addition to its previously recognized nuclear effects.","['Wright, S E', 'White, J C']","['Wright SE', 'White JC']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Cyclic N-Oxides)', '0 (Lipid Bilayers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Spin Labels)', '2644-64-6 (1,2-Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine)', '29545-47-9 (12-doxylstearic acid)', '29545-48-0 (5-doxylstearic acid)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)', 'U86ZGC74V5 (Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine)']",IM,"['1,2-Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor/ultrastructure', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*drug effects', 'Cholesterol/pharmacology', 'Cyclic N-Oxides', 'Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', '*Lipid Bilayers', 'Liposomes', 'Male', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Mice', 'Podophyllotoxin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Spin Labels', 'Teniposide/*pharmacology']",1986/12/16 00:00,1986/12/16 00:01,['1986/12/16 00:00'],"['1986/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1986 Dec 16;863(2):297-304. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(86)90270-1.,,,"['0005-2736(86)90270-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(86)90270-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,

Retinoids produce various specific biological effects, including induction of terminal differentiation, regulation of cell proliferation, regulation of gene expression and regulation of the activity of specific enzymes in cells. In this article, the effects of retinoids on gene expression are reviewed. Among these effects suppression of myc expression and induction of EGF-receptor mRNA expression are considered to be closely related to regulation of cell proliferation. The effects of retinoids on cell growth are discussed on the basis of these two actions: myc mRNA suppression and EGFR mRNA induction. The mode of retinoidal action seems to be similar to that of steroids, as many investigators suggest. The molecular mechanism of retinoidal action is considered to be the formation of a retinoid-receptor complex and its interaction with regulatory elements of DNA. The possibility of application of the methodology used in the investigation of steroidal action to the study of retinoidal action is also discussed.","['Hashimoto, Y', 'Kagechika, H', 'Kawachi, E', 'Shudo, K']","['Hashimoto Y', 'Kagechika H', 'Kawachi E', 'Shudo K']",,['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

In the current study, we demonstrate that 1,25(OH)2D3 also regulates 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] metabolism in HL-60 cells. The presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 in the culture medium of HL-60 cells stimulated the conversion of 7-10% of the substrate [25(OH)D3] to a more polar metabolite, which was identified as 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [24,25(OH)2D3] from the elution positions on sequential HPLC systems and the sensitivity to periodate treatment. The HL-60 subclone HL-60 blast, which is unresponsive to 1,25(OH)2D3 in terms of differentiation, also responded to 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment with the production of 24,25(OH)2D3. Maximal stimulation of 24,25(OH)2D3-synthesis (approximately 7 pmol/5 X 10(6) cells) in HL-60 cells was noted with a 12-h exposure to 10(-9) M 1,25(OH)2D3. The ability of vitamin D3 metabolites other than 1,25(OH)2D3 to induce the synthesis of 24,25(OH)2D3 in HL-60 cells was, with the exception of 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3, in correlation with their reported affinities for the specific 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor which is present in HL-60 cells. Treatment of HL-60 cells with phorbol diesters abolished the 1,25(OH)2D3 responsiveness, while treatment with dimethylsulfoxide and interferon gamma did not markedly alter the 25(OH)D3 metabolism of HL-60 cells. Small amounts (approximately 1% of substrate) of two 25(OH)D3 metabolites, which comigrated with 5(E)- and 5(Z)-19-nor-10-keto-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 on two HPLC solvent systems, were synthesized by HL-60 cells, independently from 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment or stage of cell differentiation.

The ease with which loss of expression of the markers can be monitored has allowed us to make observations on the stability of proviral genes. In particular, we have found indirect evidence of strong position effects on proviral gene expression by comparing the characteristic frequency of marker loss in different clonal proviral lines. Effects of the selection protocol on the apparent frequency of variants have also been noted.

Such studies with B lymphocytes, the precursors of antibody-secreting cells, are hampered by the difficulty in generating phenotypically mature, antigen-reactive lines from defined cell populations. One method is to use acutely transforming retroviruses, which can transform B-lineage lymphocytes in vitro. However, Abelson murine leukaemia virus (A-MuLV) infection of murine bone marrow cells in vitro yields mostly immature B-cell lines, and infection of murine bone marrow cells with murine sarcoma viruses carrying ras related genes produces only immature lymphoid cell lines. Retroviruses which contain ras can immortalize nonlymphoid cells without causing loss of mature phenotypic characteristics. We used ras-containing Kirsten sarcoma virus (KiSV) pseudotyped with an amphotropic MuLV helper virus, to infect a purified population of mature, hapten-binding murine splenic B lymphocytes, aiming to generate mature B-cell lines to use as models for the study of B-cell growth and differentiation physiology. Immortalized B-cell lines which retain the same mature phenotype as the starting population, including hapten-specific binding, were produced.

The p53 protein synthesized in these clones was indistinguishable from that occurring naturally in tumor cells. When a p53 cDNA clone was used instead, we observed that the L12-derived clones exhibited a distinct immunological profile. In the present experiments we compared the immunological epitopes of p53 proteins encoded by several full-length cDNA clones. Immunoprecipitation of p53 proteins generated by in vitro transcription and translation of the various cDNA clones indicated variations in the content of immunological epitopes. Basically, two p53 protein species were detected. Both species contained the same antigenic determinants except the PAb421-PAb122 site, which was present in proteins encoded by p53-M11 and pcD-p53, but not in the p53 protein encoded by the p53-M8 cDNA clone. Sequence analysis of the various cDNA clones indicated the existence of a 96-base-pair (bp) insert in clone p53-M8 as compared with clone p53-M11 or pCD-p53. The 96-bp insert contained a termination signal which caused the premature termination of the protein, leading to the generation of a p53 product 9 amino acids shorter than usual. The existence of this insert also accounted for the lack of the PAb421-PAb122 epitope which was mapped to the 3' end of the cDNA clone, following the 96-bp insert. This insert shared complete homology with the p53 intron 10 sequences mapping 96 bp upstream of the 5' acceptor splicing site of p53 exon 11. It was therefore concluded that the different cDNA clones represented p53 mRNA species which were generated by an alternative splicing mechanism. Differential hybridization of the mRNA population of transformed fibroblastic or lymphoid cells with either the 96-bp synthetic oligonucleotide or the p53-M11 cDNA indicated that the various mRNA species are expressed in vivo.","['Arai, N', 'Nomura, D', 'Yokota, K', 'Wolf, D', 'Brill, E', 'Shohat, O', 'Rotter, V']","['Arai N', 'Nomura D', 'Yokota K', 'Wolf D', 'Brill E', 'Shohat O', 'Rotter V']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Genes', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'Protein Biosynthesis', '*RNA Splicing', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1986 Sep;6(9):3232-9. doi: 10.1128/mcb.6.9.3232-3239.1986.,['IR01CA40002-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['10.1128/mcb.6.9.3232-3239.1986 [doi]'],,PMC367060,,,,"['GENBANK/M13872', 'GENBANK/M13873', 'GENBANK/M13874']",

The ability of these recombinants and the parental PvuII-D deletion mutant to replicate in permissive 3T6 cells and MOP-6 cells as well as in nonpermissive mouse B lymphoid, T lymphoid, mastocyte, and embryonal carcinoma cells was determined. Wild-type Py DNA was not permissive for replication in most lymphoid cell lines, except one hybridoma line. Simply deleting the Py PvuII-D region, however, gave Py an expanded host range, allowing high-level replication in some T lymphoid and mastocytoma cell lines, indicating that this element can be a tissue-specific negative as well as positive element. Substitution of the murine leukemia virus enhancer for Py PvuII-D yielded a Py genome which retained the ability to replicate in 3T6 cells but also replicated well in B lymphoid cells. Substitution with the immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer allowed replication in B lymphoid cells but interfered with replication in 3T6 cells and mastocytomas. Surprisingly, substitution with the simian virus 40 72-base-pair enhancer repeat gave a recombinant which would not replicate in any cell line tried, including MOP-6 cells, even though other recombinants with this enhancer would replicate. Thus, we observed both cooperation and interference in these combinations between enhancer components and the Py genome and that these combined activities were cell specific.

Thus, the primary sequence of the target strand, rather than the methylation pattern of the complementary strand, determines maintenance methylation.

In addition, the study revealed that complementary strands of oligodeoxynucleotides are methylated at different rates and in different patterns.

Although the K562 cell line was established from cells of a chronic myelocytic leukemia patient, we have been unable to detect the Ph1 chromosome by cytogenetic means. Employing a probe from the 5' region of bcr, we have cloned an amplified Ph1 breakpoint fragment from K562. This demonstrates that K562 contains multiple remnants of a Ph1 chromosome with a breakpoint within bcr and thus may serve as a model system for the study of Ph1-positive chronic myelocytic leukemia at a molecular level. The isolation of bcr cDNA sequences shows that parts of bcr encode a protein. Employing K562, we demonstrate the presence of an abnormally sized mRNA species hybridizing to c-abl and to a bcr cDNA probe, indicating the possible consequence of the Ph1 translocation on a transcriptional level in chronic myelocytic leukemia. The isolation and sequencing of a cDNA containing the breakpoint area of this mRNA provide further evidence for its chimeric structure. Cloning of large stretches of chromosomal DNA flanking bcr and c-abl sequences in K562 and identification of the exons participating in the formation of the chimeric mRNA shows that a splice of at least 99 kilobases is made to fuse the 3' bcr exon to the 5' c-abl exon. Furthermore two chimeric cDNAs were isolated containing chromosome 9 sequences that map 43.5 kilobases downstream from the K562 breakpoint. These chromosome 9 sequences neither hybridize to the 8.5-kilobase chimeric c-abl mRNA nor to normal c-abl mRNAs in Hela cells and probably represent incorrect splicing products present in the K562 cell line.","['Grosveld, G', 'Verwoerd, T', 'van Agthoven, T', 'de Klein, A', 'Ramachandran, K L', 'Heisterkamp, N', 'Stam, K', 'Groffen, J']","['Grosveld G', 'Verwoerd T', 'van Agthoven T', 'de Klein A', 'Ramachandran KL', 'Heisterkamp N', 'Stam K', 'Groffen J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chimera', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1986/02/01 00:00,1986/02/01 00:01,['1986/02/01 00:00'],"['1986/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1986 Feb;6(2):607-16. doi: 10.1128/mcb.6.2.607-616.1986.,,,['10.1128/mcb.6.2.607-616.1986 [doi]'],,PMC367552,,,,"['GENBANK/M13096', 'GENBANK/M13097', 'GENBANK/M13098', 'GENBANK/M13099', 'GENBANK/M19695', 'GENBANK/M19696']",

The first mode was found in six tumors in which a Moloney murine leukemia virus component had inserted in the same transcriptional orientation upstream of the 5'-most exon with v-myb homology (vE1). cDNA sequence data indicate the presence of a truncated c-myb mRNA that is initiated in the upstream 5' long terminal repeat of the integrated provirus and processed via a cryptic splice donor sequence in the gag region to the splice acceptor site in vE1 of the c-myb gene, thus removing the remaining downstream viral and myb intronic sequences. Unlike most gag-onc transcripts, the gag and myb sequences in the hybrid transcript were not in the same reading frame. It is presumed that the gag sequence provides a cryptic translation initiation site for the novel amino-truncated c-myb protein. The second mode of disruption was by downstream virus insertion at the 3' side of the c-myb, which results in the synthesis of a small (approximately 2 kilobase) myb transcript. The 5' long terminal repeat of the inserted provirus provides a TGA termination codon that results in the elimination of 240 normal c-myb amino acid residues from the carboxyl terminus of the tumor-specific myb protein. These results suggest that truncated myb proteins play a role in neoplastic transformation of myeloid cells.","['Shen-Ong, G L', 'Morse, H C 3rd', 'Potter, M', 'Mushinski, J F']","['Shen-Ong GL', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'Potter M', 'Mushinski JF']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Genes, Viral', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1986/02/01 00:00,1986/02/01 00:01,['1986/02/01 00:00'],"['1986/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1986 Feb;6(2):380-92. doi: 10.1128/mcb.6.2.380-392.1986.,,,['10.1128/mcb.6.2.380-392.1986 [doi]'],['Mol Cell Biol 1986 Jul;6(7):2756'],PMC367527,,,,['GENBANK/M13138'],

However, when the environment is modified by the continuous presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), two novel types of membrane immunoglobulin (mIg)-positive B cell lines are generated. Because the cells which give rise to these cell lines copurify with mIg-positive bone marrow cells, the cell lines arise as a result of A-MuLV interaction with a new type of in vitro target cell. The cell lines generated fall into two groups which differ in several phenotypic characteristics. Group 1 cells are more differentiated than the typical pre-B cell transformant in that they synthesize mIgM and appear to resemble virgin B cells. The group 1 cells do not secrete immunoglobulin and are independent of LPS for growth. In addition, these cell lines synthesize the Abelson P160 protein, contain integrated abl proviral DNA, and are highly tumorigenic in syngeneic animals. The group 2 cell lines differ markedly from both the group 1 cells and from typical, pre-B cell A-MuLV transformants. These cells are mIgG positive and secrete large amounts of immunoglobulin into the culture medium. The cell lines are comprised of both adherent and nonadherent cells and do not synthesize P160 or contain integrated v-abl sequences. The group 2 cells are nontumorigenic in syngeneic animals and require LPS for growth and viability. Both types of cells have remained in culture for over 2 years with no changes in their phenotypic characteristics.

These data indicate that the Rmcf locus contains an endogenous gp70 gene having two allelic forms, one of which inhibits exogenous MCF infection in vitro by a mechanism of viral interference.","['Buller, R S', 'Ahmed, A', 'Portis, J L']","['Buller RS', 'Ahmed A', 'Portis JL']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Crosses, Genetic', '*Genes', '*Genes, Viral', '*Genetic Linkage', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/*genetics', 'Species Specificity', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/analysis/*genetics']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1987 Jan;61(1):29-34. doi: 10.1128/JVI.61.1.29-34.1987.,,,['10.1128/JVI.61.1.29-34.1987 [doi]'],,PMC255194,,,,,

Analysis of somatic cell hybrids with different BALB/c chromosomes showed that the 9 xenotropic and more than 20 MCF virus-related proviral sequences in this mouse were present on more than nine BALB/c chromosomes. Multiple copies were found on chromosomes 1, 4, 7, 12, and probably 11, and the copies found on a single chromosome were not identical by restriction enzyme mapping. We also identified and characterized the proviral sequences that give rise to infectious xenotropic virus in both BALB/c and NFS/N mice. BALB/c contains the major locus for induction of infectious virus in inbred mice, Bxv-1, which is on chromosome 1. We showed that this locus contains a single xenotropic provirus on an 18-kilobase HindIII fragment. Restriction enzyme analysis of a hybrid cell DNA that contains only the Bxv-1 xenotropic provirus showed that the Bxv-1 provirus contains restriction enzyme sites characteristic of the infectious virus induced from BALB/c fibroblasts. The Bxv-1 provirus and its flanking sequences also contain the same restriction sites as the provirus thought to contribute U3 long terminal repeat sequences to leukemogenic (class I) AKR MCF viruses. Analysis of cell hybrids made with the nonvirus-inducible strain NFS/N showed that the single xenotropic virus env gene of NFS mice, here termed Nfxv-1, is not on chromosome 1. Unlike that of Bxv-1, the restriction map of Nfxv-1 does not resemble that of any known infectious xenotropic virus including xenotropic viruses isolated from NFS mice. These data suggest that Bxv-1, but not Nfxv-1, is a full-length xenotropic provirus that can be transcribed directly to produce infectious virus.","['Hoggan, M D', ""O'Neill, R R"", 'Kozak, C A']","['Hoggan MD', ""O'Neill RR"", 'Kozak CA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*growth & development', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/genetics/*microbiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics', 'Virus Replication']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1986 Dec;60(3):980-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.60.3.980-986.1986.,,,['10.1128/JVI.60.3.980-986.1986 [doi]'],,PMC253336,,,,,

T1 oligonucleotide fingerprinting, molecular hybridization, and restriction enzyme analysis previously showed that the env gene of Cas-Br-E MuLV diverged the most from that of other ecotropic MuLVs. To analyze proviruses in leukemic tissues, we derived DNA probes specific to Cas-Br-E sequences: two from the env region and one from the U3 long terminal repeat. With these probes, we found that this virus induced clonal (or oligoclonal) tumors and we documented the presence of typical mink cell focus-forming-type proviruses in leukemic tissues and the possible presence of other recombinant MuLV proviruses. Since the region harboring the determinant of paralysis was mapped within the pol-env region of the virus (L. DesGroseillers, M. Barrette, and P. Jolicoeur, J. Virol. 52:356-363, 1984), we performed the complete nucleotide sequence of this region covering the 3' end of the genome. We compared the deduced amino acid sequences of the pol carboxy-terminal domain and of the env gene products with those of other nonparalytogenic, ecotropic, and mink cell focus-forming MuLVs. This amino acid comparison revealed that this part of the pol gene product and the p15E diverged very little from homologous proteins of other MuLVs. However, the Cas-Br-E gp70 sequence was found to be quite divergent from that of other MuLVs, and the amino acid changes were distributed all along the protein. Therefore, gp70 remains the best candidate for harboring the determinant of paralysis.","['Rassart, E', 'Nelbach, L', 'Jolicoeur, P']","['Rassart E', 'Nelbach L', 'Jolicoeur P']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics', 'Paralysis/genetics/*microbiology', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1986 Dec;60(3):910-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.60.3.910-919.1986.,,,['10.1128/JVI.60.3.910-919.1986 [doi]'],,PMC253320,,,,['GENBANK/M14702'],

Experiments were conducted with several mutant forms of p37mos to determine whether or not the kinase function correlates with the biological activity of the mutant v-mos genes. Two mutants lacking cell transformation activity, one an arginine substitution for lysine-121 in the putative ATP-binding site and the other a 23-amino acid deletion from the C-terminal end of p37mos, had no kinase activity associated with their mutant proteins. However, a third mutant with reduced biological activity had drastically less kinase activity than the wild-type protein. The latter mutant was able to phosphorylate the kinase-inactive p37mos(Arg-121) protein in vitro. These results indicate that even though p37mos(Arg-121) can be phosphorylated in trans by other kinase molecules, it lacks the ability to phosphorylate itself in vitro. This provides a compelling argument that the protein kinase function of p37mos is an intrinsic property of the protein.

Cellular immunity was tested by lymphocyte proliferation in response to varicella antigen. Antiviral antibody was measured using the fluorescent antibody to membrane antigen technique. Reduced lymphocyte proliferation was found in 9 of 16 seropositive patients when compared to an age-related control group. On the other hand, antibody titers in patients receiving chemotherapy remained positive and were essentially unchanged from pretreatment values. Shingles occurred in two of nine children with diminished and none of seven patients with normal cellular immunity, suggesting that proliferative responses to varicella antigen may have predicative value in identifying patients at risk for viral reactivation. Additional studies were done to determine if defective antigen presentation or reduced lymphocyte responder-cell frequency could account for the subnormal proliferative responses. Intact presentation of varicella antigens by patient mononuclear cells to parental, virus-specific T-cell blasts suggested that antigen processing was not defective. However, varicella-specific responder-cell frequencies measured by limiting dilution analysis were found to be depressed in most patients, including some with normal proliferative responses. Our findings indicate that therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children can be associated with depressed cell-mediated immunity to varicella zoster virus even though patients remain seropositive. Further studies suggest that while monocyte-mediated antigen presentation remains intact, virus-specific lymphocyte numbers decline and probably contribute to decreased cellular immunity to varicella zoster virus in children being treated for leukemia.","['Giller, R H', 'Bowden, R A', 'Levin, M J', 'Walker, L J', 'Tubergen, D G', 'Hayward, A R']","['Giller RH', 'Bowden RA', 'Levin MJ', 'Walker LJ', 'Tubergen DG', 'Hayward AR']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Clin Immunol,Journal of clinical immunology,8102137,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Herpesvirus 3, Human/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Immunol. 1986 Nov;6(6):472-80. doi: 10.1007/BF00915253.,,,['10.1007/BF00915253 [doi]'],,,,,,,

Urokinase bound to both cell lines in a time-dependent, specific, and saturable manner (Kd = 0.8-2.0 nM). An active catalytic site was not required for urokinase binding to the cells, and 55,000-mol-wt urokinase was selectively recognized. Plasminogen also bound to the two cell lines in a specific and saturable manner. This interaction occurred with a Kd of 0.8-0.9 microM and was of very high capacity (1.6-3.1 X 10(7) molecules bound/cell). The interaction of plasminogen with both cell types was partially sensitive to trypsinization of the cells and required an unoccupied high affinity lysine-binding site in the ligand. When plasminogen was added to the GM1380 cells, a line with high intrinsic plasminogen activator activity, the bound ligand was comprised of both plasminogen and plasmin. Urokinase, in catalytically active or inactive form, enhanced plasminogen binding to the two cell lines by 1.4-3.3-fold. Plasmin was the predominant form of the bound ligand when active urokinase was added, and preformed plasmin can also bind directly to the cells.

Three known inducers of HL-60 monocytic differentiation were compared: 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3, tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA), and sodium butyrate. At concentrations where all three inducers resulted in similar courses of G1/0-specific growth arrest, the kinetics of appearance of certain differentiation markers typically characteristic of mature monocytic cells was determined. The markers were inducible oxidative metabolism, non-specific esterase activity, and the cell surface determinants Mo1, My4, and Mo2. The results indicate that: Regulation of the expression of these markers during induced monocytic differentiation is not controlled in common. The three monocytic inducers do not induce the same metabolic cascade leading to differentiation. Similar states of differentiation could thus be reached by different pathways apparently due to the fact that control of expression of different differentiation markers was not tightly coupled.","['Yen, A', 'Brown, D', 'Fishbaugh, J']","['Yen A', 'Brown D', 'Fishbaugh J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Butyrates)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'EC 3.1.- (Esterases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Esterases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Monocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1987 Jan;168(1):247-54. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(87)90432-0.,,,"['0014-4827(87)90432-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(87)90432-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,

The ability of these clones to bind three types of hematopoietic growth factors (MGI-1GM = GM-CSF, IL-3 = multi-CSF and MGI-1M = M-CSF = CSF-1) was measured using the method of quantitative absorption at 1 degree C and low pH elution of cell-bound biological activity. Results of binding to normal myeloid and lymphoid cells were similar to those obtained by radioreceptor assays. The results indicate that the number of receptors on different clones of these leukemic cells varied from 0 to 1,300 per cell. The receptors have a high binding affinity. Receptors for different growth factors can be independently expressed in different clones. There was no relationship between expression of receptors for these growth factors and the phenotype of the leukemic cells regarding their ability to be induced to differentiate. The number of receptors on the leukemic cells was lower than on normal mature macrophages. Myeloid leukemic cells induced to differentiate by normal myeloid cell differentiation factor MGI-2 (= DF), or by low doses of actinomycin D or cytosine arabinoside, showed an up-regulation of the number of MGI-1GM and IL-3 receptors. Induction of differentiation of leukemic cells by MGI-2 also induced production and secretion of the growth factor MGI-1GM, and this induced MGI-1GM saturated the up-regulated MGI-1GM receptors.

Their nature and the genetic basis of their antigenic diversity are unknown. Numerous attempts have been made to relate these antigens to products of known polymorphic gene families. A serological analysis of cell-surface antigens of sarcomas was initiated on the premise that serologically defined unique tumour-specific antigens would be related to tumour-specific transplantation antigens. This analysis led to the serological definition of two noncross-reacting tumour-specific antigens on two antigenically distinct BALB/c sarcomas, Meth A and CMS4. Assignment of the gene(s) involved in expression of the Meth A antigen to the distal region of chromosome 12, the same region encoding Igh, raised the possibility that genetic elements responsible for antibody idiotype could be involved in the antigenic diversity of tumour-specific transplantation antigens. Although several studies indicate a concordant expression of the Meth A and the tumour-specific transplantation antigen, the Meth A tumour-specific transplantation antigen identified as an 82,000-Da protein does not express the serologically defined antigen.

The intensity of MPO mRNA expression on Northern blot correlated with the level of MPO expression by cytochemical staining. Multiple species of MPO mRNA were found.

Rosenberg and O. N. Witte, J. Virol. 33:340-348, 1980). This virus transforms NIH 3T3 cells efficiently but does not transform a high frequency of lymphoid cells in vitro or in vivo. In this communication, we show that of the relatively few tumors induced by A-MuLV-P90 nearly all contained new variant viruses that stably expressed either larger or smaller A-MuLV proteins. Strains that expressed larger A-MuLV proteins behaved like A-MuLV-P120 in transformation assays, whereas those expressing smaller A-MuLV proteins induced a high frequency of tumors after a short latent period in vivo but failed to transform large numbers of lymphoid cells in vitro. Thus, these latter viruses separated the requirements for in vitro transformation of lymphoid cells from those for tumor induction. All of the variants differed from A-MuLV-P90 in the carboxy-terminal region of the A-MuLV protein, suggesting that sequences in this region play a key role in the ability of the virus to interact with hematopoietic cells in vivo and in vitro.","['Murtagh, K', 'Skladany, G', 'Hoag, J', 'Rosenberg, N']","['Murtagh K', 'Skladany G', 'Hoag J', 'Rosenberg N']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (Viral Proteins)'],IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Variation', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Lymphocytes/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1986 Nov;60(2):599-606. doi: 10.1128/JVI.60.2.599-606.1986.,,,['10.1128/JVI.60.2.599-606.1986 [doi]'],,PMC288931,,,,,

On transfection of an expression plasmid that contains a cDNA sequence of the pX mRNA, products from both ORFs III and IV were detected in the cells.

It is currently believed that oncogenes control metabolic pathways that involve peptide growth factors and their receptors, as well as postreceptor signaling mechanisms. Retinoids, therefore, have been valuable probes to study the function of oncogenes and peptide growth factors. In several tumor cells, including human promyelocytic leukemia, human and murine neuroblastoma, and murine teratocarcinoma, retinoic acid induces terminal differentiation, accompanied by suppression of the expression of either the c-myc or the N-myc gene. Many studies have indicated that retinoic acid can markedly increase the number of cellular receptors for epidermal growth factor, which is partially encoded by another oncogene, erb-B. We have shown that retinoic acid greatly inhibits the anchorage-independent growth of a rat fibroblast cell line that has been transfected with the c-myc gene, particularly when these cells are stimulated by the combination of platelet-derived growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta. At present, the mechanisms by which retinoids control oncogene and growth factor expression are unknown. A wide range of new compounds, including the retinoidal benzoic acid derivatives, are now available to study these mechanisms, and will necessitate the identification of a high-affinity receptor for retinoids and the elucidation of the interaction of this receptor with the genome of the cell. The recent synthesis of new terephthalic acid anilides and chalcone carboxylic acid derivatives, which have retinoid-like activity, offers a particularly useful approach to this problem.","['Sporn, M B', 'Roberts, A B', 'Roche, N S', 'Kagechika, H', 'Shudo, K']","['Sporn MB', 'Roberts AB', 'Roche NS', 'Kagechika H', 'Shudo K']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoids)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/metabolism', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Oncogenes/*drug effects', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Retinoids/*pharmacology']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 1986 Oct;15(4 Pt 2):756-64. doi: 10.1016/s0190-9622(86)70231-4.,,,"['S0190-9622(86)70231-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0190-9622(86)70231-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,

Antibody detection was performed by using an indirect immunoperoxidase staining technique (for all viruses) and, in the case of OC43 and NCDCV, antibody detection was obtained even with a hemagglutination inhibition test and a plaque reduction neutralization assay. Results obtained show a significant difference in the prevalence of antibody to 229E between children and adult group. Furthermore, a different titer was observed, within the two groups, between patients affected by hematological diseases (leukemia) and patients with other diseases. Finally, our data seem to confirm previous studies reporting a very high prevalence of antibody to coronavirus OC43 but a less detectable seropositivity to coronavirus 229E.","['Cereda, P M', 'Pagani, L', 'Romero, E']","['Cereda PM', 'Pagani L', 'Romero E']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Epidemiol,European journal of epidemiology,8508062,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*analysis', 'Coronaviridae/*immunology', 'Coronaviridae Infections/*epidemiology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Italy']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Epidemiol. 1986 Jun;2(2):112-7. doi: 10.1007/BF00157021.,,,['10.1007/BF00157021 [doi]'],,PMC7087962,,,,,

The molecular structure of the translocation varies from patient to patient, and the individual variation in RNA transcript and protein product remains to be defined.

Recovery is associated with the presence of giant pronormoblasts in the bone marrow, and several days later, a brisk peripheral reticulocytosis. In normal subjects, HPV causes erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) but is not associated with symptomatic anemia, probably because of the duration of the normal red blood cell life span.

These viruses differ in their host range. One, R-MCF-1, is dualtropic and will therefore infect both murine and non-murine cells. However, unlike other mink cell focus-inducing (MCF) viruses, it cannot infect NIH 3T3 cells. The other, R-XC-, is ecotropic. It will infect murine cells, including NIH 3T3 cells, but does not infect mink lung cells. Analysis of hybrid viruses, in which homologous regions of the genomes of R-MCF-1 and R-XC- virus were exchanged, indicated that the NH2-terminal portion of the gp70 is responsible for the particular host ranges of these viruses. The nucleotide sequence of the env gene of R-XC- virus was therefore determined and compared with the known env sequences of ecotropic MLVs and dualtropic MCF viruses of the Rauscher and Friend virus complexes. R-XC- virus was found to be a recombinant virus. Its env gene contained sequences derived from an endogenous env gene which were closely related to those of the MCF viruses but differed from any previously described sequences. The particular properties of R-MCF-1 and R-XC- virus suggest that the two viruses arose by recombination between R-MLV and two endogenous env sequences which differ from those of the known MCF viruses. If so, this suggests that the mouse genome contains at least five env sequences which can give rise to MCF-like viruses. In addition, since the host range and interference properties of R-XC- virus are very similar to those of the previously described ecotropic recombinant viruses, it may be that the ecotropic recombinant viruses arose by recombination with the same endogenous env sequences as did R-XC- virus.","['Vogt, M', 'Haggblom, C', 'Swift, S', 'Haas, M']","['Vogt M', 'Haggblom C', 'Swift S', 'Haas M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/*genetics/physiology', 'Rauscher Virus/*genetics/physiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",1986/10/30 00:00,1986/10/30 00:01,['1986/10/30 00:00'],"['1986/10/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/30 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1986 Oct 30;154(2):420-4. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(86)90470-8.,['CA 13608/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['10.1016/0042-6822(86)90470-8 [doi]'],,,,,,,

The results showed that myeloperoxidase and lysozyme started to rise again 6-8 days after initiation of treatment as compared to 12 d for lactoferrin and 16 d for blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The rate of marrow regeneration was exponential and estimated to be 9-20% per d. The comparison between two different chemotherapy regimes showed that the initial reduction in lysozyme, in contrast to other measured variables, was significantly larger with the therapy that contained vincristine and glucocorticosteroids. This might reflect a reduction in lysozyme secretion in addition to the effects on the leukemic cell mass.

This open reading frame encodes a 40-kDa protein (designated p40x) that has been implicated as a positive control element for transcription from the HTLV-I LTR in a phenomenon known as trans-activation. We now report the expression of the complete p40x coding sequence as a 40-kDa protein in Escherichia coli. The p40x protein produced in bacteria is shown, using the protoplast fusion technique, to possess biological activity by its ability to trans-activate a HTLV-I LTR-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmid that is stably integrated into the genome of mouse L cells. This stimulatory activity could be detected within 2 hr after fusion, suggesting the possibility of a direct role for p40x in trans-activation of the HTLV-I LTR. The production of p40x in large quantities in E. coli, together with the rapid protoplast fusion assay for its biological activity, should facilitate the analysis of p40x mutants and the elucidation of the molecular mechanism of trans-activation.","['Giam, C Z', 'Nerenberg, M', 'Khoury, G', 'Jay, G']","['Giam CZ', 'Nerenberg M', 'Khoury G', 'Jay G']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Viral', 'L Cells', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Oct;83(19):7192-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.19.7192.,,,['10.1073/pnas.83.19.7192 [doi]'],,PMC386681,,,,,

MCF viruses evoke stronger antibody responses than ecotropic MuLV isolates. Although these MCF viruses are highly polymorphic with respect to their gp70 and p15(E) envelope proteins, generally a similar H-2-linked immune response gene control of anti-viral antibody responses is observed. Neonatally infected BALB/c (H-2d) and C57BL/10 (B10,H-2b) mice are high responders and B10.A (H-2a) mice, congenic at the major histocompatibility complex (H-2) with B10, low responders. No correlation was found between the expression of any single gp70 or p15(E) epitope of the infecting MCF virus and the magnitude of the antibody response. This indicates that the level of the H-2 regulated anti-MuLV envelope antibody response is most likely determined by a MuLV antigen shared by all MuLV isolates examined. The magnitude of the antibody response against highly oncogenic and against poorly oncogenic MCF virus does not differ significantly. The combined data indicate that the intrinsic oncogenic potency encoded by the viral genome is a more important feature of oncogenesis than the level of antiviral envelope antibody response evoked by the MCF virus.

While effective in depressing the plasma proteinase activity of normal mice, treatment of mice bearing either the BCL1 leukemia or the B16-F10 melanoma with indomethacin did not depress the elevated plasma proteinase levels detected in tumor-bearing animals. Thus the elevation in proteinases detected in tumor-bearing animals may not be the result of increased prostaglandin synthesis and plasma proteinase activity in such disease states may be regulated differently than in normal mice.

Some known inhibitors block the lymphocyte activating factor (LAF/IL-1) but not the mononuclear cell factor (MCF/IL-1) measured by its capacity to stimulate prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and collagenase production. The presence of IL-1 in vivo may be difficult to detect due to the presence of inhibitor(s) and the level of the inhibitor(s) may vary depending upon pathological conditions. We have found that urine from three patients with monocytic leukemia (M5) contained high levels of inhibitor(s) of MCF/IL-1, whereas urine of normal subjects did not contain significant amounts. Urine from two patients with other blood neoplasic diseases also contained little inhibitory activity. The MCF/IL-1 inhibitor(s), which also acts on human recombinant IL-1 beta, is approximately 25-35 kD, is not retained on concanavalin A-Sepharose column and can be partially destroyed with urea and boiling. At this stage of the purification the fraction containing the MCF/IL-1 inhibitor(s) also inhibits the LAF/IL-1 assay.

Resting T cells do not express IL-2 receptors, but receptors are rapidly expressed on T cells following interaction of the antigen-specific T-cell-receptor complex with appropriately processed and presented antigens. Anti-Tac, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the IL-2 receptor, has been used to purify the receptor. The receptor is a 55-kDa glycoprotein comprised of 251 amino acids including a single 19-amino transmembrane domain and a short intracytoplasmic domain composed of 13 amino acids at the carboxy terminus. Normal resting T cells and most leukemic T-cell populations examined did not express IL-2 receptors; however, the leukemic cells of all patients with human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV-I)-associated adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) expressed the Tac antigen. In HTLV-I-infected cells, the 42-kDa long open reading frame (tat) protein encoded in part by the tat region of HTLV-I may act as a transacting activator that induces transcription of the IL-2-receptor gene, thus providing an explanation for the constant association of HTLV-I infection of lymphoid cells and IL-2-receptor expression. The constant display of large numbers of IL-2 receptors which may be aberrant in the ATL cells may play a role in the uncontrolled growth of these leukemic T cells. Patients with the Tac-positive ATL are being treated with both unmodified and toxin-conjugated forms of anti-Tac monoclonal antibody directed toward this growth factor receptor.","['Waldmann, T A']",['Waldmann TA'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis/immunology', 'DNA/analysis', 'Deltaretrovirus', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis/immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'T-Lymphocytes/*analysis', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7']",1986/04/15 00:00,1986/04/15 00:01,['1986/04/15 00:00'],"['1986/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1986 Apr 15;99(1):53-60. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(86)90215-7.,,,"['0008-8749(86)90215-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(86)90215-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,

To seek a direct biological effect of int-1 that would validate its proposed role as an oncogene, we constructed a retrovirus vector containing the gene and examined its effects on tissue culture cells. Expression of int-1 in a mammary epithelial cell line caused striking morphological changes, unrestricted growth at high cell density, and focus formation on a monolayer, although the cells were not tumorigenic in vivo. This partial transformation induced by int-1 was not observed in cells infected by an otherwise identical virus bearing a frameshift mutation in the gene.

Because this method is also time-consuming and subject to observer error, we have developed an automated method of quantitating drug cytotoxicity using a flow cytometric cell sorter (FCM). After incubation of drug-exposed tumor cells, acetaldehyde-fixed duck red blood cells (DRBC) are added. Dead tumor cells and the fixed DRBC are stained by the fluorescent dye propidium iodide, which penetrates dead cell membranes. A two-parameter analysis (cell size as measured by narrow angle light scatter vs propidium iodide fluorescence) enables determination of the live tumor cell:DRBC ratio. There was a strong correlation between the FCM method and manual counting (r = 0.958 for cell lines, r = 0.831 for fresh leukemic cells, P less than 0.0001 in both cases).

To investigate its mechanism of cytotoxicity, the effects of ditercalinium on DNA were assessed using normal (L1210) and drug-resistant (L1210/PyDi1) mouse leukemia cells. Alkaline elution assays demonstrated that ditercalinium produced no DNA strand breaks, DNA-protein cross-links, or DNA-DNA cross-links, eliminating these effects as cytotoxic lesions. This result sets ditercalinium apart from other intercalating agents with respect to its interaction with DNA. Nucleoids (histone-depleted chromatin) from ditercalinium-treated L1210 cells were considerably more compact than those from untreated cells, as determined by sedimentation in neutral sucrose gradients. In contrast, nucleoids from ditercalinium-treated L1210/PyDi1 (resistant) cells were similar in compactness to those from control cells. Thus, ditercalinium altered chromatin structure in vivo. The effect of the bisintercalator on purified DNA topoisomerase II, an intracellular target of monointercalators, was measured in vitro. Ditercalinium (5 X 10(-7) M) completely inhibited both the formation of covalent complexes between this enzyme and simian virus 40 DNA and the enzyme-induced DNA cleavage. In addition, ditercalinium induced DNA catenation in the presence of topoisomerase II and adenosine triphosphate. Thus, the cytotoxicity of ditercalinium may derive from a mechanism that, although involving topoisomerase II, is manifested by condensation of DNA rather than by the induction of protein-associated DNA strand breaks.","['Markovits, J', 'Pommier, Y', 'Mattern, M R', 'Esnault, C', 'Roques, B P', 'Le Pecq, J B', 'Kohn, K W']","['Markovits J', 'Pommier Y', 'Mattern MR', 'Esnault C', 'Roques BP', 'Le Pecq JB', 'Kohn KW']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'VFS4ZUK33P (ditercalinium)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Carbazoles/*pharmacology', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/pharmacology', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Intercalating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Nov;46(11):5821-6.,,,,,,,,,,

Cells exposed to NSC 368390 became depleted in intracellular pools of uridine 5'-triphosphate and cytidine 5'-triphosphate. Both uridine 5'-triphosphate and cytidine 5'-triphosphate were decreased to 50% of levels in control cells at 3 h and were undetectable at 15 h after addition of 25 microM of NSC 368390 to the cultures. Similar effects were observed in L1210 leukemia cells. Addition of 0.1 mM of uridine or cytidine restored intracellular pools of uridine 5'-triphosphate and cytidine 5'-triphosphate to control levels and rescued clone A cells from NSC 368390 cytotoxicity. Addition of uridine circumvented NSC 368390 cytotoxicity in L1210 cells, but addition of cytidine did not. This result is consistent with the fact that L1210 cells lack cytidine deaminase and thus cannot form uridine or its anabolites from cytidine. These results indicated that NSC 368390 inhibits a step in the de novo biosynthetic pathway leading to uridine 5'-monophosphate. Therefore, the effects of NSC 368390 on the six enzymes that comprise the de novo pathway leading to the formation of uridine 5'-monophosphate were examined. The results showed that NSC 368390 was a potent inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, the fourth enzyme in the pathway; thus, this study demonstrates that NSC 368390 exerts its tumoricidal effect by inhibiting a step in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis resulting in the depletion of critical precursors for RNA and DNA synthesis.","['Chen, S F', 'Ruben, R L', 'Dexter, D L']","['Chen SF', 'Ruben RL', 'Dexter DL']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Pyrimidine Nucleotides)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '5XL19F49H6 (brequinar)', 'EC 1.3.98.1 (Dihydroorotate Oxidase)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytidine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Dihydroorotate Oxidase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Pyrimidine Nucleotides/*biosynthesis', 'Uridine/metabolism/pharmacology']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Oct;46(10):5014-9.,,,,,,,,,,

Using somatic cell hybrid panels, the mammalian homologs of the 5' v-ets-domain, ets-1, were mapped to chromosome 11 in man, to chromosome 9 in mouse, and to chromosome D1 in cat. The mammalian homologs of the 3'v-ets domain, ets-2, were similarly mapped to human chromosome 21, to mouse chromosome 16, and to feline chromosome C2. We conclude that the ets sequence shared by the virus, chicken, and man is likely to contain at least two functionally dissociable domains, identifiable as ets-1 and ets-2. The human ets- locus is transcriptionally active and encodes a single mRNA of 6.8 kb, while the second locus, human ets-2 encodes three mRNAs of 4.7, 3.2 and 2.7 kb. By contrast, the chicken homolog, having a contiguous ets-1 and ets-2 sequence, is primarily expressed in normal chicken cells as a single 7.5 kb mRNA.

The feline and human sequences are colinear within the open reading frame for the putative c-myc product but show insertions and deletions relative to each other outside this domain. We have also analyzed a cloned FeLV provirus, CT4, which contains the host-derived myc gene. In this provirus the v-myc sequences are located at the 3' end of the pol gene, replacing pol and env sequences. Nucleotide sequence analysis of CT4 shows an open reading frame for a v-myc gene product which may be expressed without fusion to any viral protein sequences. This contrasts with another FeLV v-myc (LC), in which myc and gag sequences were found to be fused. Unlike previously identified avian v-myc genes, the feline v-myc genes contain exon 1-derived sequences, but these have been truncated or internally deleted. The FeLV CT4 v-myc sequence shows very few coding changes relative to c-myc and the FeLV LC v-myc coding sequence is unchanged relative to c-myc apart from fusion to gag.

The results of the deletion analysis demonstrate that the region of p37mos coding region upstream of the third methionine codon is dispensable with respect to transformation. However, deletion mutants of v-mos which allow initiation of translation at the fourth methionine codon have lost the biological activity of the parental v-mos gene. Furthermore, experiments were also carried out to define the C-terminal limit of the active region of p37mos by the construction of premature termination mutants by the insertion of a termination oligonucleotide. Insertion of the oligonucleotide just 69 base pairs upstream from the wild-type termination site abolished the focus-forming ability of v-mos.

These studies allowed us to distinguish three distinct expression classes of histone genes. The expression of the major replication-dependent class of histone genes was tightly linked to DNA synthesis. The concentrations of these transcripts decreased rapidly as cell division slowed during the process of differentiation. In contrast, the replication-independent H3.3 transcript levels were constitutively maintained throughout differentiation and were unaffected by inhibitors of DNA or protein synthesis. We also identified among the cloned histone genes used as probes a third expression class, the partially replication-dependent variants. Expression of these transcripts became transiently uncoupled from the reduced rate of DNA synthesis accompanying the early stages of differentiation. We show that their synthesis is sensitive to the DNA synthesis inhibitor hydroxyurea but that selective uncoupling from DNA synthesis of these histone mRNAs occurs at a specific stage of differentiation. We present several hypotheses to explain how this might be accomplished. The expression characteristics of the mRNAs studied coincided with those of the proteins for which they code, indicating that changes in the relative levels of the different variants is mediated at least in part by changes in mRNA levels.","['Brown, D T', 'Wellman, S E', 'Sittman, D B']","['Brown DT', 'Wellman SE', 'Sittman DB']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', '*Genes', 'Histones/*genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1985 Nov;5(11):2879-86. doi: 10.1128/mcb.5.11.2879-2886.1985.,['HD-17682/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,['10.1128/mcb.5.11.2879-2886.1985 [doi]'],,PMC369098,,,,,

This was accomplished by constructing a recombinant DNA clone containing the desired organization, introducing the recombinant DNA into mouse NIH 3T3 cells, and superinfecting the cells with replication-competent M-MuLV. The construction was designed so that an M-MuLV gag-myc fusion protein would be produced. The resulting virus, M-MuLV(myc), morphologically transformed uninfected NIH 3T3 cells. Stocks of M-MuLV(myc)-M-MuLV were infected into secondary mouse embryo cultures. M-MuLV(myc) induced striking growth and proliferation of hematopoietic cells. These cells were of the myeloid lineage by morphology, phagocytic properties, and surface staining with Mac-1 and Mac-2 monoclonal antibodies. They resembled mature macrophages, although they displayed minor properties of immaturity. The myeloid cells were transformed in comparison with uninfected myeloid cells since they were less adherent and had unlimited proliferative capacity and reduced growth factor requirements. The transformed myeloid cells with proliferative potential were actually myeloid progenitors which apparently underwent terminal differentiation to macrophages. It was possible to derive a permanent line of factor-independent macrophages from M-MuLV(myc)-transformed myeloid cells. M-MuLV(myc) also immortalized and morphologically transformed mouse embryo fibroblasts. These in vitro properties closely resembled the biological activity of MC29 virus in avian cells and suggested that the nature of the v-myc oncogene was an important determinant in transformation specificity. Neonatal NIH Swiss mice inoculated intraperitoneally with M-MuLV(myc)-M-MuLV only developed lymphoblastic lymphoma characteristic of the M-MuLV helper alone, and no acute fibrosarcomas or myeloid tumors resulted. In light of the strong myeloid transformation observed in vitro, the absence of acute in vivo myeloid disease was noteworthy. Interestingly, when a derivative of M-MuLV(myc) carried by a nonpathogenic amphotropic MuLV helper was inoculated, T lymphomas developed with long latency. Molecular hybridization confirmed that these tumors contained M-MuLV(myc).","['Brightman, B K', 'Pattengale, P K', 'Fan, H']","['Brightman BK', 'Pattengale PK', 'Fan H']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Fibroblasts/physiology', '*Genes, Viral', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/*genetics/physiology', '*Oncogenes', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1986 Oct;60(1):68-81. doi: 10.1128/JVI.60.1.68-81.1986.,"['2-T32-GM-07311-09/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'F33 CA 07968/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['10.1128/JVI.60.1.68-81.1986 [doi]'],,PMC253903,,,,,

Molecularly cloned FeLV-C-S proviral DNA yielded infectious virus (mcFeLV-C-S) after transfection of mammalian cells, and virus interference studies using transfection-derived virus demonstrated that our clone encodes FeLV belonging to the C subgroup. mcFeLV-C-S did not induce viremia in eight 8-week-old outbred specific-pathogen-free (SPF) cats. It did, however, induce viremia and a rapid, fatal aplastic anemia due to profound suppression of erythroid stem cell growth in 9 of 10 inoculated newborn, SPF cats within 3 to 8 weeks (21 to 58 days) postinoculation. Thus, the genome of mcFeLV-C-S encodes the determinants responsible for the genetically dominant induction of irreversible erythroid aplasia in outbred cats. A potential clue to the pathogenic determinants of this virus comes from previous work indicating that all FeLV isolates belonging to the C subgroup, an envelop-gene-determined property, and only those belonging to the C subgroup, are potent, consistent inducers of aplastic anemia in cats. To approach the molecular mechanism underlying the induction of this disease, we first determined the nucleotide sequence of the envelope genes and 3' long terminal repeat of FeLV-C-S and compared it with that of FeLV-B-Gardner-Arnstein (mcFeLV-B-GA), a subgroup-B feline leukemia virus that consistently induces a different disease, myelodysplastic anemia, in neonatal SPF cats. Our analysis revealed that the p15E genes and long terminal repeats of the two FeLV strains are highly homologous, whereas there are major differences in the gp70 proteins, including five regions of significant amino acid differences and apparent sequence substitution. Some of these changes are also reflected in predicted glycosylation sites; the gp70 protein of FeLV-B-GA has 11 potential glycosylation sites, only 8 of which are present in FeLV-C-S.","['Riedel, N', 'Hoover, E A', 'Gasper, P W', 'Nicolson, M O', 'Mullins, J I']","['Riedel N', 'Hoover EA', 'Gasper PW', 'Nicolson MO', 'Mullins JI']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/etiology/metabolism/*veterinary', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cat Diseases/*etiology/metabolism', 'Cats', 'Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics', 'Viremia/etiology/veterinary', 'Virus Cultivation']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1986 Oct;60(1):242-50. doi: 10.1128/JVI.60.1.242-250.1986.,['CA32563/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['10.1128/JVI.60.1.242-250.1986 [doi]'],,PMC253922,,,,['GENBANK/M14331'],

The HZ5-FeSV transforms fibroblasts in vitro and is replication defective. A biologically active integrated HZ5-FeSV provirus was molecularly cloned from cellular DNA of HZ5-FeSV-infected FRE-3A rat cells. The HZ5-FeSV has oncogene homology with the fms sequences of the SM-FeSV. The genome organization of the 8.6-kilobase HZ5-FeSV provirus is 5' delta gag-fms-delta pol-delta env 3'. The HZ5-and SM-FeSVs display indistinguishable in vitro transformation characteristics, and the structures of the gag-fms transforming genes in the two viruses are very similar. In the HZ5-FeSV and the SM-FeSV, identical c-fms and feline leukemia virus p10 sequences form the 5' gag-fms junction. With regard to v-fms the two viruses are homologous up to 11 amino acids before the C terminus of the SM-FeSV v-fms protein. In HZ5-FeSV a segment of 362 nucleotides then follows before the 3' recombination site with feline leukemia virus pol. The new 3' v-fms sequence encodes 27 amino acids before reaching a TGA termination signal. The relationship of this sequence with the recently characterized human c-fms sequence has been examined. The 3' HZ5-FeSV v-fms sequence is homologous with 3' c-fms sequences. A frameshift mutation (11-base-pair deletion) was found in the C-terminal fms coding sequence of the HZ5-FeSV. As a result, the HZ5-FeSV v-fms protein is predicted to be a C-terminally truncated version of c-fms. This frameshift mutation may determine the oncogenic properties of v-fms in the HZ5-FeSV.","['Besmer, P', 'Lader, E', 'George, P C', 'Bergold, P J', 'Qiu, F H', 'Zuckerman, E E', 'Hardy, W D']","['Besmer P', 'Lader E', 'George PC', 'Bergold PJ', 'Qiu FH', 'Zuckerman EE', 'Hardy WD']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cat Diseases/microbiology', 'Cats', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Fibrosarcoma/microbiology/veterinary', '*Genes, Viral', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Feline/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1986 Oct;60(1):194-203. doi: 10.1128/JVI.60.1.194-203.1986.,['CA32926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['10.1128/JVI.60.1.194-203.1986 [doi]'],,PMC253917,,,,"['GENBANK/M14290', 'GENBANK/M14291']",

A restriction fragment containing the v-erbB sequences from a molecular clone of avian erythroblastosis virus was inserted into a Moloney murine leukemia virus vector. The construct, designated MuLV/erbB, transformed NIH 3T3 cells at a high efficiency in the DNA transfection assay. Individual MuLV/erbB transfectants grew in soft agar and were tumorigenic. The transfectants contained v-erbB DNA sequences, expressed v-erbB-specific transcripts, and synthesized v-erbB-related glycoproteins. The majority of transfectants produced two major v-erbB gene products of 58 and 66 kilodaltons. However, some transfectants produced much smaller v-erbB-specific proteins. Tunicamycin experiments revealed that the size heterogeneity observed between different transfectants was not due to variations in glycoprotein processing, implying that, in some cases, alterations in the MuLV/erbB genome occurred during the transfection process. These findings indicate that expression of the complete v-erbB gene product is not required for transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. A transmissible murine v-erbB (M-erbB) virus was generated by infection of nonproducer transfectants with amphotrophic murine leukemia virus. Transmission of the rescued M-erbB virus was confirmed by DNA, RNA, and protein analyses. The introduction of a transforming v-erbB gene into mammalian cells by virus infection provides a means of analyzing the mechanism by which this epidermal growth factor receptor-related gene alters the growth and differentiation of cells from various lineages.","['Gazit, A', 'Pierce, J H', 'Kraus, M H', 'Di Fiore, P P', 'Pennington, C Y', 'Aaronson, S A']","['Gazit A', 'Pierce JH', 'Kraus MH', 'Di Fiore PP', 'Pennington CY', 'Aaronson SA']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Alpharetrovirus/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mink', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/genetics/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Species Specificity', 'Transfection', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*physiology']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1986 Oct;60(1):19-28. doi: 10.1128/JVI.60.1.19-28.1986.,,,['10.1128/JVI.60.1.19-28.1986 [doi]'],,PMC253897,,,,,

Generation and characterization of internal image tumor antigen.,1743-9,"The concept of idiotype vaccines against tumor-associated antigens (TAA) was tested in the DBA/2 L1210 lymphoma subline, L1210/GZL. Monoclonal antibodies against a TAA that cross-reacts with the envelope glycoprotein gp52 of the mammary tumor virus were used to make hybridoma anti-idiotype antibodies (Ab2). In this report we describe the characterization of monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies against the combining site of 11C1 (Ab1), which recognizes a shared determinant of gp52 of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) and the TAA of L1210/GZL. Hybridomas expressing the internal image of gp52 were screened by an idiotype inhibition assay. Mice sensitized with radiated L1210/GZL cells produced specific delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) against the Ab2 hybridoma. Five Ab2 hybridomas were selected and were used to immunize DBA/2 mice. Such immunized animals showed specific DTH reaction against a challenge with the L1210/GZL tumor cells. Similar results were obtained in mice immunized with purified Ab2. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis demonstrated that fluorescence staining of L1210/GZL cells by 11C1 can be completely inhibited with preabsorption on Ab2 hybridoma cells. Mice immunized with 2F10 and 3A4 coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) contained antibodies binding to MMTV. But only in mice immunized with 2F10-KLH was significant inhibition of L1210/GZL tumor growth observed. Collectively, these results indicate that certain anti-idiotypic antibodies can mimic the MMTV gp52 antigen, as well as the gp52-like epitope expressed on the L1210/GZL tumor cells. These properties of anti-idiotypic antibodies mimicking TAA could be exploited for making idiotype vaccines against tumors.","['Raychaudhuri, S', 'Saeki, Y', 'Fuji, H', 'Kohler, H']","['Raychaudhuri S', 'Saeki Y', 'Fuji H', 'Kohler H']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Viral, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Vaccines)', '0 (glycoprotein 52 antigen, Mouse mammary tumor virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', '*Antigens, Viral, Tumor', 'Cross Reactions', 'Hybridomas/immunology', 'Hypersensitivity, Delayed/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', 'Leukemia L1210/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Vaccines/*biosynthesis']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Sep 1;137(5):1743-9.,['CA26479/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

[Ca2+]i was selectively monitored and manipulated by the use of the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator and buffer quin2, while receptor-ligand internalization was studied directly by quantitative electron microscope autoradiography. Decreasing the [Ca2+]i up to 10-fold below resting level had no effect on the internalization of transferrin or insulin. Similarly, a 10-fold elevation of the [Ca2+]i using the calcium ionophore ionomycin caused little or no change in the endocytosis of the two ligands. In contrast, activation of protein kinase C by phorbol myristate acetate markedly stimulated the internalization of both occupied and unoccupied transferrin receptors, even in cells with very low [Ca2+]i. The insulin receptor was found to behave differently in response to phorbol myristate acetate, however, in that only the occupied receptors were stimulated to internalize. We conclude that the [Ca2+]i plays only a minor role in regulating receptor-mediated endocytosis, whereas protein kinase C can selectively modulate receptor internalization depending on receptor type and occupancy.","['Iacopetta, B', 'Carpentier, J L', 'Pozzan, T', 'Lew, D P', 'Gorden, P', 'Orci, L']","['Iacopetta B', 'Carpentier JL', 'Pozzan T', 'Lew DP', 'Gorden P', 'Orci L']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Insulin)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Insulin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/*physiology', 'Cell Line', '*Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'Insulin/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', 'Receptor, Insulin/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transferrin/*metabolism']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1986 Sep;103(3):851-6. doi: 10.1083/jcb.103.3.851.,,,['10.1083/jcb.103.3.851 [doi]'],,PMC2114273,,,,,

Cloning of the 5' terminus and the control segment of an interferon activated gene.,11849-58,"Treatment of cells with interferons induces various mRNAs and the corresponding proteins. We have described previously the isolation of a mouse cDNA clone (cDNA clone 202) which specifies an mRNA whose level is increased 20-fold in beta-interferon-treated Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. The increase is a consequence of an increased rate of transcription. The mRNA encodes a 56,000-dalton protein. We report here the isolation of a genomic clone including the 5' terminus of the 202 gene with the interferon-responsive region. Experiments involving primer extension and protection from cleavage by S1 nuclease revealed the existence of multiple 5' termini of 202 mRNAs in Ehrlich ascites tumor and Ltk- cells. Treatment with beta-interferon increased the level of these 202 mRNAs with different 5' termini nonuniformly. A 0.8-kilobase DNA segment from the 202 gene (including its 5' flanking region and its 5'-terminal exon) was ligated to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, and the resulting construct was transfected into mouse Ltk- cells. Treatment of these cells with beta-interferon increased the expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene 5-10-fold. Within the first, untranslated exon of the 202 gene, we found a 29-nucleotide long sequence that is partially homologous to sequences which occur upstream from interferon-inducible human HLA and metallothionein IIA genes (Friedman, R.

No correlation with decreased cell proliferation.,151-60,"Both phorbol ester or diacylglycerol (DAG) reduce cell surface transferrin receptor (TFR) number in CEM cells (a human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia line) and HL-60 cells (a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line). This effect occurs with a t1/2 of approx. 30 min and is mimicked by addition of phospholipase C to cell cultures. Although cell surface TFR number is reduced to 25-30% of the control level 5 h after phorbol ester administration, apparent cell proliferation (as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation) remains unaffected. Although independent of extracellular calcium (EGTA is slightly enhancing), the phenomenon is completely blocked by 30-min pretreatment with the calcium channel blocker diltiazem. Dilitazem pretreatment, while preventing receptor redistribution, does not completely block the phorbol ester-induced increase in TFR phosphorylation thought to be associated with receptor redistribution. Thus, calcium channel blockade effectively dissociates the effects of tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA) on TFR internalization and phosphorylation. Our results also demonstrate that phorbol ester-induced effects on the TFR can be mimicked by the endogenous stimulator of protein kinase C, DAG, whether added directly to cultures or produced by the cells in response to exogenous phospholipase C. Furthermore, the phenomenon of TFR redistribution here described is not associated with a decreased proliferative capacity.","['Neckers, L M', 'Vidal, C', 'McGlennen, R', 'Colamonici, O']","['Neckers LM', 'Vidal C', 'McGlennen R', 'Colamonici O']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EE92BBP03H (Diltiazem)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['*Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Diglycerides/pharmacology', 'Diltiazem/pharmacology', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Type C Phospholipases/pharmacology']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1986 Sep;166(1):151-60. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(86)90515-x.,,,"['0014-4827(86)90515-X [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(86)90515-x [doi]']",,,,,,,

We describe the isolation of temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of MH2 virus. As suggested by marker rescue experiments, one mutant bears a ts lesion in v-mil, whereas the other carries a mutation in v-myc. Ts v-mil MH2-transformed macrophages become factor-dependent at the non-permissive temperature (42 degrees C), while ts-v-myc MH2-transformed macrophages cease growing and acquire a more normal macrophage phenotype at 42 degrees C irrespective of the presence of cMGF. Both phenotypes can be reversed by backshift to the permissive temperature. These results suggest that the gene products of v-mil and v-myc function independently of each other and that v-mil is necessary for the maintenance of autocrine growth, whereas v-myc is required to maintain the transformed phenotype.","['von Weizsacker, F', 'Beug, H', 'Graf, T']","['von Weizsacker F', 'Beug H', 'Graf T']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics', 'Cell Division', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chickens', 'Genes', '*Genes, Viral', 'Kinetics', 'Macrophages/cytology', '*Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Temperature']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1986 Jul;5(7):1521-7.,,,,,PMC1166975,,,,,

There was no significant difference in the various types of leukemia. In patients with complete remission (CR) after treatment, their cyclic nucleotides were similar to those in normal subjects, but they remained abnormal in patients without clinical remission after treatment. In CR patients treated regularly for half a year, the cGMP level when first diagnosed was lower than that of patients who died soon or were unrelieved. Plasma cGMP level was negatively correlated to E-rosette forming cell (E-RFC) and cAMP/cGMP ratio was positively correlated to E-RFC.

A TSK 3000 SW (0.75 X 60 cm) HPLC size exclusion column was used to characterize specific 1,25(OH)2D3 binding. We show for the first time that this column is capable of resolving the 3.2-3.5S 1,25(OH)2D3 mammalian receptor (Rs = 32 A) from the 5.5-6.0S form of the mammalian serum 25(OH)D3 transport receptor (Rs = 40 A).

Receptors were not detected in the CEM line. 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibited cell proliferation of HT-39, HL-60, MCF-7 and Molt-4 cells by 20% to 70%. In contrast, mouse leukemia (L1210) cells were stimulated to proliferate by this hormone. Proliferation of RPMI and CEM cells was not affected by 1,25(OH)2D3. We demonstrate that size-exclusion HPLC of 1,25(OH)2D3 binding proteins from mammalian intestine and cancer cells provided a rapid method for identification of specific 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors. Furthermore, in the cells studied, the presence and concentration of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors qualitatively predicted the potency of this hormone to alter cell proliferation. We believe this assay will be useful for rapid analysis of human tumor receptor concentrations.","['Thomas, G A', 'Simpson, R U']","['Thomas GA', 'Simpson RU']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cancer Biochem Biophys,Cancer biochemistry biophysics,7506524,"['0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcitriol/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Intestines/analysis', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Receptors, Calcitriol', 'Receptors, Steroid/*analysis']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Biochem Biophys. 1986 Jul;8(3):221-34.,['CA36507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

AUL was diagnosed in nine patients according to stringent criteria. We combined both immunologic and molecular approaches to analyze further the ambiguous origin of AUL cells. Southern blot analysis revealed rearranged Ig heavy-chain genes in seven patients and indicated a biclonal or oligoclonal leukemic cell population in three of them, including one case of AUL with translocation (4;11). Analysis of cell surface markers showed expression of at least one early B cell-associated antigen (BA-1, BA-2, B4, UL-38) in six of these seven patients, with coexpression of a myeloid antigen (VIM-2) in three patients. Leukemic cells of two other patients neither exhibited Ig chain gene rearrangements nor expressed B cell-associated antigens. T cell receptor beta-chain genes showed germline configuration in all nine cases. Our results demonstrate heterogeneity among AUL patients based on molecular and surface marker analyses and suggest that most AUL blast cells are derived from a precursor cell that shares phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of early B cells with certain surface antigens of myeloid cells, in some cases of AUL more than one abnormal cell clone or subclone may exist, and the cellular origin, at least of some AULs exhibiting t(4;11), may be truly B cell lineage committed.","['Raghavachar, A', 'Bartram, C R', 'Ganser, A', 'Heil, G', 'Kleihauer, E', 'Kubanek, B']","['Raghavachar A', 'Bartram CR', 'Ganser A', 'Heil G', 'Kleihauer E', 'Kubanek B']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Clone Cells', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1986 Sep;68(3):658-62.,,,['S0006-4971(20)69006-1 [pii]'],,,,,,,

The latter is a good model of the inherited disease since neonatally infected cats die from wasting disease, like mutant op/op rats and children suffering from juvenile-malignant osteopetrosis. These similarities have prompted this review of retrovirus-induced osteopetrosis in animals.

N'AD formation is associated with the induced maturation of HL-60 cells and increased hormone production by GH3 cells during treatment with the nicotinamide derivative. N'AD is detected by HPLC analysis of cytoplasmic extracts as a peak which elutes near NAD. Four facts indicate that this compound is N'AD. First, a compound which elutes with identical time retention is produced by transglycosylation during reaction of NAD with pig brain NAD glycohydrolase in the presence of excess N'CH3NAm. Second, the putative N'AD is degraded by prolonged digestion with the NAD glycohydrolase to ADP-ribose. Third, N'AD formation is prevented by addition of nicotinamide along with N'CH3NAm to compete with binding of N'CH3NAm to the NAD glycohydrolase. Fourth, radioactive precursor labeling demonstrates that it contains adenosine, but it is not labeled by radioactive nicotinamide. The biological relevance of N'AD formation was evaluated. The appearance of N'AD precedes development of HL-60 maturation, and NAD levels increase, not decrease, as observed in other cell types, during treatment with N'CH3NAm. Therefore, we propose that N'AD, not the pyridine base itself, is the active species in inducing maturation. The results provide support of a role for NAD metabolism, probably ADP-ribosylation, in the regulation of HL-60 maturation and in hormone production by pituitary cells.","['Johnson, G S', 'Lucas, D L']","['Johnson GS', 'Lucas DL']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'UM47085BXC (N(1)-methylnicotinamide)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'NAD/*analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/metabolism', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Nucleotidyltransferases/metabolism', 'Pituitary Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases', 'Rats', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Time Factors']",1986/08/15 00:00,1986/08/15 00:01,['1986/08/15 00:00'],"['1986/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1986 Aug 15;249(1):148-53. doi: 10.1016/0003-9861(86)90569-2.,,,"['0003-9861(86)90569-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0003-9861(86)90569-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,

Fourteen independent clones of integrated M-PMV proviruses were isolated from a human embryo kidney cell line that had been previously derived from a single cell clone infected with M-PMV. Characterization of these clones for size of insert, restriction pattern of flanking DNA, and presence of repetitive DNA in the flanking sequences revealed that 10 of the isolates were identical while the four remaining clones were unique. Three independent clones of unintegrated M-PMV proviruses containing a single copy of the long terminal repeat (LTR) were cloned from acutely infected human embryo kidney cells, Transfection assays revealed that 13 of 14 integrated proviruses and 2 of 3 unintegrated proviruses were capable of producing infectious virus. One of the integrated provirus clones (clone 6A) produced consistently higher titers of virus than all of the other clones in all assays used and in two different cell lines, indicating that it contained a mutation that enhances virus replication. The virus recovered after transfection was shown to be capable of inducing cell fusion in nontransformed cell lines, confirming that this property is associated with M-PMV. One of the clones was hybridized under conditions of varying stringency, to molecular clones of type B, C, and D retroviruses. These studies revealed M-PMV to be most closely related to squirrel monkey retrovirus (D-type virus) and more distantly related to mouse mammary tumor virus (B-type virus). Hybridization was also detected with clones from the pol gene region of a family of human endogenous sequences. No homology was detected with Rous sarcoma virus or most mammalian C-type viruses tested. The exceptions were baboon endogenous virus and RD114 in which previously identified homology in the env gene was confirmed.

As other members of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus (Mo-MuSV) family, MPSV transforms fibroblasts in vitro and causes sarcomas in vivo. In addition, however, MPSV also causes an acute myeloproliferative disease in adult mice. The mos oncogene is essential for its transforming capacity, but sequences specific to the long terminal repeat (LTR) U3 region of MPSV account for its expanded target specificity as compared to Mo-MuSV (C. Stocking, R. Kollek, U. Bergholz, and W. Ostertag, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 5746-5750 (1985)). The U3 region of the LTR of MPSV is, however, closely related to that of the Mo-MuLV, and it appeared likely that the difference between MPSV and Mo-MuSV was caused by a divergent evolution of Mo-MuSV LTRs. In this paper, we show that this is not the case. The few nucleotide differences in the LTR between Mo-MuLV and MPSV are crucial for the expanded host range of MPSV.

In agreement with earlier studies, ecotropic viruses were detected from cells of both tissues in all mice tested, although only trace levels of ecotropic MuLV infectious centers were found with thymus cells from mice of this age. Polytropic MuLVs were not detected in mice less than 3 weeks of age; however, between the ages of 3 and 4 weeks, polytropic viruses were detectable in assays of spleen cells from 50% of the mice. No polytropic MuLVs were detected in assays of thymocytes from any mice of this age. Several polytropic MuLVs obtained from spleens of young mice were further characterized. All of the isolates were infectious for both mink and SC-1 (feral mouse) cells, and exhibited interference properties typical of polytropic MuLVs. However, none of the viruses induced obvious cytopathic effects (CPE) on mink cells. All of the viruses appeared antigenically similar with regard to their reactivities to a panel of 12 monoclonal antibodies directed at envelope antigens of polytropic MuLVs. RNase T1-resistant oligonucleotide analysis of a polytropic MuLV from a 26-day-old mouse indicated that its entire env gene was derived from nonecotropic sequences while the remainder of its genome was indistinguishable from the ecotropic parent. The isolate thus exhibited a genome structure typical of Class II polytropic MuLVs and is the first example of this type of MuLV isolated from AKR/J mice. Examination of polytropic MuLVs derived from the spleens and thymuses of 5- to 6-month-old mice indicated that only 2 of 10 isolates examined induced CPE on mink cells. Furthermore, most of the CPE-negative viruses isolated from spleen and thymus cells of these mice exhibited in vitro host ranges and antigenic reactivities similar to isolates from young mice, suggesting that this type of polytropic MuLV may originate in the spleen, subsequently spread to other tissues, and persist throughout the preleukemic period. The detection of polytropic viruses in a large proportion of very young mice is in contrast to previous studies which have not detected polytropic virus production in AKR mice less than 5 to 6 months of age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Evans, L H']",['Evans LH'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.13.- (exoribonuclease T)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Exoribonucleases/pharmacology', 'Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/immunology/pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Oligonucleotides/analysis', 'Spleen/microbiology', 'Thymus Gland/microbiology', 'Viral Interference']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1986 Aug;153(1):122-36. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(86)90013-9.,,,['10.1016/0042-6822(86)90013-9 [doi]'],,,,,,,

The pattern of DNA methylation of the viral genome remained unchanged when the cells were induced to differentiate into epithelial tissues. However, spontaneous M-MuLV expression was detected with differentiation of the cells. To determine to what extent the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) was responsible for this suppression in undifferentiated cells, I constructed plasmids in which neo was placed under the control of the promoter sequence of the dihydrofolate reductase gene or the M-MuLV LTR, and compared the biological activities of the plasmids in Ltk- cells and in undifferentiated teratocarcinoma cells. In Ltk- cells, these plasmids were highly efficient in making the cells resistant to selection by G418. However, in undifferentiated teratocarcinoma cells, the M-MuLV LTR promoted neo gene expression at only 10% of the expected efficiency, as compared with the expression of the neo gene under the control of the simian virus to or dihydrofolate reductase promoter.

We found that infection of these cultures with Harvey sarcoma virus (HaSV) profoundly enhanced the growth potential of the cells, resulting in the reproducible isolation of long-term cell lines. These HaSV-infected cells appeared to be phenotypically identical to the immune mast cells found in uninfected cultures as determined by biochemical, immunological, and cytological tests. Although the cells expressed protein p21Ha-ras at levels similar to those in HaSV-transformed fibroblasts, they continued to require IL-3 for growth in vitro. Similar IL-3-dependent, long-term mast cell lines were also cultured from the enlarged spleens present in HaSV-infected mice.

In addition not every mouse strain which shows some susceptibility to FXI-induced leukemia carries the susceptible gene at each of the multiple loci involved in the disease process.

In contrast, RSV rescued from these tumors (RSV-M) induced sarcomas that were transplantable to young but not to adult marmosets. The tumors induced by RSV-M and the transplants rapidly enlarged, metastasized to various organs, and killed the recipients 29-59 days post inoculation. Cell lines were readily established from all transplantable sarcomas. No virus expression was detected in transplantable tumor cell lines by electron microscopy or by biochemical and biological assays. However, RSV of the same subgroup as RSV-SR was rescued from both short-term and long-term tumor cell cultures by cocultivation with chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF). The rescued viruses transformed marmoset cells 100-fold more efficiently than CEF cells, although CEF cells remained permissive for virus replication. Cytogenetic studies revealed extensive chromosome abnormalities in tumor transplants but not in RSV-M-induced sarcomas. All cell lines were hyperploid and contained structurally abnormal, large metacentric and telocentric chromosomes. Immunologic studies failed to detect group-specific (gs) antigen of the avian sarcoma-leukemia complex in either RSV-M-induced, transformed cells or tumor transplants. By complement-dependent cytotoxicity assays, with the use of marmoset anti-gs serum, RSV-associated antigen could be detected on the surfaces of tumor cells. No differences in the expression of this antigen existed between transplantable and nontransplantable marmoset sarcomas. All transplantable cell lines contained abnormal amounts of lipids and glycogen in comparison to RSV-SR-induced tumors and normal marmoset cell lines. The glycogen was associated with unique cytoplasmic membrane complexes and was surrounded by either single- or double-membraned vesicles.","['Marczynska, B', 'Massey, R J']","['Marczynska B', 'Massey RJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Lipids)', '9005-79-2 (Glycogen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/*pathogenicity', 'Callitrichinae', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Glycogen/analysis', 'Lipids/analysis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/etiology/genetics/*pathology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1986 Aug;77(2):537-47.,['NCI-73-3219/CI/NCPDCID CDC HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it is of great interest to determine the influence of c-myc oncogene activation on cellular growth control, especially in primary cells. To facilitate the efficient transfer of an activated c-myc oncogene, we developed a mouse retrovirus that contains the c-myc protein-coding sequences and which can be transmitted in the presence of a Moloney murine leukemia virus helper or established as a helper-free stock with a retrovirus-packaging cell line. The virus can transform established lines of mouse fibroblasts to anchorage-independent growth; the transformed cells are tumorigenic in nude mice. However, the virus was not capable of inducing foci of transformed cells on confluent monolayers. In addition to studies on established cell lines, the effect of the c-myc retrovirus on primary cells was examined. Infection of bone marrow cells gave rise to partially transformed mononuclear phagocytes which were entirely dependent upon an exogenous supply of the monocyte-specific colony-stimulating factor CSF-1 for proliferation.

Human melanoma cells (line HMB2) were fused, using polyethylene glycol, with mouse NIH-3T3 cells which had been infected and transformed by the Harvey murine leukaemia and sarcoma virus complex (MLV and MSV). The heteropolykaryons obtained were co-cultivated with fresh NIH-3T3 cells; filtered (Millipore 0.22 micron) medium from these was used to infect further NIH-3T3 cells. In these cells after several passages, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotypes could be produced. These were infectious not only for mouse cells (manifesting the helper MLV), but also for human cells (HeLa, HEC human embryo fibroblasts, HMB2); they were not infectious for CCL64 (mink) or for Vero (African green monkey) cells. The presence of such VSV pseudotypes infectious for human cells indicated that a human ecotropic virus [provisionally named rescued human virus (RHV)] had been rescued by the fusion of human melanoma cells with MLV-infected mouse cells.

Similar to HTLV-I-infected lines derived from immunologically uncommitted lymphocytes, the transformed clones displayed blastogenic mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) responses to cells carrying any of the allelic variants of human HLA-D/DR antigens, including self. Although these two clones were originally able to provide allospecific help only to B cells expressing the DR1 antigen, after infection with HTLV-I they stimulated B cells of any HLA-D/DR phenotype to produce immunoglobulin in cultures. The helper inducer activity of the transformed clones remained susceptible to the effect of monoclonal antibody anti-LDA1 that inhibits the helper function of normal human T cells. One of these clones (207TK), which before infection specifically killed DR1-positive target cells, lost its killing ability. The other clone (19TK) although originally noncytotoxic, acquired natural killer-like function after transformation. Study of the rearrangement of the genes coding for the beta-chain of the T cell antigen receptor revealed no differences between the wild (noninfected) and mutant (infected) clones. There was, however, an increased level of this message, as well as of the message encoded by the beta-chain gene of HLA-DR in the mutant clones.

The work presented is an extension of a previous study demonstrating both complete inhibition of release of internalized human transferrin and a 50% reduction in the number of cell surface transferrin binding sites in K562 cells treated with monensin (Stein, B. S., Bensch, K. G., and Sussman, H. H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 14762-14772). The data directly reveal the existence of two distinct transferrin receptor recycling pathways. One pathway is monensin-sensitive and is felt to represent recycling of transferrin receptors through the Golgi apparatus, and the other pathway is monensin-resistant and most likely represents non-Golgi-mediated transferrin receptor recycling. A transferrin-free K562 cell culture system was developed and used to demonstrate that cell surface transferrin receptors can be endocytosed without antecedent ligand binding, indicating that there are factors other than transferrin binding which regulate receptor internalization. Evidence is presented suggesting that two transferrin receptor recycling pathways are also operant in K562 cells under ligand-free conditions, signifying that trafficking of receptor into either recycling pathway is not highly ligand-dependent.","['Stein, B S', 'Sussman, H H']","['Stein BS', 'Sussman HH']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Antibodies/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Endocytosis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Golgi Apparatus/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Transferrin/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1986/08/05 00:00,1986/08/05 00:01,['1986/08/05 00:00'],"['1986/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1986 Aug 5;261(22):10319-31.,"['CA09151/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA13533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['S0021-9258(18)67527-1 [pii]'],,,,,,,

This effect in vivo has been attributed to depressed liver protein synthesis, but this hypothesis has not been proved. To investigate this problem, human hepatoma (Hep G2) cells were continuously labeled for 4 h with 100 microCi/ml [35S]methionine in the absence or presence of graded amounts of ASNase (from 0.1 nM to 0.1 mM). Media and cell lysates were collected, immunoprecipitated with antialbumin or anti-TBG serum and protein A, and submitted to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were sliced, and the radioactivity was counted in a beta-counter. A dose-dependent inhibition of TBG and albumin biosynthesis (as well as of total protein synthesis) was demonstrable, but TBG appeared to be more sensitive to the action of the drug. In fact, TBG biosynthesis was reduced by 8% with 0.1 nM ASNase, while an effect on albumin was observed only at 1 nM ASNase; 50% inhibition was obtained with 30 nM ASNase in the case of TBG and with 800 nM in the case of albumin. At the highest concentration (0.1 mM), TBG biosynthesis was reduced by 94%, and albumin biosynthesis by 75%. ASNase also proved to have a time-dependent effect, as assessed by the measurement of radioimmunoassayable TBG in the media from Hep G2 cells grown in the presence of 10 nM ASNase for 1-4 days. The TBG concentration was progressively reduced, by 40% after 1 day to 85% after 4 days. In pulse-chase experiments, a reduction of total (intracellular plus secreted) immunoprecipitable TBG and, to a lesser extent, albumin was observed, suggesting that the drug also affected the catabolism of newly synthesized proteins. These results provide the first in vitro evidence that ASNase actually inhibits TBG biosynthesis. This effect is not specific for TBG, but this protein appears to be more susceptible than albumin to ASNase action. This can explain why in patients treated with ASNase for leukemia, a decrease in serum TBG concentrations has not always been associated with a reduction in serum albumin levels.","['Bartalena, L', 'Martino, E', 'Antonelli, A', 'Pacchiarotti, A', 'Robbins, J', 'Pinchera, A']","['Bartalena L', 'Martino E', 'Antonelli A', 'Pacchiarotti A', 'Robbins J', 'Pinchera A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Serum Albumin)', '0 (Thyroxine-Binding Proteins)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Asparaginase/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Replication', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Serum Albumin/*metabolism', 'Thyroxine-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Time Factors']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 1986 Sep;119(3):1185-8. doi: 10.1210/endo-119-3-1185.,,,['10.1210/endo-119-3-1185 [doi]'],,,,,,,

It is unresolved whether distinct subsets of progenitor cells exist with a unique responsiveness to one or other CSF or whether the macrophages produced by different CSFs are all functionally equivalent. However, it is shown here that various CSFs can generate from blast progenitor cells an intermediate macrophage progenitor cell whose growth is specifically inhibited by a substance in lectin-stimulated spleen cell-conditioned media.

While its amount has been shown to be related to the degree of resistance of such cells, its function in this phenomenon remains obscure. Because there are some biochemical and functional similarities between drug-resistant cells and differentiated cells, we asked if resistance-associated glycoproteins were also associated with cellular differentiation. Using three monoclonal antibodies against antigens known to be associated with differentiation and three monoclonal antibodies that distinguish our multiple drug-resistant human leukemic CEM/VLB100 cells from their drug-sensitive counterparts, we found that the resistant cells were neither altered in their apparent state of differentiation nor were they altered in their ability to respond to a differentiation stimulus with the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. We did find, however, that one antibody that recognizes the resistance-associated glycoprotein, Mr 180,000 glycoprotein (gp180), was only minimally altered in amount bound after treatment with the phorbol ester, but two other resistance-associated glycoproteins, Mr 155,000 glycoprotein (gp155) and, to a lesser extent, Mr 130,000 glycoprotein (gp130), were reduced in expression after this treatment.

This activity may be mediated by topoisomerase II, an enzyme capable of producing double strand breaks in mammalian cells. Two established tumor cell lines were examined to see whether polyamines, which alter DNA conformation and topoisomerase II activities, affected the cytotoxicity, strand scission, and antitumor efficacy of VP-16. L1210 murine leukemia and 8226 human myeloma cells were treated with alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) to reduce intracellular polyamine levels via inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase. The polyamines putrescine and spermidine were markedly reduced by a 48-h incubation with 50 microM DFMO. This DFMO concentration did not inhibit colony formation in either cell line, but did reduce the growth rate of both cultures. In contrast, VP-16 produced a dose-dependent inhibition of colony formation. This was especially marked in the 8226 cell line. This correlated with DNA single strand breaks (SSBs) detected by the alkaline elution technique. When cells previously treated with DFMO were exposed to VP-16, a synergistic inhibition of colony formation (determined by isobologram analysis) was observed.

As a first step in developing neuron type-selective, systemically non-toxic suicide transport agents, a prototype hybrid toxin consisting of ricin A-chain (RTA) disulfide coupled to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) was synthesized by first derivatizing WGA by reaction with N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)-propionate (SPDP) in the presence of N-acetylglucosamine and then formation of WGA-SS-RTA by mixing the derivatized WGA with reduced RTA. The ability of this conjugate to inhibit protein synthesis was tested on two cell lines in vitro; the ID50 was 0.2 nM using the K562 hematopoietic stem cell line and 0.02 nM for the 2a neuroblastoma cell line. Suicide transport activity was assessed by microinjection of hybrid into the cervical vagus nerve of rats. Intact WGA-SS-RTA, but not hybrid that was pretreated with dithiothreitol to uncouple RTA from the WGA carrier, reliably killed vagal motor neurons. Both intact and reduced hybrid killed vagal sensory neurons. Indirect peroxidase immunohistochemistry demonstrated transport of RTA to vagal sensory neurons and WGA to both vagal sensory and motor neurons.

Peripheral blood neutrophils from individual donors were lysed in sucrose-free media by either hypotonic shock or nitrogen cavitation. Using a novel two-gradient Percoll density centrifugation system, the granule-rich postnuclear supernatant was rapidly (ten minutes) and reproducibly resolved into 13 granule fractions (L1 through L8 and H1 through H5). Granule flotation and recentrifugation experiments on both continuous, self-generated and multiple-step gradients using individual and mixed isolated fractions demonstrated that the banding patterns were isopycnic and nonartifactual. Isolated granules were intact based on the findings that biochemical latency of several granule enzymes was greater than 95%, and thin-sectioned electron micrographs demonstrated intact granule profiles. Biochemical analyses of the granule marker proteins MPO, beta-glucuronidase, lysozyme, and lactoferrin indicated that a number of the fractions were related to the major azurophil and specific granule populations. Lactoferrin was found in ten of 13 fractions (L1 through L8, H1 to H2), whereas MPO was found in every fraction. Consistent with these biochemical data, all fractions exhibited varying degrees of heterogeneity based on ultrastructural morphology and cytochemistry, including diaminobenzidine (DAB) reactivity for peroxidase and periodate-thiocarbohydrazide-silver proteinate (PA-TCH-SP) staining for complex glycoconjugates. A variable but significant percentage (23% to 70%) of the granules in fractions L1 through L8 and H1 and H2 showed DAB reactivity, while about 90% of the granules in fractions H3 through H5 were peroxidase positive. These results demonstrated that DAB-reactive granules spanned the entire range of granule size and density. Ultrastructural PA-TCH-SP staining of isolated granule fractions revealed patterns similar to those of granules in intact neutrophils at different stages of development. Granules from human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) exhibited a surprisingly low density compared with typical azurophil granules from normal, mature neutrophils. The data suggest that both functional and maturational differences contribute to granule heterogeneity, and provide a new practical and conceptual framework for further defining the phenomenon of neutrophil granule heterogeneity.","['Rice, W G', 'Kinkade, J M Jr', 'Parmley, R T']","['Rice WG', 'Kinkade JM Jr', 'Parmley RT']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)']",IM,"['Cell Fractionation', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/ultrastructure', 'Glucuronidase/analysis', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Neutrophils/*ultrastructure', 'Peroxidase/analysis']",1986/08/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1986 Aug;68(2):541-55.,['CA22294/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['S0006-4971(20)69071-1 [pii]'],,,,,,,

The human promyelocytic cell line HL-60 was used since peripheral blood neutrophils are terminally differentiated and do not actively synthesize protein. Cells were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation and subcellular organelles in postnuclear supernatant separated on a discontinuous gradient of Percoll modified to resolve organelles important in protein synthesis. This Percoll gradient separated azurophilic granules from less dense organelles and partially separated the less dense organelles from one another. Approximate densities of organelles identified by electron microscopy and by biochemical markers are azurophilic granules, 1.102 g/mL; endoplasmic reticulum, 1.039 g/mL; Golgi apparatus, 1.032 g/mL; and plasma membrane, 1.027 g/mL. We validated the utility of this method of subcellular fractionation by examining intracellular transport of myeloperoxidase, a myeloid lysosomal enzyme present in azurophilic granules. The subunits of mature myeloperoxidase (molecular weight [mol wt] = 59,000 and 13,500) cosediment with biochemical markers for lysosomes, whereas the large-mol wt (89,000) precursor forms cosediments with biochemical markers of less dense organelles. Within the limits of assay sensitivity, the 89,000-mol wt precursor is enzymatically inactive and has no spectral evidence for a heme group, suggesting that precursors of myeloperoxidase may undergo proteolytic maturation in a prelysosomal compartment with concomitant incorporation of a heme group and acquisition of enzymatic activity. This system of analysis should be suitable for the identification, subcellular localization, and maturational analysis of other myeloid lysosomal enzymes as well as functionally important membrane proteins.","['Nauseef, W M', 'Clark, R A']","['Nauseef WM', 'Clark RA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['65455-52-9 (Percoll)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'FZ989GH94E (Povidone)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*ultrastructure', '*Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Line', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*ultrastructure', '*Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Lysosomes/*enzymology', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Organoids/*ultrastructure', 'Peroxidase/*biosynthesis', 'Povidone', 'Silicon Dioxide']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1986 Aug;68(2):442-9.,"['I01 BX000513/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'R01 AI020866/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 20866/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 34327/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,['S0006-4971(20)69057-7 [pii]'],,,,,,,

The rearrangement involved the integration of a retrovirus into the region of the gene corresponding to the sixth exon of the avian c-myb locus. The insertion is associated with the production of a truncated RNA and the introduction of a terminator codon at the juncture of the long terminal repeat and the c-myb locus. The properties of the NSF-60 cells were compared with those of other myeloid cell lines, and the known sequence of differentiation induced by interleukin 3. Similar to other myeloid cell lines, the NFS-60 cells do not terminally differentiate in response to interleukin 3, granulocyte/macrophage, or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor suggesting that the cells are transformed with regard to their ability to differentiate. The NFS-60 cells are totally dependent on interleukin 3 for growth and maintenance of viability in vitro but also proliferate in response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.

A control group of migrants from a nonendemic area of Japan, Niigata, had low rates of HTLV-I antibodies, suggesting that Hawaii per se is not an endemic area for HTLV-I. Factors that were significantly associated with seropositivity in the Okinawa migrant groups were years of residence in Japan before migration (issei) and age for offspring of Okinawa migrants (nisei). Antibody titer was highest in Okinawa lifetime residents, intermediate in migrants (issei), and significantly lower in offspring of Okinawa migrants (nisei), with increasing titer observed with advancing age in the offspring of the migrant group. Based on these data, infection within the household occurring early in life appears to be a major route of HTLV-I transmission and may help to explain the curious geographic clustering of this virus in certain locales. As yet to be defined cofactors, including sexual transmission and/or environmental exposures (e.g., particularly before age 20), also may contribute to HTLV-I seropositivity. The pattern of rising seroprevalence and titer with age in the offspring of migrants who resided all of their lives in Hawaii raises the possibility that HTLV-I infection acquired early in life may become dormant and reexpressed with reactivation of latently infected T cells. The importance of this model in the process of viral leukemogenesis is supported by recent reports of adult T-cell leukemia in offspring (nisei) of Okinawa migrants.","['Blattner, W A', 'Nomura, A', 'Clark, J W', 'Ho, G Y', 'Nakao, Y', 'Gallo, R', 'Robert-Guroff, M']","['Blattner WA', 'Nomura A', 'Clark JW', 'Ho GY', 'Nakao Y', 'Gallo R', 'Robert-Guroff M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antibodies, Viral/*analysis', '*Deltaretrovirus/immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Hawaii', 'Humans', 'Japan/ethnology', 'Male', 'Retroviridae Infections/*epidemiology/immunology/transmission']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Jul;83(13):4895-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.13.4895.,"['N01-CP-61060/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-33644/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['10.1073/pnas.83.13.4895 [doi]'],,PMC323850,,,,,

These patients were all the long-term survivors among 874 patients included in one of six trials between 1973 and 1981. All studies used combination chemotherapy with or without irradiation. Follow-up of the patients varied between 4 and 11 years. The estimated 5-year survival rate subsequent to discontinuation of therapy was 0.24, corresponding to a death rate of 0.25 per year or ten times greater than the expected mortality for persons of the same age group. This high mortality was primarily related to recurrent SCLC, the estimated cumulative risk of relapse reaching 46% at the time of the latest recurrence 5 years from diagnosis. The risk of relapse was generally independent of the pretreatment disease stage although it was reduced in patients with resectable disease and was greater in those with pretreatment liver or bone marrow metastases. Equal risks of relapse were related to the use of regimens with and without radiotherapy. The cumulative risk of relapse in patients surviving 3 years from initiation of the treatment was less than 15% and accordingly, 3 years of follow-up seems sufficient for comparison of long-term results obtained in different trials. The second factor resulting in death or disease was second cancer, for which the cumulated risk increased to 32%, the latest occurring 5.4 years from the diagnosis of SCLC. Five of these cases were non-small-cell lung cancers and three were secondary leukemias. The estimated mortality related to non-neoplastic conditions was just significantly greater than expected. In spite of the increased mortality in this series, 38 of 54 2-year disease-free survivors and 20 of 22 5-year survivors resumed a lifestyle similar to that before diagnosis of SCLC.","['Osterlind, K', 'Hansen, H H', 'Hansen, M', 'Dombernowsky, P']","['Osterlind K', 'Hansen HH', 'Hansen M', 'Dombernowsky P']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/drug therapy/*mortality/radiotherapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/secondary', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/*mortality/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary', 'Regression Analysis']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1986 Jul;4(7):1044-52. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1986.4.7.1044.,,,['10.1200/JCO.1986.4.7.1044 [doi]'],,,,,,,

Human GM-CSF also bound to primary human monocytes and to the myelogenous leukemia cell line, KG-1, but not to any of the murine cells known to express the murine GM-CSF receptor. In addition, although some murine T lymphomas can express the GM-CSF receptor, none of the human cell lines of T cell lineage that we examined bound iodinated human GM-CSF. Binding to all cell types was specific and saturable. Equilibrium binding studies revealed that on all cell types examined, GM-CSF bound to a single class of high affinity receptor (100-500 receptors per cell) with a Ka of 10(9)-10(10)/M. More extensive characterization with neutrophils and HL-60 cells showed that in both cases, binding of GM-CSF was rapid at 37 degrees C with a slow subsequent dissociation rate that exhibited marked biphasic kinetics. Among a panel of lymphokines and growth hormones, only human GM-CSF could compete for binding of human 125I-GM-CSF to these cells. GM-CSF can not only stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of granulocyte/macrophage precursor cells, but can modulate the functional activity of mature granulocytes and macrophages as well. No significant differences in the kinetic parameters of receptor binding were seen between mature neutrophils and the undifferentiated promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60, indicating that maturation-specific responses to GM-CSF are not mediated by overt changes in the binding characteristics of the hormone for its receptor.","['Park, L S', 'Friend, D', 'Gillis, S', 'Urdal, D L']","['Park LS', 'Friend D', 'Gillis S', 'Urdal DL']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoradiography', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*analysis/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*analysis', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1986 Jul 1;164(1):251-62. doi: 10.1084/jem.164.1.251.,,,['10.1084/jem.164.1.251 [doi]'],,PMC2188215,,,,,

Maternal antibody to ATLV decreased in all the infants, and was detectable in only three of 12 infants tested 6 months after birth. Reappearance of the antibody 9-18 months after birth was observed in only four of the 16 infants. The ATLV-bearing cells in peripheral blood were detected in all 16 mothers after delivery. None of the 16 infants showed ATLV-bearing cells in peripheral or cord blood sampled at birth, or 1, 3 or 6 months after birth. However, virus-bearing cells in the blood became detectable 9-18 months after birth in 13 of the 16 infants. Maternal antibody and virus-bearing cells were never detected in a control group of seven infants of ATLV-seronegative mothers. These findings provide evidence for the high incidence of primary ATLV infection during early infancy among infants born to ATLV-seropositive mothers and suggest maternal viral transmission. Furthermore, samples of breast milk from all 12 seropositive mothers examined contained cell-associated ATLV capable of being transmitted to peripheral leucocytes of neonates. This finding suggests that one of the possible maternal transmission routes of ATLV is via breast milk.","['Nakano, S', 'Ando, Y', 'Saito, K', 'Moriyama, I', 'Ichijo, M', 'Toyama, T', 'Sugamura, K', 'Imai, J', 'Hinuma, Y']","['Nakano S', 'Ando Y', 'Saito K', 'Moriyama I', 'Ichijo M', 'Toyama T', 'Sugamura K', 'Imai J', 'Hinuma Y']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Infect,The Journal of infection,7908424,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Breast Feeding', 'Deltaretrovirus/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Japan', 'Leukemia/*transmission', 'Milk, Human/immunology/microbiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*transmission', '*T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Infect. 1986 May;12(3):205-12. doi: 10.1016/s0163-4453(86)94086-7.,,,"['S0163-4453(86)94086-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0163-4453(86)94086-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,

The results demonstrate that in some instances (two of 12 tumor extracts tested), recombinant viruses can be recovered from primary Cas-Br-M-induced tumors that will induce lymphomas of single lineages in mice inoculated as newborns. One of these viruses is a recombinant mink cell focus-forming virus that induces T cell lymphomas, and the other is a replication-defective, fibroblast-transforming virus that induces early B lineage lymphomas in mice.

Analyses of the subpopulations of T4- (and predominantly Leu-2+) cells defined by the Leu-15 or Lyt-1 (9.3) monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that T4-Leu-15- and T4-Lyt-1+ cells displayed high 5'NT activity, whereas virtually no activity was present in T4-Leu-15+ and T4-Lyt-1-cells.

The enzymatic activity was significantly lower in these patients than in normal controls. This study provides new cytochemical evidence demonstrating the heterogeneity of Leu-2+/T8+ cells, and indicates that the population with the suppressor phenotype and function (Leu-15+/Lyt-1-, GL morphology) displays low or absent 5'NT activity, whereas the population composed of cytotoxic cell precursors (Leu-15-/Lyt-1+, nongranular morphology) has high 5'NT activity.

Affinity chromatography of solubilized extracts of K562 cells surface-labeled with 125I was performed using bovine transferrin- and human transferrin-Sepharose 4B resins. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of resin eluates reveal that bovine transferrin specifically binds a Mr = 188,000 protein which dissociates into a Mr = 94,000 protein under reducing conditions, a finding identical to what is seen with human transferrin. The Mr = 94,000 reduced protein isolated by bovine transferrin resin shows an identical one-dimensional partial proteolytic digestion map with that of the human transferrin receptor. Unlabeled bovine transferrin was shown to specifically compete 125I-labeled human transferrin from the human transferrin receptor on the surface of K562 cells at 4 degrees C in a similar manner as unlabeled human transferrin; however, approximately a 2,000-fold higher concentration of bovine ligand was required to achieve comparable competition (50% inhibition of binding). Indirect immunofluorescence cytolocalization of bovine transferrin in K562 cells grown in serum-free medium supplemented with ferric bovine transferrin reveal patterns similar to those seen for human transferrin (both focal perinuclear and diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence).

The uptake of iron from transferrin was limited by the level of endocytosis of transferrin during the initial phase of culture and the number of transferrin receptors at the cell surface during the latter stages of erythroid maturation of these cells.","['Sawyer, S T', 'Krantz, S B']","['Sawyer ST', 'Krantz SB']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Iron Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Endocytosis', '*Erythrocyte Aging', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism/microbiology', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Iron Radioisotopes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Transferrin/metabolism']",1986/07/15 00:00,1986/07/15 00:01,['1986/07/15 00:00'],"['1986/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1986 Jul 15;261(20):9187-95.,"['AM-15555/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AM-07186/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,['S0021-9258(18)67637-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,

The processing of myeloperoxidase in human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells was studied by pulse-labeling cells in culture with [35S]methionine followed by immunoprecipitation and identification of myeloperoxidase polypeptides from cell fractions after various chase intervals. These studies revealed the presence of a previously unidentified intermediate with Mr 74,000 which kinetically followed the appearance of a larger Mr 81,000 intermediate. Using an in vitro lysosomal preparation the newly identified Mr 74,000 intermediate was directly converted within protected granules to mature forms of myeloperoxidase (Mr 63,000 and 60,000). This conversion occurred optimally at pH 7.5 and was not inhibited by lysosomotropic agents (chloroquine, NH4Cl) or protonophores (monensin, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone). Furthermore, the uptake of radiolabeled amines indicated a neutral intragranular environment (pH 7.35-7.67) which remained unchanged in the presence and absence of 1 mM ATP or 2.5 microM carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone.

Ten SPF 9-week-old kittens were infected on day 0 with 10(6) ffu FeLV and subsequently inoculated i.m. with MAbs every 2 days over a 20-day period at different times after infection. The results clearly show that no protection was achieved. It is unlikely that the amount of VN antibodies, the mode and route of their application or the infectious dose of FeLV used can account for the failure to protect cats against infection. Other possibilities which may explain the lack of protective effect are that the restricted epitope specificity of the MAb preparation used may have led to selection of neutralization-resistant virus mutants, or that other mechanisms than virus neutralization (complement-mediated lysis, antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity), that may be involved in protection, function less efficiently with MAb. However, in the light of our finding that an early anti-idiotypic response is observed in all cats following administration of the MAb preparation, the rapid clearance of anti-FeLV MAb from the circulation is a more likely explanation. The data presented support our hypothesis that by administration of MAb-as compared to polyclonal antibody-a more vigorous anti-idiotypic response is elicited due to the presentation of only a limited set of idiotopes. This potential drawback of rapid clearance of MAbs as a consequence of an anti-idiotypic response might be overcome by the use of mixtures of MAbs resulting in a more heterogeneous set of idiotypic determinants.","['Weijer, K', 'UytdeHaag, F G', 'Jarrett, O', 'Lutz, H', 'Osterhaus, A D']","['Weijer K', 'UytdeHaag FG', 'Jarrett O', 'Lutz H', 'Osterhaus AD']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/analysis/biosynthesis/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis/immunology', 'Cats', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Neutralization Tests']",1986/07/15 00:00,1986/07/15 00:01,['1986/07/15 00:00'],"['1986/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1986 Jul 15;38(1):81-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910380114.,,,['10.1002/ijc.2910380114 [doi]'],,,,,,,

As expected, most lymphoma patients showed markedly elevated anti-VCA IgG and anti-EA IgG antibody titers. Only one patient in the NHL group (n = 56) consisting of patients with lymphomas other than chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and hairy-cell leukemia (HCL), and 3 patients with HCL (n = 19) had high antibody titers of the IgA class to VCA and EA. Seventeen out of 48 patients (36%) with CLL had high IgA anti-VCA titers and 10 of these sera (21%) also contained IgA anti-EA. The geometric mean titer (GMT) of IgA anti-VCA was 2,510, the GMT of IgA anti-EA was 780. These antibody titers were about 10 times lower than the corresponding GMT of the NPC patients investigated in this study. The elevated IgG and IgA antibody titers to VCA and EA in CLL and HCL patients seem to reflect an immunodeficiency secondary to the malignant disease leading to reactivation of latent EBV infection.

A molecular analysis.,905-11,"We report the molecular analysis of primary cells from four cases of human B-cell malignancies each with an 8;14 chromosomal translocation involving the c-myc proto-oncogene and the immunoglobulin (Ig) gene cluster. In two cases of B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) the c-myc is truncated, rearranged into the Ig C alpha 1 locus and over-expressed in two abnormal mRNAs of approximately 2.0 and 2.8 kb. Conversely, in two cases of B-cell lymphoma progressed into leukemia the c-myc locus was translocated intact in its coding and 5'-flanking region into an Ig region different from C alpha 1, and over-expressed in two normal mRNA species. Cloning and sequencing of the breakpoint region on chromosome 14q+ from one of the two B-ALL cases showed that the myc gene is truncated 1077 nucleotides upstream from the translation start site, and rearranged in the opposite transcriptional orientation into an Ig class-switch segment approximately 4.8 kb upstream from the C alpha 1 gene. The c-myc anti-sense strand contains two class-switch recombination consensus sequences in the immediate boundaries of the breakpoint on chromosome 8: this allows us to postulate that an erroneous, class-switch-like recombination between Ig and myc sequences gave rise to the chromosomal translocation. Furthermore, we report 13 point mutations clustered in a region spanning from the first intron to the second exon of the translocated c-myc gene, five of which cause amino acid changes leading to an abnormal myc protein.

The inhibitory activity vs DNA and/or RNA synthesis is compared with the activity against growth of E. coli and against herpes simplex virus type I (HSV).

Recombinant retroviruses containing intact or spliced CRPV sequences can now be used to introduce the viral genes efficiently into a variety of cell lines.","['Danos, O', 'Mulligan, R C', 'Yaniv, M']","['Danos O', 'Mulligan RC', 'Yaniv M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Ciba Found Symp,Ciba Foundation symposium,0356636,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cottontail rabbit papillomavirus/*genetics', 'DNA/analysis/genetics', '*DNA, Recombinant', 'DNA, Viral/analysis/genetics', '*Genes, Viral', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Papillomaviridae/*genetics', 'Plasmids', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Rabbits', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ciba Found Symp. 1986;120:68-82. doi: 10.1002/9780470513309.ch6.,,,['10.1002/9780470513309.ch6 [doi]'],,,,,,,

In addition to the traditional cell surface markers, i.e., surface membrane immunoglobulin and receptors for sheep erythrocytes that define B and T lymphocytes, highly specific monoclonal antibodies have been developed that discriminate various stages of human lymphocyte and granulocyte differentiation. Explorations of the detailed phenotypes of leukemic cells in relation to normal hemopoietic differentiation reveal that consistent, composite phenotypes of different subclasses of lymphoid malignancies closely mimic those of corresponding normal cells at equivalent levels of maturation. This is exemplified in lymphoma cells (chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B or T type, Sezary Syndrome, immunocytoma) that resemble mature and immunocompetent T and B cells, in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) (equivalent to thymus cells) and in non-T ALL (corresponding to lymphoid progenitor cells in the bone marrow). The major phenotypes documented in different leukemias represent the level of maturation arrest imposed on the dominant subclone; this is determined by, but not necessarily synonymous with, the target cell and associated clonogenic cell population in the leukemia. The clinical significance of immunodiagnosis of leukemia cell types becomes best evidenced in acute leukemias. Besides the improvement of diagnosis by using objective criteria, clinically useful subclassifications became evident: five major subtypes of ALL are now recognized, including unclassified or null ALL, common ALL, pre-B-ALL, B-ALL and pre-T/T-ALL. In addition to disclosing that ALL is an heterogeneous disease, such classifications have proved to be prognostically significant. This is exemplified in 248 children and 145 adults with ALL which were analysed for cell type and clinical data. In addition to their utility in leukemia classification, monoclonal antibodies that identify leukemia associated antigens are becoming used therapeutically, e.g., to lyse residual leukemia cells from remission bone marrows removed from leukemia patients before reinfusion. New approaches to the treatment of leukemia in which the objective is to encourage maturation of leukemia cells rather than to achieve leukemia eradication, can be monitored by phenotyping the alterations of the cell surface, and cell markers may hopefully be useful in identifying cell types that can be induced to differentiate.","['Thiel, E']",['Thiel E'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '3252-36-6 (5-bromo-4-chloroindoxyl acetate)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'EC 3.1.3.- (Nucleotidases)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)"", 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase"", 'Acid Phosphatase/analysis', 'Adenosine Deaminase/analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aneuploidy', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Blood Platelets/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'Indoles/analysis', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/classification/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Muramidase/analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Neprilysin', 'Nucleotidases/analysis', 'Periodic Acid-Schiff Reaction', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'Receptors, Complement/analysis', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis', 'Rosette Formation', 'Sex Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 1985;2(3):209-60. doi: 10.1016/s1040-8428(85)80003-2.,,308,"['S1040-8428(85)80003-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s1040-8428(85)80003-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,

Molecular genetic studies have provided insight into the events occurring at the DNA level in these gene regions.

Using biochemical and ultrahistochemical techniques, the following differences from normal eosinophil development were demonstrated. First, both myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase coexisted in the population of maturing HL-60 eosinophils. Second, the granules formed from the condensation of material in vacuoles which were derived from dilated segments of the endoplasmic reticulum; the role of the Golgi apparatus in processing of peroxidase appeared minimal. Third, low levels of lysophospholipase and arylsulfatase were present in the cells compared to normal eosinophils. Finally, crystallizations resembling precursor structures of Auer rods appeared in the granules of about 5% of the cells.

In the present study, a series of such neoplasms was analyzed to reveal the developmental association of the expression of stage-related cell surface markers and T cell receptor gene rearrangement. Rearrangements of the T cell receptor beta-chain (T beta) gene were found in most, but not all, cases (88%) of T cell lymphoblastic neoplasms. T beta gene rearrangement preceded surface expression of the T cell receptor-linked molecular complex T3. Of all monoclonal anti-T cell antibodies tested, only antibody 3A1 was capable of reacting with neoplastic cells from all cases irrespective of the occurrence of T cell receptor gene rearrangements. In contrast, markers T1 and T11, normally expressed by mature T cells, were absent from the neoplastic cells in many cases (73% and 60% positive cases, respectively). Thus, antibody 3A1 is a valuable probe for the identification of T lymphoblastic neoplasms since its target antigen is consistently expressed and does not require prior T beta gene rearrangement. Furthermore, expression of 3A1 prior to T beta gene rearrangement suggests that it may be a cell surface protein that participates in the triggering of T cell receptor gene rearrangement and expression. It is concluded that precursor T cell neoplasms display an early T cell development hierarchy that, in sequence, consists of 3A1 expression, T beta gene rearrangements, and surface T3 expression.","['Pittaluga, S', 'Raffeld, M', 'Lipford, E H', 'Cossman, J']","['Pittaluga S', 'Raffeld M', 'Lipford EH', 'Cossman J']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1986 Jul;68(1):134-9.,,,['S0006-4971(20)69864-0 [pii]'],,,,,,,

This question may be seen as part of the more general question of whether there are intrinsic variations in the structures of receptors for a given class of steroids in different healthy tissues, in healthy vs. malignant tissues or in different types of tumors. Our experimental approach to these questions has involved the stabilization and precise physicochemical characterization of the receptors. To date, we have studied the estrogen and progestin receptors from human breast cancers and benign and malignant gynecologic specimens and the glucocorticoid receptors from several healthy and malignant rodent tissues and from normal human lymphocytes and various types of leukemic cells. Chromatographic and ultracentrifugal analyses in buffers of low ionic strength, containing 20 mM Na2MoO4 as the stabilizer, have revealed each of these receptors to be a large, oligomeric complex, characterized by remarkably similar values of the Stokes radius, sedimentation coefficient, molecular weight and axial ratio. In the absence of adequate stabilization, however, we found that the receptors for three classes of steroids in extracts of some healthy, steroid-responsive tissues, such as rat kidney and human uterine endometrium, are invariably degraded by endogenous proteinases. The extent of such cleavage is increased considerably by freezing the tissues prior to homogenization. Studies designed to distinguish the intact receptors from the products of proteolysis have included the characterization of receptors in cytosols prepared from mixtures of rat liver and kidney. The results strongly support the interpretation that the smaller size of the receptors detected in kidney cytosol reflects their cleavage by the more active proteinases in that tissue. The sizes and shapes of the receptors in cytosols from various tissues were found to be correlated with the activities of specific endopeptidases, assayed fluorometrically with peptidyl derivatives of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC). These studies suggested that the receptors are vulnerable to cleavage by ""lysine-specific"" endopeptidases, detected with t-butyloxycarbonyl-L-valyl-L-leucyl-L-lysyl-AMC. An enzyme of this specificity was partially purified from rat kidney cytosol and tested for its ability to digest the glucocorticoid receptors from rat liver cytosol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Sherman, M R', 'Tuazon, F B', 'Stevens, Y W', 'Carlino, J A', 'Niu, E M']","['Sherman MR', 'Tuazon FB', 'Stevens YW', 'Carlino JA', 'Niu EM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '14259-85-9 (molybdate)', '81AH48963U (Molybdenum)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'J97339NR3V (leupeptin)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Breast/analysis', 'Breast Neoplasms/analysis', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Cytosol/analysis', 'Drug Resistance', 'Endometrium/analysis', 'Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney/analysis', 'Leukemia/analysis', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Liver/analysis', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Male', 'Molybdenum/pharmacology', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Protein Conformation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*physiology', 'Receptors, Estrogen/physiology', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/physiology', 'Receptors, Progesterone/physiology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Ultracentrifugation', 'Uterine Neoplasms/analysis']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1986;196:23-51. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4684-5101-6_3.,"['CA-28392/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29564/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32178/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",52,['10.1007/978-1-4684-5101-6_3 [doi]'],,,,,,,

Neither adenoma nor hyperplasia of the parathyroid glands was found in any case.

One of the cats infected members of four consecutive litters of kittens which subsequently became persistently viraemic and transmitted the virus to other susceptible kittens by contact. Shortly after birth its kittens were apparently FeLV-free since neither viral antigen nor infectious virus was detected in their blood and no virus was found in cell cultures made from aspirates of bone marrow. The kittens became viraemic from 45 days of age onwards at a time when their passively acquired colostral FeLV neutralising antibodies were no longer detectable. Transmission of the virus occurred via the milk since both FeLV antigen and infectious virus were found in milk samples taken six weeks after kittening and the virus was transmitted to a fostered kitten. Eleven weeks after the birth of the fourth litter the cat became viraemic. The intermittent presence of FeLV antigens detected by the Leukassay F test, but not infectious virus, in the plasma of this cat over the previous months and a low level of serum neutralising antibodies distinguished it from four other latently infected queens which did not transmit infection to their kittens.

The parental vector we have chosen [pZIP-NeoSV(X)1] expresses a dominant selectable marker for neomycin resistance and is a shuttle vector capable of propagation in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, thus facilitating its use in structure-function studies. To address the relationship between polyoma T-antigen tumorigenesis and the effects of individual T antigens on growth control and differentiation, we used these vectors to introduce and stably express large, middle-sized, or small T antigens into mouse fibroblasts and preadipocytes. All cDNAs introduced into the vector are expressed stably even in the absence of selective pressure. The stable expression of small T antigen is noted particularly because cell lines expressing small T antigen have not been readily available prior to the use of retroviral vectors. Small T antigen-induced increase in saturation density of NIH 3T3 cells can be scored on the basis of the morphology of drug-resistant colonies. Middle-sized T antigen eliminates the growth requirement of NIH 3T3 cells for epidermal growth factor in a defined medium and permits growth in platelet-poor plasma, indicating elimination of the platelet-derived growth factor requirement as well. Large T antigen suppresses mouse preadipocyte (3T3-F442A) differentiation. These vectors and these functional assays of T-antigen activity permit genetic analysis of the relationship between tumorigenesis by T antigens and the alteration of cellular growth and differentiation.","['Cherington, V', 'Morgan, B', 'Spiegelman, B M', 'Roberts, T M']","['Cherington V', 'Morgan B', 'Spiegelman BM', 'Roberts TM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, Viral, Tumor)', '0 (Growth Substances)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/cytology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral, Tumor/*genetics', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Viral', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Growth Substances/physiology', 'Mice', 'Polyomavirus/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Jun;83(12):4307-11. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.12.4307.,"['AM06668/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA30002/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['10.1073/pnas.83.12.4307 [doi]'],,PMC323721,,,,,

This translocation creates a chimeric gene composed of breakpoint-cluster-region (bcr) sequences from chromosome 22 fused to a portion of the abl oncogene on chromosome 9. The resulting gene product (P210c-abl) resembles the transforming protein of the Abelson murine leukemia virus in its structure and tyrosine kinase activity. P210c-abl is expressed in Ph1-positive cell lines of myeloid lineage and in clinical specimens with myeloid predominance. We show here that Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-lymphocyte lines that retain Ph1 can express P210c-abl. The level of expression in these B-cell lines is generally lower and more variable than that observed for myeloid lines. Protein expression is not related to amplification of the abl gene but to variation in the level of bcr-abl mRNA produced from a single Ph1 template.","['Konopka, J B', 'Clark, S', 'McLaughlin, J', 'Nitta, M', 'Kato, Y', 'Strife, A', 'Clarkson, B', 'Witte, O N']","['Konopka JB', 'Clark S', 'McLaughlin J', 'Nitta M', 'Kato Y', 'Strife A', 'Clarkson B', 'Witte ON']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Jun;83(11):4049-52. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.11.4049.,['GM07185/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,['10.1073/pnas.83.11.4049 [doi]'],,PMC323663,,,,,

In addition, we found negligible p53 mRNA and protein expression in a variety of human myeloid leukemia lines blocked at different stages of differentiation. Southern blot analysis showed that, except for the HL-60 cells, the p53 gene of the myeloid cell lines was intact.

LINE members may be currently mobile since their presence or absence causes allelic variation at three single copy loci (2, 3): insulin 1, Moloney leukemia virus integration 2 (Mlvi-2) (4), and immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh). To characterize target sites for LINE insertion, we compared the DNA sequences of the unoccupied Mlvi-2 target site, its LINE-containing allele, and several other LINE-containing sites. Although not homologous overall, the target sites share three characteristics: First, depending on the site, they are from 68% to 86% (A+T) compared to 58% (A+T) for total rat DNA (5). Depending on the site, a 7- to 15-bp target site sequence becomes duplicated and flanks the inserted LINE member. The second is a version (0 or 1 mismatch) of the hexanucleotide, TACTCA, which is also present in the LINE member, in a highly conserved region located just before the A-rich right end of the LINE member. The third is a stretch of alternating purine/pyrimidine (PQ). The A-rich right ends of different LINE members vary in length and composition, and the sequence of a particularly long one suggests that it contains the A-rich target site from a previous transposition.","['Furano, A V', 'Somerville, C C', 'Tsichlis, P N', ""D'Ambrosio, E""]","['Furano AV', 'Somerville CC', 'Tsichlis PN', ""D'Ambrosio E""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*DNA Transposable Elements', 'Gene Amplification', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Rats/*genetics', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1986/05/12 00:00,1986/05/12 00:01,['1986/05/12 00:00'],"['1986/05/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/12 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1986 May 12;14(9):3717-27. doi: 10.1093/nar/14.9.3717.,"['CA-06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-38047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-05539/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,['10.1093/nar/14.9.3717 [doi]'],,PMC339810,,,,"['GENBANK/X03855', 'GENBANK/X03856', 'GENBANK/X03857']",

In both spontaneous and radiation-induced thymomas 86Rb uptake, ATP hydrolysis and 3H-ouabain binding per cell were higher than in normal thymuses. Likewise, alkaline phosphatase activity per cell was higher in thymomas than in thymuses; this increase was accompanied by the appearance of additional isoenzyme(s) (1 in AKR, 2 in C57Bl). These changes were compared with cAMP content and 3H-thymidine incorporation, taken as indicators of the proliferative activity, and their high correlation in both AKR and C57Bl mice allowed to distinguish a pre-leukemic period.

Karyotypic analysis identified a consistent chromosome 1q+ abnormality which was not found in any of the parental cells examined.

Pretreatment of K562 target cells with intact alpha Fc gamma R mAb or its Fab fragment or anti-transferrin receptor (alpha TFR) mAb partially blocked in a dose-dependent manner, NK activity to K562 cells. However, combined pretreatment with alpha Fc gamma R and alpha TFR mAb completely blocked NK activity against K562 targets. As compared with K562 cells, lower levels of NK were elicited against Molt-4, U937, HL-60, and Daudi targets. Although NK activity to Molt-4 targets was not affected by alpha Fc gamma R mAb, it was fully prevented by pretreatment with alpha TFR mAb. In contrast, NK to U937 cells was not influenced by alpha TFR mAb, but it was strongly inhibited by alpha Fc gamma R mAb. The resistance of 3H-TdR-prelabeled adherent HEp-2 cells to natural cell-mediated cytotoxicity was not affected by either mAb. Lectin-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (LDCC) against HEp-2 cells due to the presence of concanavalin A, and was completely abrogated by pretreatment of the targets with alpha TFR mAb, but was unaffected by alpha Fc gamma R mAb. By use of the flow cytometer, a significant correlation was detected between the relative expression of 40,000 dalton Fc gamma R and the susceptibility to NK, whereas the expression of TFR was discordant from NK sensitivity. As determined in the single cell cytotoxicity assay alpha Fc gamma R mAb reduced the frequency of target binding effector cells without affecting the number of dead bound targets. This pattern of inhibition was found against both K562 and U937 targets. Alternatively, alpha TFR mAb inhibited both binding and killing of K562 and Molt-4 targets. Because pretreatment of HEp-2 cells with alpha TFR mAb did not influence conjugate formation, the blocking of LDCC to HEp-2 cells by alpha TFR mAb can be related to post-binding events. These data show that although both the 40,000 dalton Fc gamma R and the TFR can be target structures for NK cell recognition, the TFR may also play an important role in the post-binding events.","['Perl, A', 'Looney, R J', 'Ryan, D H', 'Abraham, G N']","['Perl A', 'Looney RJ', 'Ryan DH', 'Abraham GN']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/physiology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/immunology', 'Cell Line', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Molecular Weight', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/analysis/*physiology', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis/*physiology', 'Receptors, IgG', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Transferrin/*metabolism']",1986/06/15 00:00,1986/06/15 00:01,['1986/06/15 00:00'],"['1986/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Jun 15;136(12):4714-20.,"['P01-AI21288/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI19658/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

In contrast, leukotrienes C4 and D4 and formyl-methionyl chemotactic peptides did not inhibit the binding of [3H] LTB4, which demonstrates the specificity of these receptors for isomers of 5,12-dihydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid. LTB4 stimulated an increase in [Ca+2]in in HL-60 cell-derived monocytes which reached 50% of the maximal level at an LTB4 concentration of 0.5 nM (EC50). Preincubation of HL-60 cell-derived monocytes with 10 nM LTB4 resulted in a selective loss of high affinity receptors, as assessed by binding of [3H]LTB4, and a 200-fold increase in the EC50 for stimulation by LTB4 of increases in [Ca+2]in, without alterations in either the low affinity receptors for LTB4 or the responsiveness of [Ca+2]in to formyl-methionyl chemotactic peptides. HL-60 cells that are induced to differentiate into monocytes thus develop stereospecific receptors for LTB4 with binding and transductional characteristics similar to those of human blood PMNL.","['Goldman, D W', 'Olson, D M', 'Payan, D G', 'Gifford, L A', 'Goetzl, E J']","['Goldman DW', 'Olson DM', 'Payan DG', 'Gifford LA', 'Goetzl EJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Leukotriene)', '0 (Receptors, Prostaglandin)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukotriene B4/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Leukotriene', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin/*biosynthesis/drug effects']",1986/06/15 00:00,1986/06/15 00:01,['1986/06/15 00:00'],"['1986/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Jun 15;136(12):4631-6.,"['AI-19784/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-31809/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The ability of these cells to metabolize arachidonic acid via the 5-lipoxygenase pathway to form 5-HETE, LTB4, and 5,12-diHETEs, has been previously documented. However, the production of peptidoleukotrienes by DMSO-differentiated HL60 cells has not been previously reported. Arachidonic acid metabolites produced via 5-lipoxygenase were identified by reverse-phase, high-performance liquid chromatography, immunoreactivity specific for peptidoleukotriene, glutamyl transpeptidase transformation, characteristic UV spectra, and GC mass spectra. Leukotriene synthesis in the DMSO-differentiated HL60 cell is maximal at 5 min when stimulated with the calcium ioniphore, A23187 (1 microM), in the presence of calcium. These cells produce 12.94 +/- 1.8 ng/10(6) cells of LTC4 and 3.8 +/- 0.4 ng/10(6) cells of LTB4. LTC4 and LTB4 are also synthesized in the undifferentiated cell when stimulated with 1 microM A23187 and 1 mM Ca2+, but in much smaller quantities, i.e., 1.91 +/- 0.42 ng/10(6) cells of LTC4 and 0.41 ng +/- 0.06/10(6) cells of LTB4. The synthetic chemotactic peptide, f-Met-Leu-Phe, also elicits formation of LTC4 and LTB4 in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of exogenously added calcium. Maximal stimulation of DMSO-differentiated cells with f-Met-Leu-Phe produces 2.5 +/- 0.2 ng of LTC4 and 1.45 +/- 0.2 ng of LTB4 per 10(6) cells.

We describe here the relative effect on endocytosis and coendocytosis of various pharmacological agents that block or enhance exocytosis. We have previously shown that, unlike exocytosis, endocytosis by RBL and normal rat mast cells was independent of extracellular calcium. We show here that the presence of calcium chelators or antagonists also had no effect on endocytosis of cross-linked IgE. However, coendocytosis of non-cross-linked IgE was partially inhibited by the elimination of extracellular calcium and the addition of calcium chelators such as EDTA or EGTA-Mg2+. Moreover, the addition of calcium antagonists such as Ni2+ and Co2+ (5 mM) to an incubation mixture containing Ca2+ (1 mM) resulted in the complete inhibition of coendocytosis without affecting endocytosis. Other inhibitors of exocytosis such as sodium azide (10-2M), quercetin (10-4M) and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (10-2 M) blocked coendocytosis completely but had no effect on endocytosis. Sodium azide (10 mM) in combination with 2-deoxyglucose (10 mM) effectively inhibited (90%) endocytosis. Cytochalasin B (10-4 M), which was shown to enhance serotonin release, had no effect on the extent of endocytosis or coendocytosis observed 20 min after the initiation of aggregation. Thus, in RBL cells, endocytosis, coendocytosis and exocytosis exhibit distinguishable sensitivities to some pharmacological drugs.","['Furuichi, K', 'Ra, C', 'Isersky, C', 'Rivera, J']","['Furuichi K', 'Ra C', 'Isersky C', 'Rivera J']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Azides)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '968JJ8C9DV (Sodium Azide)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Azides/pharmacology', 'Basophils/immunology', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Calcium/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cytochalasin B/pharmacology', 'Endocytosis/*drug effects', 'Immunoglobulin E/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Quercetin/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Sodium Azide']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunology. 1986 May;58(1):105-10.,,,,,PMC1452636,,,,,

On the other hand, incubation of unfusogenic (trypsin or phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF)-treated) RSVE with these cells led to very little (6-9%) fluorescence dequenching. The degree of fluorescence dequenching was linearly correlated to the surface density of the virus-inserted N-NBD-PE molecules.

One of these proteins, p40 chi, was previously shown to activate transcription from the LTR in a trans-acting manner, which suggested that it activated some cellular genes involved in leukemogenesis. In this study, the sequences in the LTR responsible for this trans-activation were analyzed. Construction of deletion mutants of the LTR in pLTR-CAT and measurement of their activities in trans-activated expression of the CAT gene showed that sequences upstream of the TATA box were responsible for the trans-activation mediated by p40 chi. The active unit was identified as an enhancer sequence containing direct repeats by inserting it into an enhancer-minus SV40 promoter. Thus, it was concluded that an enhancer sequence in HTLV-I LTR is responsible, at least in part, for transcriptional trans-activation mediated by the viral product p40 chi.","['Fujisawa, J', 'Seiki, M', 'Sato, M', 'Yoshida, M']","['Fujisawa J', 'Seiki M', 'Sato M', 'Yoshida M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics/growth & development', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Genes', '*Genes, Regulator', '*Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Plasmids', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Simian virus 40/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics', '*Virus Activation']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1986 Apr;5(4):713-8.,,,,,PMC1166849,,,,,

This sequence codes for p40x, which was proposed to trans-activate transcription from the LTR. Recently, we identified novel pX proteins coded by frame III, which mostly overlaps frame IV (x-lor, coding for p40x), in a region also overlapped by frame II. To determine which product is responsible for the trans-acting function, we constructed an active provirus clone, pMTPX, that contained a genomic fragment of the env, pX and 3'LTR, and introduced site-directed mutations into the active site. The effects of various deletions and point mutations that distinguished each of the overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), II, III and IV, on trans-activation of pLTR-CAT were treated by co-transfection assays. The results showed that only mutations which affected p40x expression resulted in loss of activity for transcriptional activation. These findings clearly indicate that p40x coded by frame IV is responsible for the transcriptional activation of the LTR.

Recombinant vaccinia viruses were used to investigate the sites of surface expression in the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line of the hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus, the G glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and gp70/p15E of Friend murine leukemia virus (MuLV). These glycoproteins could be demonstrated by immunofluorescence on the surfaces of MDCK cells as early as 4 h post-infection. In intact MDCK monolayers, vaccinia recombinants expressing HA produced a pattern of surface fluorescence typical of an apically expressed glycoprotein. In contrast, cells infected with vaccinia recombinants expressing VSV-G or MuLV gp70/p15E exhibited surface fluorescence only when monolayers were treated with EGTA to disrupt tight junctions, as expected of glycoproteins expressed on basolateral surfaces. Immunoferritin labeling in conjunction with electron microscopy confirmed that MDCK cells infected with the HA recombinant exhibited specific labeling of the apical surfaces whereas the VSV-G and MuLV recombinants exhibited the respective antigens predominantly on the basolateral membranes. Quantitation of surface expression by [125I]protein A binding assays on intact and EGTA-treated monolayers confirmed the apical localization of the vaccinia-expressed HA and demonstrated that 95% of the VSV-G and 97% of the MuLV gp70/p15E glycoproteins were localized on the basolateral surfaces.

The HL-60 leukemic cell line was used as a model of induced leukemic cell maturation in order to develop a method of quantitating granulocytic and monocytic maturation in response to drug therapy. An automated flow cytochemistry system (Hemalog-D) was employed to measure mean cell volume, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and nonspecific esterase (NSE). For granulocytic maturation induced by vitamin A or DMSO, MPO and cell volume decreased by 50%, maintaining a constant mean cellular MPO concentration throughout maturation from promyelocyte to neutrophil-like forms. For monocytic maturation induced by low-dose ARA-c, the mean NSE increased substantially, while cell volume remained constant. Unlike MPO concentration, NSE was truly inducible and thus a useful quantitative measure of maturation caused by low-dose ARA-c. Flow cytochemistry and cytofluorometry may be developed to allow for quantitative monitoring of therapeutic trials of induced maturation in human leukemias.

PDBU did not alter the binding of formylmethionylleucyl-phenylalanine to the cells. Other protein kinase C-activating substances such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol could substitute for PDBU, but 4 alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate, which is inactive for both tumor promotion and protein kinase C activation, was ineffective in this capacity. Prolonged treatment of the cells with PDBU resulted in the down-regulation and decrease of protein kinase C activity to the level of 30-40% of that in the control cells. In the down-regulated cells, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine still induced generation of the phosphorylated inositols to the same extent as that in the control cells, but the inhibition of this reaction by PDBU was reduced to 30-50% as compared with that in the control cells.

These retrovirus infected T-cells express large numbers of receptors for interleukin 2 (or T-cell growth factor). Due to the presence of these receptors, these leukemic T-cells can be selectively killed in vitro by monoclonal anti-interleukin 2 receptor antibody covalently linked to the A chain of the plant toxin, ricin (anti-TAC-A), suggesting that such immunotoxins may be useful in the therapy of this disease. In this report we demonstrate that the lysosomotropic agent ammonium chloride and the carboxylic ionophore monensin substantially potentiate the cytotoxicity of anti-TAC-A on HUT 102 cells, a long-term cultured HTLV-I infected T-cell line. Anti-TAC-A alone produces half-maximal inhibition of protein synthesis in HUT 102 cells at a concentration of 2.2 X 10(-10) M (the 50% inhibitor, concentration). Addition of ammonium chloride or monensin augments the potency of anti-TAC-A killing 100-fold (50% inhibitory concentration = 2.5 X 10(-12) M) and 400-fold (50% inhibitory concentration = 8 X 10(-13) M), respectively; furthermore, these agents accelerate rate of anti-TAC-A intoxication and increase the specific killing of interleukin 2 receptor-bearing leukemic cells. At concentrations which cause only minor harm to colony forming hematopoietic progenitor cells (granulocyte-erythroid, monocytic, megakaryocytic colony forming unit, granulocyte-macrophage colony forming unit, macrophage colony forming unit, and granulocyte colony forming unit), anti-TAC-A alone is able to eliminate greater than 99.99% of an HTLV-I infected T-cell population. In the presence of ammonium chloride or monensin, respectively, a 3.5- and 20-fold greater cytoreduction of HTLV-I infected T-cells is achieved. Combined treatment with anti-TAC-A and monensin may offer an efficient and highly selective means of purging bone marrow of patients with adult T-cell leukemia, which may then be used for autologous marrow transplantation.","['Kronke, M', 'Schlick, E', 'Waldmann, T A', 'Vitetta, E S', 'Greene, W C']","['Kronke M', 'Schlick E', 'Waldmann TA', 'Vitetta ES', 'Greene WC']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '01Q9PC255D (Ammonium Chloride)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)']",IM,"['Ammonium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Deltaretrovirus/*growth & development', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Lysosomes/drug effects', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Ricin/*administration & dosage', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*microbiology']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Jul;46(7):3295-8.,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have shown that hairy cell leukemia (HCL) may respond to treatment with the ADA inhibitor, 2-deoxycoformycin. This study demonstrates that the cells of HCL have significantly lower levels of ADA and 5'NT (P always less than 0.01) when compared to levels in normal B- or T-lymphocytes, but have higher levels of PNP (P less than 0.001 for both comparisons). Recent studies have shown that when treated with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), cells of B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia (B-CLL) acquire phenotypic characters of HCL. The authors have therefore also investigated the changes in enzyme pattern of B-CLL after incubation with TPA B-CLL cells are characterized by low levels of ADA, PNP, and 5'-NT, but TPA caused a marked increase in PNP activity (P less than 0.001, t test for paired samples), a pattern similar to HCL. The results from biochemical studies are thus in accordance with the hypothesis that HCL cells are more mature than B-CLL cells. The special enzyme profile of HCL suggests that a PNP inhibitor might also be effective in the treatment of this disease.","['Ho, A D', 'Dietz, G', 'Trede, I', 'Schwartz, R', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Hunstein, W']","['Ho AD', 'Dietz G', 'Trede I', 'Schwartz R', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Hunstein W']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Purines)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', 'EC 3.1.3.- (Nucleotidases)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)"", 'EC 3.5.4.- (Aminohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.4.2 (adenine deaminase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase"", 'Aminohydrolases/analysis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*enzymology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Nucleotidases/analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/analysis', 'Purines/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1986 Jul 1;58(1):96-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19860701)58:1<96::aid-cncr2820580117>3.0.co;2-3.,,,['10.1002/1097-0142(19860701)58:1<96::aid-cncr2820580117>3.0.co;2-3 [doi]'],,,,,,,
