Patients were given itraconazole 5 mg/kg od, 2.5 mg/kg bd, 2.5 mg/kg od or 1.25 mg/kg bd. The mean daily dose of itraconazole was 407 mg for patients receiving 5 mg/kg/day and 148 mg in patients receiving 2.5 mg/kg/day. Mean concentrations of 493 and 495 micrograms/L were achieved on day 8 in patients who received 5 mg/kg/d od or 2.5 mg/kg bd itraconazole respectively. However, mean concentrations were significantly lower for those who received 2.5 mg/kg od itraconazole being 110 micrograms/L on day 8. Mean areas under the serum-concentration time curves were also markedly higher in patients receiving 5 mg/kg/day than in those receiving 2.5 mg/kg/day itraconazole and were 22,382 and 5615 micrograms.h/L on day 15 respectively. These findings suggest that the serum concentrations attained with an oral solution of 5 mg/kg itraconazole either once daily or in two divided doses are suitable for antifungal prophylaxis in patients receiving chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia.","['Prentice, A G', 'Warnock, D W', 'Johnson, S A', 'Taylor, P C', 'Oliver, D A']","['Prentice AG', 'Warnock DW', 'Johnson SA', 'Taylor PC', 'Oliver DA']","['Department of Haematology, Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Antimicrob Chemother,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,7513617,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Itraconazole/administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/complications/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*prevention & control']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jac/36.4.657 [doi]'],ppublish,J Antimicrob Chemother. 1995 Oct;36(4):657-63. doi: 10.1093/jac/36.4.657.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro studies using lymphoblastoid cell lines expressing single human cytochrome P450 forms and hepatic microsomes were undertaken to investigate the forms involved in the metabolism of ondansetron in humans. The cell lines that expressed CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP2D6 were shown to be capable of metabolizing [14C]ondansetron. Studies with human hepatic microsomes and the specific inhibitors furafylene, quinidine, and ketoconazole confirmed the role of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 and also demonstrated the involvement of the CYP3A subfamily. The data in this study collectively indicate that multiple cytochrome P450 forms, including CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and the CYP3A subfamily, are probably involved in the clearance of ondansetron in humans, with no single form of cytochrome P450 dominating the overall metabolism of ondansetron. The role played by CYP2D6 in the metabolism of [14C]ondansetron by human hepatic microsomes in vitro was shown to be minor. This finding is consistent with the lack of bimodality in the clinical pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. It is therefore concluded that ondansetron is metabolized by multiple forms of cytochrome P450, and this limits the likelihood of a clinically relevant interaction with ondansetron by a modulator of a single form of cytochrome P450.","['Dixon, C M', 'Colthup, P V', 'Serabjit-Singh, C J', 'Kerr, B M', 'Boehlert, C C', 'Park, G R', 'Tarbit, M H']","['Dixon CM', 'Colthup PV', 'Serabjit-Singh CJ', 'Kerr BM', 'Boehlert CC', 'Park GR', 'Tarbit MH']","['Department of Drug Metabolism II, Glaxo Research and Development Limited, Ware, Herts, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Serotonin Antagonists)', '4AF302ESOS (Ondansetron)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)']",IM,"['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Isoenzymes/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Microsomes, Liver/drug effects/enzymology', 'Ondansetron/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Serotonin Antagonists/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 1995 Nov;23(11):1225-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we showed that mice undergoing therapy-mediated rejection of tumor were able to reject subsequent weekly challenges with EL-4 but not L1210 tumor cells. The mechanism underlying this therapy was investigated using cyclosporine (CS) to suppress immune responsiveness. A dose-related inhibition of therapy was observed with total inhibition occurring at 30 mg/kg/day. Delayed administration of CS at day 14 or later after tumor administration resulted in little or no inhibitory effect. The resistance of cured mice to EL-4 tumor challenge was not affected by CS, which is consistent with the reduced ability of CS to affect secondary immune responses. In addition, CS did not alter natural killer cell activity in mice receiving the BCNU/reovirus therapy. These results suggest that there is an obligatory immune response produced by the BCNU/reovirus therapy which arises early after the administration of the therapy.","['Steele, T A', 'Cox, D C']","['Steele TA', 'Cox DC']","['Department of Microbiology, Miami University, Oxford, Ohio 45056, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Biother,Cancer biotherapy,9314021,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/antagonists & inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Carmustine/antagonists & inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'Immunity, Innate/immunology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', '*Immunotherapy', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/therapy', 'Male', '*Mammalian orthoreovirus 3/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/cbr.1995.10.307 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biother. 1995 Winter;10(4):307-15. doi: 10.1089/cbr.1995.10.307.,['CA 47324/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Saffron obtained from the dried stigmas of Crocus sativus L., is an important spice, rich in carotenoids, consumed commonly in different parts of the world.

The present report reviews the role of saffron in serving as a chemopreventive agent in modifying cancer risk. Dose-dependent cytotoxic effect to carcinoma, sarcoma and leukemia cells in vitro were noted. Saffron delayed ascites tumor growth and increased the life span of the treated mice compared to untreated controls by 45-120%. In addition, it delayed the onset of papilloma growth, decreased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma and soft tissue sarcoma in treated mice. Understanding the mechanisms of action of saffron have been solitarily based on their carotenoid-like action. Our results indicated significant inhibition in the synthesis of nucleic acids but not protein synthesis. It appears now that saffron (dimethyl-crocetin) disrupts DNA-protein interactions e.g. topoisomerases II, important for cellular DNA synthesis.","['Nair, S C', 'Kurumboor, S K', 'Hasegawa, J H']","['Nair SC', 'Kurumboor SK', 'Hasegawa JH']","['University of Nebraska Medical Center, Eppley Institute for Cancer Research and Allied Diseases, Omaha 68198-6260, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Biother,Cancer biotherapy,9314021,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '36-88-4 (Carotenoids)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carotenoids/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Plants, Medicinal/*chemistry', 'Spices/*analysis']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/cbr.1995.10.257 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biother. 1995 Winter;10(4):257-64. doi: 10.1089/cbr.1995.10.257.,,41,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to explore the possibility of predicting in vivo leukemic proliferation after G-CSF administration to AML patients by using in vitro assays, we investigated the leukemic blasts of 30 AML patients, including 14 patients who received G-CSF for severe infection associated with neutropenia following chemotherapy (G-CSF group) and 16 patients who did not (control group). Of the 14 patients in the G-CSF group, 9 showed an increase of leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood during G-CSF administration, while 11 of the 16 control patients developed leukemic resurgence. In the G-CSF group, the frequency of leukemic resurgence among patients whose blasts showed dose-dependent proliferation after addition of G-CSF to cultures was similar to that among patients whose blasts did not. In addition, there were no significant differences between the G-CSF and control groups in [3H]thymidine incorporation by leukemic cells and leukemic colony formation after the addition of G-CSF to cultures. The G-CSF receptor affinity of leukemic blasts was significantly higher in the patients with leukemic resurgence (mean dissociation constant [Kd]: 55 pM in the G-CSF group and 63 pM in the control group) than in those without it (101 pM and 96 pM, respectively), and the number of G-CSF receptors per cell was significantly lower when leukemic resurgence occurred (200 in the G-CSF group and 260 in the control group) than when it did not (3400 and 3030, respectively). Immunophenotyping (for CD2, CD7, CD10, CD13, CD19, CD33, CD34, CD71, HLA-DR, glycophorin A and the G-CSF receptor) revealed no significant differences between blasts from the patients with and without leukemic resurgence in the G-CSF group. Thus, we conclude that the in vivo leukemic resurgence during G-CSF administration after chemotherapy for AML was not correlated with the in vitro responsiveness of leukemic blasts to this cytokine or with blast phenotyping data. Leukemic resurgence is likely to occur in patients whose leukemic blasts have fewer numbers of G-CSF receptors with a high affinity irrespective of whether patients receive G-CSF.","['Usuki, K', 'Iki, S', 'Endo, M', 'Kitazume, K', 'Ito, K', 'Watanabe, M', 'Urabe, A']","['Usuki K', 'Iki S', 'Endo M', 'Kitazume K', 'Ito K', 'Watanabe M', 'Urabe A']","['Division of Hematology, Kanto Teishin Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blast Crisis/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530130609 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1995 Nov;13(6):647-54. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530130609.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Functional studies showed that chemotaxis for C5a was normal, although that for IL-2 or FMLP was attenuated. In addition, leukotriene C4 production was decreased while O2- production was intact.

These characteristics may have saved the patient from the multiple organ damage which occurs in typical hypereosinophilic syndrome.","['Sato, H', 'Saito, H', 'Ikebuchi, K', 'Danbara, M', 'Yagisawa, M', 'Yuo, A']","['Sato H', 'Saito H', 'Ikebuchi K', 'Danbara M', 'Yagisawa M', 'Yuo A']","['Fourth Department of Internal Medicine, Teikyo University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '2CU6TT9V48 (Leukotriene C4)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Chemotactic Factors/pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*ultrastructure', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complement C5a/pharmacology', 'Eosinophils/drug effects/*pathology', 'Folliculitis/etiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Interleukins/pharmacology', 'Leukotriene C4/biosynthesis', 'Male', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509112211 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Nov;19(5-6):499-505. doi: 10.3109/10428199509112211.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to determine their diagnostic usefulness as markers of meningeal infiltration by lymphoma cells in patients with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), we measured some soluble factors in the CSF of patients with ATL and non-ATL patients. Soluble CD4 (sCD4) was highly elevated in all patients with ATL and meningeal infiltration. The CSF level of the soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R; sCD25) was markedly elevated in 13 (72.2%) of 18 patients with ATL and meningeal infiltration. Levels of sCD4 and sCD25 in the CSF of patients with ATL and meningeal infiltration were significantly higher than in non-ATL patients (p < .01 and p < .001, respectively). These findings indicate that levels of sCD4 and sCD25 in the CSF are probably associated with meningeal infiltration by leukemia cells expressing CD4 and CD25 on surface membranes. CSF levels of sCD4 in 14 (60.9%) of 23 ATL patients and sCD25 in 13 (72.2%) of 18 ATL patients without meningeal infiltration were moderately elevated. These findings suggest that a small number of leukemic cells which were not detected by conventional CSF examination may have infiltrated the meninges in these patients. Sequential measurements of sCD4 and sCD25 in CSF obtained from patients with meningeal infiltration by leukemic cells showed that sCD4 and sCD25 levels reflected the activity of leukemic meningitis and correlated with the number of cells in CSF. However, the levels of sCD4 in CSF did not fall below the limit of detection even when the number of cells in CSF became normal. It is thought that the level of sCD4 in CSF is a more sensitive marker for detecting the infiltration of leukemic cells in CSF than the number of cells present in the CSF considering the clinical course of two patients with acute type ATL. Therefore, ATL patients with meningeal infiltration should receive treatments until sCD4 levels become normal and not just until the number of cells become normal. Our results also suggest that measurement of CSF levels of sCD4 and sCD25 is useful for the differential diagnosis of aseptic meningitis and meningeal infiltration by leukemic cells in patients with smoldering ATL. We conclude that measurement of soluble factors in CSF plays an important role in diagnosis, prophylaxis and treatment of meningitis in patients with ATL.","['Uozumi, K', 'Ishitsuka, K', 'Ohno, N', 'Nakahara, K', 'Utsunomiya, A', 'Hanada, S', 'Arima, T']","['Uozumi K', 'Ishitsuka K', 'Ohno N', 'Nakahara K', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Hanada S', 'Arima T']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'CD4 Antigens/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/cytology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins/*analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*cerebrospinal fluid/pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/cerebrospinal fluid/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Meninges/*pathology', 'Meningitis, Aseptic/cerebrospinal fluid/diagnosis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*analysis', 'Solubility']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509112202 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Nov;19(5-6):437-45. doi: 10.3109/10428199509112202.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The explanation for their prognostic significance is unclear, but might be related to cellular drug resistance. We prospectively studied the relation between the above mentioned features with resistance to 13 drugs in 144 childhood ALL samples obtained at initial diagnosis. The MTT assay was used for drug resistance testing. The interindividual differences in drug resistance were very large and exceeded those between the several subgroups. There was generally no significant relation between sex, leukemic cell burden, and FAB type with drug resistance. However, subgroups with a worse prognosis as defined by age (< 18 months and > 120 months at diagnosis) or immunophenotype (pro-B ALL and T-ALL) did show relatively resistant drug resistance profiles as compared to the subgroups with a better prognosis (age 18-120 months, common and pre-B ALL). Within the group of common and pre-B ALL and compared to the intermediate age-group, samples of the younger children were significantly more resistant to daunorubicin, mitoxantrone and teniposide, and samples of the older children were significantly more resistant to prednisolone and mercaptopurine. Pro-B ALL samples were significantly more resistant to 1-asparaginase and thioguanine, and T-ALL samples were significantly more resistant to prednisolone, dexamethasone, 1-asparaginase, vincristine, vindesine, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, teniposide, and ifosfamide, than the group of common and pre-B ALL cases.

In addition to advancing the understanding of pathological mechanisms underlying the transformation process, the cloning and sequencing of the genes altered by the translocations have provided new tools for diagnosis and monitoring of patients. In particular, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology yields rapid, sensitive and accurate diagnostic and prognostic information. As leukemias carrying certain translocations confer a higher risk of treatment failure, it is important to identify accurately all positive cases in order to give appropriate therapy. An important new initiative in the diagnostical setting and anti-leukemic therapy is the early detection of minimal residual disease (MRD). If MRD, implying an increased risk of relapse, is reliably detected during apparent clinical remission, alternative strategies could be applied early while the malignant cell burden is still minimal. The PCR assays are clearly more sensitive than other methods of MRD detection including morphology, immunophenotyping and cytogenetics; treatment failure is first detectable by PCR followed by cytogenetic relapse and finally clinical disease. PCR assays have been most often used in the MRD analysis of follicular lymphoma with t(14;18), chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with t(9;22), ALL with t(4;11), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(8;21) or t(15;17). PCR amplification is applicable to any other translocation provided the translocation is highly associated with the malignancy and the breakpoints are sufficiently clustered; a quickly increasing number of such specific molecular markers are now available for PCR assays. PCR still remains an experimental investigation for the detection of covert disease. However, the clinical relevance of MRD detection should be evaluated separately for each type of leukemia as significant prognostic differences between disease entities were found. This review describes the PCR assays available for the detection of leukemia cells with specific chromosomal translocations and summarizes the experience with the application of PCR techniques in monitoring patients during the course of the disease.","['Drexler, H G', 'Borkhardt, A', 'Janssen, J W']","['Drexler HG', 'Borkhardt A', 'Janssen JW']","['DSM-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*ultrastructure', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', '*Oncogenes', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509112194 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Nov;19(5-6):359-80. doi: 10.3109/10428199509112194.,,278,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the use of an in vitro culture technique, we found that IL-10 enhanced the survival of B-CLL cells in a dose-dependent fashion by inhibiting the process of apoptotic cell death. This was demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy and DNA gel electrophoresis. Flow cytometric and immunoblot analyses showed that IL-10 did not significantly upregulate bcl-2 expression as compared with control cultures. B-CLL cells were also found to spontaneously release IL-10 in cultures, and serum IL-10 levels were elevated in five of the eleven B-CLL patients. These findings suggest that IL-10 acts as an autocrine growth factor for B-CLL cells and cytokine-based therapy might be a new approach for the treatment of B-CLL.","['Kitabayashi, A', 'Hirokawa, M', 'Miura, A B']","['Kitabayashi A', 'Hirokawa M', 'Miura AB']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Akita University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/biosynthesis', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0925571095003959 [pii]', '10.1016/0925-5710(95)00395-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1995 Aug;62(2):99-106. doi: 10.1016/0925-5710(95)00395-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These proteins function by binding to and activating unique tyrosine kinase receptors. Expression of the flt3 receptor is primarily restricted among hematopoietic cells to the most primitive progenitor cells. The flt3 ligand is similar to Steel factor in that both proteins stimulate the proliferation of early progenitor or stem cells. Neither of these factors has much proliferative activity on its own, but each factor can synergize with a wide range of other colony stimulating factors and interleukins (ILs) to stimulate proliferation. One major difference between the two factors appears to be their effect on mast cells, which Steel factor stimulates but flt3 ligand does not. Although flt3 ligand and Steel factor each act on early hematopoietic cells, differences in their activities suggest that they are not redundant and both are required for normal hematopoiesis. There are a number of clinical settings in which the flt3 ligand may potentially prove quite useful.","['Lyman, S D']",['Lyman SD'],"['Immunex Corporation, Seattle, WA 98101, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Liver/cytology/embryology', 'Membrane Proteins/*physiology/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/physiology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Factor/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['092557109500389A [pii]', '10.1016/0925-5710(95)00389-a [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1995 Aug;62(2):63-73. doi: 10.1016/0925-5710(95)00389-a.,,42,,,,,,,,,,,,

HL-60 cells can be induced by phorbol ester to differentiate into macrophage lineage cells and by retinoic acid into granulocytic cells. THP-1 cells undergo phorbol ester-induced differentiation to macrophage cells. In LNCA-transduced HL-60 derived macrophage cells, ADA controlled by the CMV promoter was expressed at 100.0 mumol/hr.mg, in contrast to 1.2 mumol/hr.mg from LN-transduced control cells. LNCA-transduced THP-1 macrophage cells showed a similar increase in ADA activity over control cells. These elevated enzyme activities were confirmed by Northern blots, which showed substantial increases in ADA mRNA derived from the CMV promoter. This suggests use of the CMV promoter for gene therapy targeted at macrophages, as, for example, in the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders such as Gaucher disease.

The patients' sex, the side of line insertion and the catheter gauge were not associated with pneumothorax on either the univariate or logistic regression analyses. From these data we conclude that pneumothorax complicating a subclavian Hickman line is significantly more likely in elderly patients with a low BMI. Such patients are more likely to have STs than HTs. In patients with a BMI < 19 kg/m2, the subclavian route should be used with caution.","['Harrington, K J', 'Pandha, H S', 'Hollyer, J S', 'Kelly, S A', 'Bateman, A R', 'Lewanski, C', 'Morris, P', 'Jackson, J E']","['Harrington KJ', 'Pandha HS', 'Hollyer JS', 'Kelly SA', 'Bateman AR', 'Lewanski C', 'Morris P', 'Jackson JE']","['Department of Clinical Oncology, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol),Clinical oncology (Royal College of Radiologists (Great Britain)),9002902,,IM,"['Adult', 'Catheterization, Peripheral/*adverse effects/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/*therapy', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/complications/*therapy', 'Pneumothorax/*etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Subclavian Artery']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0936-6555(05)80008-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0936-6555(05)80008-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol). 1995;7(6):373-6. doi: 10.1016/s0936-6555(05)80008-1.,,,['Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol). 1996;8(3):206.

Cured animals were observed in the combination of THP with the two drugs, but not in that of EPI. Thus, in combination with 5'-DFUR and CDDP, THP was more effective against P388 leukemia than was EPI.

The rrIL-1 beta produced was demonstrated to have IL-1 bioactivity in a mouse thymocyte proliferation assay, in which it could be blocked by inclusion of human recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist (hrIL-1Ra). Similarly, rrIL-1 beta induced LIF mRNA expression in cultured rat sympathetic ganglia. In each case, the maximal dose of rrIL-1 beta was similar to that of human IL-1 beta. However, the peak response in rat tissue was twofold higher with rat IL-1 beta than with human IL-1 beta.

The results of a computer search of public databases indicated that the sequences of 13 genes were unrelated to any reported genes, while the remaining 27 genes carried sequences which showed some similarities to known genes. Obvious unique sequences noted were as follows. A stretch of triplet repeats was contained in each of three genes: These were GAG(Glu) in KIAA0122 and KIAA0147, and TCC(Ser) in KIAA0150. A stretch of 10 amino acid-residues was repeated 21 times in KIAA0139, and a homologous sequence of 76-78 nucleotides was found repeated 6 times in the untranslated region of KIAA0125. Northern hybridization analysis demonstrated that 13 genes were expressed in a cell- or tissue-specific manner.

DESIGN: 400 single-donor platelet transfusions were analyzed for patient- and concentrate-specific factors influencing posttransfusion platelet increment. Statistical analysis was performed by the General Mixed Model Analysis of Variance. SETTING: Department of hematology and oncology at a university hospital. PATIENTS: 46 patients (24 male, 22 female; age 17-80 years). INTERVENTIONS: Single-donor platelet transfusions. RESULTS: As demonstrated earlier, splenomegaly, body temperature, and bone marrow transplantation could be proven as factors reducing posttransfusion platelet increment. In addition, hepatomegaly and application of antibiotics had negative effects on platelet increment. Among the product-specific parameters leukocyte contamination and pretransfusion storage time reduced transfusion success significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical factors influencing posttransfusion platelet increment can hardly be controlled. In contrast, concentrate-specific parameters can be influenced by preparation technique and storage procedure. Therefore, high value should be set on low leukocyte contamination and short pretransfusion storage time of platelet concentrates.","['Bock, M', 'Muggenthaler, K H', 'Schmidt, U', 'Heim, M U', 'Mempel, W']","['Bock M', 'Muggenthaler KH', 'Schmidt U', 'Heim MU', 'Mempel W']","['Institut fur Transfusionsmedizin und Immunhamatologie, Universitat Magdeburg, Deutschland.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Infusionsther Transfusionsmed,Infusionstherapie und Transfusionsmedizin,9209406,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*therapy', '*Platelet Count', '*Platelet Transfusion']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Infusionsther Transfusionsmed. 1995 Dec;22(6):350-4.,,,,,Der posttransfusionelle Thrombozytenanstieg: Beobachtungen an einem hamatologisch-onkologischen Patientengut.,,,,,,,,,

We found the following: 1) All of these cells undergo PCD when cultured at low cell density in the absence of serum and exogenous signaling molecules but can be rescued by serum or specific growth factors, suggesting that they need extracellular signals to avoid PCD. (2) The mixed cell types dissociated from normal mouse embryos can only support one another's survival in culture if they are in aggregates, suggesting that cell survival in embryos may depend on short-range signals. (3) Some cancer cells secrete factors that support their own survival. (4) The survival requirements of a human leukemia cell line change when the cells differentiate.

The MPL gene expression was detected in platelets and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the majority of patients with MPD including chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). In contrast, the ML gene expression was found in the majority of ET and CML patients, but not in PV or PMF patients. These findings suggest that even in MPD the megakaryocytopoiesis depends on the MPL signal transduction system, and that in ET and CML, the ML production by mononuclear cells in the bone marrow microenvironment might play a part in the higher megakaryocytopoiesis observed in these diseases.

Experience with 114 CH treatments in 98 critically ill children from March 1988 to March 1993 is presented in this study. Ages ranged from 1 day to 23 yr (mean +/- SE = 7.1 +/- 0.7 yr), and 54% of patients were male. Seventeen percent of all treatments were performed in neonates under 1 month of age. The most common primary diagnoses were sepsis and adult respiratory distress syndrome (11 patients each), liver transplantation and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (10 patients each), and hemolytic uremic syndrome (9 patients). The most frequent indications for CH were fluid overload and acute renal failure (42% each). Choices for CH included: continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration (CAVH, 50%), continuous arteriovenous hemodiafiltration (CAVH, 23%), continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH, 18%), and continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVH-D, 9%). Choices for anticoagulation included: none (47%), regional (49%), and systemic (4%). Treatment duration ranged from 1 to 25 days (mean = 5.3 +/- 0.4 days). Mean filter life span for 363 filters was 0.94 +/- 0.1 filters/patient per day. Despite an overall survival rate of 43%, survival to discharge varied greatly (0 to 100%) among the 24 diagnostic groups: tumor lysis syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus (3/3 patients each, 100%), hemolytic uremic syndrome (8/9 patients, 89%). This compares with: bone marrow transplantation (0/6 patients, 0%), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (2/10 patients, 20%), and leukemia (1/4 patients, 25%). Survival to hospital discharge was better in patients who did not receive pressors (P < 0.005) and in patients treated with combined ultrafiltration and dialysis (CAVH-D, CVVH-D) compared with ultrafiltration alone (CAVH, CVVH) (P < 0.005), but was not notably affected by patient age, sex, use of anticoagulation, filter life span, blood pump-assisted versus spontaneous CH, or duration of therapy. Filter life span was not affected by use of anticoagulation, but was remarkably longer in patients with arteriovenous versus venovenous CH (P < 0.004). It was concluded that: (1) empirical anticoagulation of patients treated with CH is not necessary; (2) children with a minority of underlying diseases and those requiring pressor support at initiation of CH appear to have relatively poor survival rates despite the technically effective use of CH; and (3) the addition of countercurrent dialysis to routine CH may enhance patient survival to hospital discharge.","['Smoyer, W E', 'McAdams, C', 'Kaplan, B S', 'Sherbotie, J R']","['Smoyer WE', 'McAdams C', 'Kaplan BS', 'Sherbotie JR']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, School of Medicine 19104, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Am Soc Nephrol,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,9013836,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Critical Care', 'Female', '*Hemofiltration/adverse effects/instrumentation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1681/ASN.V651401 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Soc Nephrol. 1995 Nov;6(5):1401-9. doi: 10.1681/ASN.V651401.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested that differential activation of T cell subsets, particularly a shift to Th2 cytokine production, may be associated with disease progression. To clarify the regulation of the cytokine network in the course of MAIDS, we examined the kinetics of cytokine production by isolated splenocytes. C57/BL6 mice were infected with the LP-BM5 mixture. The spleen cell proliferative response, together with IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-10 and IL-4 production by unstimulated and ConA or anti-CD3 MoAb-stimulated spleen cells, were determined at various times after inoculation (weeks 1, 3, 6 and 9). Spleen cells isolated from murine leukemia virus complex (LP-BM5) infected mice spontaneously produced significant amounts of IL-2 and IFN-gamma one and three weeks post-infection, compared to uninfected controls. The capacity of isolated T cells to produce the Th1 cytokines IL-2 and IFN-gamma in response to stimulation with ConA and anti-CD3 MoAb decreased after 3 weeks of infection. The fall in IL-2 production ran parallel to the fall in the T cell proliferative response to ConA. IL-10 production in response to ConA and anti-CD3 MoAb increased after three weeks post-inoculation, and followed the reverse kinetic pattern to IFN-gamma and IL-2. In contrast, no significant spontaneous IL-4 production and no increase in IL-4 production in response to ConA or anti-CD3 MoAb occurred during the course of MAIDS, relative to uninfected controls. These results suggest that LP-BM5 infection leads to a fall in Th1 cytokine production rather than a clear switch to Th2 cytokine production.","['Akarid, K', 'Pocidalo, M A', 'Desforges, B', 'Sinet, M']","['Akarid K', 'Pocidalo MA', 'Desforges B', 'Sinet M']","['INSERM U 13, Hopital Bichat-Claude Bernard, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,Eur Cytokine Netw,European cytokine network,9100879,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Muromonab-CD3)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-10/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*pathology', 'Muromonab-CD3/pharmacology', 'Spleen/*metabolism/pathology', 'Th1 Cells/*metabolism', 'Th2 Cells/*metabolism']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur Cytokine Netw. 1995 May-Jun;6(3):181-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maximum membrane CD23 expression was detected after 16 h of incubation with IL-4, then gradually returned to basal level after 48 h. Membrane expression of CD23 on EoL-3.12 cells was found to parallel their homotypic aggregation. Extending the time of incubation with IL-4 to 48 h or more resulted in a de-aggregation of cells of cells with a shedding of membrane CD23 and an increase of its soluble form, sCD23. The IL-4-induced aggregation of EoL-3.12 cells was inhibited with anti-CD23 antibody or human myeloma IgE protein, indicating that it was mediated through the engagement of CD23. EoL3.12 incubated with IL-4 displayed morphological changes associated with differentiation, such as an increased number of lobulated nuclei with prominent nucleoli, increased ratio of cytoplasm and distinct cytoplasmic processes. EoL-3.12 cells incubated with IL-4 also displayed an enhanced adherence to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), which was reverted when the IL-4 incubation time extended. Furthermore, the transendothelial migration of EoL-3.12 cells toward a chemokinetic gradient of soluble CD23 (sCD23; 29 kDa fragment) closely paralleled the density of membrane CD23 expressed on EoL-3.12 cells. Additionally, the engagement of CD23 led to the activation of the L-arginine-dependent pathway of nitric oxide (NO) production, as detected by the increase in intracytoplasmic cGMP concentration. The capacity of EoL-3.12 cells to form homotypic as well as heterotypic adhesion appears therefore to be regulated, at least in part, by the level of CD23 expression.","['Yamaoka, K A', 'Kolb, J P']","['Yamaoka KA', 'Kolb JP']","['U 365 INSERM, Interferons et Cytokines, Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur Cytokine Netw,European cytokine network,9100879,"['0 (Myeloma Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)']",IM,"['Arginine/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects', 'Cyclic GMP/biosynthesis', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', 'Eosinophils/drug effects/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Eosinophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Myeloma Proteins/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Nitric Oxide/biosynthesis', 'Organ Specificity', 'Receptors, IgE/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Umbilical Veins']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur Cytokine Netw. 1995 May-Jun;6(3):145-55.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IM also enhanced TNF and suppressed IL-6 production, respectively, in both IL-2-activated PBMC and IL-2-dependent NK cell line, with the inhibition of their high levels of PGE2 production. Culture with PGE2 alone suppressed TNF production by three of the six TCC and NK cell lines, which was neutralized by addition of IM. It had, however, no effect on TNF production by the remaining three TCC or IL-2-activated PBMC. The effects of PGE2 on IL-6 production also varied among TCC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Tsuboi, I', 'Tanaka, H', 'Nakao, M', 'Shichijo, S', 'Itoh, K']","['Tsuboi I', 'Tanaka H', 'Nakao M', 'Shichijo S', 'Itoh K']","['Department of Immunology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '144O8QL0L1 (Diclofenac)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '90Y4QC304K (Ketoprofen)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Diclofenac/pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'HTLV-I Infections/pathology', 'Humans', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Ketoprofen/pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Sarcoidosis, Pulmonary/pathology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/metabolism', 'Th1 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Th2 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Uveitis/pathology/virology']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-4666(85)70047-6 [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.1995.0047 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1995 May;7(4):372-9. doi: 10.1006/cyto.1995.0047.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is differential expression of the epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGF-R) and c-erbB2 proteins on villous and extravillous trophoblast populations. Using monoclonal antibodies to EGF-R and c-erbB2, we have obtained highly purified populations of villous and extravillous trophoblast by fluorescence activated cell sorting. These cells were examined by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using nested internal primer pairs for the following cytokines: CSF-1, GM-CSF, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta1, IFN-gamma, IL-2, LIF and also for LIF-receptor. TNF-alpha and TGF-beta 1 were present in all trophoblast populations. GM-CSF and CSF-1 were only found in some samples, with preferential expression of CSF-1 in villous populations. IFN-gamma, IL-2 and LIF mRNA were not found, although all samples contained LIF-receptor mRNA. These cytokines (CSF-1, TGF-beta, TNF-alpha and GM-CSF) are likely to influence trophoblast growth and differentiation in an autocrine manner, since their receptors are also present on trophoblast. These results illustrate a quick and simple method to analyse for the presence of cytokine and other transcripts in trophoblast subpopulations during early pregnancy.","['King, A', 'Jokhi, P P', 'Smith, S K', 'Sharkey, A M', 'Loke, Y W']","['King A', 'Jokhi PP', 'Smith SK', 'Sharkey AM', 'Loke YW']","['Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Movement', '*Chorionic Villi', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Decidua/*cytology', 'ErbB Receptors/analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', '*Lymphokines', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimester, First', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis/biosynthesis', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/analysis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Trophoblasts/*chemistry/cytology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-4666(85)70046-4 [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.1995.0046 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1995 May;7(4):364-71. doi: 10.1006/cyto.1995.0046.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-7 binds to heparin and heparan sulfate, to a lesser extent to dermatan sulfate and does not bind to chondroitin sulfate. It was eluted from heparin by 0.3-0.6 M NaCl and from heparan sulfate by < 0.3 M NaCl. We also measured the affinity of IL-7 for heparin using an affinity co-electrophoresis method and found an affinity of 25 nM. In spite of these findings, IL-7 does not bind to the S17 cell line which supports lymphopoiesis. However, addition of heparin to cultures of an IL-7-dependent pre-B cell line (2E8) inhibited IL-7-stimulated proliferation and IL-7 complexed with heparin was more resistant than free IL-7 to protease treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that heparin may act as a carrier for IL-7, blocking its interaction with target cells and protecting it from degradation during transit.","['Clarke, D', 'Katoh, O', 'Gibbs, R V', 'Griffiths, S D', 'Gordon, M Y']","['Clarke D', 'Katoh O', 'Gibbs RV', 'Griffiths SD', 'Gordon MY']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '24967-94-0 (Dermatan Sulfate)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', '9007-28-7 (Chondroitin Sulfates)', '9050-30-0 (Heparitin Sulfate)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Cattle', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chondroitin Sulfates/metabolism', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Dermatan Sulfate/metabolism', 'Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Glycosaminoglycans/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Heparin/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Heparitin Sulfate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-7/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-4666(85)70041-5 [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.1995.0041 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1995 May;7(4):325-30. doi: 10.1006/cyto.1995.0041.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A smoothed plot of the martingale residues was suggested for this purpose by Therneau, Grambsch, and Fleming (1990, Biometrika 77, 147-160); however, its consistency required that the covariates be independent. They also noted that the plot could be biased for large covariate effects. We introduce two refinements which overcome these difficulties. The first is based on a ratio of scatter plot smooths, where the numerator is the smooth of the observed count plotted against the covariate, and the denominator is a smooth of the expected count. This is related to the Arjas goodness-of-fit plot (1988, Journal of the American Statistical Association 83, 204-212). The second technique smooths the martingale residuals divided by the expected count, using expected count as a weight. This latter approach is related to a GLM partial residual plot, as well as to the iterative methods of Hastie and Tibshirani (1990, Biometrics 46, 1005-1016) and Gentleman and Crowley (1991, Biometrics 47, 1283-1296).

It is also shown that when the parameters governing the processes of cell division, death, or additional mutation at the penultimate stage are subject to perturbations, there are relatively large fluctuations in the hazard function for carcinogenesis for either model, which start almost as soon as the parameters are changed. For this reason it appears that without some extra stochastic ""stage"" appended (such as might be provided by consideration of the process of development of a malignant clone clone from a single malignant cell) the two-mutation model is not well able to describe the pattern of excess risk for solid cancers that is often seen after exposure to ionizing radiation, although leukemia may be better fitted by the two-mutation model in this respect. An examination of the results of perturbing various of the parameters for models that require three or more mutations provides indications that these models are easier to reconcile with the results from a body of epidemiological data relating to solid cancers.","['Little, M P']",['Little MP'],"['National Radiological Protection Board, Didcot, Oxon, England.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Biometrics,Biometrics,0370625,,IM,"['Biometry/*methods', '*Cocarcinogenesis', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Models, Genetic', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*etiology/*genetics', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology/genetics', 'Nuclear Warfare', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/etiology/genetics']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biometrics. 1995 Dec;51(4):1278-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This gene encodes for a zinc finger DNA-binding protein with transcription-repressing properties. During normal ontogenesis it is expressed in a time- and tissue-dependent manner mainly in the kidneys and gonads. Recently, the expression of wt-1 in acute leukemias (AL) was reported. Here we investigated the prognostic potential of wt-1 mRNA expression during the course of the disease using the PCR technique. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Blast cells from 83 patients with newly diagnosed AML and 20 AML patients during follow-up in complete remission were analyzed for wt-1 mRNA expression. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) and bone marrow (BM) from healthy persons (n = 13) and sorted CD34-positive cells from normal donors (n = 4) were used as negative controls. RESULTS: Wt-1-specific m-RNA was detectable in 67/83 (81%) patients with AML. Normal donors did not express wt-1 m-RNA but in 1/4 sorted CD34+ cell samples a weak amplified product was observed. After achieving cytological CR 14/20 studied patients lost wt-1 expression. In 7/8 patients in morphological CR the reappearance of wt-1 expression preceded relapse of the disease, in 1/8 patients wt-1 remained positive in CR. Response to therapy, disease-free survival, overall survival and FAB-subtype did not correlate with wt-1 m-RNA expression in newly diagnosed AML before therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of acute leukemias wt-1 is expressed and probably blast cell-associated, at least in levels detectable by PCR. Wt-1 mRNA was detectable in bone marrow cells of AML patients in clinical CR. The results strongly suggest that the persistence or reappearance of wt-1 predicts relapse of the disease prior to morphological relapse.","['Brieger, J', 'Weidmann, E', 'Maurer, U', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Mitrou, P S', 'Bergmann, L']","['Brieger J', 'Weidmann E', 'Maurer U', 'Hoelzer D', 'Mitrou PS', 'Bergmann L']","['Medical Clinic III, Hematology-Oncology, J.

A report of two cases and a review of the literature.,781-8,"BACKGROUND: The development of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) with balanced translocations to chromosome bands 11q23 and 21q22 has recently been significantly related to previous treatment with several cytostatic drugs poisoning DNA topoisomerase II. A similar association was suspected for other balanced chromosomal aberrations such as the t(15;17) characteristic of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia were observed following treatment for seminoma with etoposide, cisplatin, and bleomycin and treatment for breast cancer with 4-epi-doxorubicin and subsequent cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil followed by radiotherapy. Both cases presented a t(15;17) (q22;q12) and were examined for the characteristic chimeric rearrangement of the RAR alpha and PML genes observed in acute promyelocytic leukemia de-novo. RESULTS: In both cases the characteristic chimeric rearrangement was demonstrated. Case no. 2 in addition to the t(15;17) showed an inversion of the long arm of a chromosome no. 5 and a del(7)(q22) in all abnormal mitoses studied. Despite these findings the patient obtained a complete morphological and cytogenetic remission of the leukemia following treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these two cases and a review of the literature it is concluded that the development of t-APL with the balanced translocation t(15;17) is related to previous treatment with cytostatic drugs targeting DNA topoisomerase II and that additional abnormalities of the long arms of chromosomes no. 5 and no. 7 do not interfere with the induction of remission with all-trans-retinoic acid.","['Hoffmann, L', 'Moller, P', 'Pedersen-Bjergaard, J', 'Waage, A', 'Pedersen, M', 'Hirsch, F R']","['Hoffmann L', 'Moller P', 'Pedersen-Bjergaard J', 'Waage A', 'Pedersen M', 'Hirsch FR']","['Laboratory for Cancer Genetics and Cytogenetics, Finsen Center, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,['0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/*etiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/enzymology/*etiology/genetics', 'Seminoma/*drug therapy', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*drug therapy', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a059316 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)61343-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1995 Oct;6(8):781-8. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a059316.,,32,['Ann Oncol. 1995 Oct;6(8):751-3.

All 39 children received of either G-CSF or GM-CSF (5 micrograms/kg/day) subcutaneously at the end of each chemotherapy course for a maximum duration of 14 days. The effect of G-CSF and GM-CSF on the ANC, the antibiotic therapy administration, and the length of hospital stay were studied for both groups at two cycles of chemotherapy. During both cycles a faster rise of ANC was observed in the children of the first group (G-CSF) compared with those of the second group (GM-CSF), but there was no difference in either the incidence of antibiotic therapy administration between the two groups (26% vs 25%) or the length of hospitalization. Both growth factors were well tolerated by all children studied with minimal side effects observed (including bone pain with G-CSF in 2 of 25 children and pruritus with GM-CSF in 1 of 14).

Furthermore, different reverse transcriptases have differing abilities to transcribe through regions with secondary structure, which can alter the products obtained by reverse-transcribing RNA and then PCR-amplifying the product (RT-PCR). We have been interested in studying the posttranscriptional regulation of epidermal growth factor by RT-PCR and have tested the ability of several reverse transcriptases to reverse transcribe the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR), a region that contains substantial secondary structure. When low levels of either total RNA or poly(A)+ mRNA were used, we found avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (AMV-RT) to be the most robust of all the enzymes tested. Furthermore, contrary to reports that AMV-RT is inhibited by tRNA--which should make it less effective than Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MMLV-RT) at reverse-transcribing total RNA--adding tRNA to poly(A)+ RNA actually increased the amount of specific RT-PCR product obtained with AMV-RT while it decreased the amount of product and enhanced mispriming with MMLV-RT. We found that pre-incubation of the oligo(dT) primer with total RNA at elevated temperature prior to reverse transcription improved the efficiency of both native and modified MMLV-RTs. These findings support the concept that secondary structures in RNA differentially affect the abilities of different reverse transcriptases to detect transcript diversity and raise the possibility that such structures could affect quantitation using RT-PCR with internal mRNA standards.","['Brooks, E M', 'Sheflin, L G', 'Spaulding, S W']","['Brooks EM', 'Sheflin LG', 'Spaulding SW']","['Buffalo VAMC, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Biotechniques,BioTechniques,8306785,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/enzymology', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/*chemistry/metabolism', 'RNA, Transfer/pharmacology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,"Biotechniques. 1995 Nov;19(5):806-12, 814-5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation is being increasingly utilised in these diseases. AIM: To assess the safety of high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation in haematological malignancy. METHODS: Forty-eight patients with haematological malignancy were given high dose chemotherapy followed by an infusion of previously cryopreserved autologous peripheral blood stem cells with (patients with acute myeloid leukaemia [AML]) or without (patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia [ALL], chronic myeloid leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and myeloma) autologous bone marrow. RESULTS: All patients except one had sustained engraftment. The median (range) number of days to attain a neutrophil count of 0.5 x 10(9)/L was 12 (10-42) and a platelet count of 20 x 10(9)/L unsupported by platelet transfusions was 15 (eight to 155). Other than oropharyngeal mucositis and febrile neutropenia, morbidity was low. Two patients had haemorrhagic cystitis, one hepatic veno-occlusive disease and one interstitial pneumonitis; all resolved. The treatment-related mortality was 2%--a single patient with AML died of failure of sustained engraftment. CONCLUSIONS: Autologous blood stem cell transplantation to support high dose chemotherapy is a relatively safe procedure and its efficacy is currently being explored in a wide range of haematological malignancies.","['Atkinson, K', 'Dodds, A', 'Milliken, S', 'Concannon, A', 'Fay, K', 'Harris, M', 'Flecknoe-Brown, S', 'Lind, D', 'McKinley, R', 'Rutovitz, J']","['Atkinson K', 'Dodds A', 'Milliken S', 'Concannon A', 'Fay K', 'Harris M', 'Flecknoe-Brown S', 'Lind D', 'McKinley R', 'Rutovitz J', 'et al.']","[""Department of Haematology, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Aust N Z J Med,Australian and New Zealand journal of medicine,1264322,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Survival Analysis']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1445-5994.1995.tb01492.x [doi]'],ppublish,Aust N Z J Med. 1995 Oct;25(5):483-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.1995.tb01492.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following HMBA treatment, DS19 cells exhibited a slight increment in average interior permittivity and a decrement in interior conductivity, although the changes were not statistically significant. For both untreated and HMBA treated samples, the average interior conductivity increased and permittivity decreased with increasing suspension osmolality. Of significance was that the average permittivity of cell interiors was larger than that of pure water. The electrorotation spectra of freshly prepared cell nuclei were measured, and the derived nuclear dielectric parameters were employed in numerical simulations to investigate the effects of nuclei on the ROT spectra of intact cells. Other cellular internal structures such as mitochondria were also analysed using theoretical simulations.

Early diagnosis and appropriate management are associated with improved prognosis and require an awareness of the infection and a high index of suspicion.","['Celgow, L', 'Cohn, R J', 'Sacks, A J']","['Celgow L', 'Cohn RJ', 'Sacks AJ']","['Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Johannesburg Hospital, Private Bag X 39, Johannesburg, South Africa 2000.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Pediatr Radiol,Pediatric radiology,0365332,,IM,"['Brain Abscess/microbiology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', '*Mucormycosis/diagnosis/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Pyelonephritis/microbiology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01372092 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Radiol. 1996;26(2):131-3. doi: 10.1007/BF01372092.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phylogenies were inferred from both the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of the human, murine, rat, and chicken sequences for BCL-2 and BCL-X, human MCL1, murine A1, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsiae ced-9 proteins, and the sequences BHRF1 from Epstein-Barr and LMW5-HL from African swine fever viruses. Both sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction techniques supported the conservation of both the overall secondary structure and the carboxy-terminal transmembrane domain in all members of the family. All the treeing methods employed (distance matrix, maximum likelihood, and parsimony) supported a tree in which the proapoptotic proteins BCL-2 and BCL-X represent the most recent additions to the group. All the trees also indicated that the viral proteins BHRF1 and LMW-HL arose from a common ancestor, an ancestor they shared in common with the pro-apoptotic control protein BAX, indicating that this function of BAX evolved only recently. The most ancient branches are represented by the nematode ced-9 protein and by the control genes MCL1 and A1, which in the treeing methods employed represent separate lineages within the most ancient grouping. These results demonstrate the evolution of a highly conserved family of developmental control genes from nematode to man--genes that encode proteins essential for normal development but which are highly conserved in terms of predicted structure and possible cellular localization. The evolutionary analysis also indicates that the family may be even larger than originally predicted and that other members are waiting to be discovered.","['Evans, D L', 'Mansel, R E']","['Evans DL', 'Mansel RE']","['Department of Surgery, University of Wales College of Medicine, Heath Park, Cardiff, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Mol Evol,Journal of molecular evolution,0360051,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Caenorhabditis', 'Chickens', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Rats', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00173157 [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Evol. 1995 Dec;41(6):775-83. doi: 10.1007/BF00173157.,,,,"['GENBANK/D11382', 'GENBANK/J02070', 'GENBANK/L09548', 'GENBANK/L14680', 'GENBANK/L16462', 'GENBANK/L22472', 'GENBANK/L22473', 'GENBANK/L26545', 'GENBANK/L26546', 'GENBANK/L31532', 'GENBANK/M13994', 'GENBANK/U10101', 'GENBANK/U10597', 'GENBANK/Z23110', 'GENBANK/Z23115']",,,,,,,,,,

First, LIF mRNA is present in embryonic skeletal muscle and is developmentally regulated. We detect high levels of LIF mRNA at embryonic day 17 (E17) in mouse hind leg muscles. The content of LIF mRNA falls 10-fold between E17 and birth and then remains low in the neonate and adult. The decrease in LIF mRNA in skeletal muscle coincides with the end of secondary myogenesis and the completion of the adult number of myofibers. Second, treatment of the mouse tensor fascia latae (TFL), a superficial muscle of the hind leg, with LIF from birth (100 ng/day), transiently delays the withdrawal of excess inputs from polyneuronally innervated myofibers by approximately 3 days. The midpoint of the process is shifted from 7.5 +/- 10.2 +/- 0.6 days of age. LIF treatment delays synapse withdrawal by altering its timing without an appreciable effect on its rate. Third, in mice homozygous for a disruption of the LIF gene, the midpoint in the reduction of multiply innervated TFL myofibers occurs 1 day earlier, at 6.5 +/- 0.5 days of age. Muscle fiber number is unchanged in LIF null mice. Treatment with LIF does not alter the rate of neonatal growth, the number of muscle fibers in the TFL, or the reappearance of inputs that have been eliminated. Instead, LIF appears to delay maturation of the motor unit by transiently delaying the onset of synapse withdrawal. We hypothesize that this is a necessary component of a selective process that will operate simultaneously and equally on multiple, competing motor units.","['Kwon, Y W', 'Abbondanzo, S J', 'Stewart, C L', 'Gurney, M E']","['Kwon YW', 'Abbondanzo SJ', 'Stewart CL', 'Gurney ME']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurobiol,Journal of neurobiology,0213640,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Base Sequence', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Motor Endplate', 'Muscle Development', 'Muscle, Skeletal/embryology/growth & development/metabolism', 'Nerve Growth Factors/physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/physiology', 'Neuromuscular Junction/*physiology', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Synapses/*physiology', 'Time Factors']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/neu.480280105 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurobiol. 1995 Sep;28(1):35-50. doi: 10.1002/neu.480280105.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nine patients were studied; five who were colonized with Candida spp. and four who developed Candida fungaemia. Twenty-two clinical isolates of Candida spp. were collected and identified. Three of the patients with fungaemia yielded Candida albicans from blood cultures and C. tropicalis was isolated from the fourth patient. C. albicans isolates were serotyped, morphotyped and analysed by DNA fingerprinting of total cellular DNA using the cloned C. albicans-specific, mid-repeat sequence element 27A as a molecular probe. All C. albicans isolates were of serotype A. Eight distinguishable types were identified by both morphotyping and DNA typing from 19 C. albicans isolates recovered from seven individual patients, although there were several discrepancies. Of three patients from whom two or more isolates of C. albicans were recovered on separate occasions, two yielded recurrent isolates with different morphotype codes. However, in both cases, the recurrent isolates from individual patients yielded indistinguishable, or closely related, DNA fingerprint profiles.

Here we expressed the human alpha 2 and alpha 3 subunits in three different cell lines (human erythroleukemia K562, human rhabdomyosarcoma RD and Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells). Although cell surface alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 3 beta 1 in the transfectants mediated adhesion to matrix ligands (collagen or laminin 5, respectively), in no case did we observe enhanced cell-cell adhesion. In the presence of a range of different divalent cation concentrations, stimulatory anti-beta 1 antibodies or anti-alpha 3 antibodies, VLA-2 and VLA-3 still did not appear to interact directly, through either heterophilic (i.e. VLA-3/VLA-2) or homophilic (i.e. VLA-3/VLA-3) mechanisms, to mediate cell-cell adhesion. Furthermore, in some but not all alpha 3 transfectants we observed an unexpected decrease in cell-cell adhesion, suggesting a novel anti-adhesive function. This inhibitory effect was not observed for alpha 2 transfection nor when the alpha 3 cytoplasmic tail was exchanged with that of another integrin alpha subunit. Finally, no evidence for VLA-4/VLA-4 mediated cell-cell adhesion was observed using alpha 4-transfected K562 and CHO cells. In conclusion, using many different combinations of cell lines, we found that cell-cell adhesion mediated by direct integrin/integrin interaction is not a widespread phenomenon, and is not observable in standard cell-cell adhesion assays. Furthermore, in some cell combinations, alpha 3 expression may actually cause diminished cell-cell adhesion.","['Weitzman, J B', 'Chen, A', 'Hemler, M E']","['Weitzman JB', 'Chen A', 'Hemler ME']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Integrin alpha3beta1)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Receptors, Collagen)', '0 (Receptors, Laminin)', '0 (Receptors, Very Late Antigen)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibody Specificity', 'CHO Cells/cytology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Carrier Proteins/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cricetinae', 'Extracellular Matrix/immunology/metabolism', 'Fibrosarcoma', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha3beta1', 'Integrin beta1/*physiology', 'Integrins/drug effects/physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Collagen', 'Receptors, Laminin/physiology', 'Receptors, Very Late Antigen/immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma', 'Transfection/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1995 Nov;108 ( Pt 11):3635-44.,['GM38903/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The predicted protein closely resembles the Drosophila tumor suppressor fat, which is essential for controlling cell proliferation during Drosophila development. The gene has the potential to encode a large transmembrane protein of nearly 4600 residues with 34 tandem cadherin repeats, five EGF-like repeats, and a laminin A-G domain. The cytoplasmic sequence contains two domains with distant homology to the cadherin catenin-binding region. Northern blotting analysis of J6 mRNA demonstrated full-length, approximately 15-kb, FAT message in addition to several 5'-truncated transcripts. In addition to its presence in J6 cells, in situ hybridization revealed FAT mRNA expression in epithelia and in some mesenchymal compartments. Furthermore, higher levels of expression were observed in fetal, as opposed to adult, tissue, suggesting that its expression may be developmentally regulated in these tissues. FAT shows homologies with a number of proteins important in developmental decisions and cell:cell communication and is the first fat-like protein reported in vertebrates. The gene encoding FAT was located by in situ hybridization on chromosome 4q34-q35. We propose that this family of molecules is likely to be important in mammalian developmental processes and cell communication.","['Dunne, J', 'Hanby, A M', 'Poulsom, R', 'Jones, T A', 'Sheer, D', 'Chin, W G', 'Da, S M', 'Zhao, Q', 'Beverley, P C', 'Owen, M J']","['Dunne J', 'Hanby AM', 'Poulsom R', 'Jones TA', 'Sheer D', 'Chin WG', 'Da SM', 'Zhao Q', 'Beverley PC', 'Owen MJ']","['Laboratory of Lymphocyte Molecular Biology, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,"['0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (FAT1 protein, human)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cadherins/genetics', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Drosophila/*genetics', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Laminin/genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/11/20 00:00,1995/11/20 00:01,['1995/11/20 00:00'],"['1995/11/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/20 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0888754385798849 [pii]', '10.1006/geno.1995.9884 [doi]']",ppublish,Genomics. 1995 Nov 20;30(2):207-23. doi: 10.1006/geno.1995.9884.,['A3585/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,['GENBANK/X87241'],,,,,,,,,,

A review of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties and use in the management of acute promyelocytic leukaemia.,897-923,"Tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid), a vitamin A derivative, induces cellular differentiation in several haematological precursor cell lines and cells from patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia. Drug treatment with tretinoin is associated with morphological and functional maturation of leukaemic promyelocytes and a progressive reduction in the occurrence of the characteristic t(15;17) chromosomal translocation. Recent therapeutic trials indicate that tretinoin induces remission in 64 to 100% of patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia. In newly diagnosed patients, remission induction treatment with tretinoin followed by intensive chemotherapy resulted in a significant reduction in relapse rate and prolongation of event-free and overall survival compared with chemotherapy alone in 1 comparative trial. Tretinoin alone does not totally eradicate the leukaemic clone and consolidation chemotherapy is recommended as follow-up. The use of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) provides a sensitive and specific technique to assist in prediction and monitoring of a patient's response to treatment and to help detect the presence of residual or recurrent disease. The use of tretinoin is potentially limited by the rapid and almost universal development of drug resistance and occurrence of the often severe retinoic acid syndrome. Useful strategies have been described to manage these effects but current and future efforts must be directed at elucidating the mechanisms involved and determining the optimum therapeutic management. In summary, results to date indicate that the combination of tretinoin and intensive chemotherapy is more effective than chemotherapy alone and appears to improve the prognosis of newly diagnosed patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia. Further information on the relative efficacy of various induction and post-remission strategies in subsets of patients will help determine optimum use of this promising agent in the management of acute promyelocytic leukaemia.","['Gillis, J C', 'Goa, K L']","['Gillis JC', 'Goa KL']","['Adis International Limited, Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00003495-199550050-00008 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs. 1995 Nov;50(5):897-923. doi: 10.2165/00003495-199550050-00008.,,160,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stimulation of these cells with hGM-CSF induced the assembly of multimeric complexes that contained known and novel phosphotyrosyl proteins. One of the new proteins was a major phosphotyrosyl substrate of 76-85 kDa (p80) that was directly associated with the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase through the SH2 domains of p85. p80 also associated with the beta subunit of the activated hGM-CSF receptor, and assembly of this complex correlated with activation of PI 3-kinase. A second phosphotyrosyl protein we identified, p140, associated with the Shc and Grb2 adapter proteins by direct binding to a novel phosphotyrosine-interacting domain located at the N-terminus of Shc. and to the SH3 domains of Grb2, respectively. The Shc/p140/Grb2 complex was found to be constitutively activated in acute myeloid leukemia cells, indicating that activation of this pathway may be a necessary step in the development of some leukemias. The p80/p85/PI 3-kinase and the Shc/Grb2/p140 complexes were tightly associated with Src family kinases, which were prime candidates for phosphorylation of Shc, p80, p140 and other phosphotyrosyl substrates present in these complexes.

This gene encodes a putative transcription factor with regions of homology to several other proteins including the zinc fingers and other domains of the Drosophila trithorax gene product, and the ""AT-hook"" DNA-binding motif of high mobility group proteins. We have previously demonstrated that MLL contains transcriptional activation and repression domains using a GAL4 fusion protein system (21). The repression domain, which is capable of repressing transcription 3-5-fold, is located centromeric to the breakpoint region of MLL. The activation domain, located telomeric to the breakpoint region, activated transcription from a variety of promoters including ones containing only basal promoter elements. The level of activation was very high, ranging from 10-fold to more than 300-fold, depending on the promoter and cell line used for transient transfection. In translocations involving MLL, the protein produced from the der(11) chromosome which contains the critical junction for leukemogenesis includes the AT-hook domain and the repression domain. We assessed the DNA binding capability of the MLL AT-hook domain using bacterially expressed and purified AT-hook protein. In a gel mobility shift assay, the MLL AT-hook domain could bind cruciform DNA, recognizing structure rather than sequence of the target DNA. This binding could be specifically competed with Hoechst 33258 dye and with distamycin. In a nitrocellulose protein-DNA binding assay, the MLL AT-hook domain could bind to AT-rich SARs, but not to non-SAR DNA fragments. The role that the AT-hook binding to DNA may play in vivo is unclear, but it is likely that DNA binding could affect downstream gene regulation. The AT-hook domain retained on the der(11) would potentially recognize a different DNA target than the one normally recognized by the intact MLL protein. Furthermore, loss of an activation domain while retaining a repression domain on the der(11) chromosome could alter the expression of various downstream target genes, suggesting potential mechanisms of action for MLL in leukemia.","['Broeker, P L', 'Harden, A', 'Rowley, J D', 'Zeleznik-Le, N']","['Broeker PL', 'Harden A', 'Rowley JD', 'Zeleznik-Le N']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Current topics in microbiology and immunology,0110513,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'DNA/chemistry/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Nuclear Matrix/metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Protein Binding', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', '*Transcription Factors']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-85232-9_26 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 1996;211:259-68. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-85232-9_26.,['CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML1 corresponds to CBFA2, one of the DNA-binding subunits of the enhancer core binding factor CBF. Other CBF DNA-binding subunits are CBFA1 and CBFA3, also known as AML3 and AML2. AML1, AML2 and AML3 are each characterized by a conserved domain at the amino end, the runt domain, that is necessary for DNA-binding and protein dimerization, and by a transactivation domain at the carboxyl end. AML1 was first identified as the gene located at the breakpoint junction of the 8;21 translocation associated with acute myeloid leukemia. The t(8;21)(q22;q22) interrupts AML1 after the runt homology domain, and fuses the 5' part of AML1 to almost all of ETO, the partner gene on chromosome 8. AML1 is an activator of several myeloid promoters; however, the chimeric AML1/ETO is a strong repressor of some AML1-dependent promoters. AML1 is also involved in the t(3;21)(q26;q22), that occurs in myeloid leukemias primarily following treatment with topoisomerase II inhibitors. We have studied five patients with a 3;21 translocation. In all cases, AML1 is interrupted after the runt domain, and is translocated to chromosome band 3q26. As a result of the t(3;21), AML1 is consistently fused to two separate genes located at 3q26. The two genes are EAP, which codes for the abundant ribosomal protein L22, and MDS1, which encodes a small polypeptide of unknown function. In one of our patients, a third gene EVI1 is also involved. EAP is the closest to the breakpoint junction with AML1, and EVI1 is the furthest away. The fusion of EAP to AML1 is not in frame, and leads to a protein that is terminated shortly after the fusion junction by introduction of a stop codon. The fusion of AML1 to MDS1 is in frame, and adds 127 codons to the interrupted AML1. Thus, in the five cases that we studied, the 3;21 translocation results in expression of two coexisting chimeric mRNAs which contain the identical runt domain at the 5' region, but differ in the 3' region. In addition, the chimeric transcript AML1/MDS1/EVI1 has also been detected in cells from one patient with the 3;21 translocation as well as in one of our patients. Several genes necessary for myeloid lineage differentiation contain the target sequence for AML1 in their regulatory regions. One of them is the CSF1R gene. We have compared the normal AML1 to AML1/MDS1, AML1/EAP and AML1/MDS1/EVI1 as transcriptional regulators of the CSF1R promoter. Our results indicate that AML1 can activate the promoter, and that the chimeric proteins compete with the normal AML1 and repress expression from the CSF1R promoter. AML1/MDS1 and AML1/EAP affect cell growth and phenotype when expressed in rat fibroblasts. However, the pattern of tumor growth of cells expressing the different chimeric genes in nude mice is different. We show that when either fusion gene is expressed, the cells lose contact inhibition and form foci over the monolayer. In addition, cells expressing AML1/MDS1 grow larger tumors in nude mice, whereas cells expressing only AML1/EAP do not form tumors, and cells expressing both chimeric genes induce tumors of intermediate size. Thus, although both chimeric genes have similar effects in transactivation assays of the CSF1R promoter, they affect cell growth differently in culture and have opposite effects as tumor promoters in vivo. Because of the results obtained with cells expressing one or both genes, we conclude that MDS1 seems to have tumorigenic properties, but that AML1/EAP seems to repress the oncogenic property of AML1/MDS1.","['Zent, C', 'Kim, N', 'Hiebert, S', 'Zhang, D E', 'Tenen, D G', 'Rowley, J D', 'Nucifora, G']","['Zent C', 'Kim N', 'Hiebert S', 'Zhang DE', 'Tenen DG', 'Rowley JD', 'Nucifora G']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Current topics in microbiology and immunology,0110513,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (Rpl22 protein, rat)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Runx1 protein, rat)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135844-68-7 (RPL22 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/physiopathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', '*Ribosomal Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transfection', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-85232-9_24 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 1996;211:243-52. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-85232-9_24.,"['CA 42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 67189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple mechanisms of activation of c-myb by retroviral insertional mutagenesis implicate both transcriptional deregulation and protein truncation in conversion of this proto-oncogene to an oncogene. Because transformation by c-Myb can be viewed as a block to differentiation our studies moved into two in vitro systems to evaluate effects of truncated forms of c-Myb on cytokine induced maturation of myeloid progenitors to the granulocyte and macrophage lineages. Deregulated expression of truncated and full length c-Myb did not result in maintenance of the myelomonocytic progenitor state but rather a block in differentiation at intermediate to late steps in the maturation processes of myelomonocytic cells. Our results argue that inhibition of differentiation is due to c-Myb's ability to maintain the proliferative state of cells.

(2) In what direction have they occurred? (3) What are the geographic relationships of these transmission events? The analyses support a range of 11-16 cross-species transmissions throughout the history of these sequences. Additionally, outgroup weights were assigned to haplotypes using arguments from coalescence theory to infer directionality of transmission events. Conclusions on geographic origins of transmission events and particular viral strains are inconclusive due to small samples and inadequate sampling design.

Nevertheless, the post-thaw sperm quality in these patients is poor. Whether the clinical diagnosis of malignancy affects the cryopreservation of human sperm is unknown. Such an association could allow post-thaw sperm quality to be predicted. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the effect of cryopreservation on sperm motility, velocity, linearity, amplitude of lateral head movement, motility index and motile sperm count in specimens from 30 normal men, 34 with testicular cancer, 39 with Hodgkin's disease, and 19 with leukemia and lymphoma who were referred for sperm banking during a 5-year period. RESULTS: The pre-freeze and post-thaw motility, motility index and motile sperm count were significantly lower in patients than in normal men (p < 0.01). No significant differences were noted among the patient groups. Similarly, no significant differences were noted after cryopreservation. Our results indicate that the poor pre-freeze sperm quality in some patients with malignancies explains the poor post-thaw results. However, the deterioration in sperm function after cryopreservation of semen among patients with different malignancies and normal donors appears to be similar. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical diagnosis of malignancy is not an adequate predictor of the effect of cryopreservation on human semen.","['Agarwal, A', 'Shekarriz, M', 'Sidhu, R K', 'Thomas, A J Jr']","['Agarwal A', 'Shekarriz M', 'Sidhu RK', 'Thomas AJ Jr']","['Department of Urology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Urol,The Journal of urology,0376374,,IM,"['*Cryopreservation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms', 'Predictive Value of Tests', '*Sperm Count', '*Sperm Motility']",1996/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0022-5347(01)66350-X [pii]'],ppublish,J Urol. 1996 Mar;155(3):934-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many studies have used cultured tumor cell lines as targets for cell-mediated cytotoxicity. However, it is difficult to interpret the data generated from the cytotoxic activity against cultured tumor cell lines, since they may not represent the activity against fresh autologous tumor cells. We examined the prognostic significance of circulating antitumorigenic cytotoxic lymphocytes at operation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood lymphocytes derived from 89 patients with a bladder tumor were tested at operation for cytotoxic activity against a natural killer sensitive myeloid leukemia line K562, a human bladder tumor cell line T24 and freshly isolated autologous tumor cells in a 12-hour 51chromium release assay. The levels of the cytotoxic activity were evaluated for potential prognostic significance. RESULTS: The mean cytotoxic activities of peripheral blood lymphocytes against K562 cells, T24 cells and autologous tumor cells were 37.2%, 19.8% and 9.7%, respectively, using an effector-to-target cell ratio of 40:1. Based on the analysis, patients with bladder tumors were divided into 2 groups of high (greater than the mean value) and low (less than the mean value) cytotoxic activity. The magnitude of the anti-K562 or anti-T24 cytotoxic activity did not correlate with the 5-year survival rate or the postoperative disease-free period. In contrast, bladder tumor patients with high anti-autologous cytotoxic activity had higher disease-specific survival rates and a longer postoperative tumor-free interval compared to those with low activity during the 5-year follow-up. In addition, similar analysis of the data at an effector-to-target cell ratio of 20:1 revealed that patients with high anti-autologous tumor cytotoxic activity also had a higher survival rate and a longer postoperative tumor-free period than those with low activity. No statistical differences were observed in patient age and sex, as well as the size, number, histological grade and stage of bladder tumors between patients with high and low anti-autologous tumor cytotoxic activity. The anti-autologous tumor cytotoxic activity was not paralleled with either anti-K562 or anti-T24 cytotoxic activity. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that anti-autologous tumor cytotoxic activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes might be a significant and independent prognostic indicator in patients with bladder tumors, and that the autologous tumor cell killing system might have an important role in the immune surveillance against bladder tumors.","['Mizutani, Y', 'Okada, Y', 'Terachi, T', 'Yoshida, O']","['Mizutani Y', 'Okada Y', 'Terachi T', 'Yoshida O']","['Department of Urology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Urol,The Journal of urology,0376374,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Transitional Cell/blood/*immunology/surgery', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/blood/*immunology/surgery']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0022-5347(01)66335-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Urol. 1996 Mar;155(3):888-92; discussion 892-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the human uterus, LIF is expressed in endometrial tissue and the decidua. To elucidate the role it plays, the mRNA levels for two LIF receptor (R) subunits, LIF-R and gp130, were examined in human endometrium, placenta and decidua by Northern blot hybridization. The expression of LIF-R gene was detected in the chorionic villus during the first trimester, in term placenta, and at lower levels in the decidua. The expression of LIF-R gene was not detectable in non-pregnant endometrium. The expression of the gp130 gene was detected in all tissues examined. During pregnancy, there was no significant change in the mRNA concentration of LIF-R in the placenta, while that of gp130 increased after the second trimester. The human choriocarcinoma cell line, BeWo, was found to express LIF-R and gp130. LIF inhibited forskolin-induced human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG)-beta production by BeWo in a dose-dependent manner, and it ameliorated forskolin-induced growth suppression. These findings suggest that LIF plays a regulatory role in trophoblast growth and differentiation during pregnancy in human placenta.","['Kojima, K', 'Kanzaki, H', 'Iwai, M', 'Hatayama, H', 'Fujimoto, M', 'Narukawa, S', 'Higuchi, T', 'Kaneko, Y', 'Mori, T', 'Fujita, J']","['Kojima K', 'Kanzaki H', 'Iwai M', 'Hatayama H', 'Fujimoto M', 'Narukawa S', 'Higuchi T', 'Kaneko Y', 'Mori T', 'Fujita J']","['Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,"['0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin, beta Subunit, Human)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Molecular Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (leukocyte inhibitory factor)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin, beta Subunit, Human/metabolism', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Endometrium/metabolism', 'Female', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Probes/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Placenta/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Trophoblasts/*cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.humrep.a136205 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Reprod. 1995 Jul;10(7):1907-11. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.humrep.a136205.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although undoubtedly donor lymphocyte infusions are safer than a second BMT, they are associated with toxicities stemming from graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and pancytopenia.

Using these leukemia-prone mice, protective influence of bone marrow (BM) transplantation and tolerance induction to a host antigen, Mls-1a, after BM reconstitution were studied. When SL/Kh mice were reconstituted with BM cells from allogeneic C57BL/6 mice, these [B6-->SL] chimeric mice survived longer than non-treated SL or [SL-->SL] syngeneic chimeras. These findings are compatible to those obtained with [B6-->AKR] chimeras. In [D2-->SL] and [D2-->AKR] chimeras, V beta 6+ T cells reactive to Mls-1a had been clonally eliminated 5 weeks after BM reconstitution. On the other hand, minor graft versus host reaction (GVHR) abrogated the clonal elimination of V beta 6+ T cells in both [D2-->SL] and [D2-->AKR] chimeras. This abrogation appeared to be attributable to early disappearance of Mls-1a producing host T cells in the GVHR chimeras. The cells responsible for the Mls-1a production were revealed to be mainly CD8+CD44+ T cells by in vitro mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), although other T cell subsets also induced MLR under certain conditions. Administration of the CD8+CD44+ T cells from (AKR x BR)F1 mice induced clonal elimination of V beta 6+ T cells in the thymus and lymph nodes of [BR-->BR] syngeneic chimeras. By contrast, CD8+CD44- T cells induced partial reduction of V beta 6+ T cells only in lymph nodes. CD4+ T cells of Mls-1a type showed no tolerogenicity in this in vivo study, although these CD4+ T cells as well as CD8+ T cells evoked potentially MLR against Mls-1a. The present findings indicate that host CD8+CD44+ T cells are a major source of Mls-1a production in [Mls-1b-->Mls-1a] BM chimera system and suggest that CD44 expression on T cells is associated not only with high Mls-1a production but also with lymphoid tissues where the tolerogenic cells migrate.","['Mishima, M']",['Mishima M'],"['Section of Pathology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi,[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science,17410290R,"['0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (Superantigens)', '0 (Tolerogen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Chimera', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Graft vs Host Reaction', 'Hyaluronan Receptors', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Organic Chemicals', 'Phenotype', 'Superantigens', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi. 1995 Nov;70(6):817-27.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We first suspected that the erythrocyte fraction affected the calculated TPMT activity when we examined intraindividual TPMT activities in kidney transplant recipients. We demonstrated that the erythrocyte fraction affected the calculated TPMT activity, thus causing a methodological inaccuracy. A low erythrocyte fraction gave an erroneously low TPMT activity. Mean variation of 7.0% was observed within the normal limits of the haematocrit level in healthy subjects. The slopes of the TPMT activity between erythrocyte fraction 0.1 and 0.5 were all significantly different from zero, and the activity displayed good linearity from erythrocyte fraction 0.2. There was a strong association between TPMT activity and erythrocyte fraction in a population sample of children, but not in two other population samples.

In the absence of calcium, PVL formed pores large enough to allow ethidium ions to penetrate the cells and become fluorescent by intercalating nucleic acids. In the presence of calcium, the pores were too small for ethidium entry but allowed an influx of calcium as shown by the increase in fluorescence of Fluo-3 loaded in the cells. This increase in intracellular calcium concentration induced the activation of neutrophils by PVL as shown by the liberation of their granule content measured by a decrease in side light scattering.

DTBHQ (0.1-10 mumol/l) alone induced rapid and sustained increases in [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner. In cells sensitized with anti-dinitrophenyl IgE, DTBHQ (10 mumol/l) further increased the antigen (dinitrophenylated BSA)-induced Ca2+ response. In the absence of external Ca2+ with addition of 1 mmol/l EGTA, both DTBHQ (10 mumol/l) and the antigen (10 microgram/ml) induced transient increase in [Ca2+]i. In sensitized cells, both DTBHQ (10 mumol/l) and antigen (10 micrograms/ml) elicited histamine secretion, although the response was far stronger in the latter case. The DTBHQ-induced histamine secretion was markedly enhanced by addition of the protein kinase C activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA) (10 ng/ml) whereas TPA alone did not cause any increase. Moreover, DTBHQ enhanced the antigen-induced histamine secretion. The results suggest that DTBHQ increases [Ca2+]i and enhances antigen-induced histamine secretion while DTBHQ alone does not cause as much histamine secretion as antigen, which support the idea that calcium signals are necessary but are not sufficient for maximum histamine secretion in RBL-2H3 cells.","['Kitajima, S', 'Momma, J', 'Tsuda, M', 'Kurokawa, Y', 'Teshima, R', 'Sawada, J']","['Kitajima S', 'Momma J', 'Tsuda M', 'Kurokawa Y', 'Teshima R', 'Sawada J']","['Division of Toxicology, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

The p18 gene encodes a major cytosolic phosphoprotein that appears to play a role in transducing signals that control the proliferation and differentiation of normal and leukemic cells. Recent reports have shown that p18 expression and phosporylation by p34cdc2 kinase is essential for progression through the cell cycle. It was previously shown that the level of p18 gene expression is markedly reduced when several different leukemic cell lines are induced to differentiate by exposer to a variety of chemical inducers. The mechanism of this downregulation of p18 mRNA expression has not been elucidated. We have explored the mechanism(s) of p18 mRNA downregulation in U937 promonocytic leukemia cells that are induced with phorbol esters to differentiate along a monocyte/macrophage pathway. We find that the half-life of p18 mRNA that is exceptionally stable in uninduced U937 cells does not change significantly with induced differentiation. We also determined that the stability of the p18 mRNA in these cells does not depend on the synthesis of a labile protein. Direct comparison of the transcription of this gene in induced and uninduced U937 cells showed that transcription is the predominant level of regulation of the activity of this gene in leukemic cells.,"['Mistry, S', 'Luo, X N', 'Atweh, G F']","['Mistry S', 'Luo XN', 'Atweh GF']","['Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Mol Biol Res,Cellular & molecular biology research,9316986,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Microtubule Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STMN1 protein, human)', '0 (Stathmin)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Actins/drug effects/genetics', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, myc/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', '*Microtubule Proteins', 'Phosphoproteins/biosynthesis/drug effects/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/chemistry/metabolism', 'Stathmin', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Mol Biol Res. 1995;41(2):103-10.,"['5 M01 RR00071/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-41992/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ligation of CD27 by its natural ligand generates a potent costimulatory signal for cytokine production and proliferation of activated T cells. In contrast to normal B cells, where CD27 expression is confined to germinal centre cells and to a small subset of circulating B lymphocytes, CD27 expression is found on a large array of distinct B-cell neoplasia.

In addition, the multiplicity of cytogenetic alterations observed at baseline and on sequential analysis are summarized. The cytogenetic and molecular biologic analysis of B-CLL clones has revealed that there is a dynamic array of genetic events which occur within a B-cell clone. This latter data strongly suggests that clonal evolution may occur in B-CLL patients. However the relationship of the clonal instability to the patient's clinical course is still unclear. The relatively frequent detection of multiple tumor suppressor gene alterations in the B-CLL clones offer several interesting clues regarding the transformation event within B-CLL.

Cell signalling by TNF is mediated in part by the induction of the transcription factor families AP-1 and NF-kappa B. In some cellular contexts, these factors play a role in regulating cell cycle transit. AP-1 binds DNA as dimers of jun and fos family proteins and is regulated by a cascade of protein kinases which eventually activate a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) and also by protein kinase C. Three pathways have been implicated in the activation of NF-kappa B by extracellular ligands. 1, the activation of protein kinase C by diacylglycerol generated by ligand-mediated activation of phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis, 2, stimulation of specific protein kinases by ceramide generated following activation of a sphingomyelinase by diacylglycerol and 3, a novel pathway involving ligand-induced generation of free radical species. In B-CLL and HCL cells, the generation of nuclear-localized c-jun and c-fos proteins (components of AP-1) in response to TNF or PMA appears to be blocked. Whereas PMA failed to induce NF-kappa B in these cells, this factor was readily induced by TNF. TNF induction of NF-kappa B was abolished by antioxidants, suggesting involvement of the free radical pathway. The data discussed here suggest defects in coupling of some protein kinase C-dependent pathways in B-CLL and HCL cells and that TNF is able to bypass these blocks by the activation of NF-kappa B via a free radical-dependent pathway which is independent of protein kinase C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Jabbar, S A', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Wickremasinghe, R G']","['Jabbar SA', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Wickremasinghe RG']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital and Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*physiopathology', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*physiology']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509064938 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Jun;18(1-2):163-70. doi: 10.3109/10428199509064938.,,52,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have therefore examined the effects of a number of cytokines on the proliferation of B-CLL cells, and also on the regulation of programmed cell death, and the role of interferon-alpha in these systems. In the ten patients studied, neither interferon-alpha alone or together with either interferon-gamma, IL1, IL4, IL6, TNF, or serum containing high levels of soluble CD23 was able to induce proliferation of B-CLL cells. Incubation with TPA or IL2 resulted in variable proliferative responses. Co-incubation with interferon-alpha enhanced TPA-induced proliferation in 4 cases, but reduced IL2-induced proliferation in all cases studied.

In this study we examined the immunoregulatory capacity of CD45RO+ T-cells to modulate in vitro IgG and IgM production by B-CLL cells in comparison to normal PB B-cells. Removal of CD45RO+ T-cells from normal PB lymphocyte cultures was associated with a 2.3-fold reduction in IgM production and a 7.9-fold reduction in IgG production. Activation of the T-cell component by alpha CD3 stimulation enhanced IgG and IgM production by factors of 1.85 and 3.4 respectively. Removal of CD45RO+ T-cells from alpha CD3-stimulated cultures reduced IgG production 3.7-fold, whereas no significant change in IgM production occurred. Supplementing T- and NK-depleted B-cell fractions with purified autologous CD45RO+ T-cells produced a positive correlation between Ig concentration and the CD45RO:CD19 ratio for IgG production but not for IgM. Collectively, these results suggest that: 1) 'resting' CD45RO+ ('primed' or memory) T-cells drive mainly the IgG response; 2) activation of these T-cells enhances this response; 3) activated CD45RO+ T-cells derived from the recent transformation of the CD45RA+ ('virgin' or naive) population drives mainly the IgM response. In B-CLL cultures however, the pattern of Ig production in response to alpha CD3 stimulation is more typical of regulation by CD45RO+ T-cells derived from the recent activation of virgin CD45RA+ T-cells. We believe this challenges the view that T-cells in B-CLL are largely memory cells.","['Frolova, E A', 'Scott, S C', 'Jones, R A']","['Frolova EA', 'Scott SC', 'Jones RA']","['Haematological Malignancies Diagnostic Service, Institute of Pathology, Leeds, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin M/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulins/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*analysis/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Rabbits', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509064929 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Jun;18(1-2):103-11. doi: 10.3109/10428199509064929.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blast cells from cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) bind to cellular and extracellular matrix components of the bone marrow stroma. In AML, adhesion to stroma is mediated by the combined action of beta 1 (principally VLA-4) and beta 2 integrins, while in precursor-B ALL VLA-4 and VLA-5 integrins play a major role. Adhesion molecules such as CD31, CD44, non-beta 1, beta 2 integrins, growth factor receptors such as c-kit, and other molecules are also likely to play a role. Binding of acute leukemia blasts to ligands on stroma has several pathophysiological consequences. Stromal contact is able to inhibit programmed cell death (apoptosis) in a proportion of cases of both AML and ALL. In ALL, diffusible molecules derived from stroma appear to contribute. Marrow stroma also plays a part in regulating leukemic cell proliferation. While this is partly due to stromal production of hemopoietic growth factors, in soluble or transmembrane form or bound to extracellular matrix, signalling mediated directly by binding of adhesion molecules on leukemic cells may also have a role. Contact of ALL blasts with marrow fibroblasts is followed by migration of leukemic cells, utilizing VLA-4 and VLA-5 integrins, potentially allowing homing of blasts to favourable microenvironmental sites, or controlling egress into the circulation. AML cells compete for stromal binding sites with natural killer cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes, which are known to inhibit their clonogenic growth. We speculate that these complex interactions between leukemic blasts, cellular and matrix components of stroma, and cytotoxic lymphocytes, play a critical role in determining the fate of small numbers of leukemic cells surviving after cytotoxic chemotherapy.","['Bradstock, K F', 'Gottlieb, D J']","['Bradstock KF', 'Gottlieb DJ']","['Department of Haematology, Westmead Hospital, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Communication/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Stromal Cells/cytology']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509064917 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Jun;18(1-2):1-16. doi: 10.3109/10428199509064917.,,152,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been postulated that AML has a preleukemic stage and a multi step pathogenesis, with the preleukemic stem cell able to undergo clonal evolution, with the acquisition of karyotypic abnormalities, leading to the development of acute leukemic subclones. The activations of the ras oncogenes or inactivation of the p53 anti-oncogene by point mutations have been described recently in several cases of MDS as well as AML, suggesting a critical role for these alterations in the development of these myelogenous leukemias. We reported previously establishment of a leukemic cell line, SKM-1, from the patient who initially possessed multiple point mutations of ras genes but lost these mutations during disease progression to myelomonocytic leukemia with acquisition of chromosomal abnormalities involving the p53 anti-oncogene. This process is characterized by genetic instabilities probably due to the failure of their DNA repairment leading to abnormal control of cell proliferation and differentiation. Studying this cell line, SKM-1, is a promising approach to understand the mechanisms of the initiation, disease progression, alterations of DNA repairment, and genetic instability in MDS and myelogenous malignancies.","['Nakagawa, T', 'Matozaki, S']","['Nakagawa T', 'Matozaki S']","['Department of Medicine, Hyogo Medical Center for Adults, Akashi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*pathology', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509056841 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Apr;17(3-4):335-9. doi: 10.3109/10428199509056841.,,63,,,,,,,"['K-ras', 'N-ras', 'p53', 'ras']",,,,,

Common hematological manifestations of IBD include: anemia, hypercoagulable state, leukocytosis and thrombocytosis. Recently it has been recognized that lymphoma and leukemia can also be associated with both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Careful review of the literature reveals more than 30 cases of leukemia reported in patients with IBD. Epidemiological data show that this association is statistically significant (relative risk of 5.3; p < 0.01; 95% confidence interval). This review attempts to characterize the clinical features of this association. The etiology of leukemia in these cases seems to be multifactorial and may involve: genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, immune abnormalities, prior exposure to diagnostic radiation and a variety of therapeutic modalities. No definitive time interval, specific pattern or correlation between the extent of bowel involvement and type of leukemia was found. Treatment of leukemia might affect the activity and severity of the inflammatory bowel disease, but there is very little data relating to this issue. There is some evidence suggesting that bone marrow transplantation performed for leukemia may induce remission of both diseases. Further investigation is still required in the future in order to establish a definite relationship between these two disorders.","['Caspi, O', 'Polliack, A', 'Klar, R', 'Ben-Yehuda, D']","['Caspi O', 'Polliack A', 'Klar R', 'Ben-Yehuda D']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/*complications/etiology', 'Leukemia/*complications/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509056830 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Apr;17(3-4):255-62. doi: 10.3109/10428199509056830.,,45,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis of HCV infection is currently based on the detection in serum of antiviral antibodies and HCV-RNA. Studies on leukemic children, however, have clearly shown that only HCV-RNA testing correctly identifies HCV infection, as specific antibodies become detectable in serum only after chemotherapy withdrawal in almost all cases. Viraemia instead appears early in the course of leukemia, and infected patients become carriers. The pattern of liver disease is rather homogeneous. Early onset, persisting ALT elevation during chemotherapy often with drastic reduction during high-dose chemotherapy, followed by sharp exacerbations of liver cell necrosis. ALT normalise after chemotherapy withdrawal in most cases, despite persisting viraemia. As regards to the ultimate prognosis of liver disease in these children, we have observed that, among a series of 119 patients followed for at least 10 years off-therapy, none has developed clinical decompensated liver disease and only 6% still has abnormal ALT levels. On the other hand, the need for prolonged follow-up of children surviving leukemia with chronic HCV infection is emphasized by the fact that the natural history of HCV infection has not been fully clarified and that additional late sequelae are likely to occur.","['Locasciulli, A', 'Alberti, A']","['Locasciulli A', 'Alberti A']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology, University of Milano, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Hepatitis Antibodies)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/blood', 'Child', 'Genome, Viral', 'Hepacivirus/*genetics/*immunology', 'Hepatitis Antibodies/*blood', 'Hepatitis C/*blood/complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/complications', 'Liver Diseases/genetics/immunology', 'RNA, Viral/*analysis']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509056828 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Apr;17(3-4):245-9. doi: 10.3109/10428199509056828.,,22,,,,,,,,,,,,

The viral-associated diseases, Adult T-cell Leukemia (ATL) and Burkitt's lymphoma, showed higher p53 mutation frequencies of 24% and 41%, respectively. Mutations occurred in the highly conserved regions of the p53 gene. Two new hot spots for mutation were noted in exon 7 at codons 239 and 245. The spectrum of p53 mutations differs among different cancers. Transition mutations occurring in colon and brain tumors also predominated in the majority of the lymphoid malignancies. However, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) had an unusually high frequency of G to T transversions. Among carcinomas of the lung, liver, breast and esophagus there is also a high frequency of G to T transversions. The differences in mutation spectra between different lymphoid diseases may be due to differences in mutagenic factors or differences in the biological properties of the p53 protein in different lymphoid compartments. Mutation of the p53 gene is associated with advanced stage of lymphoid disease and poor prognosis. For B-CLL disease, p53 mutations are associated with drug resistance. Overexpression of the bcl-2 protein is also associated with a block in apoptosis. Resistance to apoptosis could be a general mechanism for drug resistance in B-CLL and other lymphoid diseases.","['Newcomb, E W']",['Newcomb EW'],"['Department of Pathology, New York University School of Medicine, NY 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Drug Resistance', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/genetics', 'Lymphatic Diseases/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/genetics', '*Point Mutation']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509056825 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Apr;17(3-4):211-21. doi: 10.3109/10428199509056825.,['CA-53572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],86,,,,,,,"['MDR1', 'bcl-2', 'p53']",,,,,

A systematic analysis of primary sequence homology indicates that receptors for gp130-associated cytokines group into signal transducing and non-signal transducing receptors. This observation is consistent with the evolution of the interleukins 6, 11 and 12, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M, and the ciliary neurotrophic factor complexes from a common ancestral complex which included a homodimer of gp130-like signalling receptors and an interleukin 6 receptor-like non-signalling receptor. Alterations in the components of the complex are proposed to have arisen by receptor duplication and divergence to allow signal transduction via a LIF receptor/gp130 heterodimer, and loss of the non-signalling receptor component in the G-CSF and the LIF lineage.

Contrary to expectation, the highly purified LPS extracted from this bacterium was significantly less potent than the other surface extracts in stimulating release of IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha by all three cell types. The SAM was the most potent cytokine-stimulating agent showing equivalent activity to highly purified E. coli LPS in stimulating IL-6 release by PBMCs.

This study shows that the type II IL-6-response element of the rat alpha 2 macroglobulin (alpha 2M) gene, which mediates IL-6- and LIF-responses in hepatic cells, also functioned as a LIF-response element (LIF-RE) in ES1 embryonal stem cells and P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. It conferred transcriptional activation by LIF of transfected reporter constructs in these cells. A characteristic DNA-binding activity interacting with this LIF-RE was induced by treatment of these cells with LIF. The complex between this activity and the LIF-RE had identical electrophoretic mobility, sequence-specificity and kinetics of induction as the complex with the corresponding LIF-response factor (LIF-RF) from hepatic cells. The transcription factor STAT3 was part of this complex, as shown by its reactivity with anti-STAT3 antibodies. Withdrawal of LIF from ES1 cells caused the induction of differentiation and the disappearance of this DNA-binding activity.

The diaminobenzidine stain had advantages over the fluorescent stain owing to its greater stability, greater density, and ability to be intensified. The enhancement procedure intensified both the color and density of the diaminobenzidine product. Consequently, shorter irradiation times could be used. Osmium tetroxide solutions of 3-4% increased the intensity with minimal background staining.

In addition to cellular genes, viral promoters such as the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) are also activated upon T cell activation. To elucidate the functional significance of Fyn in the expression of viral promoters, we transfected a Fyn-expression vector together with a reporter plasmid containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene driven by HIV LTR into a human T cell line, Jurkat. In this assay, Fyn stimulated the promoter in HIV LTR when the transfected cells were treated with both concanavalin A and PMA as an antigen-mimic stimulation. This activation required the intact SH2 domain of Fyn. Mutational analysis of HIV LTR showed that the NF kappa B binding sites were responsible for this effect. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and UV cross-linking experiments showed that activation of T cells by anti-CD3 antibody induced four kappa B-binding proteins (50, 60, 65 and 100 kDa) in Fyn-overexpressing cells more efficiently than in the parental cells.

To investigate the in vivo role of expression of bcl-2 gene family products, immunoblot analysis using corresponding specific antisera was performed for peripheral blood cells and some lymphoid tissues in humans. We demonstrated that all Bcl-2 family proteins were expressed at various levels in hematolymphoid cell subpopulations isolated from peripheral blood, tonsil, spleen and thymus. Lymphoid expression of Bcl-2 family proteins tended to increase following activation, but declined with time in culture. Loss of Bcl-2 in cultured lymphoid cells was especially marked. Sole expression of Bax, but not other members of the Bcl-2 family, was observed on neutrophils, seemingly reflecting their shortest life-span among blood leukocytes.

We evaluated the prospective use of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), in addition to conventional management to prevent renal failure from tumor lysis, in three children with advanced abdominal Burkitt's lymphoma and in two children with high white blood cell count T-cell ALL who were at very high risk based on LDH and urine output.

CVVH was begun at a mean time of 10.5 h before chemotherapy was initiated. Full-dose induction chemotherapy was begun within 24 h of diagnosis. After beginning CVVH, the uric acid levels decreased 46% prior to beginning chemotherapy and decreased to a mean of 4.2 mg/dl 24 h after chemotherapy was initiated. Four of the five patients had either no change or a drop in the serum creatinine. In patient one, blood urea nitrogen peaked at 58 mg/dl, and the creatinine at 4.7 mg/dl 6 days after beginning chemotherapy with a subsequent return to normal. Asymptomatic hypokalemia developed in all patients. After beginning chemotherapy, CVVH was continued for a mean of 85 h (range 70-91 h). No patient had complications secondary to CVVH.

In our laboratory we routinely use an in vivo model in which the local effects of factors on bone histomorphometry can be determined. The factor under investigation is injected just above the periosteum of the right hemicalvaria in the adult male mouse. These subcutaneous injections are given daily over a 1-week period and the animals sacrificed at intervals after the last injection. With appropriate staining techniques it is possible to determine the effects of a particular agent on osteoblast and osteoclast numbers; the area of total bone, mineralized bone, osteoid and periosteum; osteoblast, osteoclast and eroded surfaces, and thus to infer the rate of bone formation and bone resorption in the right hemicalvaria compared to the uninjected left hemicalvaria and to vehicle-injected control animals. All these parameters are measured using a bone-dedicated image analyzer. Utilizing this in vivo model, we and others have studied a number of bone-active factors. We report the effects of parathyroid hormone, as well as reviewing results of our studies of leukemia inhibitory factor, amylin, calcitonin and calcitonin gene-related peptide in the model. The results obtained are similar to those found in most other animal models and in man. In conclusion, we describe an in vivo model whereby bone-active factors, injected locally, can be rapidly assessed.","['Cornish, J', 'Callon, K E', 'Reid, I R']","['Cornish J', 'Callon KE', 'Reid IR']","['Department of Medicine, University of Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Bone,Bone,8504048,['0 (Parathyroid Hormone)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Remodeling/*drug effects', 'Bone and Bones/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Models, Biological', 'Parathyroid Hormone/*pharmacology', 'Sexual Maturation/physiology', 'Time Factors']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['8756-3282(95)00299-S [pii]', '10.1016/8756-3282(95)00299-s [doi]']",ppublish,Bone. 1995 Oct;17(4 Suppl):249S-254S. doi: 10.1016/8756-3282(95)00299-s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow-derived osteoblastic stromal cells play an important role in modulating the differentiation of osteoclast progenitors in two different ways: one is the production of soluble factors, and the other is cell-to-cell recognition between osteoclast progenitors and osteoblastic stromal cells. M-CSF is probably the most important soluble factor, which appears to be necessary for not only proliferation of osteoclast progenitors, but also differentiation into mature osteoclasts and their survival. A number of local factors as well as systemic hormones induce osteoclast differentiation. They are classified into three categories in terms of the signal transduction: vitamin D receptor-mediated signals [1 alpha,25(OH)2D3]; protein kinase A-mediated signals (PTH, PTHrP, PGE2, and IL-1); and gp130-mediated signals (IL-6, IL-11, oncostatin M, and leukemia inhibitory factor). All of these osteoclast-inducing factors appear to act on osteoblastic cells to commonly induce osteoclast differentiation factor (ODF), which recognizes osteoclast progenitors and prepares them to differentiate into mature osteoclasts. This line of approach will undoubtedly produce new ways to treat several metabolic bone diseases caused by abnormal osteoclast recruitment such as osteoporosis, osteopetrosis, Paget's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and periodontal disease.","['Suda, T', 'Udagawa, N', 'Nakamura, I', 'Miyaura, C', 'Takahashi, N']","['Suda T', 'Udagawa N', 'Nakamura I', 'Miyaura C', 'Takahashi N']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Dentistry, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Bone,Bone,8504048,"['0 (Estrogens)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proteins)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dinoprostone/pharmacology', 'Estrogens/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-11/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Oncostatin M', 'Osteoblasts/*cytology/drug effects', 'Osteoclasts/*cytology/drug effects', 'Ovariectomy', 'Parathyroid Hormone/pharmacology', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Proteins/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/drug effects']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['8756-3282(95)00185-G [pii]', '10.1016/8756-3282(95)00185-g [doi]']",ppublish,Bone. 1995 Aug;17(2 Suppl):87S-91S. doi: 10.1016/8756-3282(95)00185-g.,,30,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since it is well documented that LIF is produced by the human endometrium, we wondered if this cytokine was capable of modulating the invasive behaviour of human cytotrophoblastic cells (CTB). METHODS: CTB were isolated and purified from first trimester abortions, separated or not into cells bearing a laminin or a fibronectin receptor (alpha 6 beta 4 or alpha 5 beta 1 respectively) using specific monoclonal antibodies and magnetic particles. RESULTS: We observed that rhLIF inhibited the secretion of gelatinases and of hCG by CTB but remained without effects on the secretion of fetal fibronectin (fFN). These effects were exerted on different CTB subsets: although rhLIF inhibited the secretion of gelatinases by alpha 6 positive cells, it stimulated the fFN secretion by alpha 5 positive cells. The inhibitory effect of rhLIF on the secretion of hCG was mainly due to its effect on the hCG secretion of alpha 5 positive CTB. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together these results suggest that in vitro LIF inhibits the differentiation of CTB towards an invasive phenotype by inhibiting the secretion of metalloproteinases, by increasing the deposition of fFN into the extracellular matrix and by inhibiting the differentiation of CTB into syncytium.","['Bischof, P', 'Haenggeli, L', 'Campana, A']","['Bischof P', 'Haenggeli L', 'Campana A']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Geneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Am J Reprod Immunol,"American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y. : 1989)",8912860,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', '0 (Receptors, Laminin)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Metalloendopeptidases/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimester, First', 'Receptors, Fibronectin/metabolism', 'Receptors, Laminin/metabolism', 'Trophoblasts/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0897.1995.tb00945.x [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Reprod Immunol. 1995 Oct;34(4):225-30. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0897.1995.tb00945.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since chronic B cell lymphoproliferation with a hairy cell appearance has not been described previously, this case might be extremely rare, and has important implication for the pathogenesis of mature B cell lymphoproliferative diseases, including hairy cell leukemia.","['Matsue, K', 'Nishi, H', 'Onozawa, S', 'Itoh, M', 'Tsukuda, K', 'Yamaguchi, M', 'Nakao, S', 'Kashimura, M']","['Matsue K', 'Nishi H', 'Onozawa S', 'Itoh M', 'Tsukuda K', 'Yamaguchi M', 'Nakao S', 'Kashimura M']","['Department of Medicine, Kameda General Hospital, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,['0 (CD11 Antigens)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'CD11 Antigens/immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Size', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/immunology/*pathology', 'Middle Aged']",1996/02/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199602)51:2<141::AID-AJH8>3.0.CO;2-Y [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199602)51:2<141::AID-AJH8>3.0.CO;2-Y [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1996 Feb;51(2):141-6. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199602)51:2<141::AID-AJH8>3.0.CO;2-Y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like other myeloproliferative diseases, ET is associated with an increased risk of development of acute leukemia (AL). However, the large majority of cases of leukemic transformation in ET are thought to be related to prior therapy, usually radioactive phosphorous or alkylating chemotherapy, and the development of AL in ET is extremely rare in the untreated patient. In this report, two cases of ET which evolved into AL without prior exposure to radiation or alkylating agents, and which were treated with long-term hydroxyurea therapy, are described. The first case had cytogenetic changes in the bone marrow suggestive of therapy-associated leukemia, and the second developed myelodysplastic syndrome on therapy which was likely chemotherapy-induced and led to acute leukemia.

The aim of this pilot was to evaluate the effects of this combination in the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory acute leukemia. A total of 21 patients was enrolled. 5-azacytidine, at doses ranging from 50-150 mg/m2/day, was administered as a 2-hr infusion for 5 consecutive days. On day 3, patients began a 5-day course of CBDCA given as a 24-hr continuous intravenous infusion of 250 mg/m2/day. There were no complete remissions with this regimen. Although there were three partial responses, these were generally of short duration. Nonhematologic toxicities were mild. No correlation was seen between response and serum platinum levels.

Thirty MAbs, each of which reacted with the FLV-producing cell line, were tested for potential neutralizing activities; only two MAbs inhibited the proliferation of the A8 virus. These two MAbs were ineffective or had very weak neutralizing activities toward the non-neurotropic FLV strain clone 57 virus. Further characterization of MAbs by immunoprecipitation revealed that 4 MAbs recognized the envelope protein of the A8 virus. Two of these 4 MAbs recognized the surface glycoprotein gp70, requiring the conformational epitope of the virus for this recognition, while the other two MAbs, which were reactive with the transmembrane protein p15E, were conformation-independent. Both of the MAbs against gp70 distinguished neuropathogenic and non-neuropathogenic viruses to some extent, through neutralizing activity or binding activity detected by immunoprecipitation, whereas the two MAbs against p15E reacted with the viruses in a similar manner.

Increasing evidence suggests that thrombotic episodes may also precede the diagnosis of cancer by months or years thus representing a potential marker for occult malignancy. Recently, emphasis has been given to the potential risk of cancer therapy (both surgery and chemotherapy) in enhancing the risk for thromboembolic disease. Post-operative deep-vein thrombosis is indeed more frequent in patients operated for malignant diseases than for other disorders. On the other hand, both chemotherapy and hormone therapy are associated with an increased thrombotic risk, which can be prevented by low-dose oral anticoagulation. Possible contributory causes for thromboembolic disease in cancer include the capacity of tumor cells and their products to interact with platelets, clotting and fibrinolytic systems, as well as their interactions with endothelial cells and tumor-associated macrophages. In particular, procoagulant activities of tumor cells have been extensively studied; one of these, cancer procoagulant, could represent a novel marker of malignancy in both solid tumors and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). In solid tumors, CP, a vitamin K dependent enzyme could represent the selective target of the antimetastatic effects of warfarin treatment. In APL, CP may contribute to trigger the well known intravascular coagulation syndrome accompanying the early manifestations of the disease and is depressed by all-trans-retinoic acid, an agent capable to determine complete remission with a rapid amelioration of the bleeding syndrome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Donati, M B']",['Donati MB'],"['Laboratory of Thrombosis Pharmacology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri Consorzio Mario Negri Sud, Santa Maria Imbaro, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Thromb Haemost,Thrombosis and haemostasis,7608063,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hormones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.26 (cancer procoagulant)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Hormones/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/complications', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Neoplasms/*complications/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/complications', 'Neoplasms, Unknown Primary/complications', 'Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1/genetics', 'Thrombophlebitis/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Thromboplastin/physiology']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Thromb Haemost. 1995 Jul;74(1):278-81.,,32,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML1 (CBFA2), which codes for the alpha subunit of the heterodimeric transcription factor CBF, is also involved in the t(8;21), and the gene coding for the beta subunit (CBFB) is involved in the inv(16). These are two of the most common recurring chromosomal rearrangements in acute myeloid leukemia. CBF corresponds to the murine Pebp2 factor, and CBF binding sites are found in a number of eukaryotic and viral enhancers and promoters. We studied the effects of AML1/EAP and AML1/MDS1 at the AML1 binding site of the CSF1R (macrophage-colony-stimulating factor receptor gene) promoter by using reporter gene assays, and we analyzed the consequences of the expression of both chimeric proteins in an embryonic rat fibroblast cell line (Rat1A) in culture and after injection into athymic nude mice. Unlike AML1, which is an activator of the CSF1R promoter, the chimeric proteins did not transactivate the CSF1R promoter site but acted as inhibitors of AML1 (CBFA2). AML1/EAP and AML1/MDS1 expressed in adherent Rat1A cells decreased contact inhibition of growth, and expression of AML1/MDS1 was associated with acquisition of the ability to grow in suspension culture. Expression of AML1/MDS1 increased the tumorigenicity of Rat1A cells injected into athymic nude mice, whereas AML1/EAP expression prevented tumor growth. These results suggest that expression of AML1/EAP and AML1/MDS1 can interfere with normal AML1 function, and that AML1/MDS1 has tumor-promoting properties in an embryonic rat fibroblast cell line.","['Zent, C S', 'Mathieu, C', 'Claxton, D F', 'Zhang, D E', 'Tenen, D G', 'Rowley, J D', 'Nucifora, G']","['Zent CS', 'Mathieu C', 'Claxton DF', 'Zhang DE', 'Tenen DG', 'Rowley JD', 'Nucifora G']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (Rpl22 protein, rat)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Runx1 protein, rat)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135844-68-7 (RPL22 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Blast Crisis', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chimera', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Mice', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Ribosomal Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Transfection', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1996/02/06 00:00,1996/02/06 00:01,['1996/02/06 00:00'],"['1996/02/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/06 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.3.1044 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Feb 6;93(3):1044-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.3.1044.,"['CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA67189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC40027,,,,,,,,

PGE1, but not PGE2, inhibited the growth of M1 cells. PGE2 neither inhibited nor augmented the antiproliferative effect of PGE1. PGE1 augmented the differentiation of M1 cells into macrophage-like cells induced by interleukin 6. PGE2, however, did not exhibit any effect on the differentiation. PGE1 caused a marked increased in intracellular cAMP level in M1 cells, whereas PGE2 had no effect. These results indicate that M1 cells are able to respond only to PGE1. Radiolabeled PGE1 binding experiments, however, revealed that there was no specific binding in M1 cells, suggesting that the cells express low numbers of receptors or very low affinity receptors specific for PGE1. Stable agonists of PGI2, iloprost, cicaprost or carbacyclin, also potently inhibited the growth of M1 cells. These findings suggest that PGE1 as well as PGI2 may play a role in the differentiation of monocyte-macrophage lineage cells.","['Sawamura, H', 'Hayashi, H', 'Onozaki, K']","['Sawamura H', 'Hayashi H', 'Onozaki K']","['Department of Hygienic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Australia,Microbiol Immunol,Microbiology and immunology,7703966,"['E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Alprostadil/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP/biosynthesis', 'Dinoprostone/agonists/*pharmacology', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1348-0421.1995.tb03261.x [doi]'],ppublish,Microbiol Immunol. 1995;39(10):809-15. doi: 10.1111/j.1348-0421.1995.tb03261.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Severe acute neurotoxicity developed rapidly. Lumbar puncture and drainage of 15 mL of cerebrospinal fluid 2 hours after administration resulted in removal of 32% of the administered drug.

Minor IT overdoses of MTX can be managed by immediate lumbar drainage alone. Major overdoses may also necessitate prompt ventriculolumbar perfusion, IT instillation of CPDG2, and further supportive measures for a successful outcome after this infrequent but potentially catastrophic event.","[""O'Marcaigh, A S"", 'Johnson, C M', 'Smithson, W A', 'Patterson, M C', 'Widemann, B C', 'Adamson, P C', 'McManus, M J']","[""O'Marcaigh AS"", 'Johnson CM', 'Smithson WA', 'Patterson MC', 'Widemann BC', 'Adamson PC', 'McManus MJ']","['Section of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Mayo Clin Proc,Mayo Clinic proceedings,0405543,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 3.4.19.9 (gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/cerebrospinal fluid/*poisoning', 'Child', 'Drug Overdose/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Lumbosacral Region', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*antagonists & inhibitors/cerebrospinal fluid/*poisoning', 'Perfusion', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase/*administration & dosage']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0025-6196(11)64508-4 [pii]', '10.4065/71.2.161 [doi]']",ppublish,Mayo Clin Proc. 1996 Feb;71(2):161-5. doi: 10.4065/71.2.161.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The initial cellular uptake of [3H]ZD1694 was greater in K562 cells than in MOLT-3 cells and the drug accumulated approximately 3-fold more in the former cells following incubation with 0.1 microM ZD1694 at 37 degrees C for 24 h. TS and dihydrofolate reductase activities were not significantly different between the two cell lines. After a 30-min incubation with the drug at 37 degrees C, 85% of the total drug (2.3 pmol/mg protein) in K562 cells was found as tri- to pentaglutamates, whereas MOLT-3 cells accumulated less drug in this time (0.83 pmol/mg protein) and polyglutamates of chain length greater than triglutamate were not found to a significant extent. When the incubation time was extended to 24 h, the polyglutamate profile in K562 cells was progressively shifted towards those of long glutamate chain length and 59% of the total cellular drug (204 pmol/mg protein) was identified as the penta form. In contrast, even distribution between tri- and pentaglutamate was observed in MOLT-3 cells. Total cellular polyglutamates were approximately 3-fold higher in K562 cells than in MOLT-3 cells, and this may explain the 2.5-fold difference in the sensitivity to ZD1694 between the two cell lines. Continuous exposure of MOLT-3 and K562 cells to ZD1694 up to 1 microM or 0.1 microM resulted in 1600- and 4200-fold resistant sublines, respectively (MOLT-3/ZD1694.C and K562/ZD1694.C). The resistant MOLT-3 cells showed a markedly lower cellular accumulation and poor retention of [3H]ZD1694 with no significant change of initial drug uptake by 10 min and with a little increase of TS activity. HPLC analysis demonstrated that more than 90% of the 3H co-eluted with the monoglutamate (parent drug) in the resistant MOLT-3 cells, indicating extremely diminished polyglutamation in the cells. On the other hand, cellular uptake of [3H]ZD1694 was extensively impaired in K562/ZD1694.C cells and cellular accumulation of the drug was only 2.5% of that in the parent cells following 24 h incubation with the drug. Neither an increase of TS or dihydrofolate reductase activity nor a change in the polyglutamate formation profile was observed in the resistant K562 cells. These results indicate that the cellular ability to produce the polyglutamate metabolites of ZD1694 must influence the sensitivity of the tumour cells to this drug, and development of mechanisms involved in the ZD1694 resistance may relate to the intrinsic biochemical properties of the cells.","['Takemura, Y', 'Gibson, W', 'Kimbell, R', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Miyachi, H', 'Jackman, A L']","['Takemura Y', 'Gibson W', 'Kimbell R', 'Kobayashi H', 'Miyachi H', 'Jackman AL']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'FCB9EGG971 (raltitrexed)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Folic Acid/analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Thiophenes/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01226268 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1996;122(2):109-17. doi: 10.1007/BF01226268.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to AraC, both derivatives were highly cytostatic after oral application as liposome formulations. With treatment schedules of five consecutive dosages or with two applications on days 1 and 4 after intravenous tumour cell inoculation with a total dose of 470-1000 mg/kg NH-AraC or NO-AraC, 70%-100% of the treated animals were cured. The lethal dose in healthy ICR mice after a single intraperitoneal application, corresponding to the LD50, was 524 mg/kg for NO-AraC, whereas NH-AraC proved to be less toxic. The haematological toxicity remained moderate for both drugs with a mild leucopenia and a drop in platelet counts, which recovered 4-6 days after treatment. The erythrocytes were not affected and haemolytic toxicities were absent. As non-haematological toxicities, at high drug concentrations, a pronounced atrophy of the rapidly dividing epithelia of the small intestines and of the white pulp of the spleen were observed. The blood levels of NH-AraC given orally reached values comparable to those after parenteral application of a four-times lower dose of NH-AraC, suggesting a moderate bioavailability. Thus, these two lipophilic derivatives of AraC are compounds with a potential for the oral treatment of malignant diseases.","['Schwendener, R A', 'Horber, D H', 'Odermatt, B', 'Schott, H']","['Schwendener RA', 'Horber DH', 'Odermatt B', 'Schott H']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '103426-87-5 (N(4)-hexadecyl-1-arabinofuranosylcytosine)', '158233-67-1 (N(4)-octadecyl-1-arabinofuranosylcytosine)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Drug Carriers', 'Female', 'Hemolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Liposomes', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Tissue Distribution']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01226267 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1996;122(2):102-8. doi: 10.1007/BF01226267.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the monocytic lineage, CD36 is expressed during the late stages of differentiation in the bone marrow, in circulating monocytes, and in some tissue resident macrophages, and it is thought to mediate the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and the endocytic uptake of modified lipoproteins. Here we analyze the synthesis, processing, and intracellular transport of CD36 in U937 and THP-1, two human cell lines representing different stages of monocytic maturation. In both cell lines, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induces the expression of CD36. A 74-kDa intracellular precursor is first synthesized that has the hallmarks of a resident protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. The precursor protein is later processed into a mature form of 90-105 kDa which is transported to the cell surface. The kinetics of processing differ significantly in U937 and THP-1. These differences are specific for the CD36, as two unrelated proteins (CD11b and CD45R) are processed and transported to the surface at similar rates in the two cell lines. A 33-kDa endoglycosidase H-sensitive glycoprotein specifically associates with the 74-kDa precursor. Coprecipitation of gp33 correlates with slow processing of CD36 precursor, suggesting that gp33 may play a role in regulating the intracellular transport of CD36, during monocyte maturation.","['Alessio, M', 'De Monte, L', 'Scirea, A', 'Gruarin, P', 'Tandon, N N', 'Sitia, R']","['Alessio M', 'De Monte L', 'Scirea A', 'Gruarin P', 'Tandon NN', 'Sitia R']","['DIBIT, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD36 Antigens)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD36 Antigens/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Glycoside Hydrolases', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Monocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/19 00:00,1996/01/19 00:01,['1996/01/19 00:00'],"['1996/01/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/19 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.3.1770 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)44992-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Jan 19;271(3):1770-5. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.3.1770.,['HL-40858/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We could also show that the combination of suboptimal doses of these blockers can restore the uptake of the Pgp substrate rhodamine 123 into L1210MDR, 3T3MDR and KB-VI cells and can reduce the survival rate of these cells when treated in combination with daunorubicin.

These sub-lines were cross-resistant to daunorubicin, vincristine, etoposide and mitoxantrone, but not to melphalan. Immunofluorescence with monoclonal anti-Pgp antibody MRK16 and Northern-blot analysis demonstrated that resistance to HHT is related to the sequential emergence of MRP- and MDR1-gene over-expression. In the low-level-resistant K-H30 sub-line, the MDR1 gene was not over-expressed, but the MRP gene was over-expressed 2.1-fold. In the intermediate-level-resistant K-H100 and K-H200 sublines, both the MRP and the MDR1 genes were over-expressed. However, in the high-level-resistant K-H300 and K-H400 sublines, MDR1-gene over-expression predominated (20- and 21-fold respectively). On the other hand, GST pi-gene expression was decreased in all 5 sub-lines. Southern-blot analysis revealed no MRP-gene amplification in any of the 5 sub-lines, whereas the MDR1 gene was amplified in the high-level-resistant K-H300 and K-H400 sub-lines. The most interesting observation is a homogeneously staining region (HSR) found in chromosome 2 of the K-H300 and K-H400 sub-lines.

Characterization of these monoclonal antibodies by immunoblot analysis revealed that they all reacted with recombinant, N-glycosylated ST2 protein that was secreted from COS7 cells transiently transfected with a mammalian expression vector carrying ST2 cDNA. The recombinant N-glycosylated ST2 protein could be immunoprecipitated by 5 out of 6 species of the IgG class monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, these antibodies were also able to detect, by immunofluorescence, the membrane-bound chimeric molecule possessing an extracellular portion of human ST2 and a transmembrane and cytoplasmic portion of murine receptor type ST2L expressed on COS7 cells, indicating that these monoclonal antibodies were useful for detecting the natural membrane-bound ST2 in human cells.

The identification of the ST2 gene product in UT-7 cells may help investigators elucidate the function of the human ST2 gene.","['Yoshida, K', 'Arai, T', 'Yokota, T', 'Komatsu, N', 'Miura, Y', 'Yanagisawa, K', 'Tetsuka, T', 'Tominaga, S']","['Yoshida K', 'Arai T', 'Yokota T', 'Komatsu N', 'Miura Y', 'Yanagisawa K', 'Tetsuka T', 'Tominaga S']","['Department of Applied Biological Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, Science University of Tokyo, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hybridoma,Hybridoma,8202424,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (IL1RL1 protein, human)', '0 (Il1rl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-1 Receptor-Like 1 Protein)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis', 'Base Sequence', 'Female', 'Genetic Vectors/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor-Like 1 Protein', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*immunology/metabolism', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/*genetics/*immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Interleukin', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hyb.1995.14.419 [doi]'],ppublish,Hybridoma. 1995 Oct;14(5):419-27. doi: 10.1089/hyb.1995.14.419.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here the isolation and characterization of the mouse homologue of the CBFA2T1 gene, Cbfa2t1h. Nucleotide sequence analysis of Cbfa2t1h cDNA clones revealed an open reading frame encoding a protein of 577 amino acids with an extremely high degree of amino acid identity (99.3%) to the human protein. The nucleotide sequence is also highly conserved between mouse and human in the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (87.0, 92.0, and 93.7% identities for 5'-untranslated, coding, 3'-untranslated regions, respectively). The 3'-untranslated region of Cbfa2t1h contains a (CA)n dinucleotide repeat, and the polymerase chain reaction amplification of the (CA)n repeat region revealed fragment length polymorphism among mouse strains. Using this polymorphism, we have mapped Cbfa2t1h to mouse chromosome 4 close to the centromere using SMXA recombinant inbred strains and 106 intersubspecific backcross progenies of the (DBA/2 x Mae) x Mae cross.

Fifty-eight B5 fixed, paraffin-embedded bone marrow biopsies were analysed, including 11 normal controls. 10 cases of myelodysplasia, 14 cases of chronic myeloproliferative disorder, eight cases of acute non-lymphoid leukaemia, and 15 cases of myeloma. In normal marrows, the highest proliferative activity was noticed in the erythroid cells (75% to 95%; mean 90%), in comparison with myeloid precursors (15% to 80%; mean 38%), and megakaryocytes (10% to 20%; mean 14%): no Ki-67 positive plasma cells were found. In all investigated haematological disorders, the expression of MIB-1 by erythroid cells was similar to that observed in controls. Similarly, the percentage of MIB-1 + myeloid precursors in chronic myeloproliferative disorders and myelodysplasia largely overlapped the values observed in normals, and comparable values were also found in the blast cells from acute non-lymphoid leukaemia type M1 and M2. These findings suggest that the evaluation of either erythroid or myeloid proliferative activity is of little value in the differential diagnosis between these myeloproliferative disorders. By contrast, the obvious increase of Ki-67 expression of megakaryocytes in chronic myeloproliferative disorders, with labelling also of micro-megakaryocytes, might sustain the diagnosis in controversial cases. Since cases of mature myeloma showed less than 2% of Ki-67 positive cells, evaluation of proliferative activity is of no value in the differential diagnosis with reactive plasmacytosis. The sequential double immunophenotyping for Ki-67 antigen and for haematopoietic cell lineage-associated markers can be applied in a consistent manner to routine bone marrow biopsies to evaluate proliferating cells in normal and neoplastic conditions.","['Pellegrini, W', 'Facchetti, F', 'Marocolo, D', 'Salvi, L', 'Capucci, A', 'Tironi, A', 'Rossi, G']","['Pellegrini W', 'Facchetti F', 'Marocolo D', 'Salvi L', 'Capucci A', 'Tironi A', 'Rossi G']","['Department of Pathology, University of Brescia, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/*pathology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Ki-67 Antigen', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/immunology/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/immunology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Plasma Cells/cytology/immunology']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2559.1995.tb00302.x [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 1995 Nov;27(5):397-405. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.1995.tb00302.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the seven year period from 1986 to 1992, 21 cases were identified with metastatic malignancies in FNA specimens from the thyroid. This represented 7.5% of neoplastic thyroid lesions aspirated in this unit. All patients presented clinically with thyromegaly or discrete nodules. Only five patients were known to have malignancies of other sites prior to FNA. The majority of metastatic nodules were bronchogenic in origin (nine). The gastrointestinal tract (five) and melanomas (two) were the next most frequent sources in the series. Single cases arose in the prostate, larynx, kidney (all carcinomas), and uterus (a leiomyosarcoma). One patient had a thyroid deposit of acute myeloblastic leukemia. This large study demonstrated that tumors of many histological types may involve the thyroid gland, and furthermore, may masquerade as primary thyroid malignancies. Recognition of an alien cell type not only prevents inappropriate thyroid surgery, but may also direct the search for the unsuspected or unknown primary. Metastases to the thyroid gland occur more frequently than is generally appreciated. FNA is the procedure of choice for evaluation of thyroid nodules in general, and thyroid metastases in particular.","['Michelow, P M', 'Leiman, G']","['Michelow PM', 'Leiman G']","['Department of Anatomical Pathology, South African Institute for Medical Research, Johannesburg.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Diagn Cytopathol,Diagnostic cytopathology,8506895,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/secondary', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/secondary', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leiomyosarcoma/secondary', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology/*secondary']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/dc.2840130306 [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Cytopathol. 1995 Oct;13(3):209-13. doi: 10.1002/dc.2840130306.,,,['Diagn Cytopathol. 1997 Jan;16(1):94-5.

An understanding of the cellular events leading to apoptosis is important for the design of new chemotherapeutic agents directed against the types of leukemias and lymphomas that are resistant to currently used chemotherapeutic protocols. We present here a review of the characteristic features of apoptosis, the cell types and situations in which it occurs, the types of oxidative stress that induce apoptosis, the signal-transduction pathways that either induce or prevent apoptosis, the biologic significance of apoptosis, the role of apoptosis in cancer, and an evaluation of the methodologies used to identify apoptotic cells. Two accompanying articles, demonstrating classic apoptosis and non-classic apoptosis in the same Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoid cell line, are used to illustrate the value of employing multiple criteria to determine the type of cell death occurring in a given experimental system. Aspects of apoptosis and programmed cell death that are not covered in this review include histochemistry, details of cell deletion processes in the sculpting of tissues and organs in embryogenesis and morphogenesis, and the specific pathways leading to apoptosis in specific cell types. The readers should refer to the excellent books and reviews on the morphology, biochemistry and molecular biology of apoptosis already published on these topics. Emphasis is placed, in this review, on a proposed common pathway of apoptosis that may be relevant to all cell types.","['Payne, C M', 'Bernstein, C', 'Bernstein, H']","['Payne CM', 'Bernstein C', 'Bernstein H']","['Arizona Research Laboratories, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Arizona, Tucson 85724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', '*DNA Damage', 'Hematopoiesis/immunology/physiology', 'Homeostasis/immunology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Models, Biological', 'Oxidation-Reduction', '*Oxidative Stress', '*Signal Transduction']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509059662 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Sep;19(1-2):43-93. doi: 10.3109/10428199509059662.,,720,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to evaluate this possibility we studied the formation of adherent stromal cell layers (ASCL) in long term bone marrow cultures (LTBMC) of 7 patients with CML and 7 patients with AML and examined the ability of these ASCLs to support hemopoiesis after irradiation and a second inoculation of bone marrow cells. The formation of ASCLs was significantly impaired in CML and AML. These CML patients and 3 AML patients did not form typical ASCLs and the cellularity of these layers was greatly reduced. Colony forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) production from bone marrow cells seeded on normal irradiated ASCLs peaked at week 3 and then gradually decreased by week 8. In CML and AML cocultures CFU-GM numbers decreased rapidly to zero by weeks 4-6 and did not differ significantly from the control cultures which did not contain preestablished ASCLs beginning from week 3.

Patients were not given platelet transfusions prophylactically but only when bleeding occurred. The severity of any bleeding event was scored. Thirty eight patients were randomized during induction. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the number of bleeding events and their severity or in the number of platelet transfusions given. Eighteen patients were studied during consolidation. In contrast, to the induction period, during consolidation there was a significantly less severe bleeding tendency in the TA group resulting in a lower platelet transfusion requirement [3.7 +/- 4.1 vs. 9.3 +/- 3.3 platelet units (p < .05)]. TA was well tolerated and no side effects were seen and no specific thromboembolic events were noticed.

The radiorefractory nature of these cells is believed to contribute to the high relapse rate subsequent to TBI and BMT in patients with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A method by which clonogenic leukemia cells could be radiosensitized in vivo could be clinically beneficial. In the present study, we used a highly radiation resistant subclone of the murine B-lineage leukemia cell line BCL-1 in a syngeneic BMT model to investigate if any of the B-cell stimulatory cytokines interleukin 2, interleukin 4, interleukin 5, or interleukin 6 could have radiosensitizing effects. All untreated BALB/c mice (N = 33) inoculated with 1 x 10(6) BCL-1 cells died of disseminated leukemia within 24 days with a median survival of 13.3 days. TBI (700 cGy = LD100/30 for BALB/c mice) followed by syngeneic BMT (N = 70) extended the median survival to 23.6 days (P < 0.001 by log-rank test). A single intraperitoneal bolus injection of 100 ng, 500 ng, or 2500 ng recombinant murine interleukin 6(rmIL-6) 2-4 hours before TBI extended the median survival to 32.5 days, 31.0 days, and 30.5 days, respectively (P < 0.01 by log-rank test for all dose groups). The improved survival was not due to any direct anti-leukemic activity of rmIL-6 and all control BALB/c mice (N = 15) that received the same doses of rmIL-6 but did not undergo TBI and BMT died of BCL-1 leukemia within 28 days with a median survival of 13.6 days.

The primary anti-viral tests of these synthetic compounds for anti-HIV-1 activity was carried out using the XTT-based cytopathicity assay (CEM-SS cells) with AZT as positive control. It was found that the nature of the macrocyclic headgroups affected the anti-HIV-1 activity. Heteroatom containing macrocyclic headgroups displayed activity in the micromolar range.

DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, 2-arm, complete crossover, prospective clinical trial. SETTING: A university-affiliated tertiary care teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: The study population consisted of 25 consecutive patients with leukemia/BMT who received 162 prophylactic regimen infusions and 169 treatment regimen infusions of amphotericin B via a central line. Prior to each infusion all patients received a parenteral IRAE prophylaxis regimen of diphenhydramine 25 mg and hydrocortisone 25 mg. No test doses or incremental amphotericin B doses were administered. Patients were monitored closely for IRAEs, which were documented by using a standardized data collection form. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidence and nature of IRAEs during a 6-hour monitoring period following the initiation of each infusion was measured. Patients served as their own controls. IRAEs were compared according to infusion duration and therapeutic indication. RESULTS: Three hundred and thirty-one 2- and 4-hour amphotericin B infusions were administered. We found no difference between 2- and 4-hour infusions in the incidence and severity of IRAEs, including overall events (29% of 166 2-hour infusions vs. 25% of 165 4-hour infusions), chill scores (8% of 166 2-hour infusions vs. 7% of 165 4-hour infusions; highest score 7 vs. 6), nausea and vomiting (7% vs. 12%; highest score 4 in both groups), fever (3% vs. 2%), highest temperature increase (2.4 vs. 1.6 degrees C), systolic hypotension (6% vs. 2%), greatest decrease from baseline (40 vs. 62 mm Hg), diastolic hypotension (5% vs. 3%), and greatest decrease (30 vs. 28 mm Hg) (p > 0.05). Overall, IRAEs were less common in prophylactic treatment regimens (35 events [22%] in 162 infusions) than in treatment regimens (55 events [32%] in 169 infusions) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that patients with leukemia/BMT without myocardial or renal dysfunction who receive hydrocortisone and diphenhydramine as premedications can tolerate 2-hour central line infusions of prophylactic or treatment regimens of amphotericin B as well as 4-hour infusions.","['Nicholl, T A', 'Nimmo, C R', 'Shepherd, J D', 'Phillips, P', 'Jewesson, P J']","['Nicholl TA', 'Nimmo CR', 'Shepherd JD', 'Phillips P', 'Jewesson PJ']","['Department of Pharmacy, Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Centre, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Female', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infusions, Intravenous/methods', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Prospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/106002809502901101 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 1995 Nov;29(11):1081-7. doi: 10.1177/106002809502901101.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T/Tn are immuno-occluded in non-CA diseased and in healthy tissues. Well-differentiated CAs usually express a higher proportion of T than Tn EPs, while Tn predominates in poorly differentiated primary CAs. Measurement of density of T and Tn EP expression on primary breast CA permits disease prognostication. CA-T and -Tn are cell adhesion molecules involved not only in invasion but also in metastasis. Immunological methods readily detect in vivo autoimmune responses to CA-T and -Tn EPs in about 90% of all CA patients from incipience and throughout.

This abnormality results in the translocation of the bcl-1 oncogene from chromosome 11 to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14. The bcl-1 oncogene is a member of the cyclin gene family, and high levels of cyclin D1 mRNA are consistently found in malignant B cell proliferations with t(11;14). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined cyclin D1 protein expression in 33 patients with low grade lymphoproliferative disorders and 2 patients with reactive hyperplasias by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody. RESULTS: 8/11 mantle cell lymphomas, 0/11 chronic lymphocytic leukemias, 0/4 hairy cell leukemias, 0/2 Sezary syndrome, 0/2 monocytoid B-cell lymphomas, 0/3 follicular lymphomas, and 0/2 reactive hyperplasias had overexpression of cyclin D1. Cytogenetic analysis was performed in four cases of mantle cell lymphoma; three of these cases had the t(11;14), one of which was hypotetraploid with two copies of t(11;14). Immunophenotypically, all cases of mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia had coexpression of CD5 and CD20. CONCLUSION: Mantle cell lymphoma may be difficult to discriminate from chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a more indolent disease, on morphologic and immunophenotypic grounds. Our findings suggest that analysis of cyclin D1 protein expression may be helpful in differentiating mantle cell lymphomas from other low grade lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Alkan, S', 'Schnitzer, B', 'Thompson, J L', 'Moscinski, L C', 'Ross, C W']","['Alkan S', 'Schnitzer B', 'Thompson JL', 'Moscinski LC', 'Ross CW']","['Department of Pathology, University of South Florida, H.

Other recent developments include new methods for blood progenitor cells mobilization and ex vivo expansion, the use of umbilical cord blood as an alternative source of stem cells, and molecular techniques that may, in the future, provide other modalities of purging tumor cells from autologous grafts.","['Reisner, Y', 'Segall, H']","['Reisner Y', 'Segall H']","['Department of Membrane Research and Biophysics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Curr Opin Immunol,Current opinion in immunology,8900118,,IM,"['Genetic Therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0952-7915(95)80078-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0952-7915(95)80078-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Immunol. 1995 Oct;7(5):687-93. doi: 10.1016/0952-7915(95)80078-6.,,69,,,,,,,,,,,,

G-protein activation via nucleoside diphosphate kinase, a possible general mechanism of mastoparan action.",217-23,"The wasp venom, mastoparan (MP), is a direct activator of reconstituted pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins and of purified nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) [E.C. 2.6.4.6.]. In HL-60 membranes, MP activates high-affinity GTPase [E.C. 3.6.1.-] and NDPK-catalyzed GTP formation, but not photolabeling of G-protein alpha-subunits with GTP azidoanilide; this suggests that the venom activates G-proteins in this system indirectly via stimulation of NDPK. Moreover, the MP analogue, mastoparan 7 (MP 7), is a much more effective activator of reconstituted G-proteins than MP, whereas with regard to NDPK and GTPase in HL-60 membranes, the two peptides are similarly effective. In our present study, we investigated NDPK- and G-protein activation by MP in membranes of the human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, the human erythroleukemia cell line, HEL, the rat basophilic leukemia cell line, RBL 2H3, and the hamster ductus deferens smooth muscle cell line, DDT1MF-2. All these membranes exhibited high NDPK activities that were increased by MP. Compared to basal GTP formation rates, basal rates of high-affinity GTP hydrolysis in cell membranes were low. MP activated high-affinity GTP hydrolysis in cell membranes but did not enhance incorporation of GTP azidoanilide into G-protein alpha-subunits. As with HL-60 membranes, MP and MP 7 were similarly effective activators of NDPK and GTPase in SH-SY5Y membranes. Pertussis toxin inhibited MP-stimulated GTP hydrolyses in SH-SY5Y- and HEL membranes, whereas NDPK activations by MP were pertussis toxin-insensitive. Our data suggest that indirect G-protein activation via NDPK is not restricted to HL-60 membranes but is a more general mechanism of MP action in cell membranes. Pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of alpha-subunits may inhibit the transfer of GTP from NDPK to G-proteins. NDPK may play a much more important role in transmembrane signal transduction than was previously appreciated and, moreover, the GTPase of G-protein alpha-subunits may serve as GDP-synthase for NDPK.","['Klinker, J F', 'Laugwitz, K L', 'Hageluken, A', 'Seifert, R']","['Klinker JF', 'Laugwitz KL', 'Hageluken A', 'Seifert R']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie, Freie Universitat Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '0 (Wasp Venoms)', '72093-21-1 (mastoparan)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase/metabolism', 'Peptides', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology', 'Wasp Venoms/*pharmacology']",1996/02/09 00:00,1996/02/09 00:01,['1996/02/09 00:00'],"['1996/02/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/09 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006295295021191 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(95)02119-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1996 Feb 9;51(3):217-23. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(95)02119-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparison of western blot analysis and in vitro kinase assays of anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates indicated that ATPo activated PTKs whose activity was tightly regulated by PTPases. In fact, an early increase in tyrosine kinase activity was observed after ATPo-treatment and was prevented by specific PTPase inhibitors. In addition, a rapid dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosyl residues on several proteins was detected in ATPo-treated cells.

Mutant proteins produced using the baculovirus/insect cell expression system were purified and their ability to stimulate monocyte chemotaxis and elevation of intracellular calcium in THP-1 monocytic leukaemia cells was measured. Two regions in MCP-1 were identified as important for its biological activity. One region consists of the sequence Thr-Cys-Cys-Tyr (amino acids 10-13). Point mutations of Thr-10 to Arg and Tyr-13 to Ile greatly lowered MCP-1 activity. The second functionally important region is formed by Ser-34 and Lys-35. Insertion of a Pro between these two residues, or their substitution by the sequence Gly-Pro-His, caused nearly complete loss of MCP-1 activity. Competition binding experiments showed that the mutations that affected activity also lowered the ability to compete with wild-type MCP-1 for receptors on THP-1 cells. Point mutations at positions 8, 15, 30, 37, 38 and 68 had little effect on MCP-1 activity.

Cells were labelled with [3H]oleic acid and incubated with extracellular ATP or benzoylbenzoic ATP in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+ and butanol, and PLD activity was assayed by the accumulation of [3H]phosphatidylbutanol ([3H]PBut). ATP stimulated PLD activity in a dose-dependent manner, and the inhibitory effects of suramin, oxidized ATP and extracellular Mg2+ suggested that the effect of ATP was mediated by P2Z purinoceptors known to be present on lymphocytes. Thapsigargin increased cytosolic [Ca2+] but did not stimulate PLD activity, whereas preloading cells with a Ca2+ chelator reduced cytosolic [Ca2+] and, paradoxically, potentiated ATP-stimulated [3H]PBut accumulation. ATP-stimulated [3H]PBut formation was supported by both Ba2+ and Sr2+ when they were substituted for extracellular Ca2+. Addition of EGTA to block bivalent cation influx inhibited the majority of ATP-stimulated PLD activity. Furthermore ATP-stimulated PLD activity showed a linear relationship to extracellular [Ba2+], and ATP-induced 133Ba2+ influx also had a linear dependence on extracellular [Ba2+].

In contrast to U-937/WT cells, the DOX-resistant U-937/RD cells have longer doubling time; are more differentiated along the monocytic lineage as determined by the presence of morphological features and mRNA coding for the monocyte colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor; synthesize the apoptosis-associated Bax protein; are less sensitive to apoptosis-inducing topoisomerase II-directed drugs, apparently because of increased synthesis of P-glycoprotein; and are practically non-tumorigenic when xenografted in nude mice. However, U-937/WT and U-937/RD cells exhibit similar sensitivity to the apoptosis-inducing drug 9-nitrocamptothecin. These findings suggest that several mechanisms are involved in the development of DOX-resistance in U-937 cells, and further, 9-nitrocamptothecin can overcome resistance to DOX.

It is rarely limited to cutaneous locations. We report the case of a 61-year-old patient with CLL who developed multiple skin lesions due to immunoblastic lymphoma. CASE REPORT: Six years after onset of CLL controlled by chloraminophen, a tumoural syndrome developed and was treated by chemotherapy. A papulonecrotic cutaneous eruption was then observed on the face, the presternal area and then on the fingers. Skin biopsy revealed large-cell CD20+ CD30+ immunoblastic lymphoma. Polymerase chain reaction on the heavy chain immunoglobulins showed a band with the same size in the skin biopsy and in the circulating cells. No transformation was found in lymph node and bone marrow biopsies. The lesions disappeared after 4 treatments with VP16, cysplatin and methylprednisolone. CLL was again stabilized after the first chemotherapy sessions. DISCUSSION: Richter's syndrome is rarely discovered due to skin lesions. There have only been 4 similar cases reported in the literature. The clinical presentation of the lesions is insufficient to distinguish them from manifestations of CLL. Histological examination of the biopsy is required to make the diagnosis of high grade lymphoma. Prognosis is usually poor after discover of this type of lymphoma. This is the first observation of Richter's syndrome revealed by a skin lesion in which polymerase chain reaction suggested that the skin lymphoma and the CLL cells came from the same B clone.","['Fraitag, S', 'Bodemer, C', 'Rousselot, P', 'Hermine, O', 'MacIntyre, E', 'De Prost, Y', 'Varet, B', 'Brousse, N']","['Fraitag S', 'Bodemer C', 'Rousselot P', 'Hermine O', 'MacIntyre E', 'De Prost Y', 'Varet B', 'Brousse N']","[""Service d'Anatomie pathologique, Laboratoire d'Immuno-Hematologie, Hopital Necker-Enfants-Malades, Paris.""]",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Immunoblastic/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Syndrome', 'Time Factors']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 1995;122(8):530-3.,,,,,Transformation cutanee d'une leucemie lymphoide chronique en lymphome immunoblastique.

The main physical sign is a gross splenic enlargement contrasting with no enlargement of lymph nodes. Skin involvement is found in 30 p. 100 cases. Twenty-one cases of cutaneous lesions of PLL have been reported, mainly with T PLL, only 2 cases of B PLL: Clinical lesions are polymorphous; histology shows a dermal prolymphocytic infiltrate. The main cytogenetic abnormalities are: translocation (14; 14) (q11; q32), inversion of chromosome 14 (q11; q32), isochromosome 8q. CASE REPORT: We report a case of an 87-year-old patient presenting a T cell prolymphocytic leukemia CD4+ with specific papular lesions of the back. Electron microscopy showed typical prolymphocytes and cytogenetic studies showed a tendency to polyploidy, with the lost of chromosome 14, translocation 8-22 and inversion of chromosome 13. After 12 months of treatment with a combination of chloraminophen and prednisone the patient was in partial remission and the cutaneous lesions disappeared. DISCUSSION: This case is rare and the patient has an unusual long survival (mean survival is 7 months).

In an attempt to lessen the likelihood of developing infections with hospital acquired pathogens, we usually discharge patients upon completion of chemotherapy and follow them as outpatients. They are readmitted if fever develops. We evaluated the feasibility and safety of this practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 29 patients with AML (median age 40 years, range 16-63) who were treated with intensive remission-induction and consolidation chemotherapy. Afebrile patients not receiving antibiotics were discharged immediately following chemotherapy and were followed every 3-4 days at the day care unit. Patients were instructed to return immediately if fever rose to 38.2 degrees C or a fever of 38 degrees C persisted for 2 hr. The 29 patients received a total of 86 courses. Following 50 courses, patients were discharged. These 50 ambulatory nadir periods (ANPs) were monitored. RESULTS: Median WBC and platelet counts on discharge were 2,900 per cubic millimeter (range 300-8,300) and 137,000 per cubic millimeter (range 17,000-618,000), respectively. Mean traveling time from the hospital by car was 1.6 hr (range 15 min-3 hr). In three of the 50 ANPs (6%), patients were not readmitted during their entire nadir. During 47 of the ANPs, patients returned to the hospital (because of fever in 44 cases), a mean of 7.2 days (range 1.0-12.7 days) after discharge. In 45 ANPs, patients were readmitted in good general condition. Four patients had life-threatening complications. Two patients were admitted in septic shock due to delay in seeking admission, but rapidly recovered. Two other patients died, one of cardiogenic shock within 24 hr of readmission and one 24 days later. Only one of the 11 gram negative bacteria cultured was resistant to mezlocillin and gentamicin. After 45 ANPs, patients were discharged a mean of 12.2 days (range 5-42 days) following readmission. We estimate that approximately 383 hospital days were saved by this policy, a mean of 7.6 days per patient, representing 16% of total inpatient hospital days. CONCLUSIONS: For AML patients who are reliable and without complicating medical conditions, selected discharge following chemotherapy is a low-risk practice and may reduce the incidence of infection with resistant hospital-acquired pathogens.","['Gillis, S', 'Dann, E J', 'Rund, D']","['Gillis S', 'Dann EJ', 'Rund D']","['Department of Hematology, Hadassah University Medical Center, Ein Karem, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', '*Ambulatory Care', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/adverse effects', 'Cross Infection/*prevention & control', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fever/epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Neutropenia/*chemically induced/complications', '*Patient Discharge', 'Safety', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/01/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199601)51:1<26::AID-AJH5>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199601)51:1<26::AID-AJH5>3.0.CO;2-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1996 Jan;51(1):26-31. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199601)51:1<26::AID-AJH5>3.0.CO;2-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hematotoxic effects of benzene in humans are well documented and include aplastic anemia and pancytopenia, and acute myelogenous leukemia. A combination of metabolites (hydroquinone and phenol for example) is apparently necessary to duplicate the hematotoxic effect of benzene, perhaps due in part to the synergistic effect of phenol on myeloperoxidase-mediated oxidation of hydroquinone to the reactive metabolite benzoquinone. Since benzene and its hydroxylated metabolites (phenol, hydroquinone and catechol) are substrates for the same cytochrome P450 enzymes, competitive interactions among the metabolites are possible. In vivo data on metabolite formation by mice exposed to various benzene concentrations are consistent with competitive inhibition of phenol oxidation by benzene. In vitro studies of the metabolic oxidation of benzene, phenol and hydroquinone are consistent with the mechanism of competitive interaction among the metabolites. The dosimetry of benzene and its metabolites in the target tissue, bone marrow, depends on the balance of activation processes such as enzymatic oxidation and deactivation processes such as conjugation and excretion. Phenol, the primary benzene metabolite, can undergo both oxidation and conjugation. Thus, the potential exists for competition among various enzymes for phenol. However, zonal localization of Phase I and Phase II enzymes in various regions of the liver acinus regulates this competition. Biologically-based dosimetry models that incorporate the important determinants of benzene flux, including interactions with other chemicals, will enable prediction of target tissue doses of benzene and metabolites at low exposure concentrations relevant for humans.","['Medinsky, M A', 'Kenyon, E M', 'Schlosser, P M']","['Medinsky MA', 'Kenyon EM', 'Schlosser PM']","['Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Toxicology,Toxicology,0361055,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Phenols)', '339NCG44TV (Phenol)', '3T006GV98U (quinone)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Benzene/administration & dosage/*metabolism/*toxicity', 'Benzoquinones/metabolism/toxicity', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Synergism', 'Hydroquinones/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Microsomes, Liver/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Phenol', 'Phenols/administration & dosage/metabolism']",1995/12/28 00:00,1995/12/28 00:01,['1995/12/28 00:00'],"['1995/12/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/28 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['0300-483X(95)03217-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0300-483x(95)03217-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicology. 1995 Dec 28;105(2-3):225-33. doi: 10.1016/0300-483x(95)03217-4.,['ES05630/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 58% of the patients as a whole, treatment of DIC resulted in complete or partial remission, while exacerbation and death occurred in 31%. The efficacy of DIC treatment in the non-leukemic group was less than that in the leukemic group, indicating that the outcome of DIC depended, in part, on the underlying disease. We examined hemostatic indicators in relation to DIC score: prothrombin time (PT) ratio, FDP, platelet count, and fibrinogen levels were found to be important indicators for the diagnosis of DIC, but not for Pre-DIC. Plasma levels of fibrin-D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), and plasmin-plasmin inhibitor complex (PPIC) were significantly increased in pre-DIC. The efficacy of treatment in relation to the DIC score when the treatment was begun showed that greater efficacy was achieved in pre-DIC than in DIC patients. The outcome was poorer with increasing DIC score, suggesting that early diagnosis and early treatment are important. On examining the relationship between outcome and hemostatic indicators, we found that the PT ratio and the levels of antithrombin, plasminogen, PPIC, the PPIC/TAT ratio, and thrombomodulin were related to outcome, suggesting that very high consumption of blood coagulation factors, liver dysfunction, hypofibrinolysis, or organ failure caused a poor outcome. Although the outcome in DIC patients may not depend substantially on plasma levels of TAT and fibrin-D-dimer, we can use these indicators to treat DIC patients at an early stage.","['Wada, H', 'Wakita, Y', 'Nakase, T', 'Shimura, M', 'Hiyoyama, K', 'Nagaya, S', 'Mori, Y', 'Shiku, H']","['Wada H', 'Wakita Y', 'Nakase T', 'Shimura M', 'Hiyoyama K', 'Nagaya S', 'Mori Y', 'Shiku H']","['2nd Department of Internal Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu-city, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Thromb Haemost,Thrombosis and haemostasis,7608063,"['0 (Antifibrinolytic Agents)', '0 (Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products)', '0 (antithrombin III-protease complex)', '0 (fibrin fragment D)', '9000-94-6 (Antithrombin III)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.21.7 (Fibrinolysin)']",IM,"['Antifibrinolytic Agents/chemistry', 'Antithrombin III/metabolism', 'Blood Coagulation Tests', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/complications/*drug therapy', 'Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products/metabolism', 'Fibrinolysin/chemistry', 'Hemostasis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Platelet Count', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prothrombin Time', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Thromb Haemost. 1995 Sep;74(3):848-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a 71 year-old man with chronic lymphocytic leukemia of 4 years duration who developed a severe mucocutaneous eruption with clinical and immunofluorescence findings of pemphigus vulgaris evolving into an oral bullous lichen planus presentation.

Only a few systemic diseases seem to be frequently associated with MDS: seronegative arthritis, cutaneous vasculitis, and relapsing polychondritis. These diseases are probably not entirely auto-immune, and the signification of their association with an MDS remains unclear. About 30% of relapsing polychondritis are associated with MDS. Conversely, 0.6% of MDS are associated with a relapsing polychondritis. These associations are mainly encountered in men suffering from a refractory anemia (with or without excess of blasts).

However, unlike c-myb, whose expression is restricted largely to immature hematopoietic cells, B-myb mRNA has been found to be expressed in all proliferating mammalian cell lines and is clearly regulated in a cell cycle dependent manner. That c-Myb and B-Myb proteins perform different roles in proliferation and/or differentiation is suggested by the redundancy of their expression. It was previously shown that degenerated c-Myb expression can inhibit IL-6 induced terminal differentiation of the leukemia cell line M1. We found that, unlike the downregulation of c-Myb protein which is an early response of progenitor M1 cells to IL-6 treatment, the downregulation of B-Myb occurs late, just prior to terminal differentiation and growth arrest. It was, therefore, of interest to examine the role of the murine B-Myb protein in the proliferation and differentiation of the M1 cells and to compare these effects to those of c-Myb in the same system. Clones ectopically producing B-Myb, like those ectopically expressing c-Myb, proliferated in the presence of the differentiation-inducing agent and did not undergo the programmed cell death which normally follows terminal macrophage differentiation. In addition, the cell-cycle distribution of M1/B-Myb cells was comparable to untreated cells. Although M1/B-Myb and M1/c-Myb clones treated with IL-6 appeared quite immature, differentiation markers were demonstrated to be maintained at near normal levels (e.g. MyD88, Mac-2), or be partially reduced in expression (C3, Fc and Mac-1 receptors) suggesting that the cells had undergone commitment to maturation, but were unable to terminally differentiate.","['Bies, J', 'Hoffman, B', 'Amanullah, A', 'Giese, T', 'Wolff, L']","['Bies J', 'Hoffman B', 'Amanullah A', 'Giese T', 'Wolff L']","['Laboratory of Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-4255, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Mybl2 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, myc', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', '*Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/18 00:00,1996/01/18 00:01,['1996/01/18 00:00'],"['1996/01/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/18 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/18 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Jan 18;12(2):355-63.,['1RO1CA51162/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In t(11;17) the PLZF gene, encoding a Kruppel-like zinc finger protein, is fused to the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RAR alpha) gene, yielding two classes of chimeric proteins. PLZF protein was found in the nucleus in a punctate speckled pattern that differed from the nuclear body expression pattern of the PML protein affected in t(15;17) APL. The reciprocal PLZF-RAR alpha and RAR alpha-PLZF fusion proteins were localized to the nucleus both in the presence and absence of ATRA. PLZF-RAR alpha, in combination with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) bound to a retinoic acid-responsive element (RARE) less efficiently than RAR alpha and formed multimeric DNA-protein complexes. PLZF-RAR alpha stimulated ATRA-dependent transcription of RARE-containing reporter genes with diminished activity compared to wild-type RAR alpha. In addition, PLZF-RAR alpha antagonized the function of coexpressed wild-type RAR alpha, an effect relieved by over-expression of RXR. Leukemogenesis in t(11;17) APL may be related to interference with ATRA-mediated differentiation due to sequestration of RXR by the PLZF-RAR alpha chimera.

Withdrawal of DIA/LIF, which induces differentiation, results in the progressive up-regulation of all. Up-regulation of D cyclins occurs through an increase in the steady-state levels of mRNA, concomitantly with the activation of Brachyury and Goosecoid, two early markers of mesoderm differentiation. Similarly, cells from the epiblast of the early postimplantation mouse embryo do not express any cyclin D/CDK4 complexes. These are progressively upregulated at gastrulation and early organogenesis. DIA/LIF-stimulated ES cells are not growth-arrested by overexpression of p16Ink4a, a specific inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6.

Moreover, when both c-Myc and Max expression was concommitantly blocked, many of the cells underwent terminal differentiation. Finally, extending these studies to myeloblast enriched normal bone marrow (BM) cell has shown that blocking expression of either c-Myc or Max accelerated GM-CSF-induced differentiation along both the granulocytic and monocytic lineages.

The involvement of the MAPK pathway in mediating both the early phosphorylation and transcriptional activation events and the chronic differentiation of U937 cells was examined utilizing constitutively active MAPK kinase (MEK1) mutants. Transient expression of an activated MEK1 construct in U937 cells was found to stimulate MAPK and SAPK activity, as well as enhancing AP1-, SRE- and c-Jun-mediated transcriptional activity. Transient transfection of MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), a protein phosphatase which preferentially dephosphorylates and inactivates MAPK, inhibited the functional effects of both PMA and the constitutively active MEK1 mutants. To determine whether specific activation of the MEK/MAPK pathway was sufficient to induce hematopoietic differentiation, U937 cell lines were established that conditionally expressed the activated MEK1 mutant under the control of the human IIa metallothionein promoter. The induction of constitutively active MEK1 protein expression resulted in an increase in MEK1 activity, c-Jun and AP-1 transcriptional activity and an inhibition of U937 cell growth. However, this growth inhibition was not accompanied by U937 cell differentiation.

DESIGN: Descriptive. SETTING: Emma's Children's Hospital, Academic Medical Centre, University of Amsterdam and Central Laboratory of the Dutch Red Cross, Amsterdam. METHOD: Of 50 children suffering from progenitor-B cell ALL, stored bone marrow samples and bone marrow slides were investigated: 328 bone marrow samples were analysed by PCR for IgH/TCR delta; 34 patients were analysed at the end of induction therapy. Follow-up period was 20 to 133 months. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients stayed in continuous complete remission (CCR), 28 patients experienced a recurrence (REC). Reduction of tumour mass was higher in the CCR group. At the end of induction therapy 2/18 CCR patients and 10/16 REC patients were PCR positive (p = 0.005). PCR positivity was not related with known prognostic factors. After recurrence 6/8 patients, who became PCR negative, stayed in remission. All patients who stayed positive after treatment for their recurrence died from leukaemia (p = 0.006). All children who were only temporary PCR negative suffered a recurrence. CONCLUSION: Analysis of MRD by means of PCR on bone marrow samples during and after treatment for progenitor-B cell ALL is of prognostic importance.","['Steenbergen, E J', 'Verhagen, O J', 'van den Berg, H', 'van Leeuwen, E F', 'von dem Borne, A E', 'van der Schoot, C E']","['Steenbergen EJ', 'Verhagen OJ', 'van den Berg H', 'van Leeuwen EF', 'von dem Borne AE', 'van der Schoot CE']","['Centraal Laboratorium van de Bloedtransfusiedienst, Amsterdam.']",['dut'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,0400770,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics', 'Recurrence']",1996/01/06 00:00,1996/01/06 00:01,['1996/01/06 00:00'],"['1996/01/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/06 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd. 1996 Jan 6;140(1):22-8.,,,,,Kinderen met acute lymfoblastenleukemie: de prognostische betekenis van analyse door middel van de polymerase-kettingreactie van minimale residuale ziekte.,,,,,,,,,

Because the structure of these PKC isotypes contains a conserved cysteine-rich region that contains the zinc finger DNA binding motif, we tested the hypothesis that selected PKC isotypes found in Friend erythroleukemia cells can bind to DNA. Cell lysates from murine Friend erythroleukemia cells, which express alpha, beta I, and beta II PKC, expressed greater amounts of the beta isoforms than the alpha isoform of PKC in their nuclei, and PKC beta I was found in the chromatin of these cells. Lysates of these cells were tested for their ability to bind to a DNA-cellulose column. Bound proteins were eluted with a step gradient of increasing KCl concentrations, and eluant fractions were then subjected to immunoblot analysis using isotype-specific antibodies to the alpha and beta I isotypes of PKC. DNA binding was detected for the PKC beta I isotype, which is present in the nucleus, but not for the more abundant PKC alpha isotype, which resides primarily in the cytoplasm.

Since breakdown products of MBP generated by calpain may include fragments with antigenic epitopes, this enzyme may play an important role in the initiation of immune-mediated demyelination.","['Deshpande, R V', 'Goust, J M', 'Hogan, E L', 'Banik, N L']","['Deshpande RV', 'Goust JM', 'Hogan EL', 'Banik NL']","['Department of Neurology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Myelin Basic Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '79079-11-1 (calpastatin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/pharmacology', 'Calpain/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Demyelinating Diseases/enzymology', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/enzymology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/enzymology/pathology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Myelin Basic Protein/*metabolism', 'Myelin Sheath/*drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jnr.490420214 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 1995 Oct 1;42(2):259-65. doi: 10.1002/jnr.490420214.,"['NS-11066/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-31622/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, extensive DNA damage was observed in human chronic myelogenous leukemic cells (K562) exposed for 15 minutes to low concentrations (15-100 microM) of the redox cycling quinones 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (2,3-diOMe-1,4-NQ) and menadione. However, DNA strand breakage and cell death could not be attributed to oxidative stress as the intracellular level and redox status of the reducing equivalents NADP(H) and GSH were unaffected. The intracellular level of NAD+ was found to correlate well with the extent of DNA repair (r = 0.93, P < 0.02) and cell proliferation (r = 0.96, P < 0.01) in cells exposed to the quinones. In contrast, a significant decrease in the level of intracellular ATP was only observed in cells exposed to menadione (50-100 microM). These results suggest that redox cycling quinones are capable of inducing DNA damage in mammalian cells by a mechanism that does not involve oxidative stress. Following DNA damage, cell death is dependent on the availability of NAD+, which may be key to the rapid repair of strand breaks.","['Morgan, W A']",['Morgan WA'],"['Interdisciplinary Centre for Cell Modulation Studies, Faculty of Science and Health, University of East London, Stratford.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biochem Toxicol,Journal of biochemical toxicology,8700114,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '12001-79-5 (Vitamin K)', '6956-96-3 (2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/analysis', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Division', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'NAD/analysis', 'Naphthoquinones/*toxicity', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Substrate Cycling', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin K/*toxicity']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jbt.2570100407 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem Toxicol. 1995 Aug;10(4):227-32. doi: 10.1002/jbt.2570100407.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The general methodology for the synthesis of these molecules involved the preparation of the dipeptide derivatives employing solution phase peptide synthesis followed by condensation of the dipeptide free bases with the appropriate pteroic acid analogue via diethyl cyanophosphoridate (DEPC) activation. In the final step, tert-butyl esters were removed by trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) hydrolysis. Z-L-Glu-OBut-gamma-D-Ala-OBut, for example, was prepared from alpha-tert-butyl N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-glutamate and tert-butyl D-alaninate via isobutyl-mixed anhydride coupling.

LIF is also expressed by the extraembryonic membranes of the early mouse embryo. Embryos of different ages were cultured with, or without, LIF, and embryo growth in vivo and in vitro was examined to determine whether LIF is important for embryo development. Supplementing embryo culture media with 1000 U recombinant human LIF ml-1 increased the number of eight-cell mouse embryos developing beyond the hatched blastocyst stage in vitro from 62.1% to 85.1% (P < 0.05). LIF significantly increased the number of embryos hatching (33.8% versus 7.65% for controls 96 h after hCG injection, P < 0.001), completely hatching (85.1% versus 62.1%, P < 0.05), and exhibiting trophoblast outgrowth (13.5% versus 0% 120 h after hCG treatment, 85.1% versus 47.0% 144 h after hCG treatment, P < 0.001) in vitro. LIF-treated embryos also displayed a significantly greater area of trophoblast outgrowth than did controls as early as day 5 in culture (P < 0.005). These data show that LIF enhances mouse eight-cell embryo development in vitro, as seen by the accelerated rate of embryo hatching and trophoblast outgrowth. In addition, enhanced embryo survival in vivo is shown, following the transfer of LIF-treated embryos into a pseudopregnant recipient female. Expression of mRNA encoding LIF was detected in endometrial cells cultured in monolayer from uteri of day 3 pregnant females, explaining the known embryotrophic effects of endometrial coculture. This expression was not enhanced significantly by treatment with oestradiol (3.7 x 10(-5) mol l-1) or progesterone (3.2 x 10(-6) mol l-1) or both hormones. These results indicate that LIF could have a dual action in early embryogenesis as an embryotrophin and as a factor required for embryo implantation. Multiple roles for LIF are consistent with the expression of this factor at embryonic, extraembryonic and maternal sites during early embryogenesis.","['Lavranos, T C', 'Rathjen, P D', 'Seamark, R F']","['Lavranos TC', 'Rathjen PD', 'Seamark RF']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Adelaide, South Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Reprod Fertil,Journal of reproduction and fertility,0376367,"['0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin/pharmacology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/*drug effects', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/drug effects', 'Endometrium/drug effects/metabolism', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Pregnancy', 'Progesterone/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Trophoblasts/physiology']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1530/jrf.0.1050331 [doi]'],ppublish,J Reprod Fertil. 1995 Nov;105(2):331-8. doi: 10.1530/jrf.0.1050331.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of these cytokines (IL-6, IL-11, and CNTF) also require a specificity-determining alpha subunit not directly involved in signaling. We have searched for functional receptor complexes for these cytokines in cells of the bone marrow stromal/osteoblastic lineage, using tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta subunits as a detection assay. Collectively, murine calvaria cells, bone marrow-derived murine cell lines (+/+LDA11 and MBA13.2), as well as murine (MC3T3-E1) and human (MG-63) osteoblast-like cell lines displayed all the previously recognized alpha and beta subunits of this family of receptors. However, individual cell types had different constellations of alpha and beta subunits. In addition and in difference to the other cell types examined, MC3T3-E1 cells expressed a heretofore unrecognized form of gp130; and MG-63 displayed an alternative form (type II) of the OSM receptor. These findings establish that stromal/osteoblastic cells are targets for the actions of all the members of the cytokine subfamily that shares the gp130 signal transducer; and suggest that different receptor repertoires may be expressed at different stages of differentiation of this lineage.","['Bellido, T', 'Stahl, N', 'Farruggella, T J', 'Borba, V', 'Yancopoulos, G D', 'Manolagas, S C']","['Bellido T', 'Stahl N', 'Farruggella TJ', 'Borba V', 'Yancopoulos GD', 'Manolagas SC']","['Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Center for Osteoporosis and Metabolic Bone Diseases, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock 72205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL11RA protein, human)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Il11ra1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Il11ra2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-11)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Biological Assay', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', '*Lymphokines', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Osteoblasts/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-11', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M']",1996/01/15 00:00,1996/01/15 00:01,['1996/01/15 00:00'],"['1996/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI118432 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1996 Jan 15;97(2):431-7. doi: 10.1172/JCI118432.,['AR41313/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,PMC507034,,,,,,,,

In the present report we investigated the effect of the cell cycle on the expression of surface and soluble TNF receptors in human histiocytic lymphoma U-937. Exposure to hydroxyurea, thymidine, etoposide, bisbensimide, and demecolcine lead to accumulation of cells primarily in G1/S, S, S/G2/M, G2/M, and M stages of the cell cycle, respectively. While no significant change in TNF receptors occurred in cells arrested in G1/S or S/G2 stages, about a 50% decrease was observed in cells at M phase of the cycle. Scatchard analysis showed a reduction in receptor number rather than affinity. In contrast, cells arrested at S phase (thymidine) showed an 80% increase in receptor number. The decrease in the TNF receptors was not due to changes in cell size or protein synthesis. The increase in receptors, however, correlated with an increase in total protein synthesis (to 3.8-fold of the control levels). A proportional change was observed in the p60 and p80 forms of the TNF receptors. A decrease in the surface receptors in cells arrested in M phase correlated with an increase in the amount of soluble receptors. The cellular response to TNF increased to 8- and 2-fold in cells arrested in G1 and S phase, respectively; but cells at G2/M phase showed about 6-fold decrease in response. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the cell cycle plays an important role in regulation of cell-surface and soluble TNF receptors and also in the modulation of cellular response.","['Pocsik, E', 'Mihalik, R', 'Penzes, M', 'Loetscher, H', 'Gallati, H', 'Aggarwal, B B']","['Pocsik E', 'Mihalik R', 'Penzes M', 'Loetscher H', 'Gallati H', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Department of Immunology, National Institute of Haematology, Blood Transfusion, and Immunology, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)', 'Z01IVE25KI (Demecolcine)']",IM,"['*Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Demecolcine/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*metabolism', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.240590303 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1995 Nov;59(3):303-16. doi: 10.1002/jcb.240590303.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we present evidence that SPP activates a G protein-coupled receptor in the plasma membrane of various cells, leading to increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, and opening of G protein-regulated potassium channels. In human enbryonic kidney (HEK) cells, SPP potently (EC50, 2 nM) and rapidly increased [Ca2+]i in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. Pertussis toxin-sensitive increase in [Ca2+]i was also observed with sphingosylphosphorylcholine (EC50, 460 nM), whereas other sphingolipids, including ceramide-1-phosphate, N-palmitoyl-sphingosine, psychosine, and D-erythro-sphingosine at micromolar concentrations did not or only marginally increased [Ca2+]i. Furthermore, SPP inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in HEK cells and increased binding of guanosine 5'3-O-(thio) triphosphate to HEK cell membranes. Rapid [Ca2+]i responses were also observed in human transitional bladder carcinoma (J82) cells, monkey COS-1 cells, mouse NIH 3T3 cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells, and rat C6 glioma cells, whereas human HL-60 leukemia cells and human erythroleukemia cells failed to respond to SPP. In guinea pig atrial myocytes, SPP activated Gi protein-regulated inwardly rectifying potassium channels. Activation of these channels occurred strictly when SPP was applied at the extracellular face of atrial myocyte plasma membrane as measured in cell-attached and inside-out patch clamp current recordings. We conclude that SPP, in addition to its proposed direct action on intracellular Ca2+ stores, interacts with a high affinity Gi protein-coupled receptor in the plasma membrane of apparently many different cell types.","['van Koppen, C', 'Meyer zu Heringdorf, M', 'Laser, K T', 'Zhang, C', 'Jakobs, K H', 'Bunemann, M', 'Pott, L']","['van Koppen C', 'Meyer zu Heringdorf M', 'Laser KT', 'Zhang C', 'Jakobs KH', 'Bunemann M', 'Pott L']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie, Universitat GH Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adenylate Cyclase Toxin)', '0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Muscarinic)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '26993-30-6 (sphingosine 1-phosphate)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Adenylate Cyclase Toxin', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cricetinae', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/metabolism"", 'Guinea Pigs', 'Heart/physiology', 'Humans', 'Ion Channel Gating', '*Lysophospholipids', 'Mice', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Potassium Channels/physiology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Muscarinic/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/physiology', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1996/01/26 00:00,1996/01/26 00:01,['1996/01/26 00:00'],"['1996/01/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/26 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.4.2082 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)46144-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Jan 26;271(4):2082-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.4.2082.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results suggest that an efficient tumor-cell vaccine can lead to induction of tumor dormancy that can be maintained by a cell-derived mechanism for a long period of time.","['Morecki, S', 'Pugatsch, T', 'Levi, S', 'Moshel, Y', 'Slavin, S']","['Morecki S', 'Pugatsch T', 'Levi S', 'Moshel Y', 'Slavin S']","['Department of Bone-Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Animals', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Immunotherapy, Active', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1996/01/17 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/01/17 00:00'],"['1996/01/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/01/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960117)65:2<204::AID-IJC13>3.0.CO;2-D [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960117)65:2<204::AID-IJC13>3.0.CO;2-D [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1996 Jan 17;65(2):204-8. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960117)65:2<204::AID-IJC13>3.0.CO;2-D.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its main influence in experimental models is on the age at onset of malignancies. We have previously shown a similar effect of homozygosity for HLA-DR53 in CML. In the present study, we investigated 79 patients with CLL and 329 local controls from Germany. In addition to full serotyping, all patients and 116 of controls were also typed by HLA-DRB PCR analysis. The homozygosity rates for DR53 in patients under and over the median age (60 years) were 18.6% and 2.9%, respectively (p = 0.03). Eight of the 9 homozygous patients were under the median age. The sex ratio in the DR53 homozygous group was reversed in favour of females. The homozygosity rates for DR53 were different in the overall groups of patients and controls, yielding a relative risk (RR) of 2.4 (p = 0.03). This association was stronger in the early-onset group compared to age-matched controls (RR = 4.4; p = 0.008) and for females with an early onset compared to age- and sex-matched controls (RR = 17.9; p = 0.0008). The simultaneous occurrence of the alleles of the haplotype A2B62DR4 showed a strong association with CLL (RR = 4.1; p = 0.002). This was probably the reason behind the association with HLA-DRB1*0401 (RR = 2.4; p = 0.009). Compared to the accelerating effect of HLA-DR53, HLA-DR52 showed a significant delaying effect on the onset of CLL. These findings confirmed the influence of the HLA complex on the development of another leukaemia.","['Dorak, M T', 'Machulla, H K', 'Hentschel, M', 'Mills, K I', 'Langner, J', 'Burnett, A K']","['Dorak MT', 'Machulla HK', 'Hentschel M', 'Mills KI', 'Langner J', 'Burnett AK']","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*genetics/immunology', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/etiology/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1996/01/17 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/01/17 00:00'],"['1996/01/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/01/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960117)65:2<134::AID-IJC2>3.0.CO;2-# [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960117)65:2<134::AID-IJC2>3.0.CO;2-# [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1996 Jan 17;65(2):134-9. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960117)65:2<134::AID-IJC2>3.0.CO;2-#.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the 3' untranslated region of many RNA has been regarded as a key element for stabilization, we found that the first 300 bases of the IL-2R alpha protein coding sequence were necessary for stabilization of the mRNA.

Results showed physiological expression of CD40L on in vitro activated CD4+ cells, while this expression was absent on fresh and activated B cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: HC developed in 10 patients after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and was BK viruria-associated in all cases. All patients were treated with instillations of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) directly into the bladder. RESULTS: A complete resolution of hematuria within a short time (5 +/- 1 days) was observed in all cases; in 4/10 patients urine cleared within 24 hours of the initial treatment. Intravesical PGE2 therapy caused no systemic circulatory or respiratory problems, although bladder spasms occurred in all patients.

The age of APL cases is younger than that of other acute myeloid leukemias (AML). Spatial and temporal clusters of APL have been reported. These observations suggest a possible selective role for environmental and/or occupational factors in APL development. METHODS: A multicenter case-control study was carried out on risk factors for acute leukemias and preleukemias. In this report data related to APL are selectively analyzed from the larger study to identify specific risk factors. RESULTS: The case-control study on 38 cases of APL showed a strong association with shoemaking (odds ration 6.3, 95% confidence interval 1.3-31.1). A moderate leukemogenic effect from living in houses built with tuff, a polous building material containing gamma-emitting radionuclides and having a high radon concentration, and from using hair dyes was also suggested. CONCLUSIONS: These data, together with the reported spatial and temporal clustering of APL, support the hypothesis of specific environmental and/or occupational risk factors for APL among other AML subtypes and indicate the need for additional ad hoc multicenter studies.","['Mele, A', 'Stazi, M A', 'Pulsoni, A', 'Visani, G', 'Monarca, B', 'Castelli, G', 'Rocchi, L', 'Avvisati, G', 'Mandelli, F']","['Mele A', 'Stazi MA', 'Pulsoni A', 'Visani G', 'Monarca B', 'Castelli G', 'Rocchi L', 'Avvisati G', 'Mandelli F']","['Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Hair Dyes)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Benzene/adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Construction Materials', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Gamma Rays/adverse effects', 'Hair Dyes/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Preleukemia/epidemiology', 'Radon/adverse effects', 'Risk Factors']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1995 Sep-Oct;80(5):405-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate here that during adenovirus infection, immediate early viral proteins from the E1 and E4 transcription units associate with the POD, which in turn undergoes a dramatic morphological change. During this process, the auto-antigen Sp-100 and NDP55 but not PML, relocate from the POD to the viral inclusion bodies, the sites of adenovirus DNA replication and late RNA transcription. The E4-ORF3 11-kD protein alone will induce this reorganization and reciprocally, viruses carrying mutations in the E4-domain fail to do so. These same viral mutants are defective in viral replication as well as the accumulation of late viral mRNAs and host cell transcription shutoff. We show that interferon (INF) treatment enhances the expression of PML, reduces or blocks PODs reorganization, and inhibits BrdU incorporation into viral inclusion bodies. In addition, cell lines engineered to overexpress PML prevent PODs from viral-induced reorganization and block or severely delay adenovirus replication. These results suggest that viral replication relies on components of the POD and that the structure is a target of early viral proteins.","['Doucas, V', 'Ishov, A M', 'Romo, A', 'Juguilon, H', 'Weitzman, M D', 'Evans, R M', 'Maul, G G']","['Doucas V', 'Ishov AM', 'Romo A', 'Juguilon H', 'Weitzman MD', 'Evans RM', 'Maul GG']","['Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Adenovirus E1 Proteins)', '0 (Adenovirus E4 Proteins)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Adenovirus E1 Proteins/metabolism', 'Adenovirus E4 Proteins/metabolism', 'Adenoviruses, Human/*physiology', 'Animals', '*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Autoantigens/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/virology', 'DNA, Viral', 'Humans', 'Interferons/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', '*Virus Replication']",1996/01/15 00:00,1996/01/15 00:01,['1996/01/15 00:00'],"['1996/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1101/gad.10.2.196 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Dev. 1996 Jan 15;10(2):196-207. doi: 10.1101/gad.10.2.196.,['CA54418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

After isolation from human tonsils and expansion in vitro we analyzed the surface phenotype, extracellular matrix components, cytoskeletal products, cytokine production, binding and functional interaction with B lymphocytes of in vitro cultured stromal cells (HTSC) both in resting condition and after activation with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interferon (IFN)-gamma. Our results show that HTSC do not express specific myeloid, lymphoid, endothelial or epithelial markers. HTSC express CD54 (ICAM-1), CD49a (VLA-1), CD49b (VLA-2), CD49c (VLA-3), CD49e (VLA-5), CD49f (VLA-6), CD29, CD51, CD44 and produce vinculin, beta-tubulin, alpha-actin, vimentin, fibronectin, laminin and collagen types I, III and IV. Activation of HTSC up-regulated CD54 (ICAM-1) and induced HLA-DR and CD106 (VCAM-1). HTSC constitutively produce interleukin (IL)-6 which is enhanced upon activation with TNF-alpha. IL-8 and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor are detected only in the supernatants of activated HTSC. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that HTSC display mRNA for IL-1 alpha, leukemia inhibitory factor and IL-7. The adhesion of tonsillar B lymphocytes to activated HTSC is mediated by CD11a/CD18 and CD54. Furthermore, HTSC can induce maximal proliferation of IL-2-activated B lymphocytes cocultured in direct cell-cell contact with HTSC. These results clearly distinguish in vitro cultured HTSC from common fibroblasts and other non-lymphoid elements present in the lymphoid parenchyma, such as follicular dendritic cells, and show that HTSC actively participate in the lymphoid microenvironment. In vitro cultures of HTSC could therefore be a useful model system for detailed analysis of the interactions between stromal cells and lymphocytes under physiological and pathological conditions.","['Lisignoli, G', 'Monaco, M C', 'Facchini, A', 'Toneguzzi, S', 'Cattini, L', 'Hilbert, D M', 'Lavaroni, S', 'Belvedere, O', 'Degrassi, A']","['Lisignoli G', 'Monaco MC', 'Facchini A', 'Toneguzzi S', 'Cattini L', 'Hilbert DM', 'Lavaroni S', 'Belvedere O', 'Degrassi A']","['Laboratorio di Immunologia e Genetica, Istituto di Ricerca Codivilla Putti I.O.R., Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/analysis', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Palatine Tonsil/cytology/*immunology', 'Stromal Cells/*classification/cytology/*immunology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830260104 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1996 Jan;26(1):17-27. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830260104.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed four cases of IgM-IgD+ hairy cell leukemia (HCL) by Southern (DNA) blot analysis and identified two cases with a recombinatorial event within the C mu-C delta intron and deletion of C mu. DNA sequence analysis of junctional regions showed that S mu or the immediate upstream region was used as a donor site and that the C mu-C delta intronic sigma delta region was used as acceptor site. Using polymerase chain reaction, we subsequently analyzed whether similar S mu-sigma delta recombinations occur in normal tonsils containing IgM-IgD+ plasma cells. Multiple products with a size range of 200-800 base pairs were detected in all four individuals, suggesting clustering of acceptor sites within sigma delta. Sequence analysis of three cloned products showed S mu-sigma delta recombinations similar those observed in HCL.

Here, we report that the signaling activities of IL-6, IL-11, CNTF and OSM/LIF can be specifically blocked by different anti-gp130 monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Furthermore, we found two mAb, B-P8 and B-S12, which directly activate gp130 independently of the presence of cytokines or their receptors. This agonistic activity includes induction of cytokine-dependent cell proliferation and stimulation of acute-phase protein synthesis in liver cells. Compared to B-P8 mAb, the B-S12 mAb exhibited the strongest agonistic activity, while both mAb are synergistic in their action. This activity could not be blocked by inhibiting mAb against IL-6 and the IL-6 receptor. In contrast to F(ab')2 of B-S12 which still could activate gp130, Fab fragments completely lost their agonistic activity. Activation by tyrosine phosphorylation of the transcription factors Stat1 and APRF/Stat3 was also induced by B-S12 and B-P8, suggesting that both mAb induce homodimerization of gp130. Since hematopoietic stem cells express gp130 on their plasma membrane, it was anticipated that the agonistic anti-gp130 mAb could stimulate the proliferation of these stem cells. Indeed, B-S12 and B-P8 were able to stimulate CD34+ cells. In summary, our data show for the first time that mAb against gp130 can specifically block the action of distinct IL-6-type cytokines that signal through gp130. Such mAb might be of great value for therapeutic applications in diseases where a single cytokine action needs to be inhibited. In addition, the agonistic gp130 mAb may be used as growth factors for maintenance and expansion of stem cells prior to grafting.","['Wijdenes, J', 'Heinrich, P C', 'Muller-Newen, G', 'Roche, C', 'Gu, Z J', 'Clement, C', 'Klein, B']","['Wijdenes J', 'Heinrich PC', 'Muller-Newen G', 'Roche C', 'Gu ZJ', 'Clement C', 'Klein B']","['Diaclone, Besancon, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830251240 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1995 Dec;25(12):3474-81. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830251240.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An HTLV-I viral-lysate enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with a recombinant transmembrane envelope protein incorporated was used to screen serum samples. Reactive specimens were confirmed by Western blot strips spiked with recombinant proteins that differentiated HTLV-I from HTLV-II. Infection was then verified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Serum samples from 19 of the 756 subjects analyzed (2.5%) were reactive for HTLV by EIA. One of these was from an intravenous drug user (IVDU) in whom HTLV-II infection was confirmed by Western blot and PCR; a specimen from another IVDU showed Western blot reactivity for both retroviruses, but PCR results were negative. Lastly, Western blot confirmed the presence of HTLV in one of the immigrant subjects. Western blot did not verify HTLV infection in the remaining 16 cases, indicating a high rate of nonspecific anti-HTLV reactivity when a second-generation EIA screening test was applied. These results suggest that HTLV is present in Spain among populations at high risk for HTLV, although at a very low rate and restricted to intravenous drug users and individuals immigrating from endemic areas.","['Calderon, E J', 'Rey, C', 'Medrano, F J', 'Sanchez-Roman, J', 'Soriano, V', 'Torres, Y', 'Ruiz, M', 'Lissen, E', 'Leal, M']","['Calderon EJ', 'Rey C', 'Medrano FJ', 'Sanchez-Roman J', 'Soriano V', 'Torres Y', 'Ruiz M', 'Lissen E', 'Leal M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Viral Hepatitis and AIDS Study Group, Virgen del Rocio University Hospital, Sevilla, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,8804297,,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology/immunology', 'HTLV-II Infections/*epidemiology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Spain/epidemiology']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01690875 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 1995 Aug;14(8):686-90. doi: 10.1007/BF01690875.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Certain growth factors, such as stem cell factor and leukemia inhibitory factor, seem to be essential for survival, proliferation and possibly differentiation of mouse primordial germ cell in vivo and/or in vitro. Similarly, increase in intracellular cAMP is followed by a marked enhancement of primordial germ cell proliferation, at least in culture. In the present study, we show that pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptides (PACAP-27 and PACAP-38), two neuropeptides of the secretin-glucagon-vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-GH-releasing hormone family, stimulate in vitro proliferation of mouse primordial germ cells, bind to primordial germ cells and gonadal somatic cells (possibly to type I PACAP receptor) and activate adenylate cyclase in the same cells. Moreover, PACAP-like immunoreactivity was found in gonadal ridges, mostly on germ cell surface. In conclusion, evidence is provided that PGC proliferation can be stimulated by certain bioactive polypeptides, thus suggesting a novel regulatory role for such compounds in early gonad development.","['Pesce, M', 'Canipari, R', 'Ferri, G L', 'Siracusa, G', 'De Felici, M']","['Pesce M', 'Canipari R', 'Ferri GL', 'Siracusa G', 'De Felici M']","['Department of Public Health and Cell Biology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Adcyap1 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide)', '0 (Receptors, Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide, Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Pituitary Hormone)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)']",IM,"['Adenylyl Cyclases/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Germ Cells/cytology/*drug effects/*enzymology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neuropeptides/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide', 'Receptors, Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide, Type I', 'Receptors, Pituitary Hormone/genetics', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/*enzymology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Development. 1996 Jan;122(1):215-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we found that HIV-infected, but not uninfected, human T cell lines generated vigorous blastogenesis and proliferation of freshly isolated mouse B cells in a short-term culture. Neither human B cells nor rat B cells showed significant responses to the HIV-infected T cell lines in the present condition. The mitogenic effect of HIV-infected human T cell line requires direct cell-cell interaction between mouse B cells and HIV-infected T cell lines. Since either mitomycin c treatment or paraformaldehyde fixation of HIV-infected T cell lines resulted in complete loss of the mitogenic effect, it seems that de novo synthesized viral products are responsible for this effect. Furthermore, anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody inhibited completely the B cell stimulation by the HIV-infected human T cell lines. Thus, surface immunoglobulin (sIg) on mouse B cells appears to be an essential molecule which transduces activation signals from HIV-infected human T cells into cytoplasm of the B cells.","['Arase, N', 'Arase, H', 'Ohki, K', 'Nishino, Y', 'Ikuta, K', 'Onoe, K']","['Arase N', 'Arase H', 'Ohki K', 'Nishino Y', 'Ikuta K', 'Onoe K']","['Section of Pathology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*virology', 'Cell Communication/drug effects/immunology', 'HIV-1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', '*Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitosis/drug effects/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*virology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2249.1996.901593.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1996 Jan;103(1):24-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2249.1996.901593.x.,,,,,,PMC2200325,,,,,,,,

Although extensively studied in the hematopoietic system, its effects on solid tumors are generally unknown. In the present study we investigated the role of LIF in human breast cancer cells. Using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we found that the human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cell line expressed the message for both LIF receptor and its signal-transducing protein gp130, suggesting that these receptors might be biologically active. Binding studies with radiolabeled LIF demonstrated that MCF-7 cells interacted with this cytokine, and the ligand binding was specific and time, dose, and temperature dependent. In addition, a Scatchard analysis of the data revealed a single class of high-affinity (Kd 0.27 nM) receptors with a density of approximately 430 sites per cell. MCF-7 cells exposed to LIF internalized and degraded the ligand. LIF stimulated the growth of MCF-7 as well as other estrogen-dependent and independent breast cancer cell lines, but the effect on normal breast epithelial lines was less significant. Likewise, it stimulated colony formation by breast cancer cells obtained from five different breast cancer patients in a dose-dependent fashion.

In response to pathogenic agents, macrophages secrete inflammatory cytokines that can modulate viral replication and contribute to AIDS pathogenesis. Because HIV replication is dependent on cellular activation, immunosuppressive cytokines that deactivate macrophages and T cells may be important modulators of an antiviral effect. We tested the anti-HIV potential of the immunosuppressive cytokine-transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta 1) alone and in combination with AZT in a new monomyeloblastic model of HIV-1 infection. The PLB-985 cell model was infected with HIV IIIB strain, and the course of HIV-1 infection and replication was monitored by reverse transcriptase assay, p24 immunofluorescence, and northern blot analysis of HIV-1-specific mRNA. TGF-beta 1 as a single agent had no effect on the multiplication of HIV-IIIB in de novo-infected PLB 985 monomyeloblastic cells. However, cotreatment with TGF-beta 1 and AZT synergistically slowed virus multiplication within the first week following infection, as determined by reverse transcriptase measurement, p24 antigen detection, and northern blot analysis of viral RNA. The synergistic actions of TGF-beta 1 and AZT were also observed in PLB 985 cells infected with an AZT-resistant strain of HIV-1 (HIV 1393). Synergism between nucleoside analogs and cytokines may be an important therapeutic approach to HIV-1 infection.

Thus, SCF alone or in combination with some other factor stimulated the growth in 27 of 30 (90%) patients. Of 3 nonresponders, 2 were AML, M3 at presentation. G-CSF at the optimal concentration increased the sensitivity of blasts to SCF. Taken together, SCF acting in combination with other factors, but not alone, stimulates the growth of blast clonogenic cells. GM-CSF, IL-6, and TNF-alpha may be produced endogenously, whereas G-CSF and SCF may be supplied exogenously. Autocrine regulation of the growth of blasts seems to increase the responsiveness of the cells to any of these factors, allowing them to achieve a highly active growth state.","['Murohashi, I', 'Endoh, K', 'Feng, M', 'Yoshida, K', 'Hirota, H', 'Yoshida, S', 'Jinnai, I', 'Bessho, M', 'Hirashima, K']","['Murohashi I', 'Endoh K', 'Feng M', 'Yoshida K', 'Hirota H', 'Yoshida S', 'Jinnai I', 'Bessho M', 'Hirashima K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Saitama Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy/pathology', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jir.1995.15.829 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995 Oct;15(10):829-35. doi: 10.1089/jir.1995.15.829.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the promyelocytic-like human leukemia cell line HL-60 this protease is inhibited during retinoic acid (RA) induced differentiation. The t(15;17) translocation, specifically associated with the human acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), fuses the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) to a novel gene PML generating the hybrid protein PML-RAR. We have shown that while mbn was early down-regulated in HL60 cells treated with all trans RA, the inhibition of this gene was considerably delayed in NB4 cells, which carry the t(15;17) translocation, upon treatment with the same inducer. This observation suggested that the changes in the myeloblastin regulation by RA found in NB4 cells could be ascribed to the presence of the fusion protein PML-RAR. To verify this hypothesis we have cloned the putative promoter region of mbn gene. Transactivation properties of endogenous retinoic acid receptors on this region have been tested in transfection experiments of HL60 and NB4 cell lines before and after treatment with all trans RA. We found that RA induced a significant inhibition of the luciferase reporter gene in HL60 cells. In contrast, a strong stimulation of luciferase activity was observed in NB4 cells treated with RA. The analysis of the promoter region allowed us to identify a new response element for retinoic acid receptors, named mREpal, which is probably affected by the product of t(15;17) translocation.","['Ballerini, P', 'Besancon, F', 'Cayre, Y E']","['Ballerini P', 'Besancon F', 'Cayre YE']","['Unite INSERM 417, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,C R Seances Soc Biol Fil,Comptes rendus des seances de la Societe de biologie et de ses filiales,7505439,"['0 (Keratolytic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Keratolytic Agents', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Myeloblastin', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,C R Seances Soc Biol Fil. 1995;189(4):521-30.,,,,,Effets de la translocation t(15;17) sur la regulation de l'expression du gene myeloblastine--mbn--au cours de la differenciation myeloide induite par l'acide retinoique tout-trans des cellules leucemiques humaines.,,,,,,,,,

This syndrome is corrected by the addition of chemotherapy. A progressive acquired resistance appears during ATRA treatment and for this reason post remission chemotherapy is indispensable.

Moreover, to investigate the mechanism of the inhibitory action of PGs the involvement of either intracellular adenosine 3': 5'-cyclic monosphosphate (cyclic AMP) accumulation or intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was studied. 2 TEI-6122, a synthetic 7-thia-PGE1 derivative, inhibited chemotaxis of THP-1 cells induced by MCP-1 with an IC50 of 1.5 pM. Its inhibitory activity was 1000 fold more than that of PGE1 and PGE2 (IC50 = 2.8 nM and 0.9 nM, respectively), which were more potent than other PGs such as PGA1, PGA2, PGF2 alpha and PGI2 (IC50 > or = 1 microM). 3 With respect to the effect on intracellular cyclic AMP accumulation in THP-1 cells, TEI-6122 was as potent as PGE1 and PGE2, which were approximately 100 to 1000 fold more potent than the other PGs such as PGA1, PGA2 and PGI2. The minimum concentration of TEI-6122 required to increase intracellular cyclic AMP accumulation in THP-1 cells was 1 nM. 4 TEI-6122 and PGE1 (4 microM) transiently increased intracellular calcium levels in THP-1 cells. When added prior to MCP-1, both PGs partially suppressed the increased in Ca2+ caused by this cytokine. There were no significant differences between the activity of TEI-6122 and PGE1 in either respect. 5 It is concluded that TEI-6122, a synthetic 7-thia-PGE1 derivative is a much more potent inhibitor of MCP-1-induced THP-1 cell chemotaxis than PGEI and PGE2 which are the best inhibitors among the natural PGs tested, while neither intracellular cyclic AMP accumulation nor effects on Ca2+ mobilization account for the extremely potent inhibitory activity of TEI-6122. Thus, either a novel PGE2 receptor (EPreceptor) or a novel intracellular signal transduction system may be involved in the extremely potent chemotaxis inhibitory activity of TEI-6122.","['Tanaka, H', 'Minoshima, T', 'Endo, N']","['Tanaka H', 'Minoshima T', 'Endo N']","['Pharmaceutical Discovery Research Laboratories, Teijin Institute for Biomedical Research, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Fibrinolytic Agents)', '83058-69-9 (TFC 612)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Alprostadil/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Chemokine CCL2/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/*drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Fibrinolytic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1476-5381.1995.tb15068.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 1995 Oct;116(4):2298-302. doi: 10.1111/j.1476-5381.1995.tb15068.x.,,,,,,PMC1908987,,,,,,,,

One hundred cases of autopsy livers originating from patients with various diseases were examined. Increased S-100-immunoreactivity of Kupffer cells was observed in six cases.

However, the factors or cellular components involved in the development of edema in chronic inflammation remain to be clarified. Recently, the gene encoding vascular permeability factor (VPF) or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the genes encoding its receptors (kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR) and fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 [fit-1]) have been cloned. VPF/VEGF induces vascular hyperpermeability and vascular endothelial proliferation through KDR or fit-1 receptors. As there is a possibility that VPF/VEGF may play a role in the development of edema in chronic inflammation, we examined the messenger (m) RNA expression of VPF/VEGF and its receptors in nasal polyp tissues, which is an example of chronic inflammation with remarkable edema. Using northern blotting, all nasal polyp tissues examined expressed mRNA of VPF/VEGF and KDR. In situ hybridization revealed that VPF/VEGF mRNA-expressing cells were scattered in the edematous stroma of nasal polyps. In the adjacent sections, these cells showed the morphological features of plasma cells and expressed mRNA of immunoglobulin light chains. Human B cell leukemia and plasmacytoma cell lines expressed VPF/VEGF mRNA but human mast-cell leukemia and T cell leukemia cell lines did not. The alternatively spliced pattern of VPF/VEGF transcripts observed in nasal polyp tissues was consistent with that in plasmacytoma cell lines. Taken together, the VPF/VEGF mRNA-expressing cells in nasal polyps appeared to be plasma cells, suggesting that plasma cells may play an important role in the development of edema in chronic inflammation through the production of VPF/VEGF.","['Ito, A', 'Hirota, S', 'Mizuno, H', 'Kawasaki, Y', 'Takemura, T', 'Nishiura, T', 'Kanakura, Y', 'Katayama, Y', 'Nomura, S', 'Kitamura, Y']","['Ito A', 'Hirota S', 'Mizuno H', 'Kawasaki Y', 'Takemura T', 'Nishiura T', 'Kanakura Y', 'Katayama Y', 'Nomura S', 'Kitamura Y']","['Department of Pathology, Osaka University Medical School, Suita, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Chronic Disease', 'Edema/*etiology/genetics', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Inflammation/complications', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nasal Polyps/etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Plasma Cells/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1827.1995.tb03387.x [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Int. 1995 Oct;45(10):715-20. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.1995.tb03387.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A historical cohort mortality study was carried out on 21,744 workers who were employed in an electrical company in the province of Quebec between 1970 and 1988. The last job held by each study subject was coded. A job exposure matrix (JEM) was used to estimate the exposure to 60 Hz electric and magnetic fields, and pulsed electromagnetic fields (as recorded by the PEMF (POSITRON) meter) in this job. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated relative to Quebec men. Because the exposure was exclusively among blue collar workers, the remainder of the analyses by exposure were restricted to them. Rate ratios (RRs) in the exposed groups relative to the background groups were estimated with Poisson regression. There were 1582 deaths by the end of follow up. RESULTS: SMRs were almost all below one and never substantially increased, although there were a few increased rate ratios (RRs). There was a significant RR of 2.00 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.37-2.93) for deaths caused by accidents and violence in workers exposed to magnetic fields, RR of 1.82 (95% CI 1.25-2.65) for electric fields, and RR of 1.62 (95% CI 1.13-2.32) for pulsed electromagnetic fields. Occupational accidents related to power lines explain some of the excess of deaths from accidents and violence. Some association was found between magnetic fields and leukaemia, brain cancer, and suicide, between electric fields and brain cancer and suicide, and between pulsed electromagnetic fields and lung cancer, but these were not significant. CONCLUSION: These results are broadly reassuring that major causes of death are not strongly associated with exposure to electric and magnetic fields, but small numbers and approximate exposure assessments preclude the denial of any risk, in particular if it were to affect a rare cause of death.","['Baris, D', 'Armstrong, B G', 'Deadman, J', 'Theriault, G']","['Baris D', 'Armstrong BG', 'Deadman J', 'Theriault G']","['Department of Occupational Health, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,,IM,"['Accidents, Occupational/mortality', 'Adult', 'Cause of Death', 'Cohort Studies', '*Electricity', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Occupations', 'Quebec/epidemiology', 'Suicide', 'Violence']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.53.1.25 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 1996 Jan;53(1):25-31. doi: 10.1136/oem.53.1.25.,,,,,,PMC1128400,,,,,,,,

At the time the view was widely held that the controversy might have been avoided if the responsible health authority had consulted the public. The law report reveals, however, that the courts adopted a moral language widely at variance with that of the patient's doctor. The courts were concerned to support a utilitarian decision procedure based on calculations of the greatest overall good; the doctor was concerned with the best interests of a sick child. The doctor-patient relationship may be damaged when public consideration transforms the issue in this way. Also, the Appeal Court supported a decision which claimed to have ""weighed"" opposing evaluations, but it excused the health authority from describing how that weighing took place. One of the main criticisms of the utilitarian approach, however, is that weighing of this type is extremely difficult to justify. By its ruling the court has made legal challenge on the grounds of inadequate consultation virtually impossible to substantiate.","['Price, D']",['Price D'],"['Social Welfare Research Unit, University of Northumbria at Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,,IM,"['Child', 'Decision Making', 'Ethical Theory', 'Female', '*Health Care Rationing/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Humans', '*Judicial Role', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Patient Advocacy', 'Refusal to Treat/legislation & jurisprudence', '*Resource Allocation', 'Social Justice', 'Social Responsibility', 'Stress, Psychological', 'United Kingdom', 'Value of Life', '*Withholding Treatment']",1996/01/20 00:00,1996/01/20 00:01,['1996/01/20 00:00'],"['1996/01/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/20 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.312.7024.167 [doi]'],ppublish,BMJ. 1996 Jan 20;312(7024):167-9. doi: 10.1136/bmj.312.7024.167.,,,"['BMJ. 1996 May 11;312(7040):1229-30.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from two allergic and two normal human donors released similarly large quantities of IL-8 and lower amounts of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha. This also held for myelomonocytic cell lines, with THP-1 cells being most active, followed by U-937 and HL-60 cells. All potent glucocorticoids studied caused a dose-dependent inhibition of cytokine release from donor cells, being most marked for IL-1 beta and lowest for IL-8. Inhibition of cytokine release was also noted with U-937 cells, with clear differences in potency between the glucocorticoids, whereas release was enhanced in all experiments with THP-1 cells. These results were confirmed with Northern blot analysis. Modulating effects of glucocorticoids on cytokine release are thus complex, and are particularly dependent on the cell type studied.","['Welker, P', 'Lippert, U', 'Nurnberg, W', 'Kruger-Krasagakes, S', 'Moller, A', 'Czarnetzki, B M']","['Welker P', 'Lippert U', 'Nurnberg W', 'Kruger-Krasagakes S', 'Moller A', 'Czarnetzki BM']","['Department of Dermatology, Virchow Clinics of Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', 'ET54W9J4U2 (methylprednisolone aceponate)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Administration, Topical', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/blood/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Methylprednisolone/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000237208 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 1996 Feb;109(2):110-5. doi: 10.1159/000237208.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite its role in the etiology of APL, PML expression is not detectably altered during granulocytic differentiation in a murine in vitro system.

However, ectopic expression of a conditional GATA-2/estrogen receptor chimera was shown to inhibit erythroid differentiation in a hormone-dependent manner, suggesting the negative regulation of erythroid differentiation by GATA-2 protein. Accordingly, we reasoned that the quantitative balance of GATA-1 and GATA-2 protein might affect erythroid differentiation. In this report, we performed specific and quantitative measurements of GATA-1 and GATA-2 protein in a new erythroid cell line, SAM-1, after treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). On the basis of these measurements, we show that TPA-induced arrest of erythroid differentiation is coupled with the upregulation of GATA-2 protein, as well as the downregulation of GATA-1 protein.

In previous work, we have demonstrated that NO inhibits the growth and induces the monocytic differentiation of cells of the HL-60 cell line. We have also demonstrated that NO inhibits the growth of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia cells freshly isolated from untreated patients and increases monocytic differentiation antigens in some. In the present work, we studied the effect of NO on the growth and differentiation of normal human bone marrow cells in vitro. Mononuclear cells isolated from human bone marrow were cultured in semisolid media and treated with the NO-donating agents sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or S-nitroso-acetyl penicillamine (SNAP) (0.25 to 1 mmol/L). Both agents decreased colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) and colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) formation by 34% to 100%. When CD34+ cells were examined, we noted that these cells responded to SNP and SNAP differently than did the mononuclear cells. At a concentration range of 0.25 to 1 mmol/L, SNP inhibited the growth of CFU-E by 30% to 75%. However, at the same concentration range, SNP increased the number of CFU-GM by up to 94%. At concentrations of 0.25 to 1 mmol/L, SNAP inhibited the growth of CFU-E by 33% to 100%. At a concentration of 0.25 mmol/L, SNAP did not affect CFU-GM. At higher concentrations, SNAP inhibited the growth of CFU-GM. Although SNP increased intracellular levels of cGMP in bone marrow cells, increasing cGMP in cells by addition of 8-Br-cGMP (a membrane permeable cGMP analogue) did not reproduce the observed NO effects on bone marrow colonies. These results demonstrate that NO can influence the growth and differentiation of normal human bone marrow cells. NO (generated in the bone marrow microenvironment) may play an important role modulating the growth and differentiation of bone marrow cells in vivo.","['Shami, P J', 'Weinberg, J B']","['Shami PJ', 'Weinberg JB']","['Department of Medicine, University Medical Centers, Durham, NC 27705, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '169D1260KM (Nitroprusside)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '79032-48-7 (S-Nitroso-N-Acetylpenicillamine)', 'GNN1DV99GX (Penicillamine)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cyclic GMP/analysis', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects', 'Granulocytes', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/classification/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Macrophages', 'Nitric Oxide/*pharmacology', 'Nitroprusside/pharmacology', 'Penicillamine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'S-Nitroso-N-Acetylpenicillamine']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65347-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Feb 1;87(3):977-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about modulation of alpha IIb beta 3 in cell lines. In the present study, we show that agonist stimulation modulates alpha IIb beta 3-dependent adhesive properties of a human erythroleukemic (HEL) cell line. Brief treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) caused a significant increase in HEL cell adhesion to monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) specific for activated alpha IIb beta 3 (PAC1 or pl-55). This adhesion was inhibited by blocking MoAbs or peptides specific for alpha IIb beta 3, but not by anti-Fc gamma receptor-specific MoAb. Similarly, PMA enhanced HEL cell adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen by 10-fold. However, the activation-dependent ligands in solution (ie, PAC1, pl-55, or fibrinogen) did not inhibit the enhanced HEL cell adhesion to immobilized MoAbs PAC1 or pl-55 after PMA treatment. Thus, PMA may increase alpha IIb beta 3-dependent adhesion to immobilized activation-dependent antibodies and fibrinogen by increasing the local concentration of alpha IIb beta 3 to participate in low-affinity interactions, resulting in an increased avidity, changing the affinity state of alpha IIb beta 3, or both.","['Boudignon-Proudhon, C', 'Patel, P M', 'Parise, L V']","['Boudignon-Proudhon C', 'Patel PM', 'Parise LV']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 27599-7365, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Fibrinogen/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex/immunology/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65346-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Feb 1;87(3):968-76.,['1-P01-HL45100/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two alternatively spliced transcripts are expressed, which differ in 129 bases immediately upstream of the RARA sequence. The NPM sequences contained in the shorter NPM-RAR cDNA are identical to the NPM sequences contained in the NPM-ALK fusion gene expressed in t(2;5) lymphomas. The RARA sequences are the same as the RARA sequences found in the PML-RAR and PLZF-RAR fusion seen in t(15;17) and t(11;17) APL, respectively. Both NPM-RAR transcripts fuse NPM and RARA sequence in the same reading frame, to generate translation products of 57 kD and 62 kD. Both NPM-RAR proteins are expressed in the patient's leukemic cells, along with wild-type RARA derived from the uninvolved allele. In transcriptional assays using a retinoic acid response element reporter construct, both NPM-RAR fusion proteins act as retinoic acid-dependent transcriptional activators.

More is known regarding signal transduction events that occur after ligation of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR). It has been shown that TCR stimulation requires both the membrane tyrosine phosphatase, CD45, and the Src-family kinase, Lck, to result in cellular activation. Although prior studies suggest a role for protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases in Fas signaling, we report here that Fas ligation induces apoptosis in T cells deficient in either CD45 or Lck. Further, in normal and CD45- or Lck-deficient cell lines, Fas stimulation results in activation of Jun kinase (JNK), a proposed mediator of stress activation pathways. Previous studies have also demonstrated a role for endogenous ceramide release in Fas-mediated apoptosis. We show that stimulation with a synthetic ceramide analog results in JNK activation as well as apoptosis, suggesting ceramide release occurs proximal to JNK activation in Fas signaling. Our data suggest that although CD45 and Lck are not required for Fas signaling, JNK activation may play an important role transducing distal signals that lead to apoptosis after Fas ligation.","['Latinis, K M', 'Koretzky, G A']","['Latinis KM', 'Koretzky GA']","['Department of Immunology, University of Iowa, Iowa City 52242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (N-acetylsphingosine)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '506T60A25R (Sorbitol)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*physiology', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*physiology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Sorbitol/pharmacology', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*physiology', 'src-Family Kinases/deficiency/*physiology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65333-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Feb 1;87(3):871-5.,"['AG-00214/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-56843/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD34 overexpression in acute myelogenous leukemia M2 with t(8;21).,1162-9,"During the immunodiagnosis of 517 cases of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) entered into the Medical Research Council (MRC) AML 10 trials, we have observed the CD34 precursor cell antigen more frequently in AML of M2 morphology, especially in the 84% of cases with the t(8;21) chromosomal translocation, than in any other French-American-British classification group. CD34 expression was then quantified (using QIFI and Quantum Simply Cellular beads [Flow Cytometry Standards, Research Triangle Park, NC] and CD34+ standard cells). When CD34 antibody-binding capacity (ABC) of normal bone marrow (BM) precursors and leukemic blasts was compared, it was shown that AML M2 cases with t(8;21) not only had the highest percentages of CD34+ blasts, but in > 80% of CD34+ cases the individual blasts expressed higher than normal levels of CD34 antigen (> 60 x 10(3) ABC per cell). In addition, in 73% of this group CD34 antigen was overexpressed in an asynchronous combination with cytoplasmic myeloperoxidase (MPO). Other signs of asynchrony included high CD34 expression with CD15 and/or CD56, as well as aberrant combinations of CD13 with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and CD19. These findings demonstrate that asynchrony is identifiable in virtually every case of AML with t(8;21), although it does not always involve the same antigens. M2 cases with t(8;21), mostly CD34+, had a 100% remission rate and 71% 5-year survival rate; other patients with CD34+ or CD34- AML showed 69% and 84% remission rates and 31% and 36% 5-year survival rates, respectively. Consequently, individual markers such as CD34 should be interpreted in relation to other features such as chromosomal changes. These simple methods, which are well suited to quantify the expression of ligands, are a useful contribution to diagnosis: 60% to 65% of M2 cases with t(8;21) are rapidly identified by CD34 overexpression alone. This aberration, together with the other signs of asynchrony seen at presentation, can be used to search for residual leukemia after therapy.","['Porwit-MacDonald, A', 'Janossy, G', 'Ivory, K', 'Swirsky, D', 'Peters, R', 'Wheatley, K', 'Walker, H', 'Turker, A', 'Goldstone, A H', 'Burnett, A']","['Porwit-MacDonald A', 'Janossy G', 'Ivory K', 'Swirsky D', 'Peters R', 'Wheatley K', 'Walker H', 'Turker A', 'Goldstone AH', 'Burnett A']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*ultrastructure', 'Cohort Studies', '*Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/immunology/mortality', 'Life Tables', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Survival Analysis', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65370-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Feb 1;87(3):1162-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In one series of 330 patients, p53 mutations were seen in fewer than 3%. We analyzed bone marrow mononuclear cells derived from 10 children with ALL at diagnosis who subsequently failed to achieve a complete remission or who developed relapse within 6 months of attaining complete remission for p53 gene mutations and mdm-2 overexpression. We found that three children had p53 gene mutations, and four overexpressed mdm-2. Also, experiments comparing relative levels of mdm-2 RNA and protein in these patients demonstrated that mdm-2 overexpression can occur at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level in primary leukemic cells. Although we were unable to link Waf-1 RNA expression with p53 status in childhood ALL, our data show potential p53 inactivation by multiple mechanisms in a large percentage of these patients and demonstrate that these alterations can be detected at diagnosis. Inactivation of the p53 pathway may, therefore, be important in children with ALL who fail to respond to treatment and may be useful for the early identification of children requiring alternative therapies.","['Marks, D I', 'Kurz, B W', 'Link, M P', 'Ng, E', 'Shuster, J J', 'Lauer, S J', 'Brodsky, I', 'Haines, D S']","['Marks DI', 'Kurz BW', 'Link MP', 'Ng E', 'Shuster JJ', 'Lauer SJ', 'Brodsky I', 'Haines DS']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19102, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis/genetics']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65369-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Feb 1;87(3):1155-61.,['CA-29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among 52 children with newly diagnosed ALL, BCL-2 expression in leukemic lymphoblasts ranged widely, from 4,464 to 59,753 molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome per cell (MESF), as determined by flow cytometry. The mean (+/- SD) level of MESF in 43 cases of B-lineage ALL (19,410 +/- 11,834) was higher than that detected in CD10+ B-lymphoid progenitors from normal bone marrow (450 +/- 314; P < .001), and CD19+ peripheral blood B lymphocytes (7,617 +/- 1,731; P = .02). Levels of BCL-2 in T-ALL cases (17,909 +/- 18,691) were also generally higher than those found in normal CD1a+ thymocytes (1,762 +/- 670), or in peripheral blood T lymphocytes (9,687 +/- 3,019). Although higher levels of BCL-2 corresponded to higher leukemic cell recoveries after culture in serum-free medium, they did not correlate with higher cell recoveries after culture on stromal layers, or with in vitro resistance to vincristine, dexamethasone, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, teniposide, daunorubicin or methotrexate. BCL-2 protein levels did not correlate with presenting clinical features. Unexpectedly, however, lower-than-median MESF values were significantly associated with the presence of chromosomal translocations (P = .010). Notably, all six cases with the Philadelphia chromosome, a known high-risk feature, had low levels of BCL-2 expression (P = .022). Higher levels of BCL-2 were not associated with poorer responses to therapy among 33 uniformly treated patients, and were not observed in three patients studied at relapse. In conclusion, increased BCL-2 expression in childhood ALL appears to enhance the ability of lymphoblasts to survive without essential trophic factors, and is inversely related to the presence of chromosomal translocations. However, it does not reflect increased disease aggressiveness or resistance to chemotherapy.","['Coustan-Smith, E', 'Kitanaka, A', 'Pui, C H', 'McNinch, L', 'Evans, W E', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Behm, F G', 'Arico, M', 'Campana, D']","['Coustan-Smith E', 'Kitanaka A', 'Pui CH', 'McNinch L', 'Evans WE', 'Raimondi SC', 'Behm FG', 'Arico M', 'Campana D']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis TN 38101, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aneuploidy', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Connective Tissue Cells', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65367-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Feb 1;87(3):1140-6.,"['P01-CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA58297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Southern blot analysis disclosed MLL gene rearrangement in only the 9 cases with 7.1 reactivity plus the t(4;11)(q21;q23) or t(11;19)(q23;p13) translocation. MLL gene rearrangements were not detected in 89 patient leukemic samples that did not express NG2, including 7 patients with del(11)(q23) or inv(11)(p13q23).

Despite short follow-up duration, 3 of the NG2+ cases have relapsed while the other 101 patients remain in remission.

The resulting BCR-ABL fusion protein has been shown to mediate the unusual resistance of K562, and other BCR-ABL expressing lines, to apoptosis induced by a variety of agents (irradiation, UV light, cytotoxic drugs). Here we show that human NK and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, when tested at low effector to target ratio, can readily induce apoptotic death in K562 cells. This was accompanied with classical DNA oligonucleosomal fragmentation, an unexpected finding given the reported lack of such fragmentation when apoptosis is induced in K562 by chemical agents, after downregulation of BCR-ABL. Apoptosis was assessed by several means: morphological studies, 125I-DNA versus 51Cr release, DNA agarose gel electrophoresis, and results were always concordant, with a delayed kinetics for DNA oligonucleosomal fragmentation. Similar data were obtained with a pluripotent human hematopoietic cell line, UT-7, infected with a defective amphotropic p210 BCR-ABL retrovirus. The BCR-ABL expressing subclone UT-7/9, while being no longer sensitive to cytotoxic drugs or to tumor necrosis factor, a lytic mediator to which UT-7 cells are sensitive, underwent apoptotic death when exposed to LAK effector cells to the same degree as the parental UT-7 line. With these targets, DNA oligonucleosomal fragmentation occurred concomitantly with isotope release. Results obtained with several inhibitors of exocytosis strongly suggest that cytotoxic granules mediate NK and LAK cell-induced apoptotic death.

Because resistance to cyclophosphamide has been correlated with increased levels of expression of the aldehyde-dehydrogenase (ALDH1) gene in tumor cell lines in vitro, we tested whether ALDH1 overexpression could directly induce cyclophosphamide resistance. We have cloned a full-length human ALDH1 cDNA and used retroviral vectors to transduce it into human (U937) and murine (L1210) hematopoietic cell lines that were then tested for resistance to maphosphamide, an active analogue of cyclophosphamide. Overexpression of the ALDH1 gene resulted in a significant increases in cyclophosphamide resistance in transduced L1210 and U937 cells (50% inhibition concentration [IC50], approximately 13 mumol/L). The resistant phenotype was specifically caused by ALDH1 overexpression as shown by its reversion by disulfiram, a specific ALDH1 inhibitor. ALDH1 transduction into peripheral blood human hematopoietic progenitor cells also led to significant increases (4- to 10-fold; IC50, approximately 3 to 4 mumol/L) in cyclophosphamide resistance in an in vitro colony-forming assay. These findings indicate that ALDH1 overexpression is sufficient to induce cyclophosphamide resistance in vitro and provide a basis for testing the efficacy of ALDH1 gene transduction to protect bone marrow cells from high-dose cyclophosphamide in vivo.","['Magni, M', 'Shammah, S', 'Schiro, R', 'Mellado, W', 'Dalla-Favera, R', 'Gianni, A M']","['Magni M', 'Shammah S', 'Schiro R', 'Mellado W', 'Dalla-Favera R', 'Gianni AM']","['Department of Pathology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (maphosphamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)', 'TR3MLJ1UAI (Disulfiram)']",IM,"['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Disulfiram/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65362-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Feb 1;87(3):1097-103.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have evaluated the expression of FLT3 by RNase protection assay and Western blotting in 161 primary bone marrow (BM) samples from patients with leukemia. FLT3 RNA was found to be expressed at a higher level than in normal BM controls in 33 of 33 B-lineage acute leukemias, 11 of 12 acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), and 3 of 11 T-cell acute leukemias (T-ALLs). Expression of FLT3 RNA was also observed in some cases of blast crisis CML. The FLT3 signal resulted from expression on the leukemic blasts, and was not caused by increased FLT3 expression on normal CD34+ stem/progenitor cells in the leukemic samples. To determine if FLT3 protein was also overexpressed, proteins were extracted from leukemic BM samples and screened by Western blotting with anti-FLT3 antisera. FLT3 protein was not detected in normal BM controls, but was found in 14 of 14 B-lineage ALLs, 36 of 41 AMLs, and 1 of 4 T-ALLs. Stimulation of patient samples with FLT3 ligand resulted in autophosphorylation of the FLT3 receptor, suggesting the receptor is functional in these cells. These data show that FLT3 RNA and protein are aberrantly expressed by AML and ALL cells in that CD34 expression and FLT3 expression are no longer synchronous, and suggest the possibility that overexpression of FLT3 could play a role in the survival and/or proliferation of malignant clones in acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemias.","['Carow, C E', 'Levenstein, M', 'Kaufmann, S H', 'Chen, J', 'Amin, S', 'Rockwell, P', 'Witte, L', 'Borowitz, M J', 'Civin, C I', 'Small, D']","['Carow CE', 'Levenstein M', 'Kaufmann SH', 'Chen J', 'Amin S', 'Rockwell P', 'Witte L', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Civin CI', 'Small D']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287-5001, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Enzyme Induction', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/pharmacology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65361-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Feb 1;87(3):1089-96.,"['CA 50435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 50383/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A third type of BCR/ABL (with e1a2 type of junction) has been identified in approximately 50% of the Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL) cases and results in the production of a BCR/ABL protein of 190 kD (P190). The presence of this transcript has been associated almost exclusively with the presence of an acute leukemia phenotype. By contrast, here we describe that in addition to transcripts with the b2a2 and b3a2 types of junction corresponding to the P210 proteins, virtually all CMLs at diagnosis bear also BCR/ABL transcripts showing the e1a2 type of junction, which correspond to the acute leukemia-associated P190 protein. With a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay we found that the amount of the e1a2 mRNA present in CMLs in chronic phase, although in absolute amount much lower than that present in Ph+ ALLs, represents in most cases approximately 20% to 30% of the total BCR/ABL transcripts.

Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays a role in hematopoiesis and apoptosis. Elevated bFGF levels have been detected in urine from patients with a variety of neoplastic diseases including various leukemias; however, the cellular source of the bFGF has not been determined. In this study, the intracellular bFGF level in lymphocytes of 36 patients with B-CLL and 15 normal donors was determined using an enzyme-linked immunoassay. In cells derived from patients with high-risk disease, the median level of intracellular bFGF was 381.5 pg/2 x 10(5) cells, compared with a median of 90.5 pg/2 x 10(5) cells in patients with intermediate disease. In patients with low-risk disease, the median bFGF level was 4.9 pg/2 x 10(5) cells, and in normal controls, it was 6.0 pg/2 x 10(5) cells. The difference in the bFGF levels was significant for the comparison between low- and intermediate-risk (P = .00119), low- and high-risk (P < .0001), and intermediate- and high-risk disease (P = .0001). Immunofluorescent stains of peripheral blood mononuclear cells confirmed CLL lymphocytes as a cellular source of bFGF. To evaluate the potential contribution of elevated intracellular bFGF levels to the phenotype of CLL cells, leukemic cells were cultured in vitro with an apoptotic stimulus (fludarabine). CLL cells with high intracellular levels of bFGF appeared to be more resistant to fludarabine treatment. The addition of bFGF to fludarabine-treated CLL cells resulted in a delay of apoptosis and prolonged survival. These data suggest that bFGF may contribute to the resistance of CLL cells to an apoptotic stimulus.","['Menzel, T', 'Rahman, Z', 'Calleja, E', 'White, K', 'Wilson, E L', 'Wieder, R', 'Gabrilove, J']","['Menzel T', 'Rahman Z', 'Calleja E', 'White K', 'Wilson EL', 'Wieder R', 'Gabrilove J']","['Molecular Therapeutics Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*analysis/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65357-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Feb 1;87(3):1056-63.,['DK 48728/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first 450 basepairs of the Btk promoter fused to a luciferase gene displayed a similar cell-type specificity. Critical binding sites for the transcription factors PU.1 and Sp1 were identified in the proximal portion of the Btk promoter upstream of a cluster of transcriptional start sites. Mutation of either the PU.1 or Sp1 site markedly reduced the activity of a Btk promoter-luciferase reporter construct in transfection experiments. In addition, PU.1 directly transactivated the Btk promoter, and deletion of the PU.1 binding site abolished this effect.

Previous studies have shown that these sequences are not necessary for the expression of viral proteins or for the induction, transmission, or maintenance of the transformed cell type in vitro. To determine the effect of the UT region in vivo, separate groups of rabbits were inoculated with lethally irradiated, stable clones of the human B-lymphoblastoid cell line, 729, transfected with either a full-length wild-type HTLV-II clone (pH6neo) or a mutant clone containing a 324-bp deletion in the proximal UT portion of pX (pH6neo delta UT[6661-6984]), or nontransfected 729 cells.

Antibody titers, as determined by enzyme immunoassay, were similar between the two groups of rabbits and increased over the 18-week period of study. All rabbits were killed at 18 weeks PI, and spleen, peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBMC), bone marrow, and mesenteric lymph node were assayed for HTLV-II tax/rex sequences by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Virus was detected in all tissues tested from all rabbits inoculated with 729pH6neo cells containing wild-type HTLV-II, which contained between 1.4 and 0.3 mean copies of provirus per cell. In contrast, the distribution and number of provirus copies were more limited in rabbits inoculated with 729pH6neo delta UT(6661-6984) cells containing UT-deleted HTLV-II; in most tissues, there was a fivefold to sevenfold reduction in mean provirus copies per cell as compared with rabbits inoculated with wild-type HTLV-II.

B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is characterized by the accumulation of slow-dividing and long-lived monoclonal B cells, arrested at the intermediate stage of their differentiation. In vitro, B-CLL cells exhibit a spontaneous apoptosis regulated by different cytokines. In this report, we show that IL-13 (10 to 200 ng/mL) acts directly on monoclonal B-CLL cells from 12 patients. (1) IL-13 enhances CD23 expression and induces soluble CD23 secretion by B-CLL cells but does not exhibit a growth factor activity. (2) IL-13 inhibits IL-2 responsiveness of B-CLL cells, activated either with IL-2 alone or through crosslinking of lgs or ligation of CD40 antigen. (3) IL-13 protects B-CLL cells from in vitro spontaneous apoptosis. The effects of IL-13 on neoplasic B cells were slightly less than those of IL-4 and occurred independently of the presence of IL-4.

The prognosis is grave for patients with endocarditis and for patients with immunoglobulin deficiency or neutropenia not related to a hematologic malignancy. In addition, mortality is substantial among bacteremic patients with respiratory conditions or other chronic debilities, especially when respiratory copathogens are present. The prognosis is good for febrile neutropenic patients with underlying leukemia or lymphoma when the neutropenia resolves.

To better understand the role of TGF-beta in T cell development, we determined whether TGF-beta is present in the human thymus, and identified stromal cells that express TGF-beta receptors and respond to TGF-beta. We demonstrate that primary cultured human thymic epithelial cells (TEC) express TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta 2 and TGF-beta 3, as well as TGF-beta type I receptor (T beta RI) (ALK-5) and TGF-beta type II receptor (T beta RII) transcripts.

We also detect TGF-beta 3 and T beta RII protein in association with keratin-positive TEC in vitro and in vivo. TEC culture supernatants contain TGF-beta 3 as detected by Western blots and, upon heat and acid activation, display growth inhibitory activity on the CCL-64 cells that is neutralized by anti-TGF-beta mAb treatment. We further demonstrate that TGF-beta 1 increases leukemia inhibitory factor transcript levels in TEC, indicating that TEC express functional TGF-beta receptors. Thus, we have shown in the human thymus that TEC produce TGF-beta 3 and express T beta RI and T beta RII.

N-myc is expressed at the pre-B cell stage of B cell differentiation and is dramatically induced by the pre-B cell growth factor, IL-7. To test the idea that N-myc plays an important role in lymphocyte development, we assayed the effect of a null N-myc mutation on the differentiation of B and T lineage cells. Homozygous, mutant embryonic stem (ES) cells were injected into blastocysts derived from recombination activating gene (RAG-2)-deficient mice. Since RAG-2 mutant mice fail to develop mature lymphocytes, later-stage lymphocytes that are present in chimeric mice are ES cell derived.

Most methods used to synchronize transformed cells induce growth imbalance. The aim of the present study was to analyze levels of cyclins B1, A, E, and D3 in the respective phases of the cycle in synchronized human leukemic MOLT-4 cells, correlate them with total cellular protein content (reflecting growth imbalance), and compare the synchronized cells with cells from unperturbed, asynchronous cultures. Expression of cyclins detected immunocytochemically in individual permeabilized cells was analyzed by multiparameter flow cytometry, which made it possible to relate position of the cell in the cell cycle with cyclin expression. Cells synchronized at the G1-S boundary by thymidine, mimosine, or aphidicolin had about 40% increased total protein and 4-5 fold higher levels of cyclins E and B1 compared to their G1 counterparts from unperturbed cultures. Expression of cyclin A in synchronized cells was 2-fold higher, while expression of cyclin D3 was essentially unaltered. The synchronized cells traversing S phase after release from the block had elevated but decreasing levels of cyclins E, B1, and A. Although the cyclin expression of cells reentering G1 was similar to that of their counterparts from asynchronous cultures, the total protein content was still elevated by about 30%. The data indicate that due to different degrees of imbalance in total protein and individual cyclin content, levels of cyclins detected by immunoblotting of cell lysates from synchronized cultures may not be representative of their expression in unperturbed cells. The elevated level of cyclin B1 in the cells arrested at the G1-S boundary may reflect the increased half-life of this protein, stabilized as the result of the overexpression of cyclin E.","['Gong, J', 'Traganos, F', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Gong J', 'Traganos F', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/*genetics', 'Cell Division/physiology', '*Cyclin B', 'Cyclin B1', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclins/*genetics', 'DNA/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'DNA Replication/*physiology', 'G1 Phase/physiology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia', 'Mitosis/physiology', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'S Phase/physiology', 'Thymidine/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1995 Nov;6(11):1485-93.,['CA 28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 10 cases of CLL examined 0-61% (mean 14.7%) of the cells were viable after 10 d culture in medium alone, whereas in the presence of BM stromal cells 10-102% (mean 47.0%) of cells were recovered alive (P < 0.005) in 7/10 cases of CLL, cells remained viable after 30 d of culture in BM stromal cells with cell recovery of 12-65%. These long-term cultured CLL cells were Epstein Barr virus negative, shown by the failure to detect the ENBA-2 and BZLF1 genes of EBV by PCR analysis. Identity between day 0 and day 30 CLL cells was demonstrated by sequence analysis of their clonal IgH CDR3 region. Adherence of CLL cells to BM stromal cell layers was critical for their protection from apoptosis. Separation of CLL cells from stroma by 0.45 micron culture filters resulted in loss of the protective effect of the stromal cells. Stromal cells were also able to protect CLL cells from hydrocortisone-induced apoptotic cell death.

To investigate the clinical significance of Pgp expression for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) diagnosis and monitoring we have studied 38 CML patients in various phases of the disease (chronic phase, CP; accelerated phase, AP; blast crisis, BC). Anti-Pgp monoclonal antibody UIC2 and FACScan analysis were used. Pgp functional activity was investigated by evaluation of verapamil influence upon rhodamine 123 efflux from the cells. Correlations between Pgp and CD34 expression were investigated. In CP, Pgp-expressing cells were found in 2/14 patients; in one of them Pgp proved to be non-functional. There were few Pgp-expressing cells in AP cases. The group of BC patients consisted of cases resistant to chemotherapy. This gave us the opportunity to consider whether drug resistance of BC CML patients is preferentially connected with Pgp-mediated MDR. 11/22 BC patients had 20% or more of Pgp-expressing blasts in the peripheral blood. In all four Pgp+ BC cases studied for Pgp activity this protein was functional. Only 4/22 BC patients demonstrated large (40% or more) fractions of Pgp+ blasts. Moreover, sequential studies of 11 BC CML patients during treatment revealed an increase in the number of Pgp-expressing cells in only two cases. This suggests that Pgp+ cells did not often accumulate in BC CML patients due to chemotherapy and are the cause of drug resistance in only a few cases. A positive correlation between Pgp and CD34 expression was found (r = 0.69; P = 0.0004). 3/22 BC CML patients had large fractions of both Pgp+ and CD34+ blasts in their peripheral blood. The BC CML patients with this immunophenotype of blast cells may represent a subtype of BC CML resistant to treatment due to Pgp overexpression.","['Turkina, A G', 'Baryshnikov, A Y', 'Sedyakhina, N P', 'Folomeshkina, S V', 'Sokolova, M A', 'Choroshco, N D', 'Stavrovskaya, A A']","['Turkina AG', 'Baryshnikov AY', 'Sedyakhina NP', 'Folomeshkina SV', 'Sokolova MA', 'Choroshco ND', 'Stavrovskaya AA']","['Cancer Research Centre of Academy of Medical Sciences, Moscow, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*blood', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/*blood', 'Blast Crisis/blood', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.273807.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Jan;92(1):88-96. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.273807.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow fibroblasts (BMF) were grown on polycarbonate microporous membranes, and acute leukaemia cells added to cultures and allowed to adhere to BMF for variable periods of time before fixation. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) blasts showed rapid development of surface membrane microvilli on contact with BMF layers. ALL blasts, and the pre-B ALL cell line NALM-6, showed evidence of movement in to the BMF layer within 15-30 min, with intrusion of extended cytoplasic processes into gaps between BMF cytoplasm. ALL cells were frequently seen within the layers of fibroblasts after 30 min incubation, and had pronounced morphological changes, with pseudopodia and attenuated and elongated microvilli interdigitating with the surface of fibroblasts or with strands of extracellular matrix material. Changes were also noted in the surface membrane of BMF adjacent to ALL cells, with invagination of the cytoplasmic membrane and formation of micropits. In contrast to the migratory behaviour of pre-B ALL cells, migration was not observed with acute myeloid leukaemia cells or other leukaemic cell lines. These cells showed membrane activation, with variable degrees of microvillous formation, and in some cases insertion of pseudopodia into BMF layers, but migration was not observed. Ultrastructural immunogold labelling was carried out to determine the localization of leukaemic adhesion molecules and their ligands on BMF. This demonstrated that beta 1 integrins were largely localized to the contact surfaces of both ALL blasts and fibroblasts, with VCAM-1 expressed only on the surface of BMF. These observations confirm the specificity of migratory behaviour for pre-B leukaemic cells, and indicate that a complex pattern of surface and intracellular events mediate this process, including the expression of beta 1 integrins and VCAM-1 at the sites of insertion of leukaemic cells between fibroblast margins.","['Hewson, J', 'Bianchi, A', 'Bradstock, K', 'Makrynikola, V', 'Gottlieb, D']","['Hewson J', 'Bianchi A', 'Bradstock K', 'Makrynikola V', 'Gottlieb D']","['Department of Haematology, Concord, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow/*ultrastructure', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Movement', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1/analysis', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Stromal Cells/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/analysis']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.00291.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Jan;92(1):77-87. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.00291.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the four children transplanted using an HLA-identical sibling, conditioning regimen included busulfan (BU), cyclophosphamide (CY) and melphalan (L-PAM), whereas graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine-A (Cs-A). The preparative regimen was well tolerated and all patients engrafted promptly. None of the patients have relapsed and all four children remain in haematological remission after an observation time of 7, 24, 25 and 48 months, respectively. Of the three children given BMT from an unrelated volunteer, one was < 2 years of age and she received the BU/CY/L-PAM regimen. In view of the increased risk of graft rejection described in patients transplanted from unrelated donors, we chose to prepare the other two patients with fractionated total body irradiation (TBI), thiotepa and CY. Cs-A, short-term methotrexate and Campath-1G in vivo were employed to prevent GVHD in this group of patients. Graft failure with autologous reconstitution of haemopoiesis occurred in the child given the chemotherapy-based regimen. One of the two girls given TBI relapsed after BMT; therefore only one of the three patients who received a marrow transplant from a matched unrelated donor survives in complete haematological remission 10 months after BMT. Our study suggests that the conditioning regimen we employed for allogeneic BMT from a compatible sibling is an effective means of eradicating the leukaemic clone.

Differences between countries may be due to the availability of beds and resources or to divergent opinions about treatments. We used the coefficient of variation (CV) to assess the degree of agreement between clinicians with regard to different procedures and indications, with a cut-off of < or = 45% to indicate consensus. The rate of allogeneic transplantation between the 12 countries was more 'homogenous' than that of autologous transplantation (mean 6.8 per million inhabitants, range 5.2-9.5, CV 20% versus mean 9.8 per million inhabitants, range 3.6-18.4, CV 40%).

Recently, two distinct TNF receptors (TNF-Rs), TNF-Rp55 and TNF-Rp75, have been identified. In this study we show that both receptors are expressed on freshly isolated AML blasts, with p75 being the predominant TNF-receptor type. This study investigates the roles of these two receptors in TNF-alpha-driven growth regulation of AML blasts in vitro. Using a receptor-specific antibody, it is shown that both receptor types participate in TNF-alpha-mediated stimulation of GM-CSF/IL-3-induced proliferation and in TNF-alpha-induced autocrine growth. In contrast, the TNF-alpha-triggered growth inhibition (antiproliferation) and the potent suppression of G-CSF- and SCF-induced proliferation exclusively result from activation of TNF-Rp55. Taken together, these results suggest that the proliferative effects of TNF-alpha on AML blasts are mediated through both p55 and p75 TNF receptors, whereas the TNF-alpha-signalled growth inhibition is exclusively transduced via TNF-Rp55.","['Carter, A', 'Haddad, N', 'Draxler, I', 'Israeli, E', 'Raz, B', 'Rowe, J M']","['Carter A', 'Haddad N', 'Draxler I', 'Israeli E', 'Raz B', 'Rowe JM']","['Department of Haematology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II', 'Stem Cell Factor/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.272806.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Jan;92(1):116-26. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.272806.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to exploit the diversity of the complementarity determining region (CDR) and immunoglobulin variable heavy chain (VH) family specific usage has greatly improved the sensitivity up to one leukaemic cell in 10(5)-10(6) normal bone marrow cells. Here we report on a prospective study of 14 patients with ALL of B-cell lineage by using a combined PCR approach which estimates levels of disease between 1:10(3) and 1:10(5). The sequential use of allele-specific oligoprimer (ASO) independent tests (using framework 1. FR1 and 3, FR3 primers with a JH consensus primer, sensitivity up to 1:5 x 10(3)) and ASO-dependent PCR (sensitivity up to 1:10(5)) assays were applied to 64 bone marrow (BM) follow-up samples in a sequential array of tests. Results presented in this study indicate high concordance of MRD among different tests for samples with level of residual disease > 1:5 x 10(3). Consequently, samples positive by the FR1 and FR3 fingerprinting tests were confirmed by the more sensitive ASO-dependent tests, as expected. However, the ASO-dependent assays revealed levels of disease undetected by the FR1 and FR3 test. Although a higher level of sensitivity is provided by the ASO-dependent tests, the FR1 and FR3 fingerprinting tests allow MRD investigation in patients with oligoclonal B cell proliferations, CDR3 region of size < 15 bp or with ASO primers unsuitable for PCR investigation on technical grounds (i.e. background signal). If a sequential order of investigation from less (e.g. FR1 and FR3 fingerprinting) to more sensitive tests (ASO-dependent) is applied, an indirect estimate of MRD is obtained for patients with level of disease < 1:10(3).","['Chim, J C', 'Coyle, L A', 'Yaxley, J C', 'Cole-Sinclair, M F', 'Cannell, P K', 'Hoffbrand, V A', 'Foroni, L']","['Chim JC', 'Coyle LA', 'Yaxley JC', 'Cole-Sinclair MF', 'Cannell PK', 'Hoffbrand VA', 'Foroni L']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital and School of Medicine, London.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Fingerprinting/*methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*drug therapy', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.289831.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Jan;92(1):104-15. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.289831.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine the role of protein phosphorylation in signal transduction of TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis, a variant cell line resistant to TNF-alpha was established by an intermittent challenge of Kasumi-1 cells with increasing concentrations of TNF-alpha for 6 months. The mechanism of resistance to TNF-alpha appears to be in the post-receptor pathway because expression of p55 TNF receptor in the variant cells is increased compared with that of the parental Kasumi-1 cells. In renaturation assays, TNF-alpha induced a rapid activation of different protein kinases of different molecular weights, including the 50 kDa protein kinase (PK50) followed by the 35 kDa protein kinase (PK35), in the parental Kasumi-1 cells. The dose-response of TNF-alpha required to activate PK50 and PK35 was closely related to concentrations of TNF-alpha that induced apoptosis. Treatment of Kasumi-1 cells with ceramide also activated PK35. In TNF-resistant variant cells, activation of PK35 in response to TNF-alpha or ceramide was practically nil. These findings suggest that activation of PK35 through the ceramide pathway may play an important role in signal transduction of TNF-alpha in the Kasumi-1 cell line, while the decreased activation of PK35 may explain the insensitivity of the variant cells towards TNF-alpha.","['Ido, M', 'Hayashi, K', 'Kato, S', 'Ogawa, H', 'Komada, Y', 'Zhau, Y W', 'Zhang, X L', 'Sakurai, M', 'Suzuki, K']","['Ido M', 'Hayashi K', 'Kato S', 'Ogawa H', 'Komada Y', 'Zhau YW', 'Zhang XL', 'Sakurai M', 'Suzuki K']","['Department of Molecular Pathobiology, Mie University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1996.61 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1996 Feb;73(3):360-5. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1996.61.,,,,,,PMC2074439,,,,,,,,

These findings indicate that mutations in this region do not represent a general phenomena in Ig/MYC translocation-carrying tumours, but may confer growth advantage on BL cells under continuous in vitro propagation.","['Axelson, H', 'Henriksson, M', 'Wang, Y', 'Magnusson, K P', 'Klein, G']","['Axelson H', 'Henriksson M', 'Wang Y', 'Magnusson KP', 'Klein G']","['Microbiology and Tumorbiology Centre, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Genes, myc/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmacytoma/*genetics', 'Point Mutation/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rats', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0959-8049(95)00449-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0959-8049(95)00449-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1995 Nov;31A(12):2099-104. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(95)00449-1.,['5RO1 CA 14054-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The physiological actions of the insulin family of growth factors are mediated by interactions with specific cell surface receptors that are detectable on the cells of preimplantation mouse embryos. Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells are totipotent cells derived directly from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst. ES cells have the ability to differentiate into all three germ layers and have unlimited growth potential under certain culture conditions. The great advantage of ES cells is the ability to obtain large amounts of tissue for biochemical studies as compared with preimplantation embryos. To examine in greater detail the biological actions of the insulin family of growth factors, the expression of their cognate receptors on ES cells was examined. ES cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to maintain the undifferentiated state. Receptor expression was evaluated at the mRNA level using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and at the protein level by radioactive labeled ligand-receptor binding assay. Using RT-PCR, mRNAs of all three growth factor receptors were detected in ES cells. Messenger RNA from ES cells was reverse transcribed into cDNA by AMV reverse transcriptase at 42 degrees C for 1 hr. The reverse transcription reaction was amplified with Taq polymerase and specific primers for insulin, IGF-I, or IGF-II receptors by PCR. RT-PCR and the control plasmid cDNA PCR products were resolved electrophoretically on 3% agarose gels. Each amplified PCR product showed the predicted correct size.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Shi, C Z', 'Dhir, R N', 'Kesavan, P', 'Zhang, S L', 'Matschinsky, F M', 'Heyner, S']","['Shi CZ', 'Dhir RN', 'Kesavan P', 'Zhang SL', 'Matschinsky FM', 'Heyner S']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, Philadelphia 19104-6080, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Reprod Dev,Molecular reproduction and development,8903333,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, IGF Type 2)', '0 (Receptors, Somatomedin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Insulin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, IGF Type 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Insulin/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Somatomedin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mrd.1080420206 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Reprod Dev. 1995 Oct;42(2):173-9. doi: 10.1002/mrd.1080420206.,"['DK22122/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK28143/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HD 23511/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The investigation was carried out on Romanowsky-Giemsa stained bone marrow (n = 15) and blood smears (n = 10) from 25 patients with primary acute leukemia. The cases had been classified as of myeloid or lymphoid origin by three hematologic centers using immunochemistry or cytochemistry, but the specimens were submitted to the authors' laboratory without the diagnosis. The nuclear and cytoplasmic pattern of the blast cells were analyzed by a high resolution image analysis system and the measured and calculated cell features were sorted by means of a classifier program (CART). The image analysis classification was then compared with the immunophenotypical and cytochemical classification. Blood blast cells showed nuclear features that were significantly correlated to a myeloid or lymphoid immunophenotype. In contrast, bone marrow blast cells displayed overlapping and therefore nondiscriminating nuclear features. However, by generating a learning data set using the immunophenotypes the classifier program found specific cytoplasmic features that eventually permitted a differentiation into myeloid or lymphoid subtypes. In summary, the authors suggest that high resolution image analysis of leukemic blast cells detect nuclear and cytoplasmic features that are associated with the immunophenotype and therefore with the lineage determination of the cell. With this new objective and reproducible approach of morphologic cell analysis, it might not only be possible to classify blast cells with minimal cellular differentiation, but furthermore to discover prognostic features because the remarkable difference in classification quality between blood and bone marrow blast cells reported in this study, might be of biologic relevance and requires further investigation.","['Baumann, I', 'Nenninger, R', 'Harms, H', 'Zwierzina, H', 'Wilms, K', 'Feller, A C', 'Ter Meulen, V', 'Muller-Hermelink, H K']","['Baumann I', 'Nenninger R', 'Harms H', 'Zwierzina H', 'Wilms K', 'Feller AC', 'Ter Meulen V', 'Muller-Hermelink HK']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,['EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'Child', 'Cytoplasm/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*classification/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*classification/pathology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/105.1.23 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1996 Jan;105(1):23-30. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/105.1.23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies on thymocytes obtained from ts1-infected mice indicated that the ts1-induced depletion of thymocytes is mediated through activation-induced death by apoptosis. To further investigate the interaction between ts1 and thymocytes, we have established long-term primary murine thymocyte cultures by placing the thymocytes together with thymic remnants in culture medium containing IL-2 and IL-7. These thymocytes retained their immature phenotype and we susceptible to infection by ts1 and its parental wild-type MoMuLV. ts1-infected thymocytes proliferated initially at accelerated rate but subsequently produced more infectious virus and died much faster than control or MoMuLV-infected thymocytes.

To further dissect the XbaI-BamHI region for its effects on BCEC tropism, we constructed recombinant viruses between PVC-211 MuLV and F-MuLV and tested their infectivity on a cell line established from rat BCEC. Our results indicated that Glu116-to-Gly and Glu129-to-Lys substitutions in the background of the F-MuLV envelope SU protein were sufficient for conferring BCEC tropism on the virus. Interference studies of these viruses on Rat-1 fibroblastic cells showed that the structure of the SU protein encoded by the XbaI-BamHI region also has significant effects on their affinity for the rat ecotropic MuLV receptor.

In contrast to findings in von Willebrand's disease, the abnormal response of platelets to ristocetin could not be corrected by the addition of normal flesh plasma. The detection of abnormal platelet aggregation response to ristocetin may be a useful diagnostic finding for clonal disorders causing impaired platelet function in MDS and coexistent TMDS associated with AML.

Proliferation, measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation or production of a formazan product (MTT assay), was substantially inhibited by HgCl2 at concentrations of 10(-6) M and above. Inspection of the DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis from HgCl2-treated cells revealed that it was intact, indicating inhibition of DNA synthesis, but not denaturation. HgCl2 inhibited expression of mRNA for IL-8, TNF-alpha and MHC class II at 4 x 10(-6) M and inhibited expression of IL-4 mRNA at 8 x 10(-6) M and above. At a concentration of 10(-5)M, HgCl2 almost completely blocked mRNA expression for IL-4, IL-8, TNF-alpha and MHC class II, but produced negligible inhibition of expression of mRNA encoding the housekeeping gene beta-actin, thus demonstrating selective toxicity for the cytokine and MHC class II genes studied. Pre-exposure of the cells to human recombinant IL-4 prior to treatment with HgCl2 had no effect on expression levels of any of the genes examined. The effects seen in this study are consistent with previous reports showing immunotoxic effects of HgCl2 on other cell types, therefore, the HMC-1 mast cell line may prove useful in further studies of mast cell cytokine gene expression and the mechanisms involved in cytokine gene toxicity.","['Warbrick, E V', 'Thomas, A L', 'Coleman, J W']","['Warbrick EV', 'Thomas AL', 'Coleman JW']","['Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Toxicology,Toxicology,0361055,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '53GH7MZT1R (Mercuric Chloride)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Complementary/biosynthesis/chemistry/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Genes, MHC Class II/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/pathology', 'Mast Cells/cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'Mercuric Chloride/*toxicity', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/metabolism']",1995/12/15 00:00,1995/12/15 00:01,['1995/12/15 00:00'],"['1995/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0300-483X(95)03146-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0300-483x(95)03146-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicology. 1995 Dec 15;104(1-3):179-86. doi: 10.1016/0300-483x(95)03146-7.,"['P42 ES04917/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA32157/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated 15 HB to characterize intratumoral hematopoietic foci and to find clues to the pathophysiology of their formation. By conventional histology and immunohistochemistry, we found erythroblasts in all and megakaryocytes in 10 of the HB, whereas granulocyte and monocyte precursor cells could not be identified in hematopoietic foci of any tumor. Only a minority of erythropoietic cells in these foci contained fetal Hb (HbF). We recently found that HB cells produce IL-1 beta and thus stimulate stromal cells to secrete IL-6. We therefore searched for other hematopoietic cytokines in HB. Supernatants of primary HB cultures were subjected to ELISA, bioassayed, and immunoblotted. We detected erythropoietin (EPO) in 11 of 15, stem cell factor (SCF) in 7 of 11, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in 4 of 15, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in 6 of 15, IL-3 in 1 of 12, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in 1 of 9, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) in 1 of 8 conditioned media. With immunoenzymatic labeling we localized EPO and SCF to the cytoplasm of epithelial HB cells, whereas stromal cells and cells of immature fibrous tissue of mixed HB expressed SCF, G-CSF, GM-CSF, LIF, and M-CSF. EPO and SCF could also be detected in extracts of epithelial HB cells. We conclude that, in HB, erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis but not the granulocyte-macrophage lineage is induced by fetal and embryonal tumor cells in cooperation with stromal cells by locally secreted cytokines.","['von Schweinitz, D', 'Schmidt, D', 'Fuchs, J', 'Welte, K', 'Pietsch, T']","['von Schweinitz D', 'Schmidt D', 'Fuchs J', 'Welte K', 'Pietsch T']","['Department of Pediatric Surgery, Medical School Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*immunology/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Erythroblasts/pathology', 'Erythropoiesis/physiology', 'Erythropoietin/metabolism', '*Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', 'Liver Neoplasms/*immunology/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Stem Cell Factor/metabolism']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1203/00006450-199510000-00014 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Res. 1995 Oct;38(4):555-63. doi: 10.1203/00006450-199510000-00014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, we reviewed all autopsy cases since 1972 and available lumbar puncture data on patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia admitted to the Massachusetts General Hospital. Invasion of the CNS by chronic lymphocytic leukemia often leads to confusional state, meningitis with cranial nerve abnormalities, optic neuropathy, or cerebellar dysfunction. Lumbar puncture shows a lymphocytosis consisting of monoclonal B cells, but CSF cytology studies are of limited value in establishing the diagnosis. Long-term survival may be related to the stage of chronic lymphocytic leukemia at the time of CNS disease and may be associated with intrathecal chemotherapy. A mild, asymptomatic infiltration of the brain, frequently noted in late-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia in autopsy series, may explain the CSF lymphocytosis in some patients with late-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Cramer, S C', 'Glaspy, J A', 'Efird, J T', 'Louis, D N']","['Cramer SC', 'Glaspy JA', 'Efird JT', 'Louis DN']","['Neurology Service, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Neurology,Neurology,0401060,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1212/wnl.46.1.19 [doi]'],ppublish,Neurology. 1996 Jan;46(1):19-25. doi: 10.1212/wnl.46.1.19.,,67,['Neurology. 1996 Sep;47(3):853.

In order to elucidate the role, we examined the expression of Hox11 in normal lymphocytes by a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Two alternatively spliced Hox11 mRNAs were expressed in fetal spleens. However, lymphocytes did not express Hox11 mRNA during differentiation. Furthermore, it was not induced in primary lymphocytes after activation.

We showed that the transcript is perpetually synthesized in patients' cells and that it rapidly disappears when the cells are treated with ATRA. In ATRA-sensitive (HL-60, NB4) cell lines and an ATRA-resistant (HL-60R) cell line we have shown that this process is dependent on proteins synthesized during the first 6h of ATRA-triggered differentiation and may involve both pre- and post-transcriptional mechanisms. A corresponding decrease in cathepsin G protein synthesis then follows. These findings indicate that the maturation arrest in AML M3 results in cells that may constitutively continue to produce proteins whose production is temporally confined during normal hemopoiesis.

Infection of U937 cells with a c-myc retrovirus produced similar changes strongly suggesting that Myc plays an important role in this action of Ras. By contrast, expression of H12-ras promoted factor-independent growth of the multipotent cell line, TF-1. Furthermore, mutant ras dramatically enhanced the growth of TF-1 cells in the presence of added GM-CSF or erythropoietin, but did not influence the state of differentiation of these cells.

Most patients with APL express del(17q)-derived RAR alpha-PML transcripts as well as the putative leukemogenic PML-RAR alpha associated with add(15q). We have found that a nested RT-PCR for RAR alpha-PML affords greater sensitivity than that for PML-RAR alpha, particularly in patients with the commonest breakpoint pattern.

The RAR alpha-PML assay changed the PCR status of two patients in morphological remission; in both cases disease contamination of bone marrow harvest specimens was detected. Although parallel assessment of PML-RAR alpha and RAR alpha-PML can enhance minimal residual disease detection in APL, this study demonstrates that treatment strategies involving determination of PCR status post-consolidation, even using RAR alpha-PML in addition to the more conventional PML-RAR alpha assay will fail to identify all patients at risk of relapse.

A region corresponding to bp 3897-4471 of MRP cDNA is amplified, which encompasses approximately half of the second nucleotide-binding domain (NBD2). In two multidrug resistant (MDR) sublines of the HL-60 human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line which overexpress MRP but not P-glycoprotein, the assay detects elevated levels of MRP mRNA (4- to 8-fold) relative to the drug-sensitive parental cells (designated HL-60/W). Blast cells from 24 patients with AML were also studied for MRP expression using this RT-PCR method. Expression of MRP was normalized for that of beta-actin in the blast cells, which was also determined by RT-PCR. All of these blast cell samples had MRP expression that was detectable after 35 PCR cycles. Eighteen of these patients samples had levels of expression of MRP mRNA equal to or less than that expressed by HL-60/W cells. In six patient blast cell specimens, the expression of MRP mRNA was up to 1.7-fold higher than that of HL-60/W cells. In 21 specimens, the steady-state intracellular accumulation of daunorubicin (1 microgram/ml, 3h) was also determined. The blast cells with MRP mRNA expression higher than HL-60/W had a lower median accumulation of daunorubicin compared to those whose MRP expression was less than HL-60/W, suggesting a functional defect in drug transport in the cells with higher MRP expression; a similar trend toward lower daunorubicin accumulation was also noted in the one-third of samples that displayed the highest expression of MDR1 mRNA (also determined by RT-PCR). These studies illustrate the range of expression of MRP in AML blast cell specimens. The identification of MRP overexpression in MDR AML cell lines and in some AML patient blast cells with low intracellular daunorubicin accumulation warrants further study of MRP as a component of clinical drug resistance in AML.","['Ross, D D', 'Doyle, L A', 'Schiffer, C A', 'Lee, E J', 'Grant, C E', 'Cole, S P', 'Deeley, R G', 'Yang, W', 'Tong, Y']","['Ross DD', 'Doyle LA', 'Schiffer CA', 'Lee EJ', 'Grant CE', 'Cole SP', 'Deeley RG', 'Yang W', 'Tong Y']","['University of Maryland Cancer Center, Baltimore 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jan;10(1):48-55.,['R0-1-CA52718/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Administration of hemopoietic growth factors (HGFs) such as interleukin-3 (IL-3) during chemotherapy may result in an increased cell kill by cytotoxic agents. In addition, administration of IL-3 following chemotherapy may potentially accelerate hemopoietic recovery from chemotherapy-induced bone marrow hypoplasia. We performed an open labelled, phase I/II study in which patients received IL-3 by continuous infusion from 24 h before the beginning of chemotherapy until day 28. Chemotherapy included daunorubicin or mitoxantrone days 1-3 and cytarabine 200 mg/m2 days 1-7. IL-3 was given at a dose of 5 microgram(s)/kg/day in 10 patients, 7.5 microgram(s)/kg /day in six patients and 10 microgram(s)/kg/day in four patients. Complete remissions (CR) after one cycle of this treatment were obtained in 5/10 patients and 5 microgram(s)/ kg group, 2/6 in the 7.5 microgram(s)/kg group and 3/4 in the 10 microgram(s)/kg group). Thus, 50% (10/20) of all individuals and 45% (5/11) of the elderly patients attained CR. Eight of 20 patients entered PR, and 2/20 patients died during the hypoplastic phase from infectious complications. Neutrophils and platelets recovered to 0.5 x 10(9)/l at day 25 (median) and to 50 x 10(9)/l at day 32, respectively. Adverse events during IL-3 and concomitant chemotherapy were fluid retention (4/20), rash (14/20), bone pain (2/20), headache (10/20), chest pain (1/20), arthritis (1/20), fever and nausea. IL-3 (at the dose of 10 microgram(s)/kg) was discontinued in two patients because of side-effects (fluid retention, fever, rash and chest pain), and in two other patients the high IL-3 dose was tolerated with no problems for 29 days. Thus, IL-3 applied to patients with high-risk AML at dosages of 5-10 microgram(s)/kg is tolerated with acceptable toxicity and results in a satisfactory frequency of complete responses following a single treatment cycle.","['Wielenga, J J', 'Vellenga, E', 'Groenewegen, A', 'Sonneveld, P', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Wielenga JJ', 'Vellenga E', 'Groenewegen A', 'Sonneveld P', 'Lowenberg B']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Platelet Count', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jan;10(1):43-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Homoharringtonine (HHT) is a novel cephalotaxime alkaloid with reported efficacy in relapsed and de novo AML and more recently, chronic myeloid leukemia. Although its mechanism(s) of action is not completely understood, in vitro studies have demonstrated both cytotoxic and differentiating activity in leukemic cells, as well as intra-cellular changes suggestive of apoptotic cell death. In a phase II trial, HHT was administered at a dose od 5 mg/m2 by 24-h continuous infusion daily for 9 days to patients with MDS and MDS evolving to AML (MDS/AML). Twenty-eight patients (MDS 16, MDS/AML 12) with a median age of 67 years (range 23-83) were entered. A complete remission was achieved in seven patients, a partial remission was achieved in one patient for an overall response rate of 28% (8/28). There were four of 13 responders in MDS/AML patients and four of 15 in patients with MDS. The median duration of complete response was 7 months (range 2-10). Significant myelosuppression was universal and resulted in a high incidence of induction deaths (13/28) due to neutropenic-related infections. Extramedullary toxicity was mild and consisted of hypo-tension, fluid retention, hypoglycemia, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. HHT given in this dose and schedule demonstrated limited activity in MDS and MDS/AML and was associated with prolonged pancytopenia and marrow hypoplasia in many patients. Administration of HHT at a lower dose or in combination with hematopoietic growth factors may lead to better results, but treatment with HHT as single agent at this dose and schedule is not currently recommended for these patients.","['Feldman, E J', 'Seiter, K P', 'Ahmed, T', 'Baskind, P', 'Arlin, Z A']","['Feldman EJ', 'Seiter KP', 'Ahmed T', 'Baskind P', 'Arlin ZA']","['New York Medical College, Division of Oncology/Hematology, Valhalla 10595, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Harringtonines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Remission Induction']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jan;10(1):40-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients ( > 60 years) received induction with idarubicin 12 mg/m2/day x 3 and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) 200 mg/m2/day x 5. A second course of chemotherapy consisting of mitoxantrone 12mg/m2/day x 3, etoposide (VP-16) 150 mg/m2/day x 3 and Ara-C 200 mg/m2/day x 4 was given approximately 1 month after achieving a complete remission (CR) or immediately if patients failed the first induction. Twenty-four hours following completion of the chemotherapy, G-CSF (10 micrograms/kg/day continuous i.v. infusion) was started. A historical control group of 28 patients treated without G-CSF was used for comparison. Twenty-six patients were evaluable for response. Following induction, the recovery of neutrophils to greater than 500/microliters and 1000/microliters was more raped in the responders who received G-CSF compared to historical controls (median 13 vs 17 days, P = 0.008; 14 vs 19 days, P = 0.005). The toxic death rate of 8% in the study group was significantly lower than the 32% mortality observed in the historical controls (P = 0.04). There was no difference in supportive care requirements or infectious complications. The complete remission (CR) rate was 58% in the entire study group with 71% of de novo AML patients achieving CR. Disease-free survival and overall survival were comparable between the study and historical control groups. These results indicate that G-CSF benefits elderly patients after intensive chemotherapy for AML by decreasing the duration of neutropenia. The reduced neutropenic period may have contributed to the small number of early toxic deaths.","['Maslak, P G', 'Weiss, M A', 'Berman, E', 'Yao, T J', 'Tyson, D', 'Golde, D W', 'Scheinberg, D A']","['Maslak PG', 'Weiss MA', 'Berman E', 'Yao TJ', 'Tyson D', 'Golde DW', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Pilot Projects', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jan;10(1):32-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One hundred and thirteen patients referred to our service with a diagnosis of APL were reviewed. Fourteen were classified as secondary APL. Nine were induced with chemotherapy, and five with all-trans retinoic acid plus chemotherapy. Pretreatment characteristics, response to therapy and outcome of primary vs secondary APL were compared by standard statistical methods. Secondary APL constituted 12% of all APL cases. Patients with secondary APL were significantly older (median age 56 vs 36 years; P < 0.01) and had a lower incidence of hypofibrinogenemia (P < 0.01) than those with primary APL. The complete response (CR) rates were similar with secondary vs primary APL (CR rates 79 vs 69%), as were CR duration and survival. The CR rates at 5 years were 57 and 45%, respectively(P not significant), and the survival rates 37 and 35%, respectively (P not significant). The incidence of secondary APL within APL disease (12%) was similar to the incidence of secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in karyotypes not known to be therapy-related (diploid, t(8;21), inversion 16: incidences 9 to 12%), but was significantly lower than in karyotypes known to be therapy-related (chromosome 5 or 7 abnormalities, 11q; incidences 30 and 33%).

It has been suggested that these 'unclassifiable' cases form a distinct subset with a clinical behavior more like that of refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) than that of RA or RARS, but few studies have been undertaken that characterize this group. We compared the clinical, hematologic, morphologic and cytogenetic features of 18 such patients - for whose disease we propose the designation 'refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia' (RCMD) - to those of 42 patients meeting the FAB criteria for RA or RARS (14 patients) and RAEB (28 patients). Our results show that cytopenias in RCMD are more severe than those in RA or RARS, but are similar to those in RAEB. Erythroid hyperplasia and dyserythropoiesis are the main findings in bone marrow specimens of RA or RARS, but the major features in RCMD are multilineage proliferation and dysplasia, which, except for the lack of increased blasts resemble the findings in RAEB. Only 1/14 patients (7%) with RA or RARS had an abnormal karyotype, whereas RCMD resembled RAEB in terms of the frequency (41 vs 50%, respectively) and type of karyotypic lesions. Abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and 7 (excluding del(5q) as an isolated finding) or complex aberrations were seen only in RCMD and RAEB. in RCMD, the median survival was 24 months, with a 4-year survival rate of48 +/- 13%, intermediate between the findings in RA/RARS (107 months and 77 +/- 12%, respectively) and RAEB (18 months and 27 +/- 9%, respectively). Our data indicate that RCMD is a distinct subset of MDS, with an unfavorable clinical outcome.

Secondary AML following standard doses of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is uncommon, suggesting that the high risk on this trial may result from its higher-than-standard doses of chemotherapy. However, the cases of secondary AML were characteristic of the type that follows treatment with topoisomerase II-active agents, especially etoposide, and this type of secondary AML is rare after treatment with either cyclophosphamide or doxorubicin at any dose. We raise the possibility that another component of this trial, hematopoietic growth factors to decrease the toxicities related to myelosuppression, may play an important role in the development of secondary AML. Growth factors not only stimulate hematopoietic progenitor proliferation and differentiation, they also regulate hematopoietic cell survival by interfering with apoptosis (programmed cell death). Inhibition of apoptosis by a variety of genetic factors is an important mechanism of oncogenesis, and appears to be the initiating event in some malignancies. Growth factor-mediated suppression of the apoptotic death of hematopoietic progenitors damaged by chemotherapy may contribute to their leukemic transformation.","['Brodsky, R A', 'Bedi, A', 'Jones, R J']","['Brodsky RA', 'Bedi A', 'Jones RJ']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)'],IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology/pathology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jan;10(1):175-7.,['CA 15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],26,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirteen cell lines and samples from 27 patients were studied. Cells were infected by a recombinant adenovirus expressing beta galactosidase gene (Ad RSV betagal) and efficacy of transduction assessed by evaluating betagal expression in cells with a histochemical method. After infection of the cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 200 p.f.u./cell, the percentage of beta gal-positive cells after 48h was high in two cell lines. K562 (64%) and RPMI 8226 (a myeloma cell line, 65%), relatively large in the two myeloma cell lines tested (41% and 20%, respectively) and in MT4 (an adult T cell leukemia cell line, 38%) and low or absent in other cell lines. In fresh samples from AML, ALL, CLL, NHL, myeloma and MDS, no betagal positive cells were seen 48h and 72h after infection, except in one case of myeloma and one case of CLL (where 10% and 2% of betagal positive cells were seen after infection, respectively). Exposure of fresh malignant cells to GM-CSF before and during adenoviral infection, in three cases, did not increase the number of transfected cells. This suggests that adenoviral vectors, at least in their present form, cannot efficiently be used for direct gene transfer in hematological malignant cells.","['Wattel, E', 'Vanrumbeke, M', 'Abina, M A', 'Cambier, N', 'Preudhomme, C', 'Haddada, H', 'Fenaux, P']","['Wattel E', 'Vanrumbeke M', 'Abina MA', 'Cambier N', 'Preudhomme C', 'Haddada H', 'Fenaux P']","['Inserm U124 Institut de Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)'],IM,"['Adenoviruses, Human/enzymology/*genetics', 'Adult', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/enzymology/*genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/enzymology/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/enzymology/genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', '*Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jan;10(1):171-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extensive FISH experiments were performed in order to re-examine the short arm of chromosome 12 in three children with ALL, previously shown to have t(12;21). It was shown that the t(12;21) is undetectable by routine R-banding technique and that the translocated 12 looks like a cytogenetically normal chromosome 12 in the three patients. Partial 12p deletion involving the TEL locus was shown to be interstitial in one patient with 12p- by using cosmid and YAC probes. In the second patient, the 12p- chromosome was secondary to the translocation since it was observed in about one half of the metaphases analyzed with FISH. In the third patient, the region of TEL usually rearranged in the t(12;21) displayed a germline pattern by Southern blotting, at diagnosis and in relapse. A few metaphases showed associated 12p- by standard cytogenetics, only in relapse. Thus we conclude that the TEL allele not involved in t(12;21) is inconstantly lost in patients with this subtype of ALL and occurs on the 12p- chromosome.

The oncogenic role of the bcl-2 gene has been shown by the suppression of a variety of programmed cell deaths (apoptosis). Bcl-2 is able to interact with other members of the bcl-2 family through at least one of its conserved dimerization domains. Although overproduction of the wild-type protein appears sufficient for conferring a selective growth or a survival advantage to hematopoietic cells, the mode of activation of the proto-oncogene remains to be elucidated. In a first step, we examined and quantitated the expression of the bcl-2 gene in primary biopsies of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) as well as in cell lines derived from NHLs. The results show that bcl-2 expression is found in a variety of hematopoietic lineages, but is most strongly associated with the B cell lineage. Within the B cell lineage, the expression levels vary depending on the differentiation as well as on the t(14;18) rearranged status. The quantitative measurements show high steady-state mRNA levels in early and in t(14;18) arranged B cells, whereas bcl-2 expression decreases with further B cell maturation and differentiation. In a second step we analyzed the bcl-2 mRNA for secondary genetic alterations, which may alter regulatory regions rendering it more tumorigenic. For this purpose, we chose a combined RT-PCR/SSCP method in order to screen out mutations of alleles which are not expressed. Different migration patterns of SSCP products were found only in two cell lines and subsequent sequencing revealed that the functional domains are not affected. Our data suggest that the dimerization properties of this protein are preserved in tumor cells and that modifications of the bcl-2 gene by the somatic hypermutation mechanism are not involved and do not influence the pathobiology of NHL.","['Dirks, W', 'Nolte, M', 'Werner, M', 'Jager, K', 'Koch, C', 'Drexler, H G']","['Dirks W', 'Nolte M', 'Werner M', 'Jager K', 'Koch C', 'Drexler HG']","['DSM-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jan;10(1):150-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow transplants from an HLA-identical sibling are reported to be better than chemotherapy but this is controversial. The objective of the study was to compare 3-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) in comparable subjects receiving chemotherapy or a transplant. 485 persons with AML in 2nd remission were studied. The chemotherapy cohort included 244 persons treated on trials of the British Medical Research Council, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and MD Anderson Hospital. The transplant cohort included 257 persons transplanted worldwide and reported to the international Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (16 were also chemotherapy subjects.) Subjects were selected for comparable age and year of treatment. Preliminary analyses identified two factors correlated with LFS: age < or = or > 30 years and 1st remission duration < or = or > 1 year; subsequent analyses were partitioned accordingly. Three-year probabilities of treatment-related mortality with chemotherapy and transplants were 7% (95% confidence interval, 3-15%) vs 56% (49-63%). Three-year leukemia relapse probabilities were 81% (74-86%) vs 41% (33-49%). Three-year probabilities of LFS were 17% (12-23%) vs 26 (20-32%).

Patterns differing from those of the haemopoietic cell line TF-1 were detected in 25/35 (71%) AML patients and 8/10 (80%) normal controls. A total of six base substitutions were identified by sequencing. Three were conservative for the amino acid involved, three led to amino acid differences, valine652-->methionine, glycine647-->valine and proline603-->threonine. One alteration was found only in a normal control, the other five were all found in both AML patients and normal controls suggesting that they were DNA polymorphisms. Two substitutions were particularly common with allele frequencies of 0.23 (G1972-->A, unchanged proline648) and 0.13 (C1306-->T, unchanged serine426).

Proposal of a model for the regulation of myelopoiesis by interleukin 4 and interferon gamma and its integration with the regulation of the immune response.,117-22,"We have previously shown that interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interferon gamma (INF-gamma) reciprocally regulate the production of granulocytes and monocytes from mature monopotential hematopoietic progenitor cells, while at the level of the very primitive stem cells IFN-gamma is a selective inhibitor of proliferation and differentiation, and IL-4 has weak stimulatory effects. We investigated the effects of IL-4 and IFN-gamma on the expansion in suspension culture of myeloid colony-forming cells (CFCs) induced by either IL-3 or IL-1+IL-3, using on the one hand more differentiated CD34+HLA-DR strongly positive (HLA-DR++) and on the other hand more primitive Cd34+HLA-DR weakly positive (HLA-DR+/-) human bone marrow cells. It is shown that both IL-4 and IFN-gamma stimulate the IL-3- and IL-3+IL-1-induced expansion of the number of CFCs in the HLA-DR+/- population. In the presence, but not in the absence of IL-1, additive effects of IL-4 and IFN-gamma were seen. We could not demonstrate any IL-3-like effect by IL-4 on early human hematopoietic progenitors. No expansion of CFC number was seen in the HLA-DR++ population. Based on these data and on data which we have published previously, a model for the regulation of myelopoiesis by IL-4 and IFN-gamma is proposed. In this model, IL-4 and IFN-gamma, which are both immune recognition induced inflammatory cytokines, both stimulate the expansion and recruitment of early myeloid progenitors, whereas at the level of their terminal differentiation, the balance between both cytokines determines whether preferentially monocytes/macrophages (IFN-gamma) or granulocytes (IL-4) are being produced. At the level of the most primitive cells, the inhibitory action of IFN-gamma might prevent differentiative exhaustion of the stem cell compartment in situations of hematopoietic stress.","['Snoeck, H W', 'Lenjou, M', 'Nys, G', 'Lardon, F', 'Peetermans, M E', 'Van Bockstaele, D R', 'Moulijn, A', 'Haenen, L', 'Berneman, Z N']","['Snoeck HW', 'Lenjou M', 'Nys G', 'Lardon F', 'Peetermans ME', 'Van Bockstaele DR', 'Moulijn A', 'Haenen L', 'Berneman ZN']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, University of Antwerp (UIA), Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antibody Formation', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Synergism', 'HLA-DR Antigens/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Models, Biological']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jan;10(1):117-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pappenheim staining of FACS-purified cells labeled with mAb 9C4 and anti-glycophorin A (GA) revealed that the majority of the 9C4+GA- and 9C4+GA+ cells consisted of erythroblasts. In contrast, the E-cad-positive population comprised normoblasts and erythroblasts. While the E-cad+GA- fraction contained mainly erythroblasts and basophilic normoblasts, the E-Cad+GA+ population was enriched in orthochromatic and polychromatophilic normoblasts. By colony assays of affinity column-purified cells it could be shown that erythroid colony forming units (CFU-E) were enriched and erythroid burst forming units (BFU-E) were depleted in the 9C4- and E-cad-positive fractions. Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow cells double-labeled with mAb 67A4 and anti-CD71, anti-CD117, anti-CD34, or anti-GA revealed that about 90% of the E-cad-positive cells coexpressed CD71, about 70% were positive for CD117, about 50% for GA, and only about 5% coexpressed CD34.

Nonetheless, most statistical designs for phase II trials only provide rules for evaluating treatment efficacy, and moreover only allow early stopping after fixed cohorts of patients have been treated. We illustrate a new statistical design strategy for monitoring both adverse and efficacy outcomes on a patient-by-patient basis in phase II and other single-arm clinical trials. DESIGN: The new strategy is used to design a phase II trial of the experimental regimen idarubicin plus cytarabine (ara-C) plus cyclosporine for treatment of patients with intermediate-prognosis acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The design requires a maximum of 56 patients and provides continuous monitoring boundaries to terminate the trial if the toxicity rate is unacceptably high or the complete remission (CR) rate is unacceptably low compared with the rates of these events with the standard regimen of anthracycline plus ara-C. RESULTS: The design has an 88% to 91% probability of stopping the trial early with a median of 15 to 18 patients if the toxicity rate of the experimental regimen is .05 to .10 above that of the standard and there is no improvement in the CR rate. If there is a .15 improvement in the CR rate and the toxicity rate is no more than .05 above that of the standard, then there is at least an 83% probability that the trial will run to completion. CONCLUSION: The proposed monitoring strategy provides a flexible, practical means to continuously monitor both safety and efficacy in single-arm cancer clinical trials. The design strategy can be implemented easily using a freely available menu-driven computer program, and provides a scientifically sound alternative to the use of ad hoc safety monitoring rules.","['Thall, P F', 'Simon, R M', 'Estey, E H']","['Thall PF', 'Simon RM', 'Estey EH']","['Department of Biomathematics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Anthracyclines/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Bayes Theorem', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic/*methods', 'Cyclosporine/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mathematical Computing', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', '*Probability', 'Remission Induction', 'Research Design']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.1.296 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Jan;14(1):296-303. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.1.296.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was undertaken to determine how phase I trials are currently conducted and to provide a basis for evaluation of evolving methodology. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: All published phase I trials from a single institution over a 3-year period were reviewed to determine the method of selection of the recommended dose for a phase II trial of a new agent, type and extent of toxicity, number of patients treated at the recommended dose, and clinical response. RESULTS: All 23 published trials used the standard method of entering cohorts of patients at increasing dose levels and observing toxic effects to determine the dose recommended for phase II study. Among 610 patients, 26% were treated at or within 10% of the recommended dose and 35% were treated with less than 50% of the recommended dose or on a trial that yielded no recommended dose. Among 18 trials using agents previously tested in humans, fewer patients were treated at much less than the recommended dose. For trials in which myelosuppression was dose-limiting, the estimated probability of serious myelosuppression associated with the recommended dose ranged from 23% to 66%. Nineteen patients (3%) responded to therapy. CONCLUSION: This summary of phase I trials recently conducted at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center confirms the need for alternative methods, provides baseline information against which alternatively conducted trials can be compared, and demonstrates some practical clinical trial issues not generally considered when alternative methods are proposed.","['Smith, T L', 'Lee, J J', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Legha, S S', 'Raber, M N']","['Smith TL', 'Lee JJ', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Legha SS', 'Raber MN']","['Department of Biomathematics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic/*methods', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Logistic Models', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Patient Selection', '*Research Design', 'Texas']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.1.287 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Jan;14(1):287-95. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.1.287.,"['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA62461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase II study was conducted of 31 patients (median age, 41 years) treated with BU (7 mg/kg), CY (50 mg/kg), TBI (12 Gy), and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched (n = 23) or -mismatched (n = 2) related or unrelated donor (n = 6) marrow transplantation. Results were compared with 44 historical control patients treated with CY (120 mg/kg) and TBI. RESULTS: The 3-year actuarial disease-free survival (DFS) rate was similar for the BU/CY/TBI group and the CY/TBI group (23% v 30%, P = .6), but there were trends toward lower relapse rates (28% v 54%, P = .27) and higher nonrelapse mortality rates (68% v 36%, P = .12) among the current patients compared with historical controls. Multivariate analysis showed that a normal karyotype pretransplant and the use of methotrexate as part of posttransplant immunosuppression were associated with improved survival and reduced nonrelapse mortality. Univariate analysis showed significant differences in relapse rates based on marrow source (57% for HLA genotypically matched marrow v 18% for all others, P = .04) and on disease morphology (66% for RAEB-T v 38% for RAEB and CMML, P = .05). CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced morphology myelodysplasia tolerated the intensified BU/CY/TBI preparative regimen and reduced posttransplant immunosuppression poorly. Novel transplant procedures are needed to reduce relapse rates without increasing nonrelapse mortality rates. In addition, transplantation before progression to RAEB-T, if possible, may reduce the risk of relapse.","['Anderson, J E', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Schoch, G', 'Gooley, T', 'Anasetti, C', 'Bensinger, W I', 'Bryant, E', 'Buckner, C D', 'Chauncey, T', 'Clift, R A']","['Anderson JE', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Schoch G', 'Gooley T', 'Anasetti C', 'Bensinger WI', 'Bryant E', 'Buckner CD', 'Chauncey T', 'Clift RA', 'et al.']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cyclosporine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/adverse effects', 'Infections/etiology', 'Karyotyping', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Methylprednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Regression Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.1.220 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Jan;14(1):220-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.1.220.,"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,['J Clin Oncol. 1996 Apr;14(4):1404-5.

The Japan Leukemia Study Group.",204-13,"PURPOSE: We analyzed complete remission (CR), disease-free survival (DFS), and event-free survival (EFS) rates in two groups of patients treated with either N4-behenoyl-1-beta-D-arabinosylcytosine (BHAC) or cytarabine, and analyzed DFS with or without ubenimex, a biologic response modifier. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were randomized to receive either BHAC or cytarabine as remission-induction combination chemotherapy and two courses of consolidation therapy. After maintenance/intensification therapy, patients in CR were randomized to receive either ubenimex and no drug. RESULTS: Of 341 patients registered, 326 were assessable. The age of assessable patients ranged from 15 to 82 years (median, 48). The overall CR rate was 77%: 72% in the BHAC group and 81% in the cytarabine group, and there was a significant difference between the two groups (P = .035, chi 2 test). The predicted 55-month EFS rate of all patients was 30%: 23% in the BHAC group and 35% in the cytarabine group, with a significant difference between groups (P = .0253). The predicted 55-month DFS rate of all CR patients was 38% and that of CR patients less than 50 years of age was 47%. There was no significant difference in DFS between the ubenimex group and the group that did not receive ubenimex. CONCLUSION: Analyses of our clinical trial showed that the use of BHAC in remission-induction therapy and in consolidation therapy resulted in poorer CR and EFS rates in adult AML patients compared with the use of cytarabine at the doses and schedules tested.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 264 patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who developed clonal evolution between 1967 and 1993. RESULTS: The median survival time following clonal evolution was 19 months. Factors associated with worse survival (P < .01) were as follows: chromosome 17 abnormality or chromosomal translocations other than Ph, high percentage of abnormal metaphases, longer time to clonal evolution, and presence of other accelerated-phase features. A recursive partitioning technique (CART) identified different risk groups. The best group (37 patients; no chromosome 17 abnormality, abnormal metaphases < 16%, and interval to clonal evolution < or = 24 months) had an estimated median survival time of 54 months. The worst two groups included 27 patients with chromosome 17 abnormalities and > or = 36% abnormal metaphases (estimated median survival time, 6 months), and 22 patients with other accelerated features and > or = 16% abnormal metaphases (estimated median survival time, 7 months). The intermediate group had an estimated median survival time that ranged from 13 to 24 months. Prior interferon therapy evaluated within risk groups showed a significant survival advantage only in the intermediate-risk group. A multivariate analysis showed similar results, and identified the following independent poor prognostic variables: chromosome 17 abnormality, percentage of abnormal metaphases (cutoff, 24%), longer time to clonal evolution (cutoff, 24 months), other accelerated-phase features, and no prior interferon therapy. Patients with none, one, two, three, or more of the first four features had median survivals times of 51, 24, 14, and 7 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: The prognostic significance of clonal evolution in CML is not uniform and is related to the specific abnormality, time to its development, its predominance in metaphases, and the presence of other accelerated features, and it may be modified by specific therapies.","['Majlis, A', 'Smith, T L', 'Talpaz, M', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Rios, M B', 'Kantarjian, H M']","['Majlis A', 'Smith TL', 'Talpaz M', ""O'Brien S"", 'Rios MB', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Hematology, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chi-Square Distribution', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.1.196 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Jan;14(1):196-203. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.1.196.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Participants included representatives from the Childrens Cancer Group (CCG), Pediatric Oncology Group (POG), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), St Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH), and the CTEP. METHODS: Workshop participants presented and reviewed data from ALL clinical trials, using weighted averages to combine outcome data from different groups. RESULTS: For patients with B-precursor (ie, non-T, non-B) ALL, the standard-risk category (4-year event-free survival [EFS] rate, approximately 80%) will include patients 1 to 9 years of age with a WBC count at diagnosis less than 50,000/microL. The remaining patients will be classified as having high-risk ALL (4-year EFS rate, approximately 65%). For patients with T-cell ALL, different treatment strategies have yielded different conclusions concerning the prognostic significance of T-cell immunophenotype. Therefore, some groups/institutions will classify patients with T-cell ALL as high risk, while others will assign risk for patients with T-cell ALL based on the uniform age/WBC count criteria. Workshop participants agreed that the risk category of a patient may be modified by prognostic factors in addition to age and WBC count criteria, and that a common set of prognostic factors should be uniformly obtained, including DNA index (DI), cytogenetics, early response to treatment (eg, day-14 bone marrow), immunophenotype, and CNS status. CONCLUSIONS: The more uniform approach to risk-based treatment assignment and to collection of specific prognostic factors should increase the efficiency of future ALL clinical research.","['Smith, M', 'Arthur, D', 'Camitta, B', 'Carroll, A J', 'Crist, W', 'Gaynon, P', 'Gelber, R', 'Heerema, N', 'Korn, E L', 'Link, M', 'Murphy, S', 'Pui, C H', 'Pullen, J', 'Reamon, G', 'Sallan, S E', 'Sather, H', 'Shuster, J', 'Simon, R', 'Trigg, M', 'Tubergen, D', 'Uckun, F', 'Ungerleider, R']","['Smith M', 'Arthur D', 'Camitta B', 'Carroll AJ', 'Crist W', 'Gaynon P', 'Gelber R', 'Heerema N', 'Korn EL', 'Link M', 'Murphy S', 'Pui CH', 'Pullen J', 'Reamon G', 'Sallan SE', 'Sather H', 'Shuster J', 'Simon R', 'Trigg M', 'Tubergen D', 'Uckun F', 'Ungerleider R']","['Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetics/methods', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.1.18 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Jan;14(1):18-24. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.1.18.,"['CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 30969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,['J Clin Oncol. 1996 Jan;14(1):4-6.

We investigated the role of TNF-alpha in collagenase gene expression by U937 monocyte/macrophage cells. Transcription of the TNF-alpha gene was observed after 0.5 h of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulation. Collagenase mRNA expression was not observed until 5-7 h of activation with PMA. TNF-alpha was detected in the culture supernatants 2-3 h before transcription of the collagenase gene. Neutralization of TNF-alpha protein with anti-TNF-alpha antibodies significantly reduced collagenase mRNA expression. Protein kinase C (PKC) and protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibition essentially abolished both PMA-induced TNF-alpha protein secretion and collagenase mRNA expression. Collagenase gene expression induced by exogenous TNF-alpha in U937 cells stimulated with a suboptimal concentration of PMA was suppressed by PTK, but not PKC, inhibition. The pyrrolidine derivative of dithiocarbamate, a potent inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation, resulted in a marked reduction in collagenase gene transcription, however, no reduction of TNF-alpha secretion was noted. Anti-TNF-alpha antibodies inhibited PMA-induced NF-kappa B activation. These observations demonstrate an important role for TNF-alpha in the autocrine regulation of collagenase gene expression by U937 cells. Additionally, TNF-alpha-induced PTK and NF-kappa B activation were important in collagenase gene expression in this cell line.","['Callaghan, M M', 'Lovis, R M', 'Rammohan, C', 'Lu, Y', 'Pope, R M']","['Callaghan MM', 'Lovis RM', 'Rammohan C', 'Lu Y', 'Pope RM']","['Division of Arthritis and Connective Tissue Diseases, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Thiocarbamates)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '25769-03-3 (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamic acid)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Collagenases/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrrolidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thiocarbamates/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/immunology/*physiology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.59.1.125 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1996 Jan;59(1):125-32. doi: 10.1002/jlb.59.1.125.,['P60-AR30692/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an approach to elucidate the potential functionality of TL, we developed transgenic mice that ectopically express the H-2T18d gene product on essentially all nucleated cells through the control of a heterologous H-2Kb gene promoter. Transgenic mice demonstrated an increase in the number of CD4+ lymphocytes within the thymus and lymph nodes; these cells displayed an altered T cell receptor repertoire possibly suggesting a role for the ectopically expressed TL protein. The TL protein additionally displayed the characteristics of a bona fide transplantation Ag, because skin grafts from transgenic animals onto MHC- and minor histocompatibility Ag-matched nontransgenic recipient mice resulted in a rapid and vigorous immunologic rejection of the allograft. In MLR studies, transgenic stimulator cells induced the proliferation of responders to a level intermediate between genetically identical and H-2-disparate responder-stimulator combinations. The TL protein was also capable of stimulating cytotoxic T lymphocytes, thereby resulting in specific lysis of TL+ target cells. Further data demonstrated that the TL protein assembles with peptides that are modified at the amino terminus, and that TL retains these molecules at the cell surface. Together, these data suggest that H-2T18d is capable of interacting with T cells via a bound peptide. These data further support the possibility that TL may subserve a specialized function within the immunologic system.","['Sharma, P', 'Joyce, S', 'Chorney, K A', 'Griffith, J W', 'Bonneau, R H', 'Wilson, F D', 'Johnson, C A', 'Flavell, R A', 'Chorney, M J']","['Sharma P', 'Joyce S', 'Chorney KA', 'Griffith JW', 'Bonneau RH', 'Wilson FD', 'Johnson CA', 'Flavell RA', 'Chorney MJ']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation/genetics', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/*immunology', 'Autoantigens/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/*immunology', 'Plasmids/immunology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Feb 1;156(3):987-96.,['5RO1CA53445-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We and others have previously demonstrated that expression of the B7-1 costimulatory molecule, in either immunogenic or nonimmunogenic tumors, can protect against subsequent challenge with wild-type tumor cells. In this work, using a murine model of acute myeloid leukemia, we demonstrate that the B7-1 costimulatory molecule is superior to the B7-2 molecule in its capacity to protect against wild-type tumor challenge and eradicate minimal residual disease.

Although the ligation of several different cell surface receptors, including the antigen-specific CD3/T cell receptor complex, the CD2, CD7, and CD28 antigens, as well as several chemokine receptors, has been shown to rapidly upregulate integrin function, the intracellular signaling events that initiate this increase in adhesion remain poorly defined. In this study, we have used DNA-mediated gene transfer to explore the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) in the upregulation of beta 1 integrin functional activity mediated by the CD2 antigen. CD2 was expressed in the myelomonocytic cell line HL60, which expresses beta 1 integrins that mediate adhesion to fibronectin and VCAM-1 in an activation-dependent manner. Antibody stimulation of CD2 expressed on HL60 transfectants resulted within minutes in increased beta 1-mediated adhesion to fibronectin and VCAM-1 at levels comparable to that obtained upon stimulation with the phorbol ester PMA. A role for PI 3-K in CD2-mediated increases in beta 1 integrin function is suggested by: (a) the ability of the PI 3-K inhibitor wortmannin to completely inhibit CD2-induced increases in beta 1 integrin activity; (b) the association of PI 3-K with CD2; and (c) induced PI 3-K activity upon CD2 stimulation. The mode of association of PI 3-K with CD2 is not mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent binding of PI 3-K via SH2 domains, since: (a) PI 3-K is associated with CD2 in unstimulated cells; (b) CD2 stimulation fails to increase the amount of associated PI 3-K; and (c) the CD2 cytoplasmic domain lacks tyrosine residues. A role for both protein kinase C and cytoskeletal rearrangements in CD2 regulation of integrin activity is also suggested, since a PKC inhibitor partially inhibits CD2-induced increases in beta 1 integrin function, and CD2 stimulation increases F-actin content in a wortmannin-sensitive manner. Analysis of human peripheral T cells indicated that CD2 stimulation also results in PI 3-K-dependent upregulation of beta 1 integrin activity. Thus, these results demonstrate that CD2 can function as an adhesion regulator in the absence of expression of the CD3/T cell receptor complex; and directly implicate PI 3-K as a critical intracellular mediator involved in the regulation of beta 1 integrin functional activity by the CD2 antigen.","['Shimizu, Y', 'Mobley, J L', 'Finkelstein, L D', 'Chan, A S']","['Shimizu Y', 'Mobley JL', 'Finkelstein LD', 'Chan AS']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'CD2 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation/physiology', 'Wortmannin']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.131.6.1867 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1995 Dec;131(6 Pt 2):1867-80. doi: 10.1083/jcb.131.6.1867.,"['AI31126/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI38474/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC2120662,,,,,,,,

Expression of the WAF1/CIP1 gene is induced in a p53-dependent manner in response to DNA damage but can also be induced in the absence of p53 by agents such as growth factors, phorbol esters, and okadaic acid. WAF1/CIP1 expression in U937 human leukemic cells is induced by both phorbol ester, a protein kinase C activator, and by okaidaic acid, an inhibitor of phosphatases 1 and 2A. Both of these agents induce the differentiation of these leukemic cells toward macrophages. We demonstrate that phorbol esters and okadaic acid stimulate transcription from the WAF1/CIP1 promoter in U937 cells. This transcription is mediated by a region of the promoter between -154 and +16, which contains two binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1. Deletion or mutation of these Sp1 sites reduces WAF1/CIP1 promoter response to phorbol ester and okadaic acid, while a reporter gene under the control of a promoter containing only multiple Sp1 binding sites and a TATA box is induced by phorbol ester and okadaic acid. The WAF1/CIP1 promoter is also highly induced by exogenous Sp1 in the Sp1-deficient Drosophila Schnieder SL 2 cell line. These results suggest that phorbol ester and okadaic acid activate transcription of the WAF1/CIP1 promoter through a complex of proteins that includes Sp1 and basal transcription factors.","['Biggs, J R', 'Kudlow, J E', 'Kraft, A S']","['Biggs JR', 'Kudlow JE', 'Kraft AS']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham 35294, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Ethers, Cyclic/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/12 00:00,1996/01/12 00:01,['1996/01/12 00:00'],"['1996/01/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/12 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.2.901 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)95517-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Jan 12;271(2):901-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.2.901.,"['CA42533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 43652/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The amino acid sequences of the peptides derived from p180 were almost identical to those of human AF-6 that is identified as the fusion partner of the ALL-1 protein. The ALL-1/AF-6 chimeric protein is the critical product of the t (6:11) abnormality associated with some human leukemia. AF-6 has a GLGF/Dlg homology repeat (DHR) motif and shows a high degree of sequence similarity with Drosophila Canoe, which is assumed to function downstream from Notch in a common developmental pathway. The recombinant N-terminal domain of AF-6 and Canoe specifically interacted with GTP gamma S.GST-Ha-Ras. The known Ras target c-Raf-1 inhibited the interaction of AF-6 with GTP gamma S.GST-Ha-Ras. These results indicate that AF-6 and Canoe are putative targets for Ras.","['Kuriyama, M', 'Harada, N', 'Kuroda, S', 'Yamamoto, T', 'Nakafuku, M', 'Iwamatsu, A', 'Yamamoto, D', 'Prasad, R', 'Croce, C', 'Canaani, E', 'Kaibuchi, K']","['Kuriyama M', 'Harada N', 'Kuroda S', 'Yamamoto T', 'Nakafuku M', 'Iwamatsu A', 'Yamamoto D', 'Prasad R', 'Croce C', 'Canaani E', 'Kaibuchi K']","['Division of Signal Transduction, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (AFDN protein, human)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (cno protein, Drosophila)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)', 'EC 3.6.4.4 (Kinesins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Oncogene Protein p21(ras))']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Brain/*metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Humans', 'Kinesins/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myosins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Protein p21(ras)/*metabolism', 'Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis']",1996/01/12 00:00,1996/01/12 00:01,['1996/01/12 00:00'],"['1996/01/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/12 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.2.607 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)95473-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Jan 12;271(2):607-10. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.2.607.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The process involves the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) protocol developed in our laboratory to detect the amplified PCR product. For these studies, a Y-chromosome specific repeat DNA sequence was amplified. Daudi cells, a B-cell lymphoma culture line established from a male, was used as a positive control and HL-60, a promyelocytic leukemia culture line established from a female, was used as a negative control. During the in situ PCR process cellular autofluorescence (noise) increases causing markedly reduced detection sensitivity of the probe (signal) bound to the amplified product within the positive cells. An autofluorescence reduction circuit was applied which was integrated into as standard bench top flow cytometer to reduce this noise, thereby producing a 10-fold increase in detection sensitivity of the signal. Without the application of the autofluorescence reduction circuit, the positive control histogram distribution was virtually indistinguishable from the negative control sample distributions. After autofluorescence reduction, the data showed that the Y-chromosome DNA was only amplified in the Daudi cells subjected to the complete in situ PCR protocol. This increased sensitivity also provided direct detection of the Y-chromosome repeat sequence, albeit exhibiting less signal compared to the amplified target after the in situ PCR.","['Timm, E A Jr', 'Podniesinski, E', 'Duckett, L', 'Cardott, J', 'Stewart, C C']","['Timm EA Jr', 'Podniesinski E', 'Duckett L', 'Cardott J', 'Stewart CC']","['Laboratory of Flow Cytometry, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Y Chromosome']",1995/09/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/09/15 00:00'],"['1995/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990220313 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1995 Sep 15;22(3):250-5. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990220313.,['5RO1CA6020002/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the hospitalized patients, the body parts with highest fungus-bearing rates were cavities and foramina, 80.70% (895/1109) for patients and 71.64% (144/201) for healthy subjects respectively. The skin had lowest fungus-bearing rate. 20.02% (222/1109) and 13.43% (26/201), and the mucosa had a rate of 50.77% (563/1109) for patients and 32.34% (65/201) respectively. The fungi in the hospitalized patients included 1884 strains (mean = 1.92 strains per case) in which the Candida accounted for 29.78% (561/1884) and Aspergilla 24.31% (458/1884) and those identified in healthy subjects covered 234 strains (mean = 1.52 strains per person) in which Penicillia accounted for 45.30% (106/234) and Saccharomycetes 26.07% (61/234). The patients who had been hospitalized for 3-10 days and over 20 days had higher fungus-bearing rate as compared with those who had been hospitalized for 10 to 20 days (X2 = 5.633-97.09). The patients before the administration of antibiotics and adrenocortical steroid and those who had been given these medicines for over 20 days had a higher fungus-bearing rate than those who had been on these medicines for 1-20 days.","['Zheng, Y', 'Wu, Y', 'Tang, Z']","['Zheng Y', 'Wu Y', 'Tang Z']","['Department of Dermatology and venereal Diseases, Xiehe Hospital, Tongji Medical University, Wuhan.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aspergillosis/epidemiology', 'Candidiasis/epidemiology', 'Carrier State/*epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inpatients', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*epidemiology']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,"Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 1995 Sep;75(9):552-6, 575-6.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixteen patients were found to have incomplete rearrangements of the TCR delta genes. Among them, 13 patients displayed V delta 2-D delta 3 rearrangement, while 3 had both V delta 2-D delta 3 and D delta 2-D delta 3 rearrangements. To determine the junctional sequence of TCR delta gene, PCR products from the 16 patients were sequenced directly or after M13 cloning. The results showed the junctional sequences of TCR delta gene are highly specific for each allele. This sequence diversity resulted from several factors including deletion of the 3' end of V delta 2 or D delta 2 segment and 5' end of D delta 3 segment, the presence of D delta 1 or D delta 2 sequences, insertion of N nucleotides and the association of P nucleotides with intact V delta 2 and D delta 3 segments. In addition, analysis of N-nucleotide contents revealed that the amount of GC was much larger than that of AT (70%: 30%), indicating the insertion of N nucleotide was not fully random. Our sequence data confirmed that the imcomplete rearrangement of TCR delta gene is an early event in the lymphoid cell ontogenesis, and its N sequences in V-(D)-J junctional region may be used as a specific marker of clonality to detect the minimal residual disease (MRD) in ALL.","['Kuang, S', 'Dong, S', 'Gu, L']","['Kuang S', 'Dong S', 'Gu L']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,"Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 1995 Sep;75(9):532-6, 574.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were also fewer CD4+ T-helper cells in HIV-1--seronegative IDU drug addicts. PBMNCs from HIV-1--seropositive subjects had abnormal surface enzyme kinetics. The phospholipase C had two pH optima, whereas the enzyme on normal cells has only one. The specific activity in cells from AIDS subjects was 4 times lower than that in normal PBMNCs. 5'-Nucleotidase showed a similar trend, whereas neutral endopeptidase activity did not correlate with the amounts of surface common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA).

The subcellular distribution of enzymes and the profile of surface glycosphingolipids were also markedly changed, indicating the profound alterations in the membranes of PBMNCs from HIV-1--seropositive IDUs.

Three had the process in the mandible and one in the maxilla. Specific diagnoses of Aspergillus flavus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Actinomyces species were obtained histologically from surgical samples. Treatment was radical surgery to remove all infected and necrotic tissue: removal of a substantial part of the mandible and loss of seven to eight permanent teeth in those with mandibular lesions.

Each child was treated with amikacin (7.5 mg/kg/12 h x 10-14 days) for one or more courses. RESULTS: No patient demonstrated elevations in amikacin trough levels. beta 2-Microglobulinuria, glucosuria, proteinuria, and hyperphosphaturia were absent.

There have been few studies of late cardiac performance in children in whom serial monitoring during treatment suggested normal cardiac performance, and those studies that do exist rely on the results of extensive evaluation. It was our purpose to determine whether findings consistent with known late cardiac changes could be discovered in these patients by echocardiographic monitoring similar to that routinely performed during treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total 28 consecutive asymptomatic patients who had completed anthracycline therapy at least 3 years previously, had been free of malignant disease since the completion of therapy, and who had had normal serial echocardiographic studies during and at completion of treatment were restudied by echocardiography. Of these 28, 12 had undergone mediastinal radiation as part of their acute treatment. RESULTS: Four patients (14%) of the study group were found to have abnormally low values for left ventricular shortening and ejection fractions. All four had also received mediastinal radiation. The remaining 24 patients, while having values for shortening fraction within the normal range, had, as a group, experienced a significant decrease in echocardiographic left ventricular shortening since completion of treatment. In these patients, left ventricular wall thickness had not increased commensurate with growth in body size and left ventricular cavity dimension. CONCLUSIONS: The known incidence of late asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction is confirmed despite the presence of persistently normal echocardiographic monitoring studies during and at completion of anthracycline treatment. Additionally, as a population, these patients show impaired myocardial growth over time, placing them at risk for future myocardial failure. Normal echocardiographic monitoring studies during antineoplastic treatment in children may not necessarily predict that patients will be free of the development of late cardiac dysfunction. Routine serial echocardiographic monitoring can, however, be helpful in the long-term management of these patients.","['Johnson, G L', 'Moffett, C B', 'Geil, J D', 'Greenwood, M F', 'Noonan, J A']","['Johnson GL', 'Moffett CB', 'Geil JD', 'Greenwood MF', 'Noonan JA']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington 40536, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Echocardiography', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart/drug effects', 'Heart Failure/*chemically induced/*diagnostic imaging', 'Heart Function Tests', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199602000-00014 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1996 Feb;18(1):72-5. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199602000-00014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four patients subsequently relapsed; the three others are disease-free. Based on these data, we suggest that when conventional therapy is contraindicated by associated malformations, low-dose Ara-C can be used for treating DS patients with erythroblastic or megakaryoblastic leukemia. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of low-dose Ara-C in treating megakaryoblastic and/or erythroblastic leukemia associated with DS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven patients with DS presented with leukemia in which blast cells displayed early markers of the erythroblastic and/or megakaryoblastic lineage. Low-dose subcutaneous Ara-C (10 mg/m2 two times per day) was given for 21 days as induction therapy, followed by a 5-10-day course each month for 2 years as a maintenance treatment. RESULTS: Low-dose Ara-C treatment resulted in complete remission in all seven patients and in long-term disease-free survival in three patients. CONCLUSION: In cases in which conventional chemotherapy is contraindicated, low-dose Ara-C should be considered as a therapeutic alternative for treatment of DS-associated erythroblastic or megakaryocytic leukemia.","['Tchernia, G', 'Lejeune, F', 'Boccara, J F', 'Denavit, M F', 'Dommergues, J P', 'Bernaudin, F']","['Tchernia G', 'Lejeune F', 'Boccara JF', 'Denavit MF', 'Dommergues JP', 'Bernaudin F']","['Department of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier de Bicetre, Le Kremlin Bicetre, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Remission Induction']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199602000-00011 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1996 Feb;18(1):59-62. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199602000-00011.,,,['J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1996 Feb;18(1):10-2.

Further analysis to determine the fidelity of bleomycin-induced repair as indicated by mutagenesis to hypoxanthine-phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency was also conducted. Similar sensitivities to bleomycin treatments were observed in the two cell types with the comet assay, while similar levels of dose-dependent excision repair following bleomycin treatments were also detected in unscheduled DNA synthesis experiments. Comet assay and unscheduled DNA synthesis experimental results are in agreement. Survival and induced hypoxanthine-phosphoribosyltransferase mutant frequencies were observed to be unaffected by a thymidine kinase-deficiency in Friend erythroleukaemia cells.

The glutathione (GSH) of MDR cells was approximately 1.5-fold greater than that of the parental cell line. BSO reduced GSH content of MDR cells compared to that of the sensitive ones. The BSO treatment (50 microM) enhanced the effect of DOX by 1.8-fold, while CE caused a greater reversal of drug resistance. The combination of BSO with CE produced further potentiation of DOX activity in an antiproliferative effect. Pretreatment of cells with BSO did not alter the cellular accumulation of DOX in the absence or presence of CE. The addition of BSO (30 mM) to the drinking water of mice reduced the tissue levels of GSH in tumor cells, suggesting that the marked decrease in GSH might diminish the ability of that tumor to resist DOX. Combined administration of CE and DOX resulted in enhancement of DOX antitumor activity and prolongation of survival time. The survival of mice treated with BSO and CE as a supplement to DOX treatment was superior that of mice receiving DOX alone. These studies demonstrated that the combinations of BSO with CE may be useful for killing drug-resistant tumor cells.","['Kisara, S', 'Furusawa, S', 'Murata, R', 'Ogata, M', 'Hikichi, N', 'Takayanagi, Y', 'Sasaki, K']","['Kisara S', 'Furusawa S', 'Murata R', 'Ogata M', 'Hikichi N', 'Takayanagi Y', 'Sasaki K']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Tohoku College of Pharmacy, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '1982-67-8 (Methionine Sulfoximine)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '7592YJ0J6T (cepharanthine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/drug effects/physiology', 'Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Benzylisoquinolines', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Methionine Sulfoximine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1995;7(3-4):191-200.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ADF/TRX has multiple functions including growth promoting, antiapoptotic and radical scavenging activities, and is also involved in a wide variety of intracellular processes as a dithiol reducing agent in cooperation with the NADPH-TRX reductase system. In HTLV-1(+) T cell lines, HuT 102 and MT-2, which are ADF/TRX high producing cells, we found that the expression of ADF/TRX was dependent on the cell cycle and peaked at S phase. The reducing activity of ADF/TRX in these cells was also dependent on the cell cycle and elevated in S phase as determined by NADPH-dependent insulin degradation assay. Furthermore, inhibitors of TRX reductase, 13-cis-retinoic acid (13-cis-RA) and azelaic acid, inhibited the DNA synthesis of these cells. In contrast, the residual expression and reducing activity of ADF/TRX in HTLV-I(-) T cell lines did not show any significant correlation with the cell cycle. There was no distinct inhibitory effect of 13-cis-RA or azelaic acid on the growth of these ADF/TRX low producing cells. These results indicate that a high level of reducing activity of the ADF/TRX system may be required for the cell division of these virally transformed cells. This suggests that the TRX reductase inhibitors including retinoid derivatives have a potential therapeutic utility for treatment of HTLV-1(+) T cell leukemia without any effect on HTLV-I(-) cells.","['U-Taniguchi, Y', 'Furuke, K', 'Masutani, H', 'Nakamura, H', 'Yodoi, J']","['U-Taniguchi Y', 'Furuke K', 'Masutani H', 'Nakamura H', 'Yodoi J']","['Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Dicarboxylic Acids)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor)', '12001-79-5 (Vitamin K)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 1.8.1.9 (Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase)', 'F2VW3D43YT (azelaic acid)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Dicarboxylic Acids/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Growth Substances/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Insulin/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*virology', 'Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Thioredoxins/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin K/pharmacology']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1995;7(3-4):183-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the kinetics of the appearance of IgG of donor origin and the disappearance of IgG of recipient origin, G1m and G2m allotype levels were quantified in sera obtained at regular intervals between 3 months and 5 years after BM transplantation (BMT). For this quantification, a dot immunobinding assay (DIBA) has been developed. In 19 of 22 informative recipients, the Gm allotype distribution had reached the range of values expected on the basis of the Gm phenotype of the donor within 6 months after BMT. Remarkably, IgG of recipient origin persisted in 15 of 18 informative recipients until last follow up, ie, for several years after BMT. In addition to the origin of total IgG production, the origin of homogeneous IgG components (H-IgG) appearing after BMT was investigated. H-IgG of donor origin could be detected as early as 3 weeks after BMT, but also H-IgG of recipient origin were present in 8 of 13 informative recipients for a period of up to 1 year after BMT. We conclude that host-type IgG-producing cells were not eradicated by the (myeloablative) conditioning regimen and persisted in a high number of graft recipients. It is our hypothesis that lack of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the majority of these recipients results in the persistence of IgG-producing cells of host origin.

In t(4;11) ALL, the AF-4 gene at 4q21 is translocated into the MLL locus at 11q23, resulting in the expression of an MLL/AF-4 fusion protein that is the presumptive oncoprotein. AF-4 and LAF-4 are homologous throughout their coding regions, yet neither protein is related to previously cloned genes. Human LAF-4 readily hybridized with genes in mouse and chicken, thus showing that this gene family has been highly conserved during vertebrate evolution. In mouse tissues, LAF-4 mRNA was found to be present at highest levels in lymphoid tissues, present at lower levels in brain and lung, and absent from other tissues. In human and mouse lymphoid cell lines, LAF-4 expression was highest in pre-B cells, intermediate in mature B cells, and absent in plasma cells, thus pointing to a potential regulatory role for LAF-4 in lymphoid development. Antibodies to LAF-4 showed it to be a nuclear protein that showed an uneven, granular immunofluorescence pattern. In vitro-translated LAF-4 was able to bind strongly to double-stranded DNA cellulose. Furthermore, both LAF-4 and AF-4 had domains that activated transcription strongly when fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Interestingly, the AF-4 transactivation domain is retained in the MLL/AF-4 fusion protein; thus, it may contribute to the transforming potential of the oncoprotein. Therefore, the cloning of LAF-4 has defined a new family of potential regulatory proteins that may function in lymphoid development and oncogenesis.","['Ma, C', 'Staudt, L M']","['Ma C', 'Staudt LM']","['Metabolism Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AFF3 protein, human)', '0 (Aff1 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Laf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '150826-18-9 (AFF1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chickens/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/*ultrastructure', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Drosophila melanogaster/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Lymphoid Tissue/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/physiology', 'Organ Specificity', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Species Specificity', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1996/01/15 00:00,1996/01/15 00:01,['1996/01/15 00:00'],"['1996/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66168-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jan 15;87(2):734-45.,,,,"['GENBANK/M78417', 'GENBANK/U34360', 'GENBANK/U34361']",,,,,,,,,,

However, clinical resistance to retinoids may develop and poses a serious problem for differentiation-inducing therapy. We studied the effects of RA in combination with a cytochrome P450 inhibitor (clotrimazole) and a P-glycoprotein antagonist (verapamil) on cell growth and differentiation of RA-resistant HL-60 cells and fresh RA-resistant leukemic cells from two APL patients. RA-resistant HL-60 cells and APL cells differentiated to mature granulocytes when cultured with all-trans RA and either clotrimazole and verapamil but not with either of the agents alone. These findings were confirmed in these cells by their increased expression of CD11b antigen and migration-inhibitory factor-related protein-8/14 mRNAs and decreased levels of c-myc mRNA. These combinations also markedly decreased the number of viable cells and inhibited cellular proliferation. After isolation of microsomes, measurements showed that levels of cytochrome P450 activities in both wild-type and RA-resistant HL-60 cells were almost comparable. Moreover, expression of the CYP1A1-type cytochrome P450 gene could not be detected in either cell type. However, RA-resistant HL-60 cells and APL cells, but not RA-sensitive HL-60 cells and APL cells, expressed multidrug-resistance-1 gene transcripts. Taken together, acquired resistance to RA may be explained in part by drug metabolism in leukemic cells. Possible mechanisms for accelerated clearance of RA include the induction of non-CYP1A1 cytochrome P450 enzymes and P-glycoprotein.","['Kizaki, M', 'Ueno, H', 'Yamazoe, Y', 'Shimada, M', 'Takayama, N', 'Muto, A', 'Matsushita, H', 'Nakajima, H', 'Morikawa, M', 'Koeffler, H P', 'Ikeda, Y']","['Kizaki M', 'Ueno H', 'Yamazoe Y', 'Shimada M', 'Takayama N', 'Muto A', 'Matsushita H', 'Nakajima H', 'Morikawa M', 'Koeffler HP', 'Ikeda Y']","['Division of Hematology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Calgranulin A)', '0 (Calgranulin B)', '0 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases)', 'G07GZ97H65 (Clotrimazole)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Biotransformation', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Calgranulin A', 'Calgranulin B', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Clotrimazole/pharmacology', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Microsomes/enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1996/01/15 00:00,1996/01/15 00:01,['1996/01/15 00:00'],"['1996/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66167-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jan 15;87(2):725-33.,"['CA33936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42710/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43277/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stimulation of these B-CLL cells through surface CD40 in the presence of interleukin-10 induced them to secrete IgG and IgA, proving that they can also differentiate into Ig-secreting cells.

Both C-reactive protein (CRP) and beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M) are established prognostic markers in MM. We tested the diagnostic value of these markers in 212 serum samples of patients with paraproteinemia registered prospectively in a population-based registry. Sixty patients had MM and 152 had other monoclonal gammopathies (hematologic diseases [48], paraneoplastic disease [35], autoimmune disease [15], and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [56]). CRP and beta 2M had wide and overlapping ranges in all diagnostic categories. However, serum neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) was low (< 20 U/mL) in all but 4 of 152 nonmyeloma cases and high (> or = 20 U/mL) in 31 (52%) of the 60 MM cases. Two patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1 with chronic lymphatic leukemia, and 1 with autoimmune disease had serum NCAM values between 20 and 30 U/mL. In a discriminant analysis in which serum NCAM, CRP, beta 2M, paraprotein type and concentration, hemoglobin, leukocyte and thrombocyte counts, creatinine, corrected calcium, lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase were included, paraprotein type and concentration and serum NCAM turned out to be the best combination of parameters predicting whether a patient had MM, with 89% of cases being correctly classified.

We have further investigated the effects of ATRA on leukemic cells freshly isolated from patients at diagnosis. Increase of TM antigen was documented in all AML cells: M0 (n = 1), M2 (n = 5), M3 (n = 3), M4 (n = 3), M5 (n = 3), and M6 (n = 1). Decrease of TF antigen was observed in 4 M2, 1 M4, and all M3 and M5 patients. However, no TM and TF antigens were detected in all chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (n = 3) with or without ATRA treatment. Changes of TM and TF antigen levels were associated with those of TM and TF cofactor levels on the cell surface. A stereoisomer of RA, 9-cis RA, is a high-affinity ligand for the RA receptors (RARs) and the retinoid X receptors, although ATRA and another isomer, 13-cis RA, solely bind to RARs. We have also studied the effects of 9-cis RA and 13-cis RA on the expressions of TM and TF in NB4 and U937 cells. A relatively wide range of 9-cis RA concentrations (0.01 to 1 mumol/L) compared with ATRA was optimal for prolongation of normal plasma-based recalcification time (reduction of cell surface TF activity), decrease of TF antigen, and increase of TM antigen on the surface and in the lysates of NB4 and U937 cells. Western blot analysis under nonreducing conditions showed that both ATRA and 9-cis RA markedly induced the prominent band at 75 kD of TM and reduced the band at 45 kD of TF. Northern blot analysis has shown similar changes of mRNA levels, which indicates that RAs regulate TM and TF expression in leukemic cells at transcriptional levels. Anticoagulant effects of ATRA, ie, upregulation of TM expression and downregulation of TF expression, are applied not only to established cell lines of specific subtypes (M3 and M5) but also to more universal AML (most cases of M3 and M5 and a part of the other types of AML) cells freshly isolated from patients. 9-cis RA may be more effective than ATRA as an inducer of differentiation of AML M3 cells and as an anticoagulant agent for patients with certain types of AML as well.","['Saito, T', 'Koyama, T', 'Nagata, K', 'Kamiyama, R', 'Hirosawa, S']","['Saito T', 'Koyama T', 'Nagata K', 'Kamiyama R', 'Hirosawa S']","['School of Allied Health Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Thrombomodulin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.26 (cancer procoagulant)', 'EH28UP18IF (Isotretinoin)']",IM,"['Anticoagulants/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Separation', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isotretinoin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/blood/classification/pathology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/drug effects/physiology', 'Thrombomodulin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Thromboplastin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/01/15 00:00,1996/01/15 00:01,['1996/01/15 00:00'],"['1996/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66158-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jan 15;87(2):657-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the cells were stimulated by thrombin receptor-activating peptide, an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) developed as predicted by the known effect that thrombin exerts in the platelet. We then monitored the membrane potentials of individual DAMI cells during this response and observed complex, triphasic changes that could not be accounted for by Ca2+ fluxes alone. These consisted of rapid hyperpolarization, followed by depolarization to values more positive than the resting potential and then by slow repolarization. For the purpose of this study, we focused on the hyperpolarizing current that developed immediately after thrombin receptor activation. This proved to be composed of (1) a Ca(2+)-independent, outwardly rectifying Cl- current and (2) a strongly hyperpolarizing, inwardly rectifying, Ba(2+)-sensitive K+ current that required an increase of [Ca2+]i for activation. By analogy with their functions in other cell systems, it is logical to conclude that these prominent K+ and Cl- conductances may serve to regulate the complex volume changes that accompany thrombin receptor activation and/or to increase the electromotive drive that supports Ca2+ influx under these conditions through hyperpolarization of the cell membrane.","['Sullivan, R', 'Kunze, D L', 'Kroll, M H']","['Sullivan R', 'Kunze DL', 'Kroll MH']","['Research Service, Houston VA Medical Center, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Chloride Channels)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombin)', '0', '(prolyl-seryl-glycyl-phenylalanyl-tyrosyl-leucyl-lysyl-leucyl-aspartyl-prolyl-arg', 'inyl-asparaginyl-phenylalanyl-asparagine)', '137339-65-2 (thrombin receptor peptide (42-55))', '24GP945V5T (Barium)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Barium/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Chloride Channels/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Chlorides/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ion Channel Gating/drug effects/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Peptide Fragments/drug effects', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Potassium/*metabolism', 'Potassium Channels/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Thrombin/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/15 00:00,1996/01/15 00:01,['1996/01/15 00:00'],"['1996/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66157-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jan 15;87(2):648-56.,"['HL 02311/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 45880/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was designed to evaluate whether the APL cell line NB4 induces the procoagulant activity (PCA) of human endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro, and whether this property is modified after ATRA-induced NB4 maturation. EC monolayers were incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees C with the conditioned media (CM) of NB4 treated with 1 mumol/L ATRA (ATRA-NB4-CM) or the vehicle (control-NB4-CM). EC lysates were tested for PCA. ATRA-NB4-CM induced significantly more PCA:tissue factor (TF) than control-NB4-CM (P < .01). To identify the cause of TF induction, interleukin (IL)-1 beta antigen levels were measured in CM samples. ATRA-NB4-CM contained significantly more IL-1 beta than control-NB4-CM. EC PCA was significantly inhibited by an anti-IL-1 beta antibody. The addition to the media of 10 mumol/L ATRA counteracted the EC TF expression induced by NB4-CM. These data indicate that ATRA increases the promyelocyte-induced EC TF, partly through increased IL-1 beta production.

Ex vivo expansion of this population is proposed as a means of providing accelerated short-term, as well as long-term, engraftment after myeloablative therapy. Here we demonstrate that primitive quiescent cells are retained in bulk expansion cultures of CD34+/Thy-1+/Lin- cells and that the cell production capacity of the expanded cell product can largely be attributed to cells exhibiting quiescent behavior during culture. CD34+/Thy-1+/Lin- cells from adult BM or MPB were labeled with the fluorescent membrane dye PKH26, followed by in vitro culture of 10(4) cells on a murine stromal layer in the presence of interleukin (IL)-3, IL-6, c-kit ligand (KL), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). With each subsequent cell division, PKH26 fluorescence is reduced by roughly half, which allows tracking of the number of cell divisions. Progenitor cells present after a 2-week expansion period were sorted into CD34+/Lin-/dyebright and CD34+/Lin-/dyedim fractions and then cultured in a 4-week single-cell proliferation assay to characterize the proliferative capacity of each group. Fifty-nine percent of progenitors remaining dyebright after bulk culture (four or fewer cell divisions) were observed to proliferate in single cell culture, and produced an average of 1,780 cells per plated cell. In contrast, only 26% of dyedim (more than four divisions) progenitors were observed to proliferate and displayed a lower average proliferative capacity of 225 cells per plated cell. Similar behaviors were observed after a second consecutive cycle of bulk culture, indicating that quiescent cells with high proliferative capacity existed in culture for at least 4 weeks. Single CD34+/Lin-/dyebright progenitors purified from bulk cultures were observed to produce as many as 1,000 CD34 positive progeny during single cell culture, and these progeny included multilineage colony forming cells. These data demonstrate that among CD34 positive cells recovered after in vitro bulk culture, a higher proliferative capacity correlated with quiescent behavior. The described culture method provides quantitation of the cell producing capacity of individual cells in hematopoietic cell mixtures and may prove useful for predicting engrafting potential in products intended for cellular therapy.","['Young, J C', 'Varma, A', 'DiGiusto, D', 'Backer, M P']","['Young JC', 'Varma A', 'DiGiusto D', 'Backer MP']","['SyStemix Inc, Department of Cell Product Development, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology']",1996/01/15 00:00,1996/01/15 00:01,['1996/01/15 00:00'],"['1996/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66146-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jan 15;87(2):545-56.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To enhance retroviral vector integration in bone marrow cells, mice were treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) to increase stem cell mitotic activity, which peaked on day 8 post-5-FU. The infectivity titer of the vector, pSFF-mPrP-3F4, was determined by a novel assay in which antigen-positive foci of infected cells were detected after replication and spread of the vector in cultures of mixed packaging cell lines. Infection of Sca-1+/Lineageneg-low cells with pSFF-mPrP-3F4 resulted in marker protein expression in 40% of the progeny cells after 7 days of culture. Transplantation of marrow cells or sorted Sca-1+/Lineageneg-low cells transduced with vector resulted in 3F4-positive mPrP expression in 11% to 37% of donor-derived peripheral blood leukocytes at 2 weeks. Though the percentage of 3F4-positive blood cells gradually declined, at 28 weeks 23% of recipient mice still maintained expression of the marker gene. Expression was observed in lymphoid, myeloid, and erythroid lineages and was detected in Sca-1+/Lineageneg-low marrow cells.

The diagnosis of B-ALL was confirmed by L3 morphology and/or by surface immunoglobulin (Slg) expression with > 25% blast cell infiltration in the bone marrow (BM). They were characterized by male predominance (78%) and a median age of 34 years (15 to 65 y) with only 9% adolescents (15 to 20 y), but 28% elderly patients (50 to 65 y). The patients received either a conventional (N = 9) ALL treatment regimen (ALL study 01/81) or protocols adapted from childhood B-ALL with six short, intensive 5-day cycles, alternately A and B. In study B-NHL83 (N = 24) cycle A consisted of fractionated doses of cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m2 for 5 days, intermediate-dose methotrexate (IdM) 500 mg/m2 (24 hours), in addition to cytarabine (AraC), teniposide (VM26) and prednisone. Cycle B was similar except that AraC and VM26 were replaced by doxorubicin. Major changes in study B-NHL86 (N = 35) were replacement of cyclophosphamide by ifosphamide 800 mg/m2 for 5 days, an increase of IdM to high-dose, 1,500 mg/m2 (HdM) and the addition of vincristine. A cytoreductive pretreatment with cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m2, and prednisone 60 mg/m2, each for 5 days was recommended in study B-NHL83 for patients with high white blood cell (WBC) count (> 2,500/m2) or large tumor burden and was obligatory for all patients in study B-NHL86. Central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis/treatment consisted of intrathecal methotrexate (MTX) therapy, later extended to the triple combination of MTX, AraC, and dexamethasone, and a CNS irradiation (24 Gy) after the second cycle. Compared with the ALL 01/81 study where all the patients died, results obtained with the pediatric protocols B-NHL83 and B-NHL86 were greatly improved. The complete remission (CR) rates increased from 44% to 63% and 74%, the probability of leukemia free survival (LFS) from 0% to 50% and 71% (P = .04), and the overall survival rates from 0% to 49% and 51% (P = .001). Toxicity, mostly hematotoxicity and mucositis, was severe but manageable. In both studies B-NHL83 and B-NHL86, almost all relapses occurred within 1 year. The time to relapse was different for BM, 92 days, and for isolated CNS and combined BM and CNS relapses, 190 days (P = .08). The overall CNS relapses changed from 50% to 57% and 17%, most probably attributable to the high-dose MTX and the triple intrathecal therapy. LFS in studies B-NHL83 and B-NHL86 was significantly influenced by the initial WBC count < or > 50,000/microL, LFS 71% versus 29% (P = .003) and hemoglobin value > or < 8 g/dL, LFS 67% versus 27% (P = .02). Initial CNS involvement had no adverse impact on the outcome. Elderly B-ALL patients (> 50 years) also benefited from this treatment with a CR rate of 56% and a LFS of 56%. It is concluded that this short intensive therapy with six cycles is effective in adult B-ALL. HdM and fractionated higher doses of cyclophosphamide or ifosphamide seem the two major components of treatment.","['Hoelzer, D', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Thiel, E', 'Gassmann, W', 'Loffler, H', 'Fonatsch, C', 'Rieder, H', 'Heil, G', 'Heinze, B', 'Arnold, R', 'Hossfeld, D', 'Buchner, T', 'Koch, P', 'Freund, M', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Maschmeyer, G', 'Heyll, A', 'Aul, C', 'Faak, T', 'Kuse, R', 'Ittel, T H', 'Gramatzki, M', 'Diedrich, H', 'Kolbe, K', 'Fuhr, H G', 'Fischer, K', 'Schadeck-Gressel, C', 'Weiss, A', 'Strohscheer, I', 'Metzner, B', 'Fabry, U', 'Gokbuget, N', 'Volkers, B', 'Messerer, D', 'Uberla, K']","['Hoelzer D', 'Ludwig WD', 'Thiel E', 'Gassmann W', 'Loffler H', 'Fonatsch C', 'Rieder H', 'Heil G', 'Heinze B', 'Arnold R', 'Hossfeld D', 'Buchner T', 'Koch P', 'Freund M', 'Hiddemann W', 'Maschmeyer G', 'Heyll A', 'Aul C', 'Faak T', 'Kuse R', 'Ittel TH', 'Gramatzki M', 'Diedrich H', 'Kolbe K', 'Fuhr HG', 'Fischer K', 'Schadeck-Gressel C', 'Weiss A', 'Strohscheer I', 'Metzner B', 'Fabry U', 'Gokbuget N', 'Volkers B', 'Messerer D', 'Uberla K']","['Medizinische Klinik III, Universitatsklinik Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/chemically induced', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Male', 'Meninges/pathology', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Teniposide/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1996/01/15 00:00,1996/01/15 00:01,['1996/01/15 00:00'],"['1996/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66141-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jan 15;87(2):495-508.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The vector consists of plasmid DNA containing a luciferase reporter gene that is condensed by electrostatic forces with polylysine (PL) covalently linked to streptavidin (binds biotinylated ligand) and PL covalently linked to adenovirus (AD; to achieve endosomal lysis) with the final addition of biotinylated steel factor (SLF-biotin). Targeted transfection of growth factor-dependent hematopoietic progenitor cell lines that express c-kit showed specific luciferase gene expression over cell lines that did not express c-kit. This effect was dependent on the dose of SLF-biotin and was competed by excess SLF or with monoclonal antibodies that recognize c-kit and block the binding of SLF to its receptor. Maximum transfection efficiency (> 90%) requires a 2-hour incubation period of the vector with the cells, and maximum gene expression occurred 30 hours later. Removal of the endosomalytic agent, AD, from the vector resulted in the loss of gene expression. Vector targeting was versatile and could be changed by the addition of other biotinylated ligands. In principle, this vector should be broadly applicable to deliver genes to hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in vitro and in vivo.","['Schwarzenberger, P', 'Spence, S E', 'Gooya, J M', 'Michiel, D', 'Curiel, D T', 'Ruscetti, F W', 'Keller, J R']","['Schwarzenberger P', 'Spence SE', 'Gooya JM', 'Michiel D', 'Curiel DT', 'Ruscetti FW', 'Keller JR']","['Laboratory of Leukocyte Biology, SAIC-Frederick, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '25104-18-1 (Polylysine)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', '9013-20-1 (Streptavidin)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/physiology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Bacterial Proteins/administration & dosage', 'Biotin/administration & dosage', 'DNA, Recombinant/administration & dosage', 'Endosomes/virology', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', '*Genetic Vectors/chemistry/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Polylysine/administration & dosage', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/immunology/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Stem Cell Factor/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Streptavidin', 'Transfection/*methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/15 00:00,1996/01/15 00:01,['1996/01/15 00:00'],"['1996/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66138-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jan 15;87(2):472-8.,['N01-CO-56000/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is therefore an important need to develop new strategies that will allow effectively transduced primitive hematopoietic target populations to be both rapidly characterized and isolated free of residual nontransduced but biologically equivalent cells. To address this need, we constructed a murine stem cell virus (MSCV)-based retroviral vector containing the 228-bp coding sequence of the murine heat-stable antigen (HSA) and generated helper virus-free amphotropic MSCV-HSA producer cells by transfection of GP-env AM12 packaging cells. Light density and, in some cases, lineage marker-negative (lin-) normal human marrow or mobilized peripheral blood cells preactivated by exposure to interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, and Steel factor in vitro for 48 hours were then infected by cocultivation with these MSCV-HSA producer cells for a further 48 hours in the presence of the same cytokines. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of the cells 24 hours later showed 21% to 41% (mean, 27%) of those that were still CD34+ to have acquired the ability to express HSA. The extent of gene transfer to erythroid and granulopoietic progenitors (burst-forming unit-erythroid and colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage), as assessed by the ability of these cells to form colonies of mature progeny in the presence of normally toxic concentrations of G418, averaged 11% and 12%, respectively, in 6 experiments. These values could be increased to 100% and 77%, respectively, by prior isolation of the CD34+HSA+ cell fraction and were correspondingly decreased to an average of 2% and 5%, respectively, in the CD34+HSA- cells. In addition, the extent of gene transfer to long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) was assessed by G418 resistance. The average gene transfer to LTC-IC-derived colony-forming cells in the unsorted population was < or = 7% in 4 experiments. FACS selection of the initially CD34+HSA+ cells increased this value to 86% and decreased it to 3% for the LTC-IC plated from the CD34+HSA- cells. Transfer of HSA gene expression to a phenotypically defined more primitive subpopulation of CD34+ cells, ie, those expressing little or no CD38, could also be shown by FACS analysis of infected populations 24 hours after infection. These findings underscore the potential use of retroviral vectors encoding HSA for the specific identification and non-toxic selection immediately after infection of retrovirally transduced populations of primitive human hematopoietic cells. In addition, such vectors should facilitate the subsequent tracking of their marked progeny using multiparameter flow cytometry.","['Conneally, E', 'Bardy, P', 'Eaves, C J', 'Thomas, T', 'Chappel, S', 'Shpall, E J', 'Humphries, R K']","['Conneally E', 'Bardy P', 'Eaves CJ', 'Thomas T', 'Chappel S', 'Shpall EJ', 'Humphries RK']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, B.C.

Penetrance of the tumor phenotype is about 10% to 15% by early adulthood. The increase in lymphoid malignancy includes both B- and T-cell tumors. However, young A-T patients do not show an increased susceptibility to cALL, and the UK data suggest that B-cell lymphoma occurs in older A-T children. T-cell tumors may occur at any age and may be T-ALL, T-cell lymphoma, or T-PLL; most strikingly, there may be a fourfold to fivefold increased frequency of T-cell tumors compared with that of B-cell tumors in these patients. If this is correct, it is possible that a significant proportion of all T-ALL/T-cell lymphoma in infants might be associated with undiagnosed A-T. The age range and sex predominance for T-ALL may be different for A-T and non-A-T patients and the age range for T-PLL may also be different in A-T and non-A-T patients. There is clearly some uncertainty concerning the ratio of T-cell to B-cell tumors in A-T, but this could be clarified by the publication of all tumors that occur in the disorder. In contrast, 8 of 9 tumors reported in NBS, which shows the same cellular features as A-T, were lymphomas and none was a leukemia. There are several indicators of genetic heterogeneity in A-T that suggest that not all patients are equally susceptible to all T-cell tumor types. Concordance for tumor type within individual families suggests that particular gene defects may be associated with particular tumor types. The logical extrapolation of this argument is that some patients may not have any increased risk for B-cell tumors at all or even to all T-cell types but only to a particular type of T-cell tumor. What is the cause of the increased predisposition to leukemia/lymphoma in A-T patients? There is no evidence that the immunodeficiency in A-T is related to this predisposition. One of the major findings in all A-T patients is the increase in V(D)J-mediated chromosome rearrangement observed in T lymphocytes. Particular chromosome translocations in T cells, involving a break in a TCR gene, are characteristically associated with either T-ALL or T-PLL in non-A-T patients. The majority of T-cell tumors in A-T are T-ALL and T-cell lymphoma, about which virtually nothing is known chromosomally, and the assumption is that the increased number of translocations leads to the increased level of these tumors. In older T patients, the expansion of specific translocation T-cell clones has been followed to the point to which they develop into T-PLL. All the evidence, therefore, suggests that the A-T mutation in the homozygous state allows a large increase in production of translocations formed at the time of V(D)J recombination, and this leads to the increased predisposition to leukemia. The general increased predisposition to T-cell tumors compared with B-cell tumors in A-T patients may be related to a preferential occurrence of translocations in T cells. Relatively little is known about translocations in circulating B lymphocytes in normal individuals, but A-T siblings have been shown to have clonal chromosome rearrangements of both B and T cells, simultaneously, although in these siblings the T-cell clones occupied all the T-cell compartment and the B-cell clones were small. An important inference from these facts is that the A-T defect preferentially affects immune system gene recombination in T cells rather than B cells. Recent evidence suggests that the V(D)J recombination machinery is not identical or is not regulated identically in T- and B-cell progenitors. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that V(D)J rejoining in the majority, at least, of A-T patients may be preferentially deficient in T cells compared with B cells giving rise to the greatly increased number of translocations and T-cell tumors.

Using flow cytometry the efflux of the fluorescent dye rhodamine 123 (Rh123) was measured from normal peripheral blood CD8+ T-lymphocytes which express low levels of P-glycoprotein. Inhibition of Rh123 efflux by R-verapamil, dexnigludipine-HCl, cyclosporin A, SDZ PSC833 and the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor CGP 41251 was determined in serum-free medium and in serum at concentrations from 0.1 to 50 mumol/l. With the exception of SDZ PSC833 all MDR modulators showed an insufficient or suboptimal modulation of P-glycoprotein under serum conditions at concentrations achievable in vivo. The highest potency under serum conditions demonstrated SDZ PSC833: even at a concentration of 0.5 mumol/l a sufficient inhibitory effect was observed. Subsequently this approach was applied to patients suffering from B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL; n = 3) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML; n = 2) which were positive in the Rh123 efflux assay. As for normal CD8+ T-lymphocytes, much higher drug concentrations were required under serum conditions to effectively inhibit Rh123 efflux from the leukaemic cells. Thus the interpretation of results of clinical 'modulator' trials should consider the decreased bioavailability of MDR-reversing agents.","['Ludescher, C', 'Eisterer, W', 'Hilbe, W', 'Hofmann, J', 'Thaler, J']","['Ludescher C', 'Eisterer W', 'Hilbe W', 'Hofmann J', 'Thaler J']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Dihydropyridines)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'Z81N45O25Z (niguldipine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/pharmacology', 'Acute Disease', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Dihydropyridines/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines/*metabolism', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05362.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1995 Nov;91(3):652-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05362.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that none of acute myeloblastic leukaemias (four cases) showed the CDK4I alteration, whereas 6/13 (46%) common acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALLs) displayed homozygous deletions. Moreover, and even more important, all the blasts purified from ALLs derived from early lymphoid precursors (three early-T ALLs and two pre-B ALLs) showed the absence of CDK4I gene. When the entire coding sequence of the CDK4I gene from samples without homozygous deletions was analysed by the single-strand conformational polymorphism method, no point mutations were identified. These results demonstrate that CDK4I gene deletions are very frequent and probably early events in childhood acute leukaemias of lymphoid origin and especially in early-T and pre-B ALLs. Moreover, the molecular mechanism of the loss of function of the gene is correlated, at least in childhood ALLs, almost exclusively to deletions and not to point mutations.","['Iolascon, A', 'Faienza, M F', 'Coppola, B', 'della Ragione, F', 'Santoro, N', 'Schettini, F']","['Iolascon A', 'Faienza MF', 'Coppola B', 'della Ragione F', 'Santoro N', 'Schettini F']","[""Dipartimento di Biomedicina dell'Eta Evolutiva, Universita di Bari, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', '*Gene Deletion', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05361.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1995 Nov;91(3):647-51. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05361.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used quantitative double-labelling flow cytometry with standard fluorescent beads to convert the mean fluorescence to the number of antigen molecules per cell. The number of TdT, CD10 and CD19 molecules per cell was determined in normal B-cell precursors from 22 healthy donors and eight regenerating marrows from patients with various malignancies and in 20 cases of B-lineage ALL. In normal bone marrow we characterized two different B-cell populations: TdT+/CD10+/CD19+ and TdT-/CD10+/CD19+. We demonstrated a major difference in the level of expression of TdT, CD10 and CD19 between normal bone marrow and B-lineage ALL blasts. Normal TdT+ precursors have significantly higher number of TdT (> 100 x 10(3)) and lower number of CD10 (< 50 x 10(3)) and CD19 (< 10 x 10(3)) molecules per cell than B-lineage ALL blasts (< 100, > 50, > 10 x 10(3) molecules per cell respectively); these differences were statistically highly significant. Furthermore, regenerating marrows had a significantly higher percentage of B-cell precursors than healthy donors. This increase was at the expense of the TdT-/CD10+/CD19+ population which, in the context of B-lineage ALL, could be wrongly interpreted as evidence of relapse if TdT is not included in the analysis. Therefore the quantitative analysis of TdT combined with CD10 and CD19 may allow a clear distinction between normal precursors and minimal residual leukaemia in B-lineage ALL and avoid the pitfall of misinterpreting regenerating B-cells as evidence of relapse.","['Farahat, N', 'Lens, D', 'Zomas, A', 'Morilla, R', 'Matutes, E', 'Catovsky, D']","['Farahat N', 'Lens D', 'Zomas A', 'Morilla R', 'Matutes E', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Royal Marsden Hospital, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neprilysin/analysis']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05360.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1995 Nov;91(3):640-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05360.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the molecular basis of the evolution of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) into blast crisis remains largely unknown, we decided to investigate if the occurrence of similar deletions could represent one of the mechanisms underlying the disease progression. Whereas none of 22 chronic phase CML cases examined showed alterations, we found that 3/17 total blast crisis examined (18%) showed a homozygous deletion of the CDKN2 gene. The deletions were restricted to cases of lymphoid blast crisis, being present in 3/8 (40%) of the lymphoid and in none of the nine myeloid cases examined. The fact that the chronic phase DNA obtained at diagnosis in one of the cases lacks the homozygous deletion observed in blast crisis, suggests that the final deletion event took place concomitantly with the progression of the disease. Furthermore, the analysis of polymorphic regions on chromosome 9p21 flanking at both sides the CDKN2 gene, showed that deletions at 9p21 differ between cases and are characterized by a wide range of extensions. A concomitant search for a possible involvement of the p53 tumour suppressor gene in the same series of patients showed mutations of the gene and loss of heterozygosity at 17p only in myeloid blast crisis, suggesting the presence of distinct molecular pathways in the pathogenesis of lymphoid and myeloid blast crisis.","['Serra, A', 'Gottardi, E', 'Della Ragione, F', 'Saglio, G', 'Iolascon, A']","['Serra A', 'Gottardi E', 'Della Ragione F', 'Saglio G', 'Iolascon A']","['Dipartimento Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, Universita di Torino, Ospedale San Luigi Gonzaga, Orbassano, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Gene Deletion', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05358.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1995 Nov;91(3):625-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05358.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, 2-3-fold increases of the total CD36 content and the surface CD36 expression were measured in almost all patients studied, using a radioimmunoassay and the direct binding of the radiolabelled antibody, FA6-152, to the platelet surface, respectively. These results indicate that the abnormality affected both the external and internal CD36 pools. Therefore platelet CD36 may be a useful tool for the diagnosis and the follow-up of MPD patients. Surface CD36 has been proposed as a platelet receptor for thrombospondin, an adhesive glycoprotein that is released from platelets upon activation and promotes aggregate formation. Despite a 2-fold increase of CD36 molecules, resting and thrombin-activated platelets from ET patients expressed the same amount of thrombospondin as normal platelets, suggesting that there is not a direct correlation between the CD36 expression and thrombospondin binding either spontaneously or after activation.","['Thibert, V', 'Bellucci, S', 'Cristofari, M', 'Gluckman, E', 'Legrand, C']","['Thibert V', 'Bellucci S', 'Cristofari M', 'Gluckman E', 'Legrand C']","['INSERM U353 Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CD36 Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex)', '0 (Thrombospondins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Platelets/*metabolism', 'CD36 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*blood/metabolism', 'Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex/metabolism', 'Thrombospondins']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05357.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1995 Nov;91(3):618-24. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05357.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within 2 h of UVA irradiation, three peaks of increased 3H-PMA binding to the ChL cells (by 70-100%) were observed at ca. 20, 60 and 95 min post-irradiation. The exposure of ChL to UVA caused also a rapid, but transient, decline in the cell proliferation rate (by 18% within 24 h). However, the statistically significant decrease in cell numbers was observed only 3 days later (down by 22%). The inhibition of ChL proliferation was not due to alteration of cell viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion assay, and neither was it caused by cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, as determined by flow cytometry analysis of propidium iodide-labelled cells and cell morphology in May-Grunvald-Giemsa-stained cell smears. Phorbol-ester-induced activation of PKC (performed at 37 degrees C) caused inhibition of ChL proliferation similar to that caused by UVA. This suggests that a UVA-induced increase of the membrane-bound fraction of PKC may be responsible for the UVA-induced inhibition of ChL proliferation.","['Leszczynski, D', 'Leszczynski, K', 'Servomaa, K']","['Leszczynski D', 'Leszczynski K', 'Servomaa K']","['Laboratory of Radiobiology, Finnish Centre for Radiation and Nuclear Safety, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Photodermatol Photoimmunol Photomed,"Photodermatology, photoimmunology & photomedicine",9013641,"['0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Cell Count/radiation effects', 'Cell Cycle/radiation effects', 'Cell Division/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Coloring Agents', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*radiation effects', 'Propidium', 'Protein Kinase C/*radiation effects', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Rats', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Time Factors', 'Tritium', 'Trypan Blue', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ultraviolet Rays/*adverse effects/classification']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0781.1995.tb00151.x [doi]'],ppublish,Photodermatol Photoimmunol Photomed. 1995 Jun;11(3):124-30. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0781.1995.tb00151.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than the value for normal subjects (n = 26): mean 0.92 +/- 0.09 ng ml-1. Constitutive HGF production was observed in freshly prepared leukaemic blast cells from three patients with high HGF levels of bone marrow plasma. Expression of HGF mRNA was correlated with bone marrow plasma HGF levels. After complete remission was obtained in six patients, bone marrow plasma HGF levels were significantly decreased. In contrast, the HGF mRNA was less abundantly expressed in acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL). In patients with ALL (n = 5), bone marrow plasma HGF concentration (0.69 +/- 0.14 ng ml-1) remained low within the value for normal subjects. These results suggest that some populations of myeloid lineage cells have the ability to produce HGF.","['Hino, M', 'Inaba, M', 'Goto, H', 'Nishizawa, Y', 'Tatsumi, N', 'Nishino, T', 'Morii, H']","['Hino M', 'Inaba M', 'Goto H', 'Nishizawa Y', 'Tatsumi N', 'Nishino T', 'Morii H']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Osaka City University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,['67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1996.22 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1996 Jan;73(1):119-23. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1996.22.,,,,,,PMC2074290,,,,,,,,

Determination of the half-lives of the RNAs either including or lacking this sequence element showed that the observed effect intervenes at the transcriptional level. This negative element does not affect basal activity of the HTLV-I TATA box, but down-regulates transcription induced by strong activators.

The cells were approximately 500-fold more resistant to BESM than parental cells and were unable to accumulate BESM, putrescine, spermidine or spermine. Addition of spermine to the polyamine-transport-deficient cells failed to induce haemoglobin synthesis. Hexamethylene-1,6-bisacetamide, a well-known differentiating agent, induced haemoglobin synthesis in both parental and resistant cells. Polyamine-transport-deficient cells transfected with DNA purified from the parental cell line were further selected for their ability to grow in the presence of alpha-difluoromethylornithine and putrescine. The transfectants had an active transport system for polyamines, and spermine added to their culture medium accumulated inside the cells and induced haemoglobin production.

Treatment of L1210 mouse leukaemia cells with either 5 mM alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a suicide substrate of ornithine decarboxylase, or 25 microM N1,N12-bis(ethyl)spermine (BE-3-4-3), a dysfunctional polyamine analogue, caused a stable decreased in intracellular pH (pHi) by 0.1-0.4 unit from steady-state control values between 7.4 and 7.6, as measured either by partition of a weak acid or with a fluorescent pH-sensitive probe. This effect was not related to cell growth status or differences in metabolic acid generation, and was observed in either the presence or absence of HCO3-. Exogenous spermidine (10-25 microM) or putrescine (25-50 microM) fully reversed DFMO- or BE-3-4-3-induced acidification within 2 and 8 h respectively. Recovery of pHi in L1210 cells after a nigericin- or NH4(+)-mediated acid load in HCO3(-)-free buffers was mediated by Na+/H+ antiporter activity, in addition to a minor Na(+)-independent and amiloride-insensitive pathway. Decreased steady-state pHi was maintained in polyamine-depleted L1210 cells after recovery from acid stress. Moreover, the pHi-dependence of the rate of Na(+)-dependent H+ extrusion after an acid stress was altered by DFMO and BE-3-4-3, resulting in a set-point which was lower by 0.25-0.30 pH unit in polyamine-depleted cells. On the other hand, neither the rate nor the magnitude of Na+/H(+)-exchanger-mediated alkalinization induced by hypertonic shock was decreased by polyamine depletion. Thus polyamine depletion induces a persistent defect in pHi homeostasis which is due, at least in part, to a stable decrease in the pHi set-point of the Na+/H+ exchanger.","['Poulin, R', 'Pegg, A E']","['Poulin R', 'Pegg AE']","['Laboratory of Molecular Endocrinology, Laval University Medical Research Center, Ste, Foy, Que, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bicarbonates)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', '61345-84-4 (N(1), N(12)-diethylspermine)', 'RRU6GY95IS (Nigericin)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bicarbonates/pharmacology', 'Eflornithine/*pharmacology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nigericin/pharmacology', 'Polyamines/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Putrescine/pharmacology', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers/metabolism', 'Spermidine/pharmacology', 'Spermine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1995/12/15 00:00,1995/12/15 00:01,['1995/12/15 00:00'],"['1995/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3120749 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1995 Dec 15;312 ( Pt 3):749-56. doi: 10.1042/bj3120749.,['GM-26290/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,PMC1136177,,,,,,,,

Both women subsequently presented in leukemic phase associated with a poor prognosis, and both patients succumbed soon after. The characteristics, differential diagnosis, and leukemic phase of mantle cell lymphoma are discussed. The importance of appropriate immunohistochemical and flow cytometry analysis in distinguishing mantle cell lymphoma from morphologically similar follicular center cell lymphomas is demonstrated.","['Vadlamudi, G', 'Lionetti, K A', 'Greenberg, S', 'Mehta, K']","['Vadlamudi G', 'Lionetti KA', 'Greenberg S', 'Mehta K']","['Department of Pathology, Monmouth Medical Center, Long Branch, NJ 07740, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hypertrophy', 'Immunoblastic Lymphadenopathy/pathology', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*diagnosis', 'Middle Aged', 'Splenomegaly/pathology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 1996 Jan;120(1):35-40.,,31,"['Arch Pathol Lab Med. 1996 Jan;120(1):12-4.

European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation and the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry.,311-5,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize in detail the outcomes of HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplantation for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in patients younger than 60 years of age. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: 30 centers for bone marrow transplantation worldwide, which reported data on outcome of HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplantation for CLL to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation or the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry between 1984 and 1992. PATIENTS: 54 patients diagnosed with CLL (median age, 41 years; range, 21 to 58 years). The median interval from diagnosis to transplantation was 37 months (range, 5 to 130 months). At the time of transplantation, 3 patients were at Rai stage 0; 10 were at stage 1; 10 were at stage 2; 7 were at stage 3; and 22 were at stage 4. INTERVENTION: Transplant regimens varied. Most patients received high-dose cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation, followed by infusion of bone marrow from an HLA-identical sibling. After transplantation, immune suppression with cyclosporine or methotrexate or both was generally used to prevent graft-versus-host disease. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was survival. We also studied hematologic remission, defined as normalization of the leukocyte count, hemoglobin level, and platelet count, and absence of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. RESULTS: 38 patients (70%) achieved hematologic remission. Twenty-four (44%) remain alive a median of 27 months (range, 5 to 80 months) after transplantation. Three-year survival probability was 46% (95% CI, 32% to 60%). Three patients who received transplants at Rai stage 0 remain alive 21, 32, and 45 months after transplantation. Three-year survival probabilities were as follows: 68% (CI, 38% to 98%) in 10 patients who received transplants at Rai stage 1, 30% (CI, 2% to 58%) in 10 patients who received transplants at Rai stage 2, 57% (CI, 21% to 93%) in 7 patients who received transplants at Rai stage 3, and 34% (CI, 12% to 56%) in 22 patients who received transplants at Rai stage 4 CLL. Five patients (9%) died of progressive leukemia and 25 (46%) of treatment-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: Bone marrow transplants from HLA-identical siblings can result in hematologic remission and survival in persons with CLL, but it is uncertain how these results compare with those of conventional therapies.","['Michallet, M', 'Archimbaud, E', 'Bandini, G', 'Rowlings, P A', 'Deeg, H J', 'Gahrton, G', 'Montserrat, E', 'Rozman, C', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Gale, R P']","['Michallet M', 'Archimbaud E', 'Bandini G', 'Rowlings PA', 'Deeg HJ', 'Gahrton G', 'Montserrat E', 'Rozman C', 'Gratwohl A', 'Gale RP']","['Edouard Herriot Hospital, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', '*HLA Antigens', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7326/0003-4819-124-3-199602010-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1996 Feb 1;124(3):311-5. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-124-3-199602010-00005.,['P01-CA-40053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['Ann Intern Med. 1996 Nov 1;125(9):780.

Recently, several reports have identified these lymphomas as marginal zone B-cell lymphomas. We reviewed 39 cases of NHL presenting with an enlarged spleen without lymphadenopathy, documented by fixed and frozen material. Two were peripheral T-cell lymphomas, four diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, and 14 hairy cell leukemias. The remaining 19 belonged to the ""small B-cell"" category and constitute the focus of our study. Subtyping was achieved by combining morphology, immunophenotype, and cytogenetic features according to the proposal of the International Lymphoma Study Group; in addition, analysis of the peripheral blood and bone marrow smears was performed adopting the French-American-British (FAB) criteria. From this study, we can conclude that most ""small B-cell"" NHL of the spleen were either mantle cell lymphomas or marginal zone cell lymphomas and, by peripheral blood analysis, that the mantle cell lymphomas corresponded to intermediate lymphocytic lymphoma and the marginal zone cell lymphomas to splenic lymphomas with villous lymphocytes. As a result, several diagnostic criteria can be proposed that may be helpful in differentiating mantle cell lymphoma from marginal zone cell lymphoma in the spleen.","['Pittaluga, S', 'Verhoef, G', 'Criel, A', 'Wlodarska, I', 'Dierlamm, J', 'Mecucci, C', 'Van den Berghe, H', 'De Wolf-Peeters, C']","['Pittaluga S', 'Verhoef G', 'Criel A', 'Wlodarska I', 'Dierlamm J', 'Mecucci C', 'Van den Berghe H', 'De Wolf-Peeters C']","['Department of Pathology, K.U.

The specific induced transcription is mediated by the interaction of specific transcription factors with regulatory DNA sequences that lie upstream the promoters of IFN induced genes. Phosphorylation of IFN-specific transcription factors is required for activation of transcription. We have studied the antiviral effect and the induction of gene expression by IFN-alpha in Friend Leukemia cells (FLC) in the presence of a series of inhibitors of known kinases. Protein kinase C (PKC)-specific inhibitors, i.e. calphostin C and bisindolylmaleimide, failed to influence the IFN-induced gene expression and the antiviral state. Likewise, little or no effect was found using inhibitors such as H7 or K252a. Chronic exposure of FLC to phorbol ester, that causes down regulation of PKC (the effectiveness of TPA treatment was proven by PKC enzymatic assay), has no effect on IFN-alpha action. In addition, treatment of FLC with staurosporine prevented the induction of IFN-stimulated genes and the establishment of the antiviral state only when this drug was used at high dosage (500 nM). This result indicates that, also in FLC, activation of PKC is not involved in the transcriptional response of the cells to IFN-alpha treatment. The non receptor tyrosine kinases of the JAK family that take part in the IFNs-specific transduction pathways could be the target of the staurosporine specific inhibition of the IFN-alpha action.","['Percario, Z A', 'Fiorucci, G', 'Marcolin, C', 'Mangino, G', 'Affabris, E', 'Romeo, G']","['Percario ZA', 'Fiorucci G', 'Marcolin C', 'Mangino G', 'Affabris E', 'Romeo G']","['Laboratory of Virology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,8809253,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)"", 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/genetics"", 'Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Staurosporine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents. 1995 Jan-Mar;9(1):7-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J. French and P. Roy, 1990, J. Virol. 64, 1530-1536). We have recently reported that five small internal deletion mutants of VP3 form CLPs when provided with unmodified VP7 protein (D1-5; S. Tanaka and P. Roy, 1994, J. Virol. 68, 2795-2802). To investigate whether foreign sequences can be inserted into VP3 and to determine their effect on CLP formation, three of these internal regions (D1, D2, and D5), as well as the carboxy terminus, were modified to create unique restriction enzyme sites, thereby replacing VP3 coding regions with shorter synthetic sequences. Each modified VP3 gene was used to generate baculovirus expression vectors (D1I, D2I, D5I, and VP3C, respectively). Other than the D5I mutant, the mutants formed CLPs when expressed in the presence of VP7. Subsequently, T7 tag epitopes were inserted into the D1I, D2I, and VP3C restriction sites and recombinant baculoviruses were generated to express chimeric VP3 proteins (VP3D1IT, VP3D2IT, and VP3CT). Each chimeric protein retained the ability to form CLPs when VP7 protein was provided. In another construction an immunogenic sequence representing a bovine leukemia virus (BLV) glycoprotein peptide was incorporated into the carboxy terminus of VP3 and the derived CLPs were used to raise antibodies that reacted with the BLV antigen. The results suggest that the VP3 molecule can accommodate foreign sequences at certain sites without perturbing their ability to form CLPs with VP7.","['Tanaka, S', 'Mikhailov, M', 'Roy, P']","['Tanaka S', 'Mikhailov M', 'Roy P']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics, University of Oxford, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Enterotoxins)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (VP3 protein, Bluetongue virus)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (tcdA protein, Clostridium difficile)', '137764-11-5 (VP7 protein, orbivirus)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Bacterial Toxins', 'Bacteriophage T7/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Bluetongue virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral', 'Enterotoxins/genetics/metabolism', 'Epitopes/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Spodoptera/cytology', 'Viral Core Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Assembly/*physiology']",1995/12/20 00:00,1995/12/20 00:01,['1995/12/20 00:00'],"['1995/12/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/20 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(85)70070-0 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1995.0070 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1995 Dec 20;214(2):593-601. doi: 10.1006/viro.1995.0070.,['A126879/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine infectivity of rFeLVs, neonatal cats were inoculated with rFeLVs alone or in combination with FeLV-A. The recombinant viruses were able to replicate efficiently in vivo only when administered along with FeLV-A. Of six co-infected cats, three developed thymic lymphosarcomas, one severe aplastic anemia, and two cachexia and depression; all were viremic and seroconverted shortly after inoculation. While both virus types were detected in virtually all tissues examined from these tumor-bearing cats, there was a particularly noteworthy sequence reversion in the rFeLVs. It is known that exogenous FeLV isolates carry a conserved neutralizing MGPNL epitope in the middle of the surface glycoprotein domain of the env gene. In contrast, the parental recombinant viruses used to inoculate these cats harbored the enFeLV-derived MGPNP sequence at this position. However, all in vivo-propagated recombinants displayed the MGPNL sequence, while the env-encoded backbone flanking the MGPNL sequence was that of the parental recombinant virus. These results suggest that viruses with the MGPNL epitope have an in vivo proliferative advantage. The data also provide an explanation for the conservation of this epitope in exogenous FeLVs despite the existence of variant forms in enFeLV proviral elements with which they can recombine.","['Pandey, R', 'Bechtel, M K', 'Su, Y', 'Ghosh, A K', 'Hayes, K A', 'Mathes, L E', 'Roy-Burman, P']","['Pandey R', 'Bechtel MK', 'Su Y', 'Ghosh AK', 'Hayes KA', 'Mathes LE', 'Roy-Burman P']","['Department of Pathology, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Crossing Over, Genetic', 'DNA, Viral', 'Gene Products, env/genetics', 'Gene Products, gag/blood/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/pathology/*virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/blood', 'Retroviridae Infections/blood/pathology/*virology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/blood/pathology/*virology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Virus Infections/blood/pathology/*virology']",1995/12/20 00:00,1995/12/20 00:01,['1995/12/20 00:00'],"['1995/12/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/20 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(85)70069-4 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1995.0069 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1995 Dec 20;214(2):584-92. doi: 10.1006/viro.1995.0069.,['CA51485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Suppression required an intact glucocorticoid receptor (GR), as it was amplified by transfection of lymphocytes with a plasmid encoding the human GR and blocked by the receptor antagonist RU486. These results were in direct contrast to the effects of dexamethasone on a murine leukemia retrovirus promoter where, consistent with the findings of others, activation of gene expression was obtained. Potential regions of the HIV-1 LTR mediating these effects were sought, with sequence homologies predicting two new glucocorticoid response element half-sites, GRE-II (nucleotides -6 to -1) and GRE-III (+ 15 to + 20), downstream from a previously identified GR DNA binding domain, GRE-I (-264 to -259). Mutational analyses documented the loss of inhibitory activity attendant on changes in GRE-III and the independence of steroid-mediated effects from GRE-I and GRE-II. Consistent with these findings, electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed a difference in binding of cellular factors to GRE-III in cells of T and B lymphocyte vs. monocytic lineages. Binding sites for the cellular transcription factor leader binding protein (LBP-1) were found to overlap with GRE-III, and LBP-1 interacted with this element in the HIV LTR only in T and B lymphocytic extracts. We hypothesize that GRE-III sequence-specific effects, including modulation of LBP-GR interactions, underlie the negative regulatory effect of glucocorticoids on HIV-1 gene expression, with some specificity for cell type.","['Mitra, D', 'Sikder, S K', 'Laurence, J']","['Mitra D', 'Sikder SK', 'Laurence J']","['Department of Medicine, Cornell University Medical College, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*drug effects', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat/*drug effects', 'HIV-1/*drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mifepristone/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/20 00:00,1995/12/20 00:01,['1995/12/20 00:00'],"['1995/12/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/20 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(85)70062-1 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1995.0062 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1995 Dec 20;214(2):512-21. doi: 10.1006/viro.1995.0062.,"['R01 DE11348/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL55646/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common and best-characterized lymphomas are of T-cell origin, generally occurring in the thymus. These tumors typically contain mature T-cells, involve the activation of a distinctive set of proto-oncogenes, and contain FeLV proviruses whose long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences contain tandemly repeated enhancers. Previous studies of a small group of extrathymic, multicentric lymphomas implicated a different set of genetic determinants. The present study expands those observations by examining the lineage of origin, the involvement of proto-oncogenes, and the structure of LTR and env gene sequences in a set of 11 natural, extrathymic lymphomas of the multicentric type. A pattern of genetic events associated with FeLV-positive multicentric lymphomas emerges from this analysis that is clearly distinct from the pattern associated with thymic lymphomas. The tumors do not contain T-cells or B-cells, as evidenced by the germ line organization of TCR beta and IgH loci. Proto-oncogenes strongly implicated in T-cell lymphomagenesis are not involved in these tumors. Rather, a distinct set of proto-oncogenes may be involved. Most striking is the repeated occurrence of an FeLV isolate whose LTR and env gene bear unique sequence elements.","['Athas, G B', 'Choi, B', 'Prabhu, S', 'Lobelle-Rich, P A', 'Levy, L S']","['Athas GB', 'Choi B', 'Prabhu S', 'Lobelle-Rich PA', 'Levy LS']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana 70112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein gp70, Feline leukemia virus)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'DNA, Viral', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/*genetics/virology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*genetics/virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics', 'Virus Integration']",1995/12/20 00:00,1995/12/20 00:01,['1995/12/20 00:00'],"['1995/12/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/20 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(85)70053-0 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1995.0053 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1995 Dec 20;214(2):431-8. doi: 10.1006/viro.1995.0053.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further relationship seems to exist between EBV and the lymphoproliferative syndromes appearing in immunodeficient subjects. The present work is aimed to study the possible relationship between the virus and the lymphoproliferative syndromes presented by people without any apparent immunodeficiency. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The presence of antibodies against different antigens of the virus was analysed. Antibodies against the viral capsid antigen were studied along with those against the early antigen and the viral core antigen in 55 patients with lymphoproliferative syndromes, of whom 38 had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 17 had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and none of them had immunodeficiency. RESULTS: Significantly higher geometric means of the titres against capsid antigen and of the prevalence of antibodies against early antigen were seen in the patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with respect to the control group. On the contrary, patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia showed lower immunologic response than the control group, although the difference was not significant for any of the antibodies under study. CONCLUSIONS: The higher immunologic response against EBV and its reactivation in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma would suggest that such agent could play a role favouring the onset of the disease, if not as a direct aetiological factor.","['Barranco, M', 'Vidal, J', 'Quintero, L', 'Vives-Corrons, J L', 'Jimenez de Anta, M T']","['Barranco M', 'Vidal J', 'Quintero L', 'Vives-Corrons JL', 'Jimenez de Anta MT']","['Servicio de Microbiologia Hospital Clinico y Provincial, Faeultad de Medicina, Universidad de Barcelona.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis/blood', '*Capsid Proteins', 'Female', 'Herpesviridae Infections/immunology', '*Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunocompetence/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology/*virology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/immunology/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology', 'Viral Core Proteins/analysis']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1995 Oct;40(5):383-7.,,,,,Relacion entre el virus de Epstein-Barr y sindromes linfoproliferativos en pacientes sin inmunodeficiencia.,,,,,,,,,

MCP is highly polymorphic due to a variety of mRNA splice products. The levels of MCP expression on T and myeloid cell lines are usually two-eightfold higher than those on their normal counterparts, whereas Burkitt's lymphoma B cell lines express less MCP than B cell lineages carrying no EB virus. The molecule has a Ser/Thr-rich (ST) domain adjacent to the functional domain, namely short consensus repeats (SCR). The ST domain and a cytoplasmic tail (CYT) contribute to the MCP polymorphism. The ST domain is encoded by three exons (A, B and C) and major ST isoforms are STABC, STBC and STC. The authors investigated the relationship between the expression levels and isoform usage of MCP by flow cytometry using specific antibodies against STA and STC, by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with size markers for each splice variant, and by RT-PCR/Southern blotting using a specific probe for STA. The results were (1) the profiles of mean shifts of myeloid and T cell lines were STC < STA on flow cytometry while those of B cell lines and normal blood cells were STA < STC; (2) all cell lines tested by RT-PCR expressed the messages for the isoforms STBC/CYT1, STC/CYT1, STBC/CYT2, and STC/CYT2. The band for STABC/CYT2 overlapped that for STC/CYT1, and the band for STABC/CYT1 was marginal in all cell lines examined; (3) semi-quantitative analysis of the STABC isoforms by Southern blotting indicated the presence of high levels of the STABC messages in myeloid and T-cell lines in comparison with B lymphoid cells and normal leucocytes. Thus, the quantity of MCP expressed parallels the STABC message level, which is up-regulated in T and myeloid leukaemia cell lines.","['Hara, T', 'Suzuki, Y', 'Semba, T', 'Hatanaka, M', 'Matsumoto, M', 'Seya, T']","['Hara T', 'Suzuki Y', 'Semba T', 'Hatanaka M', 'Matsumoto M', 'Seya T']","['Department of Immunology, Center for Adult Diseases Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD46 protein, human)', '0 (Complement Inactivator Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Membrane Cofactor Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/chemistry/*genetics/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Complement Inactivator Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/*genetics/immunology', 'DNA Primers', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Membrane Cofactor Protein', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/*genetics/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Virus/biosynthesis/chemistry/*genetics/immunology', 'Serine/chemistry', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Threonine/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1995.tb03700.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1995 Dec;42(6):581-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1995.tb03700.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This translocation produces a fusion gene encoding the chimeric oncoprotein E2A-Pbx1, which can induce both acute myeloid and T-lymphoid leukemia in mice. The binding of Pbx1 to DNA is weak; however, both Pbx1 and E2A-Pbx1 exhibit tight binding to specific DNA motifs in conjunction with certain other homeodomain proteins, and E2A-Pbx1 activates transcription through these motifs, whereas Pbx1 does not. In this report, we investigate potential transcriptional functions of Pbx1, using transient expression assays. While no segments of Pbx1 activated transcription, an internal domain of Pbx1 repressed transcription induced by the activation domain of Sp1, but not by the activation domains of VP16 or p53. This Pbx1 domain, which lies upstream of the homeodomain and is highly conserved among Pbx proteins, is thus predicted to bind a specific transcription factor. Surprisingly, the repression activity of Pbx1 did not require homeodomain-dependent DNA binding. Thus, Pbx1 may be able to alter gene transcription by both DNA-binding-dependent and DNA-binding-independent mechanisms.","['Lu, Q', 'Kamps, M P']","['Lu Q', 'Kamps MP']","['Department of Pathology, University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine, La Jolla 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Herpes Simplex Virus Protein Vmw65)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry', 'Herpes Simplex Virus Protein Vmw65/physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry', 'Repressor Proteins/*chemistry', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology']",1996/01/09 00:00,1996/01/09 00:01,['1996/01/09 00:00'],"['1996/01/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/09 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.1.470 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Jan 9;93(1):470-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.1.470.,['CA56876-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,PMC40260,,,,,,,,

Recent work has implicated the functional status of p53 as a critical determinant in the apoptotic response of certain cell lines to DNA damaging agents. By using human T-cell leukemia virus type I-transformed lymphoid cell lines that differ in their level and function of wild-type p53, we investigated the induction of WAF1/CIP1 and apoptosis after exposure to Adriamycin, a genotoxic agent. We found that regardless of the p53 status in these cell lines, WAF1/CIP1 RNA was rapidly induced in response to Adriamycin treatment. An elevated level of WAF1/CIP1 protein was observed as well. Additionally, we demonstrated that apoptosis was induced in all cell lines analyzed despite some having functionally inactive p53 protein.

The tumor, which resembled an oligodendroglioma or dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor, was composed of medium-sized cells with dark, round-to-polygonal nuclei and a mucinous matrix that formed pericellular lakes. Tumor cells were immunoreactive with S-100 protein and neuron-specific enolase but not with glial fibrillary acid protein, synaptophysin, or vimentin. Tumor cells had prominent rough endoplasmic reticulum and free ribosomes with short processes, compatible with an oligodendroglial or small neuronal nature. Many atypical lymphocytes had infiltrated the leptomeningeal space, subependymal zone along the ventricular walls, fornices, corpus callosum, and right frontal lobe. Multinucleated or bizarre astrocytes and macrophages were found exclusively in the right frontal white matter.

The homeodomain of Pbx1 binds ATCAATCAA, and while Pbx1 does not activate transcription through this motif, E2A-Pbx1 induces constitutive transactivation. Here, we investigate whether DNA-binding by Pbx1 or transcriptional activation by E2A are essential for the transforming abilities of E2A-Pbx1. Elimination of DNA-binding in E2A-Pbx1 by point mutations in the Pbx1 homeodomain or by large deletions that removed the Pbx1 homeodomain and carboxyl terminus did not alter ability of E2A-Pbx1 to induce focus-formation in fibroblast, even though these mutations completely eliminated its ability to activate transcription through the PRS. These same DNA-binding mutations, however, severely impaired or eliminated the ability of E2A-Pbx1 to immortalize factor-dependent myeloid progenitors in marrow cultures. Elimination of the first transcriptional activation domain of E2A abolished both fibroblast and myeloid transforming activities while elimination of the second altered neither of these activities. We conclude that DNA-binding is important for the ability of E2A-Pbx1 to disrupt differentiation, as evidenced in myeloblast immortalization, but dispensable for its ability to induce focus-formation, and that the aminoterminal domain of E2A, which strongly activates transcription, is essential for both transforming activities.","['Kamps, M P', 'Wright, D D', 'Lu, Q']","['Kamps MP', 'Wright DD', 'Lu Q']","['Department of Pathology, University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine, La Jolla 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Adenovirus E2 Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Adenovirus E2 Proteins/*physiology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Female', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1996/01/04 00:00,1996/01/04 00:01,['1996/01/04 00:00'],"['1996/01/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/04 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/04 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Jan 4;12(1):19-30.,['5 RO1 CA56876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell lines used for the experiments reported here included MOLT4 T cell line, mature B cell lines DAUDI and U-266, and early B cell line REH-6. Results from our studies demonstrated, that in the absence of CD3 antigen on the surface membrane of viable MOLT4 blast cells, double labeling of fixed, permeabilized cells revealed 97% mCD7+, cCD3+ double positive cells. Two color staining with anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) in DAUDI cells showed, that larger part of cCD22+ cells expressed mCD19 antigen. CD22 antigen was absent on DAUDI cell membrane. Of great interest was the finding, that the marker detected by anti-CD19 MoAb which was absent on the membrane of U-266 cells was detected in their cytoplasm. Double staining of these cells revealed, that the number of mCD22+, cCD19+ double positive cells was 80%. Cytoplasmic CD22 antigen along with surface membrane CD19 was used to define early B cell line REH-6 as well. Our results demonstrate majority of double positive cells among tested population (mCD19+, cCD22+). To our knowledge the presence of cytoplasmic IgM detectable by flow cytometry in REH-6 cells, which could be so regarded as a precise and adequate counterpart to pre-B acute leukemia cell phenotype in children, is an original finding. Immunological typing plays an important part in the multiple marker analysis of hematopoietic malignancies.

The hematopoietic cell lines that have been used so far to study wt p53 functions have in common the characteristic of not expressing endogenous p53. However, the mechanisms involved in the transformation of these cells are different, and the cells are at different stages of tumor progression. It can be postulated that each type of neoplastic cell offers a particular environment in which p53 might generate different effects. To test this hypothesis, we introduced individual oncogenes into untransformed, interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent myeloid precursor 32D cells to have a single transforming agent at a time. The effects induced by wt p53 overexpression were subsequently evaluated in each oncogene-expressing 32D derivative. We found that in not fully transformed, v-ras-expressing 32D cells, as already shown for the parental 32D cells, overexpression of the wt p53 gene caused no phenotypic changes and no reduction of the proliferative rate as long as the cells were maintained in their normal culture conditions (presence of IL-3 and serum). An accelerated rate of apoptosis was observed after IL-3 withdrawal. In contrast, in transformed, IL-3-independent 32D cells, wt p53 overexpression induced different effects. The v-abl-transformed cells manifested a reduction in growth rate, while the v-src-transformed cells underwent monocytic differentiation. These results show that the phenotype effects of wt p53 action(s) can vary as a function of the cellular environment.","['Soddu, S', 'Blandino, G', 'Scardigli, R', 'Martinelli, R', 'Rizzo, M G', 'Crescenzi, M', 'Sacchi, A']","['Soddu S', 'Blandino G', 'Scardigli R', 'Martinelli R', 'Rizzo MG', 'Crescenzi M', 'Sacchi A']","['Molecular Oncogenesis Laboratory, Regina Elena Cancer Institute, CRS, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src))', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Oncogene Protein p21(ras))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/physiology', 'Oncogene Protein p21(ras)/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src)/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.16.2.487 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1996 Feb;16(2):487-95. doi: 10.1128/MCB.16.2.487.,,,,,,PMC231026,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we studied, in addition to PGP expression and accumulation of VCR, the cellular beta-tubulin content in quiescent and rhIL-2 activated B-CLL cells. VCR mediates cytotoxicity by binding to tubulin. Constitutive beta-tubulin levels in B-CLL cells varied considerably. Upon activation with rhIL-2, beta-tubulin expression increased significantly. Therefore, tubulin levels could be correlated over a wide range to VCR accumulation. When the PGP-mediated drug efflux was blocked by verapamil (VRP), tubulin levels correlated linearly to VCR accumulation. All B-CLL cases expressed PGP at different levels. There was no linear correlation between PGP expression and VCR accumulation. A modulation factor m was defined as a quotient of VCR accumulation in the presence and absence of VRP to define the extent by which VRP inhibited a steady-state accumulation of VCR. The factor allowed discrimination between B-CLLs expressing low versus high PGP, irrespective of the levels of tubulin. However, PGP and beta-tubulin levels together were predictive for VCR accumulation in steady state. There was no uniform-accumulation defect for VCR in B-cell CLL because beta-tubulin and PGP were expressed independently. Non PGP-mediated VCR transport seems to play a minor role in B-cell CLL. Leukemia-associated varying of cytoskeletal organization in B-cell CLL might be one reason for the diverse cellular responses to receptor-mediated signals.","['Reichle, A', 'Diddens, H', 'Altmayr, F', 'Rastetter, J', 'Andreesen, R']","['Reichle A', 'Diddens H', 'Altmayr F', 'Rastetter J', 'Andreesen R']","['Klinik und Poliklinik der Medizinischen Klinik I, Universitat Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tubulin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tubulin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/*pharmacokinetics']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(95)00062-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(95)00062-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1995 Nov;19(11):823-9. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(95)00062-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CPT analogues interfere with the mechanism of action of the nuclear enzyme topoisomerase I, while the cells progress through the S-phase of the cell cycle and this results in cell death by apoptosis. Modulations of topoisomerase I phosphorylation may indirectly modulate the cytotoxic activity of CPT analogues. In vitro, CPT analogues have exhibited increased or unaltered killing activity against leukaemia cells resistant to epipodophyllotoxins, anthracyclines, anthracenediones, and Vinca alkaloids, while development of resistance to CPT analogues renders leukaemia and lymphoma cells more sensitive to topoisomerase II-directed drugs, inducers of cell differentiation, and immunotoxins. Oral administration of the CPT analogues has circumvented the inconvenience of solubility of these drugs. Metabolic conversion of the CPT analogue 9-nitro-CPT to equally or more potent 9-amino-CPT practically makes unnecessary treatment of the patient with 9-amino-CPT, which, in addition, is costlier to prepare than 9-nitro-CPT.

All mutants produced normal amounts of physical particles, as measured by reverse transcriptase activity and capsid protein (p24) concentration, but they formed three groups based on infectious titer and synthesis of viral DNA. Changes at the three highly conserved acidic residues in the IN core domain (D-64, D-116, and E-152) impair provirus formation without affecting viral DNA synthesis or the accumulation of viral DNA in the nucleus of the infected cell, a phenotype predicted by each mutant's lack of in vitro integrase activity. Mutations at positions N-120, R-199, and W-235 minimally affect in vitro integrase activity, but infectious titers are severely reduced, despite normal synthesis of viral DNA, implying a defect during integration in vivo. Mutations in the zinc binding region (H12C, H16V, and H16C), S81R, and a deletion of residues 32 through 275 yield noninfectious particles that synthesize little or no viral DNA following infection, despite wild-type levels of reverse transcriptase activity and viral RNA in the particles. The two latter classes of mutants suggest that IN can affect DNA synthesis or integration during infection in ways that are not appreciated from currently used assays in vitro.","['Leavitt, A D', 'Robles, G', 'Alesandro, N', 'Varmus, H E']","['Leavitt AD', 'Robles G', 'Alesandro N', 'Varmus HE']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco 94143-0100, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/*enzymology/genetics', 'Humans', 'Integrases', 'Point Mutation', 'Proviruses/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', 'Virion/metabolism', 'Virus Integration/genetics/*physiology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.2.721-728.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Feb;70(2):721-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.2.721-728.1996.,"['AI-27205/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-36899/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC189872,,,,,,,,

Molecular cloning and sequencing of the v-myc gene revealed several unique mutations, including a large deletion affecting amino acids 49 to 124 and a 3-bp insertion within the basic DNA binding domain which converts Leu-362 to Phe-Arg. The T17 lymphoma cell line was found to express a truncated 50-kDa Myc protein at exceptionally high levels, while the endogenous c-myc gene was not detectably expressed. These observations suggest that the mutant Myc product expresses an oncogenic function in T cells. Further evidence that the T17 mutant gene retains oncogenic potential was provided by its detection in clonally integrated proviruses in secondary tumors induced by feline leukemia virus T17, where no reversion mutations were found in any of three tumors examined. However, the mutant T17 v-myc gene did not induce transformation in a chicken embryo fibroblast assay, in contrast to wild-type feline c-myc, which conferred higher growth rates on the chicken fibroblasts, along with altered morphology and the ability to form foci in soft agar. Chicken cells over-expressing feline c-myc died by apoptosis when cultured with low serum concentrations, while the T17 mutant had no discernible effect. These results suggest that the leukemogenic potential of Myc can be uncoupled from its ability to cause transformation in fibroblasts. A possible explanation for this apparent paradox is that developing T cells are acutely sensitive to a subset of Myc functions which are insufficient for fibroblast transformation.","['Fulton, R', 'Gallagher, R', 'Crouch, D', 'Neil, J C']","['Fulton R', 'Gallagher R', 'Crouch D', 'Neil JC']","['Department of Veterinary Pathology, University of Glasgow, Bearsden, Scotland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Myc associated factor X)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Binding Sites', 'Cats', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Genes, myc/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.2.1154-1162.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Feb;70(2):1154-62. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.2.1154-1162.1996.,,,,['GENBANK/U28401'],,PMC189924,,,,,,,,

Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the HaPiT2 and PiT2 proteins suggested that differences in the amino acid composition of the extracellular region(s) of the hamster and human proteins account for their functional differences. We substituted extracellular regions of HaPiT2 for those of PiT2 to map the region of the HaPiT2 protein required for GALV receptor function. Only those PiT2-HaPiT2 chimeric receptors containing the fourth and fifth extracellular regions of HaPiT2 functioned as GALV receptors.

This feature correlates with the presence of low levels of phosphotyrosine in lymphoid cells infected with carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants. In contrast, high levels of phosphotyrosine are observed in NIH 3T3 cells infected with wild-type and mutant Ab-MLV. Two downstream targets affected in lymphoid transformants are the GTPase-activating protein and GTPase-activating protein-associated protein p62, molecules which are heavily tyrosine phosphorylated in lymphoid cells transformed by wild-type Ab-MLV but not carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants of Ab-MLV. This difference suggested that signaling mediated via the Ras pathway may be compromised in lymphoid cells expressing the carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants. Consistent with this idea, expression of v-Ha-ras complemented these mutants in primary bone marrow transformation assays and increased transformation frequencies obtained with the Ab-MLV mutants 8- to 20-fold. These data suggest that a biologically important link exists between the carboxyl terminus of v-Abl protein and the Ras pathway.

A rationale for high-dose methotrexate.,73-80,"Methotrexate (MTX) is one of the most widely used drugs for the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and is commonly given in high doses. However, the rationale for high-dose MTX (HDMTX) has been challenged recently. To determine whether higher MTX polyglutamate (MTXPG) concentrations in ALL blasts translate into greater antileukemic effects, 150 children with newly diagnosed ALL were randomized to initial treatment with either HDMTX (1,000 mg/m2 intravenously over 24 h) or lower-dose MTX (30 mg/m2 by mouth every 6 h x 6). ALL blasts accumulated higher concentrations of MTXPG and long-chain MTXPG (MTXPGLC) after HDMTX (P < 0.00001). Of 101 patients evaluable for peripheral blast cytoreduction, MTXPG concentrations were higher in patients whose blast count decreased within 24 h (P = 0.005) and in those who had no detectable circulating blasts within 4 days (P = 0.004). The extent of inhibition of de novo purine synthesis in ALL blasts was significantly related to the blast concentration of MTXPGLC (IC95% = 483 pmol/10(9) blasts). The percentage of patients with 44-h MTXPGLC exceeding the IC95% was greater after HDMTX (81%) than LDMTX (46%, P < 0.0001). These data indicate that higher blast concentrations of MTXPG are associated with greater antileukemic effects, establishing a strong rationale for HD-MTX in the treatment of childhood ALL.","['Masson, E', 'Relling, M V', 'Synold, T W', 'Liu, Q', 'Schuetz, J D', 'Sandlund, J T', 'Pui, C H', 'Evans, W E']","['Masson E', 'Relling MV', 'Synold TW', 'Liu Q', 'Schuetz JD', 'Sandlund JT', 'Pui CH', 'Evans WE']","[""Pharmaceutical Department, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Purines)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Purines/biosynthesis', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI118409 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1996 Jan 1;97(1):73-80. doi: 10.1172/JCI118409.,"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC507064,,,,,,,,

Immunofluorescence staining of transiently transfected NIH3T3 cells demonstrated that the RING finger motif, dimerization domain, and nuclear localization signal are all required for the formation of PML oncogenic domains (PODs). Immunofluorescence staining of transiently transfected GM637D human fibroblasts indicated that expression of PMLprb-, PM-Lnls-, and PMLprb-nls- led to a significant reduction or, in some cases, complete elimination of PODs. PMLdim-, PMLnls-, PMLpr-, PMLprb-, and PMLprb-nls- mutants were found to lose their ability to suppress transformation of NIH3T3 cells by activated neu, while PMLpro- and PMLsp- mutants did not. These results suggest that the ability of PML to form a POD is essential for suppression of growth and transformation. Furthermore, since PMLprb-, PMLnls-, and PMLprb-nls- mutants could block the suppression effect of wild-type PML on transformation of NIH3T3 cells by the neu oncogene, these PML mutants are potential dominant negative inhibitors of PML. Our study also suggests that the RING finger motif may interact with other nuclear proteins.","['Le, X F', 'Yang, P', 'Chang, K S']","['Le XF', 'Yang P', 'Chang KS']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas M.

In the present study we examined the effects of p48 on the accumulation of a series of monokine transcripts, including TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6, in human peripheral blood monocytes and the myeloid/monocyte cell lines HL-60 and U937. Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Northern blot analysis, p48 was found to induce accumulation of TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA in peripheral blood monocytes, HL-60 and U937 cells. IL-6 mRNA was found to be increased in p48-stimulated peripheral blood monocytes but not HL-60 or U937. Thus, the secretion of IL-1 and TNF-alpha by p48-stimulated monocytic cells was associated with up-regulation of cytokine mRNA, suggesting that p48 leads to increased transcription or mRNA stability in these cells. As U937 and HL-60 are likely to represent premonocyte stages of haemopoietic differentiation, it is possible that the effect of p48 on IL-6 mRNA, in contrast to its effect on TNF and IL-1, requires cells to be at a later differentiation step.","['Kestler, D P', 'Agarwal, S', 'Hall, R E']","['Kestler DP', 'Agarwal S', 'Hall RE']","['Department of Medicine, University of Tennessee Medical Center, Graduate School of Medicine, Knoxville, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (polypeptide 48)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cytokines/genetics/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/metabolism']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1995 Nov;86(3):463-8.,['CA-58205/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,PMC1383952,,,,,,,,

We also studied the effect of CPZ on human TNF-alpha action by assessing TNF-alpha cytotoxicity on mouse fibrosarcoma L929 cells. CPZ (1-100 microM) inhibited TNF-alpha production in THP-1 cells in a dose dependent manner by a maximum of 80%. This effect was comparable to that of two well-known inhibitory drugs, dexamethasone and cyclicAMP. Inhibition was also evident at the mRNA level. On the other hand CPZ (10-25 microM) also inhibited TNF-alpha activity: in fact it reduced the cytotoxicity of TNF-alpha on L929 cells (EC50 was increased four times) and could provide protection even as a post-treatment. CPZ inhibited TNF-induced apoptosis in L929 cells, as detected by analysis of nuclear morphology. However, since we showed that apoptosis was very limited, and was not the main mode of cell death in our conditions, this could not explain the overall protection.

Anti-TCR mAb-induced apoptosis, but not A23187- or anti-fas-induced apoptosis, was rescued by anti-CD3 mAb treatment. In contrast, only anti-fas mAb-mediated apoptosis was rescued by PKC activators such as PMA. These differences suggest that each of these three agents mediate apoptosis by unique signaling pathways. Nevertheless, two variant subclones of SUP-T13 were found to be resistant to all three apoptosis-inducing agents, suggesting a point(s) of common regulation between the different pathways. To determine whether this regulation occurred through bcl-2, p53, or c-myc, their expression in the parental and variant cells was determined. The three clones expressed approximately equal amounts of these proteins, and their levels did not change significantly upon treatment with anti-TCR or anti-TCR plus anti-CD3 mAb.

Although these cells respond to all-trans-retinoic acid to form neutrophils, our group has recently shown that these cells are capable of terminal monocytic differentiation in response to combined treatment with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25 D3) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). We show here that the agents need not be present simultaneously, but may be added sequentially. TPA treatment prior to 1,25 D3 led to the appearance of adherent cells; however, when 1,25 D3 treatment preceded TPA treatment cells expressed all differentiation markers reflective of terminal differentiation. This priming effect of 1,25 D3 was both dose and time dependent. Increasing the interval between 1,25 D3 and TPA treatment caused a decrease in this priming potential indicative of limited commitment inducing capacity of 1,25 D3. In order to characterize the mechanism of action of 1,25 D3 and TPA, chemical inhibitors of phosphorylation were used. Staurosporine and bisindolymaleimide GF 109203X treatment prior to and during 1,25 D3 treatment or TPA treatment caused attenuation of the differentiation response. Experiments utilizing tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors supported the hypothesis that 1,25 D3 signaling was mediated by both serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation cascades. Results from this study provide evidence to support the hypothesis that 1,25 D3 signaling occurs via nongenomic mechanisms which when combined with the signaling effects of TPA, allow for the terminal differentiation of APL cells. This model should be used to develop new differentiation therapies for APL and other leukemias.","['Bhatia, M', 'Kirkland, J B', 'Meckling-Gill, K A']","['Bhatia M', 'Kirkland JB', 'Meckling-Gill KA']","['Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Maleimides)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'L79H6N0V6C (bisindolylmaleimide I)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Genistein', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Isoflavones/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Maleimides/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Monocytes/*cytology/drug effects', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Signal Transduction', 'Staurosporine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism', 'Vanadates/pharmacology']",1996/01/10 00:00,1996/01/10 00:01,['1996/01/10 00:00'],"['1996/01/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/10 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(96)90008-7 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1996.0008 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1996 Jan 10;222(1):61-9. doi: 10.1006/excr.1996.0008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inhibition results in dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product, prolongation of the G1-phase in the cell cycle, and subsequent commitment to terminal differentiation of MEL cells. Reversal of the processes by repletion of cellular BH4 with biopterin-related compounds including BH4, 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (7,8-BH2), sepiapterin, and 7,8-dihydroneopterin has generated complicated results. Low micromolar exogenous pterin compounds had little or no effect. At 300 microM or higher, the synthesis of hemoglobin by DAHP-induced MEL cells is significantly inhibited by 7,8-dihydrobiopterin and sepiapterin. However, further cell cycle analysis shows that the inhibition of cell differentiation by 7,8-BH2 and sepiapterin may not be due to the reversal of cell proliferation. Inhibition of BH4 biosynthesis in MEL cells by inhibitors of sepiapterin reductase has also been studied. None of the inhibitors that were tested, including N-chloroacetyl-dopamine and N-acetylserotonin, which are specific for sepiapterin reductase, can block MEL cells in G1-phase or induce the cells to commit to terminal differentiation. Furthermore, inhibitors of sepiapterin reductase are found to reduce or to abolish hemoglobin synthesis in differentiating MEL cells induced by hexamethylene bisacetamide. The mechanism for this is not clear. Not all of the effects caused by the depletion of BH4 synthesis can be rescued by repletion of BH4. These results suggest that BH4 may not regulate proliferation or differentiation of MEL cells as previously thought.

In different cell systems, nuclear PLCs can be modulated, in response to agonists, either by enhancing or by down-regulating their activity, thus leading to DNA replication or to cell differentiation. Friend cells, induced to erythroid differentiation by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), show a down-regulation of PLC beta 1 isoform, as indicated by the reduction of the transcription of its mRNA and of the in vitro synthesis of its translation product. The intracellular localization and the amount of different PLC isoforms have been evaluated by electron microscope immunocytochemistry. In untreated Friend cells, PLC beta 1 and gamma 1 isoforms are both present within the nucleus, whereas mainly the gamma 1 isoform is detected in the cytoplasm. The small amount of cytoplasmic PLC beta 1 is probably representative only of the newly synthesized enzyme. Quantitative immunolabeling analyses demonstrate that erythroid differentiation is associated with a significant decrease of the PLC beta 1 amount in the nucleus and with an almost complete disappearance of that isoform in the cytoplasm, whereas the PLC gamma 1 isoform is unaffected. The two PLC isoforms, moreover, appear to be differently associated with the nuclear components, PLC beta 1 being steadily bound to the inner nuclear matrix, whereas PLC gamma 1 is almost completely soluble.","['Zini, N', 'Ognibene, A', 'Marmiroli, S', 'Bavelloni, A', 'Maltarello, M C', 'Faenza, I', 'Valmori, A', 'Maraldi, N M']","['Zini N', 'Ognibene A', 'Marmiroli S', 'Bavelloni A', 'Maltarello MC', 'Faenza I', 'Valmori A', 'Maraldi NM']","['Istituto di Citomorfologia Normale e Patologica, CNR, Bologna/Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Cell Biol,European journal of cell biology,7906240,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Phospholipase C beta)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Plcb1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/*enzymology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Phospholipase C beta', 'Phospholipase C gamma', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/genetics/*metabolism']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Cell Biol. 1995 Sep;68(1):25-34.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many other agents such as electromagnetic fields, pesticides, and some parental occupational exposures are suspected of playing roles, but the evidence is not conclusive at this time.

Serum lipids and lipoprotein profiles were determined in children affected by different types of malignancies (leukaemias or lymphomas and solid tumours) both before any treatment and after remission of the disease following chemical or surgical therapy. 2. At the time of diagnosis, children bearing tumours showed hypertriglyceridaemia and reduced concentrations of plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, the decrease being particularly prominent in patients with haematological tumours. Children bearing solid tumours displayed an increase of total cholesterol, while those with haematological cancer showed decreased phospholipid levels; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in neoplastic patients was not significantly different from control values. High triacylglycerol and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were also evident in cancer patients divided according to age into three groups (0-5, 6-10 and 11-15 years) when compared with age-matched control subjects. Similarly, high triacylglycerol and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were also observed in both male and female children when patients were divided according to sex and compared with corresponding controls. 3. Clinical remission after therapy was accompanied by an increase of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels compared with values observed at diagnosis. In contrast, post-treatment levels of triacylglycerol were higher than those observed before therapy. These results support the hypothesis that alterations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels may be related, at least in part, to the rate of tumour growth, while modifications of triacylglycerol levels may be mediated by different mechanisms.","['Dessi, S', 'Batetta, B', 'Spano, O', 'Sanna, F', 'Tonello, M', 'Giacchino, M', 'Tessitore, L', 'Costelli, P', 'Baccino, F M', 'Madon, E']","['Dessi S', 'Batetta B', 'Spano O', 'Sanna F', 'Tonello M', 'Giacchino M', 'Tessitore L', 'Costelli P', 'Baccino FM', 'Madon E', 'et al.']","['Dipartimento di Patologia Sperimentale, Universita di Cagliari, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Sci (Lond),"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",7905731,"['0 (Cholesterol, HDL)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cholesterol, HDL/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypertriglyceridemia/*etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood', 'Remission Induction']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/cs0890505 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Sci (Lond). 1995 Nov;89(5):505-10. doi: 10.1042/cs0890505.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most cases reported have been of acute leukaemias developing after high doses of 131I. Only a few cases of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) have been reported in this setting to date. We report two new cases of CML after low dose radioactive iodine and review the literature. We present an analysis of the minimal relative risk of CML developing in thyroid cancer patients treated with 131I in Israel. Two male patients, 35 and 51 years old, developed CML following low dose 131I therapy for metastatic mixed papillary and follicular carcinoma of the thyroid. Both had undergone thyroidectomy and neck dissection and thyroid ablation with 131I (total dose: 56 and 130 mCi respectively). Four and 10 years later, respectively, a leucocytosis was noticed with typical blood smears, and CML was diagnosed either by Philadelphia translocation or bcr-abl gene rearrangement. Thyroid cancer at that time was in remission. Estimated minimal relative risk of CML after 131I therapy where the population considered at risk comprised all thyroid cancer patients detected during the years 1981-1991 in Israel was 8.95 (95% confidence limits 2.26-35.16). Literature review disclosed five additional similar cases. The mean radioiodine dose given to the seven CML patients was 11416MBq (range 1134-32130 MBq), considerably lower than the dose given to patients reported in the literature who subsequently developed acute leukaemias (mean 34965, range 3856-54810 MBq). We suggest that CML is a potential complication of low dose 131I therapy given for thyroid carcinoma even at the lower end of the dose range used for this indication. Leucocytosis appearing in these patients should raise the suspicion of secondary CML.","['Shimon, I', 'Kneller, A', 'Olchovsky, D']","['Shimon I', 'Kneller A', 'Olchovsky D']","['Institutes of Endocrinology, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Carcinoma, Papillary, Follicular/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Israel', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Risk', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*radiotherapy']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2265.1995.tb02932.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 1995 Nov;43(5):651-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2265.1995.tb02932.x.,,21,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under physiological conditions, the uptake of THP by both types of cell was time- and temperature-dependent. The amount of drug transport in the resistant cells was significantly less than that in the parent cells within 3 min of incubation. THP uptake was significantly higher in the presence than in the absence of 4 mM 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) in glucose-free Hanks' balanced salt solution in both HL60 and HL60/THP cells and the increases were approximately equal. In the presence of DNP, the uptake of THP by both types of cell was concentration-dependent, and there were no significant differences in the apparent kinetic constants (Michaelis constant (Km), maximum velocity (Vmax) and Vmax/Km) for THP uptake between HL60 and HL60/THP cells. Additionally, THP transport was competitively inhibited by its analogue doxorubicin. The efflux of THP from HL60/THP cells was significantly greater than that from HL60 cells, and the release from both types of cell was completely inhibited by decreasing the incubation temperature to 0 degrees C and by treatment with DNP in glucose-free medium. In contrast, the P-glycoprotein inhibitors verapamil and cyclosporin A did not inhibit THP efflux. However, genistein, which is a specific inhibitor of multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), increased the THP remaining in the resistant cells, and the value was approximately equal to that of the control group in the sensitive cells. These results suggest that THP is taken up into HL60 and HL60/THP cells via a common carrier by facilitated diffusion, and then pumped out in an energy-dependent manner. Furthermore, the accelerated efflux of THP by a specific mechanism, probably involving MRP, other than the expression of P-glycoprotein, resulted in decreased drug accumulation in the resistant cells, and was responsible, at least in part, for the development of resistance in HL60/THP cells.","['Nagasawa, K', 'Natazuka, T', 'Chihara, K', 'Kitazawa, F', 'Tsumura, A', 'Takara, K', 'Nomiyama, M', 'Ohnishi, N', 'Yokoyama, T']","['Nagasawa K', 'Natazuka T', 'Chihara K', 'Kitazawa F', 'Tsumura A', 'Takara K', 'Nomiyama M', 'Ohnishi N', 'Yokoyama T']","['Department of Hospital Pharmacy, Kyoto Pharmaceutical University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'D58G680W0G (pirarubicin)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport, Active/drug effects', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacokinetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genistein', 'HL-60 Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoflavones/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*metabolism', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050389 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1996;37(4):297-304. doi: 10.1007/s002800050389.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The iminoether ligands can have either E or Z configuration about the C = N double bond, therefore EE, EZ and ZZ isomers are obtainable. Substitution of iminoether with EE configuration for amine leads to unexpectedly high antitumor activity for the complex with trans geometry which turns out to be more active than the cis congener in the P388 leukaemia system. The same trans-EE complex shows an activity comparable to that of cisplatin in reducing the primary tumour mass and lung metastases in mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma, thus representing a trans platinum complex active on both limphoproliferative and solid metastasizing murine tumours. Also the cytotoxicity, the inhibition of DNA synthesis and the mutagenic activity, which are greater for the cis- with respect to the trans-isomer in the amine complexes, are instead greater for the trans- than for the cis- isomer in the case of iminoether compounds. Binding to calf thymus DNA is slower for iminoether complexes than it is for amine complexes, however after 24 h reaction time the level of binding is similar for both types of complexes. Trans-EE, like trans-DDP, does not give the DNA conformational alterations (terbium fluorescence) typical of antitumour-active cis- platinum compounds, but, under strictly analogous experimental conditions, shows a greatly reduced DNA interstrand cross-linking ability (heat denaturation/renaturation assay) with respect to either trans-DDP or cis-EE and cis-DDP. The data in hand point to a new trans platinum antitumour complex with a mechanism of action different from that of cis-DDP and classical analogues.","['Coluccia, M', 'Boccarelli, A', 'Mariggio, M A', 'Cardellicchio, N', 'Caputo, P', 'Intini, F P', 'Natile, G']","['Coluccia M', 'Boccarelli A', 'Mariggio MA', 'Cardellicchio N', 'Caputo P', 'Intini FP', 'Natile G']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, Sez.

We have shown previously that Bcl-2 protein levels are unaltered by these factors, suggesting a Bcl-2-independent regulation of apoptosis in this system. Here, we have investigated the possibility that the three recently identified Bcl-2 homologues, Bax, Bcl-x, and Mcl-1, could be involved instead. Freshly isolated cells expressed both Bax and Mcl-1 protein, but only low levels of Bcl-xL and no detectable Bcl-xS, as determined by Western blot analysis. Upon culture of cells with apoptotic or survival stimuli, Bax and Bcl-xL protein levels remained relatively unchanged. By contrast, Mcl-1 levels decreased markedly in cells undergoing apoptosis in medium and, even more dramatically, after treatment with the apoptotic stimuli transforming growth factor beta 1 and forskolin. This decrease was rapid and preceded cell death. Furthermore, all the survival stimuli tested (interleukin 4, anti-IgM antibodies, and the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) prevented the decline in Mcl-1 levels. This striking correlation between cell survival and Mcl-1 expression in peripheral blood B cells suggests the possible involvement of Mcl-1, instead of Bcl-2, in the regulation of apoptosis in these cells. The present study is the first one linking this novel Bcl-2 homologue to the control of cell death in normal cells.","['Lomo, J', 'Smeland, E B', 'Krajewski, S', 'Reed, J C', 'Blomhoff, H K']","['Lomo J', 'Smeland EB', 'Krajewski S', 'Reed JC', 'Blomhoff HK']","['Department of Immunology, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Jan 1;56(1):40-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human K562 erythroleukemic cells, PGA1 induces the synthesis of a M(r) 70,000 hsp (hsp70) by cycloheximide-sensitive activation of heat shock transcription factor (HSF). Induction of hsp70 has been associated recently with the ability of PGA to protect K562 cells from thermal injury, establishing a thermotolerant state; however, the role of hsp70 in thermotolerance is still controversial. Because quercetin was shown to modulate hsp70 expression after heat shock in K562 cells, we have investigated the effect of this flavonoid on HSF activation, hsp70 synthesis, and thermotolerance in human K562 cells after induction with PGA1. Quercetin was found to inhibit hsp70 synthesis for a period of 3-6 h after PGA1 treatment. This transient block was exerted at the transcriptional level and was not due to the loss of HSF DNA-binding activity. After the initial delay, hsp70 synthesis reached the same rate as the PGA1-treated control, and it was actually prolonged in the presence of quercetin. In PGA1-treated cells, quercetin suppressed PGA1-induced thermotolerance completely if the heat shock was applied at a time (6 h) when hsp70 synthesis was inhibited, whereas it could not prevent the establishment of a thermotolerant state if the heat challenge was applied 24 h after treatment, when hsp70 synthesis was not affected. These results support strongly the hypothesis that hsp70 is involved in the establishment of thermotolerance in human cells.","['Elia, G', 'Amici, C', 'Rossi, A', 'Santoro, M G']","['Elia G', 'Amici C', 'Rossi A', 'Santoro MG']","['Institute of Experimental Medicine, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Prostaglandins A)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'VYR271N44P (prostaglandin A1)']",IM,"['Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Antagonism', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Prostaglandins A/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Jan 1;56(1):210-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxic therapy may result in the induction of hematopoietic inhibitors contributing to prolonged myelosuppression, whereas preventing the induction of such inhibitors may accelerate multilineage recovery. Lisofylline [LSF; (R)-1-(5-hydroxyhexyl)-3,7, dimethyl-xanthine], inhibits the signaling and/or release of certain hematopoietic inhibitory molecules such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha, transforming growth factor beta, and IFN-gamma. Treatment of murine bone marrow cells with the cytotoxic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) results in the release of a nondialyzable inhibitor of progenitor (colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage; CFU-GM) proliferation. When murine bone marrow cells were treated with 5-FU plus LSF, release of this inhibitor of CFU-GM proliferation was blocked. Neutralizing antibody and Western blot analysis indicated that the inhibitor was TGF-beta. We tested the effect of LSF (100 mg/kg i.p., b.i.d.) on multilineage regeneration after high-dose 5-FU or thiotepa treatment in BALB/c mice. In 4 of 5 experiments, LSF significantly accelerated neutrophil recovery (P < or = 0.05, Wilcoxon paired-signed test). In addition, platelet, reticulocyte, and CFU-GM regeneration were significantly accelerated in mice treated with LSF compared to control mice (P < or = 0.05). LSF had no significant effects on the ability of 5-FU to kill hematopoietic progenitor cells, nor did LSF stimulate or inhibit proliferation of CFU-GM. LSF had no effect on chemotherapy-induced killing of tumor cells in vitro, nor on the antitumor activity of 5-FU or thiotepa in BALB/c mice implanted with P388 leukemia cells. Inhibition of hematopoietic inhibitor release may accelerate multilineage recovery after cytotoxic therapy and, as such, may represent an alternative or additional therapy to the use of positively acting lineage specific colony-stimulating factors.","['Clarke, E', 'Rice, G C', 'Weeks, R S', 'Jenkins, N', 'Nelson, R', 'Bianco, J A', 'Singer, J W']","['Clarke E', 'Rice GC', 'Weeks RS', 'Jenkins N', 'Nelson R', 'Bianco JA', 'Singer JW']","['Cell Therapeutics, Inc., Seattle, Washington 98119, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'L1F2Q2X956 (lisofylline)', 'SD6QCT3TSU (Pentoxifylline)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/*toxicity', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Pentoxifylline/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Jan 1;56(1):105-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detection by fluorescence in situ hybridization.",118-23,"The putative oncogenes BCL-1, BCL-2, and BCL-3 are commonly rearranged by translocations to the immunoglobulin genes in B-cell malignancies. However, Southern blotting rarely detected their involvement in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This discrepancy could stem from some unique features of the oncogenesis of CLL or be due to shortcomings of Southern blotting. We have therefore evaluated the role of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in the detection of these oncogenes in CLL. Twenty consecutive CLL patients were studied by FISH for the detection of BCL-1, BCL-2, or BCL-3 rearrangement and for the presence of trisomy 12. Selected patients were also evaluated by classical cytogenetic techniques and by Southern blot analysis. Juxtaposition of JH and BCL-1 was demonstrated in 10 (50%), BCL-2 in three (15%), and BCL-3 in four (20%) of the patients. Trisomy 12 was detected by FISH in 11 (55%) patients. The coexistence of trisomy 12 and translocation of the BCL-1 oncogene was common. Three of the patients had chromosomal aberrations compatible with those detected by FISH. In contrast, in none of the five patients selected by their positive FISH findings was a rearrangement demonstrated by Southern blotting. We conclude that FISH is a sensitive method for the detection of oncogene involvement in CLL. Mainly BCL-1, but also BCL-2 and BCL-3, are commonly translocated to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14. These translocations are often associated with trisomy 12. These findings indicate that the BCL oncogenes are commonly involved in CLL and lend support to the multi-hit theory of cancer development.","['Lishner, M', 'Lalkin, A', 'Klein, A', 'Yarkoni, S', 'Manor, Y', 'Fejgin, M', 'Leytin, V', 'Ravid, M', 'Amiel, A']","['Lishner M', 'Lalkin A', 'Klein A', 'Yarkoni S', 'Manor Y', 'Fejgin M', 'Leytin V', 'Ravid M', 'Amiel A']","['Department of Medicine, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (BCL3 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Cyclin D1', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', '*Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Transcription Factors']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165460895001522 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(95)00152-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1995 Dec;85(2):118-23. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(95)00152-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prevalence rates (95% confidence interval) of antiretroviral antibodies among individual dairy cows in Ontario were: BIV 5.5% (4.0-7.0), BLV 25.7% (22.9-28.6), and BSV 39.6% (36.4-42.8). The following percentages of cows showed serological reactivity against the specified retroviruses: BIV 2.3%, BLV 14.0%, BSV 27.5%, BIV and BSV 1.3%, BIV and BLV 0.9%, BLV and BSV 9.9%, BIV and BLV and BSV 0.9%. These rates of sero-positivity are similar to those found in other countries. Serological test results were not adjusted for sensitivity and specificity. The prevalence rates of antibodies to the three retroviruses (BIV, BLV, and BSV) were significantly different, but no associations were observed between specific retroviral serological test results among individual cows. The prevalence rates of BIV and BSV seropositivity were constant across Ontario, whereas, there was a significant trend for the prevalence rate of BLV seropositivity to decrease going from southwestern to eastern Ontario; cows in eastern Ontario had approximately half the prevalence rate of those in southwestern Ontario. Cows that were seropositive for BSV were significantly older than BSV seronegative cows. There was no association between culling rate and BSV serology. Significant negative associations were found with winter or summer housing of calves separate from adults and summer outdoor exercise for dry cows. The use of calf hutches in the summer had a significant positive association with BSV seropositivity. Regression analyses were done to assess the association of retroviral (BIV, BLV, and BSV) seropositivity on calving interval, milk somatic cell count, and milk production. Serological test results for BIV, BLV, and BSV were entered into all models and all models were adjusted for intra-cluster (intraherd) correlation. Herd size and age were found to be important confounding variables.

In some clonal cell lines the expected short transcript initiated either from the 5' or 3' LTR tRNA-alpha rev gene was not detectable by Northern blot analyses of transduced, G418-resistant cells with an alpha rev-specific oligonucleotide probe. In other clonal cells, neither the short polymerase III transcript nor the full-length genomic polymerase II transcript (containing the 3' LTR tRNA-alpha rev gene) was detectable when compared with the transduced cell pool. Southern blot and DNA-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses specific for the tRNA-alpha rev cassette in the 5' or 3' LTR of the retroviral vector suggested that the transfer of the 3' LTR U3 region to the 5' LTR was incorrect in most proviruses. These data were confirmed by DNA sequence analyses of several clonal lines demonstrating deletions and insertions. In summary, our results indicate that this retroviral vector design with direct repeats flanking the polymerase III transcription unit plus the alpha rev insert is prone to genetic rearrangements and consequently not useful for the development of gene therapy protocols.","['Junker, U', 'Bohnlein, E', 'Veres, G']","['Junker U', 'Bohnlein E', 'Veres G']","['Progenesys, Department of Molecular Therapy, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Gene Products, rev)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Met)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase III)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA Polymerase III/genetics', 'DNA, Antisense/genetics', 'DNA, Recombinant/genetics', 'Gene Products, rev/*genetics', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'HIV Infections/therapy', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat/genetics', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Transfer, Met/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Sequence Deletion', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gene Ther. 1995 Nov;2(9):639-46.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ADA2 activity was significantly elevated in the sera of patients with the acute, lymphoma, and chronic types of ATL (P < 0.001) compared with that in patients with smoldering ATL and HTLV-1 carriers. In the case of patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, ADA1 and ADA2 activities in the sera of patients with AIDS and HIV-1 antibody-positive individuals were significantly (P < 0.001) higher than those in the sera of HIV-1 antibody-negative individuals.

These results suggest that the magnitude of elevation of ADA isoenzyme levels in serum correlates well with the clinical conditions of the patients with these diseases.

Multiparameter flow cytometry was used to evaluate apoptosis by measuring changes in both side scatter and propidium iodide staining. The appearance of apoptotic cells was confirmed biochemically by measuring DNA endonuclease activity by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay quantitation and DNA ladder formation on agarose gels and morphologically with the detection of micronuclei by confocal laser microscopy.

Temporary remissions marking LAK cell-driven graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) responses were observed in four of seven acute leukemia patients associated with unique self-limited graft-versus-host (GvH) reactions that were NK cell and cytokine related. Retinopathy not previously reported in a GvH setting was a consistent manifestation in these patients. Cure was achieved in an eighth patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia after she had been given effective chemotherapy, an active role for the adoptive therapy indicated by the occurrence of a week of fever suggesting an abortive GvH reaction. Two of five patients with Hodgkin's disease also experienced favorable responses to parental leukocyte therapy, one exhibiting GvH manifestations almost identical to those seen in the acute leukemia patients when given the adoptive therapy successfully to spur recovery from severe herpes zoster that had interrupted curative radiation therapy. The GvH in the other patient was a more typical one, the key effect being an increase in circulating lymphocytes that may have contributed indirectly to cure with subsequent therapy. These and other attempts to apply GvL responses therapeutically, including those currently in favor, exemplify the shortcomings of partial mitogenic responses to alloactivation, which are dependent on engraftment, limited in scope, excessively toxic, and difficult to control.

BSC collection by apheresis was well tolerated and associated with less morbidity for donors, probably reducing the cost of the treatment.

A 54% incidence of psychosocial morbidity (as assessed by either an abnormal HAD or PSE result) was found among those cases assessed both before and at least once after BMT. Significant psychosocial morbidity was still present 6-9 months following BMT. Cases scoring abnormally following BMT in general also scored abnormally before transplant, suggesting a predictive value of pre-BMT psychological assessment. Psychological morbidity was unrelated to the type of transplant. Patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia had a higher incidence of post-BMT psychosocial morbidity than patients with other diagnoses; it is suggested that this may be due to their lack of previous experience of intensive haematological therapy.

CASE SUMMARY: An elderly woman taking phenytoin for a stroke-associated seizure disorder had lymphocyte count of 28,800 x 10(6) cells/L. Speculating an unusual lymphadenopathic effect of the phenytoin therapy, carbamazepine therapy was substituted. After 15 weeks of carbamazepine treatment, the lymphocyte count declined to 3200 x 10(6) cells/L. Because of severe diarrhea, carbamazepine therapy was stopped and phenytoin therapy was reinstituted. At the end of 4 months of phenytoin treatment, the lymphocyte count had increased to 23,200 x 10(6) cells/L. Phenytoin therapy was discontinued and carbamazepine therapy was begun. The lymphocyte count decreased to 10,700 x 10(6) cells/L. Severe diarrhea recurred and phenytoin treatment was reinstituted. Over 12 days the lymphocyte count increased to 28,900 x 10(6) cells/L. Phenytoin therapy was stopped and valproic acid therapy was started. The lymphocyte count continued to increase during valproic acid therapy, reaching a peak of 114,300 x 10(6) cells/L. DISCUSSION: In this patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, carbamazepine therapy had a significant and reproducible lymphopenic effect that was readily reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. Unfortunately, this effect was associated with severe diarrhea, preventing further attempts at exploiting this potentially beneficial action. CONCLUSIONS: Carbamazepine had a reproducible suppressive effect on lymphocyte counts in an elderly patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This unique observation raises the possibility that carbamazepine therapy may have a useful effect in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Silverman, D A', 'Chapron, D J']","['Silverman DA', 'Chapron DJ']","['Hebrew Home and Hospital, West Hartford, CT, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Anticonvulsants)', '33CM23913M (Carbamazepine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Anticonvulsants/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Carbamazepine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*complications', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphopenia/blood/*chemically induced', 'Seizures/drug therapy']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/106002809502900906 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 1995 Sep;29(9):865-7. doi: 10.1177/106002809502900906.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NK cells represent a special lymphoid subset which displays its cytotoxic function without the engagement of MHC system. In order to investigate the role of different adhesion molecules in the mechanism of binding of the NK cell to the classic tumor target K562 cell, we have employed different unclustered mAbs of the Adhesion session (5th ""CD"" Workshop, Boston 1993) mostly of the CAM (cell adhesion molecule) subpanel. After their reactivity characterization both on lymphocytes and K562 cells, those that demonstrate reactivity against the tumor target were tested in the binding assay. The target was pretreated with the monoclonal in order to block a possible reacting molecule for the effector. Then, after the incubation of lymphocytes with PE-labelled anti CD16 mAb, their ability to bind to the target was tested in flow. While the majority of the mAbs did not induce any significant change in the binding capacity of the NK subset, few of them did, and precisely anti-CD58 (LFA-3) and anti-CD54 (ICAM-1) which showed different level of inhibition, particularly drastic with S002, S083 and S100. Other mAbs, such as the S011 (anti-CD59), due to the presence of the PI-linked glycoprotein recognized on both target and effector membranes, and to its capacity to stimulate NK activity, produced a total binding of the NK population. The coincubation of targets with anti-CD54 and anti-CD58 allowed to reduce at the lowest level this function. This data seem to support the hypothesis of specific surface molecules involved in the binding process of the NK cell, after recognition of the target.","['Papa, S', 'Gregorini, A', 'Pascucci, E', 'Bartolucci, M', 'Rocchi, M B', 'Valentini, M']","['Papa S', 'Gregorini A', 'Pascucci E', 'Bartolucci M', 'Rocchi MB', 'Valentini M']","['Istituto di Scienze Morfologiche, Universita di Urbino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Eur J Histochem,European journal of histochemistry : EJH,9207930,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*immunology', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Direct', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Histochem. 1994;38 Suppl 1:83-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We generated monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against the extracellular domain of TIE and a polyclonal antibody against the TIE carboxyterminus and used them to analyze expression of TIE in hematopoietic cells. Western blotting detected two forms of TIE protein with a molecular mass of 135 and 130 kD in hematopoietic and endothelial cells. Northern blotting analysis revealed that TIE was expressed preferentially in undifferentiated cell lines, especially when megakaryocytic, but not erythroid differentiation was induced. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that TIE was predominantly expressed in the human hematopoietic progenitor fraction, CD34+ cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) showed that 42% of CD34+ and 17% of KIT-positive (KIT+) cells were TIE-positive (TIE+). The majority (81%) of the primitive hematopoietic stem cells, CD34+CD38- cells, were TIE+. Assays of progenitor cells and long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) showed that the TIE+ fraction contained more primitive cells than the TIE- fraction. Some TIE+ cells were in the CD34- fraction, which were CD19+ and CD20+ (B cells). These findings indicate that TIE has a unique spectrum of expression in primitive hematopoietic stem cells and B cells. Although its ligand has not been identified, TIE and its ligand may establish a novel regulatory pathway not only in early hematopoiesis, but also in the differentiation and/or proliferation of B cells.","['Hashiyama, M', 'Iwama, A', 'Ohshiro, K', 'Kurozumi, K', 'Yasunaga, K', 'Shimizu, Y', 'Masuho, Y', 'Matsuda, I', 'Yamaguchi, N', 'Suda, T']","['Hashiyama M', 'Iwama A', 'Ohshiro K', 'Kurozumi K', 'Yasunaga K', 'Shimizu Y', 'Masuho Y', 'Matsuda I', 'Yamaguchi N', 'Suda T']","['Department of Cell Differentiation, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, TIE)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/enzymology/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, TIE', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66198-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jan 1;87(1):93-101.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although IL-3R activation may play a role in hematopoiesis and immunity, its aberrant expression or excessive stimulation may contribute to pathologic conditions such as leukemia, lymphoma, and allergic reactions. We describe here the generation and characterization of a monoclonal antibody (MoAb), 7G3, which specifically binds to the IL-3R alpha-chain and completely abolishes its function. MoAb 7G3 immunoprecipitated and recognized in Western blots the IL-3R alpha-chain expressed by transfected cells and bound to primary cells expressing IL-3R alpha. MoAb 7G3 bound the IL-3R alpha-chain with a kd of 900 pmol/L and inhibited 125I-IL-3 binding to high- and low-affinity receptors in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, IL-3 but not granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) inhibited 125I-7G3 binding to high- and low-affinity IL-3Rs, indicating that MoAb 7G3 and IL-3 bind to common or adjacent sites. In keeping with the inhibition of IL-3 binding, MoAb 7G3 antagonized IL-3 biologic activities, namely stimulation of TF-1 cell proliferation, basophil histamine release, and IL-6 and IL-8 secretion from human endothelial cells. Two other anti-IL-3R alpha-chain MoAbs failed to inhibit IL-3 binding or function. Epitope mapping experiments using truncated IL-3R alpha-chain mutants and IL-3R alpha/GM-CSFR alpha chimeras revealed that 31 amino acids in the N-terminus of IL-3R alpha were required for MoAb 7G3 binding. MoAb 7G3 may be of clinical significance for antagonizing IL-3 in pathologic conditions such as some myeloid leukemias, follicular B-cell lymphoma, and allergy. Furthermore, these results implicate the N-terminal domain of IL-3R alpha in IL-3 binding. Since this domain is unique to the IL-3/GM-CSF/IL-5 receptor subfamily, it may represent a novel and common binding feature in these receptors.","['Sun, Q', 'Woodcock, J M', 'Rapoport, A', 'Stomski, F C', 'Korpelainen, E I', 'Bagley, C J', 'Goodall, G J', 'Smith, W B', 'Gamble, J R', 'Vadas, M A', 'Lopez, A F']","['Sun Q', 'Woodcock JM', 'Rapoport A', 'Stomski FC', 'Korpelainen EI', 'Bagley CJ', 'Goodall GJ', 'Smith WB', 'Gamble JR', 'Vadas MA', 'Lopez AF']","['Division of Human Immunology, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, South Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Basophils/drug effects/metabolism', 'Binding, Competitive', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Endothelium, Vascular/drug effects', 'Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66197-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jan 1;87(1):83-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously documented that CMV exposure of bone marrow (BM) stromal cells reduces the capacity of these cells to support hematopoiesis because of a decreased production of colony-stimulating factors. This study examines the potential role of CMV on constitutive and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated production of cytokines involved in inflammatory reaction, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) by BM stromal cells. The release of IL-6 was already detectable 2 hours post CMV-infection (2.5-fold increase in production) and the cumulative production of IL-6 after 5 days of infection was 23 +/- 1.2 ng/mL (ninefold increase in production). CMV was also able to induce a time-dependent production of LIF that was maximal 8 hours after CMV infection (2.5-fold increase in production). Concomitantly, there was no detectable release of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) by CMV-infected stromal cells. The similar IL-6 and LIF production in the presence of polymyxin B ruled out the possibility that this increase could be caused by contamination of the viral stock by endotoxin. In addition, ultraviolet-inactivated virus behaved similarly to live virus and caused the release of IL-6 and LIF. However, heat-inactivated CMV was unable to induce IL-6 and LIF secretion by BM stromal cells. The production of IL-6 and LIF was also evaluated after stimulation by LPS. After 5 days of CMV exposure, the LPS-stimulated production of IL-6 and LIF was significantly lower than uninfected controls. This LPS-induced release of cytokine production was found to be dependent of viral replication. The experiments have shown that CMV is a potent inducer of IL-6 and LIF with differential effect on constitutive and LPS-stimulated cytokine production by stromal cells; we suggest that CMV induction of IL-6 and LIF during the first hours of infection could play a role in CMV-induced inflammatory reaction. Moreover, our results show that human CMV can disturb the balanced cytokine network involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis.","['Lagneaux, L', 'Delforge, A', 'Snoeck, R', 'Bosmans, E', 'Moreau, J F', 'Taupin, J L', 'De Clercq, E', 'Stryckmans, P', 'Bron, D']","['Lagneaux L', 'Delforge A', 'Snoeck R', 'Bosmans E', 'Moreau JF', 'Taupin JL', 'De Clercq E', 'Stryckmans P', 'Bron D']","[""Service de Medecine Interne et Laboratoire d'Investigation Clinique Henri Tagnon, Institut J.

The success of retrovirus gene therapy for hematopoietic diseases will be limited both by the efficiency of ex vivo transduction of target cells and by the ability of corrected cells to replace uncorrected cells in vivo. Using MFG-based retrovirus vectors containing oxidase genes, we have previously demonstrated in vitro correction of CGD, but transduction rates were low. In the present study we explore a strategy for providing a selective growth advantage to transduced cells, while retaining the single promoter feature of MFG responsible for high virus titer and enhanced protein production. We constructed a bicistronic retrovirus producing a single mRNA encoding both the therapeutic gene for the X-linked form of CGD (X-CGD), gp91phox, and the selectable human multidrug resistance gene, MDR1 linked together by the encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosome entry site (IRES). As a control we constructed a bicistronic vector with the polio virus IRES element and using the bacterial neomycin resistance gene (neor) as the selective element. In Epstein-Barr virus transformed B (EBV-B) cells from an X-CGD patient, a tissue culture model of CGD, we show correction of the CGD defect and complete normalization of the cell population using either of these vectors and appropriate selection (vincristine for MDR1 and G418 for neor). Using a chemiluminescence assay of O2-. production, populations of cells transduced with either vector demonstrated initial correction levels of from less than 0.1% up to 2.7% of normal EBV-B cell oxidase activity. With either construct, cell growth under appropriate selection enriched the population of transduced cells, resulting in correction of X-CGD EBV-B cells to a level of O2-. production equalling or exceeding that of normal EBV-B cells. These studies show that a therapeutic gene can be linked to a resistance gene by an IRES element, allowing for selective enrichment of cells expressing the therapeutic gene. Furthermore, the use of MDR1 as a selective element in our studies validates an important approach to gene therapy that could allow in vivo selection and is generalizable to a number of therapeutic settings.","['Sokolic, R A', 'Sekhsaria, S', 'Sugimoto, Y', 'Whiting-Theobald, N', 'Linton, G F', 'Li, F', 'Gottesman, M M', 'Malech, H L']","['Sokolic RA', 'Sekhsaria S', 'Sugimoto Y', 'Whiting-Theobald N', 'Linton GF', 'Li F', 'Gottesman MM', 'Malech HL']","['Laboratory of Host Defenses, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Gentamicins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'A08F5XTI6G (antibiotic G 418)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (CYBB protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.95 (Kanamycin Kinase)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Gentamicins/pharmacology', 'Granulomatous Disease, Chronic/classification/enzymology/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Kanamycin Kinase', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/deficiency/*genetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'NADPH Oxidase 2', '*NADPH Oxidases', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/genetics', 'Poliovirus/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Ribosomes/metabolism', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Vincristine/pharmacology', 'X Chromosome']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66192-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jan 1;87(1):42-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigates the potential of a human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) nonrestricted killer T-cell line (TALL-104) as a new marrow purging agent in a clinical setting. TALL-104 cells can be irradiated without losing cytotoxic activity against tumor targets in vitro. In vivo, the irradiated killers can be adoptively transferred into immunodeficient and immunocompetent leukemia-bearing mice, and reverse their disease even in advanced stages. The present study shows that gamma-irradiated TALL-104 cells, cultured for 18 hours with marrows from healthy donors, do not impair the viability and long-term growth of committed and pluripotent hematopoietic progenitors. However, as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and colony assays, TALL-104 cells could completely purge marrows containing up to 50% lysis-susceptible myelomonocytic leukemia cells (U937). When marrows were admixed with a pre-B leukemia cell line (ALL-1), which is fairly resistant to TALL-104 cell lysis in longterm 51Cr-release assays but can be totally growth inhibited by TALL-104 cells in proliferation assays, residual ALL-1 cells were detectable by PCR after TALL-104 purging. However, importantly, these PCR+ marrows were devoid of tumorigenic activity when transplanted into the human hematopoietic microenvironment of human severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) chimeras.

While every positive clone of 5'-RACE encoded the identical sequence of previously identified cDNA downstream from nucleotide 203, the upstream sequences were different. The upstream sequences corresponded to the sequence from nucleotide -279 to -308/-357 in erythroblasts and from -279 to -355/-383 in lung and were regarded as comprising a novel exon. This novel exon encoded seven residues initiated with a methionine, linked to nucleotide 203 in-frame and in agreement with the GT-AG splicing rule. The major erythroid transcriptional start position was identified in human erythroleukemia cells by primer extension and in bone marrow by ribonuclease protection analysis at 34 bases upstream from the first ATG codon. Distinctively, in lung and kidney, the transcription was started at 82 bases upstream from the ATG. Both Northern blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction followed by Southern analysis indicated a predominance of the novel spliced form of mRNA of about 50- to 200-fold comparing with the unspliced form, in every studied organ and erythroid lineage cells. The spliced form of cDNA has been transfected into a human erythroleukemic cell line, K562, and the expressed protein reacted with Duffy-specific murine monoclonal antibody Fy6. These studies indicate that the product from the spliced form of mRNA is the major product of the Duffy gene in the erythroid lineage and postcapillary venule endothelium.","['Iwamoto, S', 'Li, J', 'Omi, T', 'Ikemoto, S', 'Kajii, E']","['Iwamoto S', 'Li J', 'Omi T', 'Ikemoto S', 'Kajii E']","['Department of Legal Medicine and Human Genetics, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Duffy Blood-Group System)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Duffy Blood-Group System/*genetics', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*metabolism', 'Erythroblasts/*metabolism', 'Exons/genetics', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Kidney/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Lung/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organ Specificity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66229-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jan 1;87(1):378-85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are presumed to play a prominent role in innate host defenses. We examined defensin mRNA levels during drug-induced differentiation of the promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60. Transcription was restricted to promyelocyte, myelocyte, and very early metamyelocyte stages of the granulocytic pathway. Complete downregulation occurred during late granulocytic maturation or early during phorbol ester-promoted differentiation along the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Retinoic acid (RA) was the strongest inducer of defensin mRNA accumulation, even at doses too low to effect morphologic changes; the initial (first 48 hours), gradual increase resulted from transcriptional activation and was enhanced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. In contrast, addition of hybrid polar compounds led to a transient, drug-specific downregulation within the same time period, apparently by means of selectively induced, biphasic degradation of transcripts. Subsequent increase in transcript levels was faster and more pronounced with hexamethylene bisacetamide, relative to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). DMSO-promoted effects were strikingly different in serum-free medium or in the presence of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein. Under these conditions, and although differentiation was unaffected, early defensin mRNA downregulation was final. The effect did not occur with RA and expression of other myeloid-specific genes was also unchanged. Addition of selected cytokines caused a similar ""dip,"" only at earlier times and uncoupled from differentiation. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha markedly induced defensin levels after 2 days in previously untreated HL-60 cells, but inhibited expression in RA-differentiated cells. These results begin to detail a complex regulation of defensin mRNA synthesis with both spatial and temporal control elements, and a unique modulation by chemical agents, cytokines, and serum-factors.","['Herwig, S', 'Su, Q', 'Zhang, W', 'Ma, Y', 'Tempst, P']","['Herwig S', 'Su Q', 'Zhang W', 'Ma Y', 'Tempst P']","['Molecular Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, N.Y. 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Defensins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '8696NH0Y2X (Dimethylformamide)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers', 'Blood Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Defensins', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Dimethylformamide/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genistein', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Isoflavones/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66226-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jan 1;87(1):350-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The initial analysis using the YAC 964c10 (D12S736) revealed that all four cases with cytogenetically identified del(12p) had lost one copy of this YAC and that submicroscopic deletions had occurred in 10 of the 16 neoplasms with other 12p abnormalities, ie, translocations, additions, and insertions. The deletions were partially mapped with cosmids localized to subregions of 12p. One copy of the gene for p27kip1 (KIP1), involved in cell cycle entrance, was found to be lost in all cases in which deletions could be detected by other probes and in one case with a translocation as the only detectable change. This implicates KIP1 as a possible tumor suppressor gene affected by del(12p). Four translocations with no apparent concomitant deletions were detected. All four breakpoints resulted in a split D12S736 signal. In two of these cases, we showed that TEL was disrupted as a result of a t(5;12)(q32-33;p12) and a t(12;22)(p12;q12), respectively. Two lymphoid neoplasm--one non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and one Burkitt's lymphoma--with 12p amplifications were detected. In both cases cyclin D2 (CCND2) was within the amplified region. Thus, cytogenetic abnormalities of 12p in hematologic malignancies result in at least three different molecular changes: deletions of KIP1, amplifications of CCND2, and structural rearrangements of TEL.","['Hoglund, M', 'Johansson, B', 'Pedersen-Bjergaard, J', 'Marynen, P', 'Mitelman, F']","['Hoglund M', 'Johansson B', 'Pedersen-Bjergaard J', 'Marynen P', 'Mitelman F']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aneuploidy', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Yeast', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/*ultrastructure', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Female', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', '*Oncogenes', '*Translocation, Genetic', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66223-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jan 1;87(1):324-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the high proportion of Latinos in this center, we questioned if APL is more common in this ethnic group. The proportion of APL among the 80 AML patients of Latino origin was significantly higher (30; 37.5%) when compared with the 62 non-Latinos (4; 6.5%) (P = .00001). In an attempt to verify this finding on a larger group of patients, we analyzed 276 pathologically verified cases of AML in patients aged 30 to 69 years from the entire County of Los Angeles, registered on an ongoing population-based epidemiologic study of AML. APL was more frequent among the 47 Latinos (24.3%) than in the 229 non-Latinos (8.3%) (P = .0075). APL is seen in younger patients with AML, but Latino AML patients also had a higher frequency of APL after accounting for their younger age (age-adjusted odds ratio for APL among Latinos in LAC-USC Medical Center, 9.4 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.9, 30] P = .0002; among Latinos in the population-based study, 3.0 [95% CI 1.3 to 6.9] P = .01). The different ethnic distribution of AML was found to be due to a higher proportion of APL cases per se, and not to a lower proportion of any other French-American-British subtype (P = .0004). These results, from two different populations of AML patients, indicate that Latinos with AML have a higher likelihood of the APL subtype of disease, which may suggest a genetic predisposition to APL and/or exposure to distinct environmental factor(s).","['Douer, D', 'Preston-Martin, S', 'Chang, E', 'Nichols, P W', 'Watkins, K J', 'Levine, A M']","['Douer D', 'Preston-Martin S', 'Chang E', 'Nichols PW', 'Watkins KJ', 'Levine AM']","['Department of Medicine, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Central America/ethnology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Susceptibility/ethnology', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', '*Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*ethnology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*ethnology', 'Los Angeles/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Odds Ratio', 'South America/ethnology', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'United States/epidemiology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66221-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jan 1;87(1):308-13.,,,"['Blood. 1996 Jul 1;88(1):377.

Using biochemical modulation strategies to increase the accumulation of ara-CTP in leukemia blasts, a clinical protocol was designed combining 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (CdA), an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, and ara-C for adults with AML. The protocol stipulated an infusion of 1 g/m2 of ara-C over 2 hours on day 1. A continuous infusion of CdA (12 mg/m2/d) begun 24 hours later and continued for 5 days. Identical doses of ara-C were administered on days 3, 4, 5, and 6. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between CdA and ara-C during therapy were investigated. To complement these studies, molecular actions of the triphosphate of ara-C and CdA on DNA extension by human DNA polymerase alpha in an in vitro model system was conducted. In the circulating leukemia blasts of 7 of the 9 patients studied, ara-CTP pharmacokinetics showed a median 40% increase in the rate of ara-CTP accumulation after 24 hours of CdA infusion. The ex vivo effect of CdA on accumulation of ara-CTP in AML blasts was similar to that during therapy except that the enhancement was less. The DNA synthetic capacity of the circulating blasts was inhibited to a greater extent by administration of CdA and ara-C in combination than by either one alone. Additionally the lowered level of DNA synthesis was maintained until the next infusion of ara-C. Endogenous levels of deoxynucleotides increased 24 hours after ara-C infusion. Administration of CdA in general lowered the concentrations of all dNTPs. DNA pol alpha incorporated CdATP and ara-CTP with high affinity in a DNA primer extending over an oligonucleotide template of defined sequence. Human DNA polymerase alpha extended DNA primers terminated by CdA monophosphate (CdAMP) at its 3'-end by incorporating ara-C monophosphate (ara-CMP). The tandem incorporation of CdAMP and ara-CMP resulted in nearly complete inhibition of DNA primer extension. The insertion of two analogs in sequence, inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase, and the metabolic potentiation of ara-CTP by CdA infusion may be responsible for sustained inhibition of DNA synthesis in the circulating leukemia blasts during therapy with this combination regimen.","['Gandhi, V', 'Estey, E', 'Keating, M J', 'Chucrallah, A', 'Plunkett, W']","['Gandhi V', 'Estey E', 'Keating MJ', 'Chucrallah A', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (cladribine triphosphate)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Biotransformation/drug effects', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Prodrugs/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Salvage Therapy']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66215-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jan 1;87(1):256-64.,"['CA32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether hematopoietic cells have receptors that recognize bFGF, the ability of human leukemia cell lines to bind 125I-bFGF was investigated. Specific bFGF-binding sites were identified on K562 and HL60 cells, but not on U937 cells. DAMI cells bound low amounts of 125I-bFGF specifically. Binding of 125I-bFGF to K562 cell surfaces was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by unlabeled bFGF or by heparin. Scatchard analysis of binding to K562 cells revealed two classes of binding sites: 1,650 high affinity binding sites per cell with a dissociation constant (kd) of 192 pmol/L, and 36,600 low affinity sites per cell with a kd of 9.3 nmol/L. Chemical crosslinking experiments with K562, HL60, and DAMI cells revealed receptor-growth factor complexes with molecular masses of 140 to 160 kD, similar in size to complexes formed by known receptor species. Binding of 125I-bFGF to K562 cells was sensitive to heparinase treatment but not to chondroitinase treatment, suggesting that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) may be responsible for the low affinity binding sites. To further investigate whether K562 cells make HSPG, the incorporation of 35SO4 into proteoglycans was assessed. Metabolically labeled cell-surface proteoglycans with molecular masses of 180 to 300 kD were identified in K562 cells. These proteoglycans were sensitive to heparinase, demonstrating that K562 cells synthesize bFGF-binding HSPG. Treatment of K562 cells with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) caused a loss of bFGF-binding capacity. This decreased binding capacity reflected a rapid loss of high affinity receptors. The ability to form bFGF-receptor complexes decreased by 65% to 70% within 1 hour and declined continuously thereafter. The decrease in binding of bFGF was not due to an autocrine downregulation of bFGF receptors, because there was no increase in bFGF after PMA treatment as detected by Western blotting, and suramin, which blocks bFGF binding to receptors, did not prevent the loss of receptors after exposure to PMA. In addition, inhibitors of either protein synthesis or protease activity did not prevent the loss of bFGF receptors in PMA-treated cells. In summary, this work demonstrates that leukemia cell lines have receptors that specifically bind bFGF and supports the hypothesis that bFGF acts directly on certain blood cells to stimulate their proliferation.","['Liuzzo, J P', 'Moscatelli, D']","['Liuzzo JP', 'Moscatelli D']","['Department of Cell Biology, New York University Medical Center, New York 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', '9050-30-0 (Heparitin Sulfate)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'CHO Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/pathology', 'Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans', 'Heparin/pharmacology', 'Heparitin Sulfate/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Proteoglycans/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/classification/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66214-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jan 1;87(1):245-55.,"['CA34289/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T35 DK07421/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

An RAR alpha-selective ligand used with an RXR-selective ligand generated the same responses as did all-trans RA or 9-cis RA, which affect both families of receptors, suggesting an important role for RAR alpha among RAR subtypes in eliciting cellular response.

The coupling of the shift of RB to its hypophosphorylated form with G1/0 arrest and differentiation in response to ligands is consistent with a possible role of RB as a downstream target or effector of RAR alpha and RXR in combination.","['Brooks, S C 3rd', 'Kazmer, S', 'Levin, A A', 'Yen, A']","['Brooks SC 3rd', 'Kazmer S', 'Levin AA', 'Yen A']","['Department of Pathology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Chromans)', '0 (Cyclohexanes)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pentanoic Acids)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Ro 25-5802)', '0 (Ro 25-6603)', '0 (Tetrahydronaphthalenes)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '102121-60-8 (Am 580)', '144092-31-9 (Ro 41-5253)', '146670-37-3 (SR 11234)', '146670-40-8 (SR 11237)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '71441-28-6', '(4-(2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propenyl)benzoic', 'acid)']",IM,"['*Benzoates/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chromans/pharmacology', 'Cyclohexanes/pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Pentanoic Acids/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*drug effects/physiology', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Retinoids/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tetrahydronaphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*drug effects/physiology', 'Tretinoin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66212-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jan 1;87(1):227-37.,['ES 07052/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before treatment, the predominant immature bone marrow cells were found to have t(15;17), whereas the residual mature granulocytes were diploid and lacked evidence of the translocation. In response to RA treatment, an increase in the leukocyte count was noted. The majority of these cells exhibited a t(15;17). Subsequently (eg, between days 6 and 23), 32% to 91% of the maturing myeloid cells still exhibited t(15;17). The appearance of t(15;17) in gradually maturing elements suggests that RA contributed to a release of the maturation block of the leukemic elements. As responding patients obtained complete remission, diploid elements without evidence of the translocation prevailed in the blood and bone marrow. In 16 patients studied after 1 month in complete remission, all but 2 showed all diploid cells. The residual t(15;17) cells disappeared 18 days later in 1 patient, whereas the second patient exhibited clinical evidence of relapse 20 days later. These results suggest that response of patients with APL to RA is associated with maturation, subsequent loss of the mature leukemic elements, and preferential regeneration of normal diploid hematopoietic elements.","['Vyas, R C', 'Frankel, S R', 'Agbor, P', 'Miller, W H Jr', 'Warrell, R P Jr', 'Hittelman, W N']","['Vyas RC', 'Frankel SR', 'Agbor P', 'Miller WH Jr', 'Warrell RP Jr', 'Hittelman WN']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Blood Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/ultrastructure', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Diploidy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Immunologic Factors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis/genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1996/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66211-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jan 1;87(1):218-26.,"['CA-27931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-57645/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA-55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of these cells with 10 nmol/L phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 3 days caused a complete inhibition of proliferation and a threefold increase in the surface expression of glycoprotein (GP) IIIa, a marker of megakaryocytic differentiation that forms part of the fibrinogen receptor complex, GPIIb/IIIa. A similar effect was observed with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, but not with the biologically inactive derivative PMA-4-O-methyl ether. The PMA-induced increase in GPIIIa expression was completely inhibited by GF109203X in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 0.5 mumol/L), with a maximal effect at 2.5 to 5.0 mumol/L. GF109203X also blocked the inhibitory effect of PMA on cell growth and inhibited PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of the 47-kD PKC substrate, pleckstrin. Incubation of HEL cells with 25 mumol/L hemin for 3 days caused a fourfold to fivefold increase in expression of the erythroid differentiation marker, glycophorin A. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of GF109203X on GPIIIa expression, hemin induction of glycophorin A was enhanced by this compound. Furthermore, GF109203X alone caused a dose-dependent increase in glycophorin A expression, and induced hemoglobinization. Consistent with these changes, Northern blot analysis revealed that GF109203X treatment reduced the steady-state level of GPIIb mRNA and increased those for glycophorin A and gamma-globin. These results suggest that PKC may act as a developmental switch controlling erythroid/megakaryocytic differentiation.","['Hong, Y', 'Martin, J F', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Erusalimsky, J D']","['Hong Y', 'Martin JF', 'Vainchenker W', 'Erusalimsky JD']","[""Department of Medicine, King's College School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (platelet protein P47)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', '57716-89-9 (4-O-methyl-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'L79H6N0V6C (bisindolylmaleimide I)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Aphidicolin/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Globins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Glycophorins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Maleimides/*pharmacology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/pharmacology', '*Phosphoproteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66201-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jan 1;87(1):123-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SCL codes for a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factor that can function as a transcriptional activator or repressor. In the adult, SCL expression is restricted to hematopoietic cells and tissues, but its function in the process of lineage commitment is unknown. The present study was designed to address the role of SCL in hematopoietic cell differentiation. SCL expression was determined in primary hematopoietic cells through the screening of cDNA samples obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from single cells at different stages of differentiation. SCL RNA expression was highest in bipotential and committed erythroid precursors and diminished with subsequent maturation to proerythroblasts and normoblasts. In contrast, SCL mRNA was low to undetectable in precursors of granulocytes and monocytes and their maturing progeny. The same pattern of expression was observed after erythroid or monocytic differentiation of a bipotent cell line, TF-1, in that SCL mRNA levels remained elevated during erythroid differentiation and were downregulated with monocytic differentiation. Accordingly, TF-1 was chosen as a model to investigate the functional significance of this divergent pattern of SCL expression in the two lineages. Four independent clones stably transfected with an SCL expression vector exhibited enhanced spontaneous and delta-aminolevulinic acid-induced erythroid differentiation as measured by glycophorin expression and hemoglobinization, consistent with the view that SCL is a positive regulator of erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, constitutive SCL expression interfered with monocytic differentiation, as assessed by the generation of adherent cells and the expression of Fc gamma RII in response to TPA. These results suggest that the downregulation of SCL may be required for monocytic differentiation.","['Hoang, T', 'Paradis, E', 'Brady, G', 'Billia, F', 'Nakahara, K', 'Iscove, N N', 'Kirsch, I R']","['Hoang T', 'Paradis E', 'Brady G', 'Billia F', 'Nakahara K', 'Iscove NN', 'Kirsch IR']","['Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Department of Pharmacology, University of Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aminolevulinic Acid/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', '*Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66199-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jan 1;87(1):102-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Significant increases have been found in other situations of rural population mixing as predicted by the infection hypothesis. The 1950s and 1960s were of most interest since it preceded the decline in mortality brought about by effective chemotherapy in many countries. The 33 countries covered were all those in the World Health Organization's mortality database. No sensitive measure of rural-urban migration is available for international comparisons. However, it seems noteworthy that Greece and Italy, the two countries with the most striking levels of rural migration in the 1950s and 1960s, also had unusually high mortality rates from childhood leukemia. Greece was most affected proportionally by these population movements and from 1958 to 1972 had the highest recorded mortality from this cause in the world. The problems of international comparisons of mortality data dictate caution in drawing conclusions. However, against a background of other work on population mixing, and in the light of certain considerations, we suggest that the marked rural population mixing in Greece and Italy may have contributed to their high mortality rates from childhood leukemia in the 1950s and 1960s.","['Kinlen, L J', 'Petridou, E']","['Kinlen LJ', 'Petridou E']","['Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Infirmary, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Greece/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Male', '*Population Dynamics', 'Rural Population', 'Survival Rate', 'United States/epidemiology']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00052185 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 1995 Sep;6(5):445-50. doi: 10.1007/BF00052185.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These act directly through receptors expressed on the embryo. In addition, embryos also produce growth factors. The reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to determine the pattern of expression of mRNAs encoding several growth factor ligand and receptor genes throughout preimplantation development of cryopreserved human embryos. Transcripts encoding the receptor for c-fms, the receptor for colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), and c-kit (the receptor for stem cell factor [SCF]) were expressed throughout preimplantation development. Other growth factor ligand and receptor transcripts were expressed in a stage-specific manner: these included receptors for interleukin (IL)-6 (IL-6R), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIFR), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) (TNFRp80 and TNFRp60), and gp130. The transcripts for gp130 and the ligand SCF showed stage-specific splice variants. Blastocysts expressed a novel cDNA encoding gp130, which predicts a truncated form lacking the intracellular signaling domain. No expression of mRNAs encoding LIF, CSF-1, or the cloned receptor for platelet-activating factor was seen in any embryonic stage studied. We have shown that RT-PCR provides a sensitive and powerful method for identifying transcripts encoding growth factors and their receptors in single human embryos. The method is economical, allowing the expression pattern of many genes to be determined from a single embryo. These data are important in defining which cytokines may be involved in regulating human preimplantation development and when they may act.","['Sharkey, A M', 'Dellow, K', 'Blayney, M', 'Macnamee, M', 'Charnock-Jones, S', 'Smith, S K']","['Sharkey AM', 'Dellow K', 'Blayney M', 'Macnamee M', 'Charnock-Jones S', 'Smith SK']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Cambridge, Rosie Maternity Hospital, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blastocyst/metabolism', 'Culture Techniques', 'Cytokines/*genetics', '*Embryonic Development', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Morula/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics', 'Stem Cell Factor/chemistry/genetics', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics', 'Zygote/*metabolism']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1095/biolreprod53.4.974 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Reprod. 1995 Oct;53(4):974-81. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod53.4.974.,,,,"['GENBANK/S80479', 'GENBANK/S80491']",,,,,,,,,,

Resistance related to alterations in the drug targets or apoptotic pathways is not discussed. Until recently multidrug resistance was associated almost exclusively with p-glycoprotein (Pgp)-overexpression. However, other non-Pgp-related mechanisms have been tracked down. It has been shown that transfection of the gene that encodes a novel drug transport protein, the multidrug resistance protein, induces cross-resistance for many multidrug resistance drugs as well as active transport of daunorubicin from tumor cells. Surprisingly, it has also been found that multidrug resistance protein mediates transport of negatively charged species that are not classic multidrug resistance drugs, such as leukotriene C4 and other glutathione conjugates as well as negatively charged dyes. It was therefore suggested that multidrug resistance protein is identical with the multispecific organic anion transporter. The transport rate of several positively charged drugs (vincristine, rhodamine-123, daunorubicin) by multidrug resistance protein appeared to be dependent on the cellular glutathione levels. Multidrug resistance protein seems to be constitutively expressed in normal tissues at a low level with few tissues having higher expression. Multidrug resistance protein overexpression in in vitro-selected MDR cell lines occurs relatively frequently in lung cancer and leukemia cell lines and often precedes Pgp overexpression. Differential expression has been demonstrated in tumor samples, which suggests a role in resistance to chemotherapy in at least certain tumor types. Modulation studies of multidrug resistance protein activity are still scarce. Other non-Pgp, non-multidrug resistance protein multidrug resistance mechanisms probably exist but have not been identified at the molecular level as yet.","['Broxterman, H J', 'Giaccone, G', 'Lankelma, J']","['Broxterman HJ', 'Giaccone G', 'Lankelma J']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Academisch Ziekenhuis Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001622-199511000-00011 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 1995 Nov;7(6):532-40. doi: 10.1097/00001622-199511000-00011.,,78,,,,,,,,,,,,

A systematic study was therefore initiated, employing a large quantity of HL60 cells (> or = 1200 mL packed) and human leukocytes (approximately 100 mL packed). Gangliosides were extracted, followed by extensive fractionation and examination of the E- and P-selectin binding ability of each fraction. The following results were of particular interest: (i) Only monosialogangliosides having a polylactosamine core with > 10 monosaccharide units (or > 4 N-acetyllactosamine units) showed E-selectin binding under static conditions with thin-layer chromatography overlay technique employing 32P-labeled E-selectin-expressing CHO cells. (ii) Sulfate groups were not detectable in the binding fractions, and di- and trisialoganglioside fractions did not show E-selectin binding under these conditions. (iii) None of the fractions showed P-selectin binding under a similar assay system using 32P-labeled P-selectin-expressing CHO cells.

Pharmacol, 45: 1207-1214, 1994] that also has antitumor effects in vivo. To determine whether inhibition of PKC can be related to inhibition of cell growth with induction of apoptosis, we compared the effects of UCN-01 to those of the highly selective bisindolylmaleimide PKC antagonist GF 109203X in leukemic T-cell lines. Both compounds potently inhibited PKC activity when added to T-cell membrane preparations and reversed phorbol ester-induced c-fos gene expression in intact cells. However, whereas UCN-01 potently inhibited growth of Jurkat, Molt-3, Molt-4, and Hut-78 cells (IC50 = 20-65 nM, irreversible after 24 h of exposure), GF 109203X had IC50s for cell growth of 3.6-5.0 muM. Less than 3 h after addition, UCN-01 but not GF 109203X-treated cells displayed loss of cells with G2-M DNA content, appearance of a hypodiploid DNA fraction, and evidence of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Six h after treatment, cells appeared to accumulate with S-phase DNA content. These effects correlated with selective UCN-01 but not GF 109203X-induced decrease in total and tyrosine phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) 1 and 2, and with increases in the histone H1 kinase activities of cdk1 and cdk2. UCN-01 was relatively less potent in inhibition of properly activated cdk1 and cdk2 when added in vitro to H1 kinase assays (IC50 = 1000 and 600 nM, respectively). We conclude that inhibition of PKC alone is not sufficient to account for the actions of UCN-01 and are led to the hypothesis that inappropriate cdk activation either correlates with or actually mediates cell growth inhibition with apoptosis in T lymphoblasts exposed to UCN-01.","['Wang, Q', 'Worland, P J', 'Clark, J L', 'Carlson, B A', 'Sausville, E A']","['Wang Q', 'Worland PJ', 'Clark JL', 'Carlson BA', 'Sausville EA']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, Division of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Maleimides)', '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'L79H6N0V6C (bisindolylmaleimide I)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/agonists', '*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*agonists', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/blood/enzymology', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/agonists', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives', 'Stem Cells/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1995 Aug;6(8):927-36.,,,,,,,,,,['Cell Growth Differ 1995 Oct;6(10):1339'],,,,

Glandular steroid metabolism was for a long time believed to dominate the estrogenic milieu around any cell of the organism. Recent reports verified the expression of estrogen receptors in ""non-target"" tissues as well as the extraglandular expression of steroid metabolizing enzymes. Extraglandular steroid metabolism proved to be important in the brain, skin and in stromal cells of hormone responsive tumors. Aromatase converts testosterone into estradiol and androstenedione into estrone, thereby activating estrogen precursors. The group of 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases catalyzes the oxidation and/or reduction of the forementioned compounds, e.g. estradiol/estrone, thereby either activating or inactivating estradiol. Aromatase is expressed and regulated in the human THP 1 myeloid leukemia cell line after vitamin D/GMCSF-propagated differentiation. Aromatase expression is stimulated by dexamethasone, phorbolesters and granulocyte/macrophage stimulating factor (GMCSF). Exons I.2 and I.4 are expressed in PMA-stimulated cells only, exon I.3 in both PMA- and dexamethasone-stimulated cells. Vitamin D-differentiated THP 1 cells produce a net excess of estradiol in culture supernatants, if testosterone is given as aromatase substrate. In contrast, the 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 4 (17 beta-HSD 4) is abundantly expressed in unstimulated THP 1 cells and is further stimulated by glucocorticoids (2-fold). The expression is unchanged after vitamin D/GMCSF-propagated differentiation. 17 beta-HSD 4 expression is not altered by phorbolester treatment in undifferentiated cells but is abolished after vitamin D-propagated differentiation along with downregulation of beta-actin. Protein kinase C activation therefore appears to dissociate the expression of aromatase and 17 beta-HSD 4 in this differentiation stage along the monocyte/phagocyte pathway of THP 1 myeloid cells. The expression of steroid metabolizing enzymes in myeloid cells is able to create a microenvironment which is uncoupled from dominating systemic estrogens. These findings may be relevant in the autocrine, paracrine or iuxtacrine cellular crosstalk of myeloid cells in their respective states of terminal differentiation, e.g. in bone metabolism and inflammation.","['Jakob, F', 'Homann, D', 'Adamski, J']","['Jakob F', 'Homann D', 'Adamski J']","['Medizinische Poliklinik, University of Wurzburg Rontgenring 11, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,9015483,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 1.1.1.62 (Estradiol Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Aromatase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Aromatase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Estradiol Dehydrogenases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0960-0760(95)00206-5 [doi]'],ppublish,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 1995 Dec;55(5-6):555-63. doi: 10.1016/0960-0760(95)00206-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B-origin ALLs were characterized by the lack of the RO isoform along with the consistent presence of RA. Conversely, a differential expression of the two isoforms was detected in different subsets of T-origin ALL, in that T-stem cell leukaemias (T-SCL: CD7+, CD4-, CD8-, CD1-) preferentially expressed CD45RA whereas conventional T-acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (T-ALL: CD7+, CD4+ and/or CD8+ and/or CD1+) were consistently marked by CD45RO. Within myeloid malignancies, most of AMLs displayed CD45RA, while a substantial group of CML-BP-my preferentially exhibited CD45RO. As a general rule, a reciprocal exclusion of the two isoforms was observed in AML as well as in ALL. Nevertheless, a frequent coexpression of CD45RA and CD45RO was observed in CD14+ AML. In vitro treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) was able to promote a switch from CD45RA to CD45RO expression in 27 de novo AML, independently from morphological subtyping. To our knowledge, this is the first report on CD45 isoform expression in a large series of patients with acute leukaemia. The knowledge of the differential expression of CD45RA and CD45RO can ameliorate our classificative approach to haematological malignancies, as well as disclose new multiple overlap points between normal and leukaemic cell differentiation.","['Schiavone, E M', 'Lo Pardo, C', 'Di Noto, R', 'Manzo, C', 'Ferrara, F', 'Vacca, C', 'Del Vecchio, L']","['Schiavone EM', 'Lo Pardo C', 'Di Noto R', 'Manzo C', 'Ferrara F', 'Vacca C', 'Del Vecchio L']","['Servizio di Immunoematologia, Laboratorio di Immunocitologia, Napoli, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Isomerism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*immunology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05407.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1995 Dec;91(4):899-906. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05407.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FISH on metaphases identified the t(15;17) in all cases who were positive for the PML/RAR alpha transcript by RT-PCR. Conventional cytogenetics revealed the t(15;17) in only 68% of cases. However, it enabled the detection of additional chromosome changes in five cases, three of whom were M3v. 11 patients were also investigated during complete remission (CR) by both FISH and RT-PCR, in order to evaluate residual disease; the duration of CR at the time of analysis ranged between 1 and 16 months, with three patients being studied twice. Comparison of RT-PCR and FISH results showed a very good correlation. In fact, of the 10 samples which were RT-PCR positive for residual disease, all were also recognized by interphase FISH, and eight were positive by metaphase FISH. Of the three samples negative at RT-PCR, all were also negative at the interphase FISH. The results of this study indicate that: (a) the t(15;17) is present in all cases positive for the PML/RAR alpha rearrangement, thus in virtually all true APLs; (b) standard cytogenetics, capable of unravelling the t(15;17) in only 68% of cases, enables recognition of additional chromosome changes of potential clinical and prognostic significance; (c) FISH on interphase nuclei is a reliable tool for the monitoring of residual disease, with a sensitivity greater than that of FISH on metaphase cells and superimposable to that of RT-PCR.","['Mancini, M', 'Nanni, M', 'Cedrone, M', 'Diverio, D', 'Avvisati, G', 'Riccioni, R', 'De Cuia, M R', 'Fenu, S', 'Alimena, G']","['Mancini M', 'Nanni M', 'Cedrone M', 'Diverio D', 'Avvisati G', 'Riccioni R', 'De Cuia MR', 'Fenu S', 'Alimena G']","['Department of Human Biopathology, University of Rome La Sapienza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05404.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1995 Dec;91(4):878-84. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05404.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied primary samples of 100 patients with lymphoid leukaemias [B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), n = 23; T-ALL, n = 7; B-cell chronic lymphocytic (B-CLL) or prolymphocytic (B-PLL) leukaemia, n = 50; T-CLL/T-PLL, n = 20] using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with eight overlapping cosmid clones covering the region on chromosome band 9p21 containing CDKN2. We did not observe any CDKN2 deletions in the 70 patients with chronic lymphoid leukaemias of B- or T-cell origin. Of the 23 patients with B-lineage ALL, one (4%) exhibited a CDKN2 deletion: in this patient, two clones were detected, one exhibiting a hemizygous and the other a homozygous deletion. On chromosome banding analysis, four patients with B-lineage ALL had a 9p aberration, whereas all CDKN2 copies were retained. In contrast, six of the seven (86%) patients with T-ALL exhibited CDKN2 deletions (homozygous, n = 4; hemizygous, n = 2). We conclude that hemizygous or homozygous deletions of the CDKN2 gene occur at high frequency in T-ALL and at low frequency in B-lineage ALL, supporting the role of this gene as a tumour suppressor, especially in T-ALL.

We have conducted 161 analyses of remission bone marrow aspirates (BMs) in 13 children with hyperdiploid ALL. Slides were analysed blind and in parallel to 35 control samples. Control BMs showed very low numbers of trisomic cells (mean +/- 2 x SD = 0.13 +/- 0.34%). MRD was detected in 5/13 cases of ALL investigated while on chemotherapy.

Since cell death following exposure to ionizing radiation and many chemotherapeutic agents can occur by the apoptotic pathway, inhibition of apoptosis would be expected to confer a relative resistance to these treatments. Similarly, cells deprived of growth factors in vitro die by apoptosis, and inhibition of apoptosis would therefore be expected to allow cells to survive better in growth factor-deprived conditions. We found that the survival of normal and CML myeloid progenitors was the same after in vitro incubation in deprived conditions and after treatment with X-irradiation or glucocorticoids. We also found that mature cells in colonies produced by CML progenitors (CFU-GM) did not survive better than those produced by normal progenitor cells. Flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells provided a direct indication that the degree of apoptosis may correspond to the degree of deprivation.

Blasts from CD34+ AML patients expressed significantly higher levels of bcl-2 (mean MESF 43.6 x 10(3), n = 36) than CD34- AML patients (mean MESF 31.7 x 10(3), n = 19). In five cases of CD34+ AML, bcl-2 expression was determined on purified CD34+ and CD34- blast cell populations. In all cases CD34+ blasts were found to express significantly higher bcl-2 MESF values compared to the CD34- fraction. Purified CD34+ cells from normal bone marrow consistently expressed high levels of bcl-2 (MESF > 75 x 10(3), n = 4), which was comparable to that found on CD34+ AML cells. Our results suggest that the poor prognosis previously associated with AML blasts expressing the CD34 antigen may in part be related to high expression of bcl-2. Also the ability to measure bcl-2 in AML blasts quantitatively by flow cytometry and to categorize patients into discrete groups may be of value as a prognostic indicator in AML.","['Bradbury, D A', 'Russell, N H']","['Bradbury DA', 'Russell NH']","['Department of Haematology, City Hospital, Nottingham.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05306.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1995 Oct;91(2):374-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05306.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RT-PCR of immunoglobulin genes gave evidence of monoclonal rearrangement of the IgM type. Our tests showed that IL-2 was produced when leukaemic B cells were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate, ionomycin and lipopolysaccharide. In addition, transfections with the full IL-2 promoter or elements thereof revealed that IL-2 expression is inducible and mediated through the NF-kB-promoter element. Finally, the amount of IL-2 secreted by these cells is about 39 ng/ml/10(6) cells, which is remarkably high for non-T cells. These results suggest that the large amounts of polyclonal IgG seen in this case of B-CLL are secreted by normal B cells which are in turn stimulated by IL-2 produced by proliferating monoclonal (leukaemic) B cells.

For this paper we have studied the constitutive expression of IL-11 mRNA in a panel of wellknown leukaemic cell lines and samples from AML patients at diagnosis. Moreover, the same cellular populations were evaluated for their proliferative response to recombinant-human-(r-hu). IL-11 alone and combined with r-hu-IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and stem cell factor (SCF, c-kit ligand). The colony-forming ability of HL60, K562, KG1 cells and eight fresh AML cell populations was assessed by a clonogenic assay in methylcellulose. In eight additional AML cases the number of S-phase leukaemic cells induced by IL-11 was determined by the bromodeoxyuridine (BRDU) incorporation assay after 3d of liquid culture. IL-11, as single cytokine, did not stimulate the colony formation of the three myeloid cell lines under serum-containing and serum-free conditions. In contrast, the proliferation of the leukaemic cells in response to IL-3, GM-CSF and SCF was enhanced by co-incubation with IL-11, and this effect was reversed in blocking experiments by the anti-IL-11 Moab. When tested on primary AML samples, IL-11 alone showed little, if any, proliferative activity. However, it increased the IL-3-dependent blast colony formation in eight out of eight cases and GM-CSF in seven cases. IL-11 also augmented synergistically the number of CFU-L stimulated by SCF in seven cases. A combination of three factors (IL-11, SCF and IL-3) yielded optimal colony formation. The BRDU studies showed the significant increase of AML cells in S-phase when IL-11 was combined with SCF, whereas the two CSF had no activity on their own. Positive interaction was also observed when IL-11 was added to IL-3 supplemented cultures in five out of eight cases tested. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification (RT-PCR) demonstrated the constitutive expression of IL-11 mRNA in all the cell lines and 11/12 AML samples studied at diagnosis. These results indicate that IL-11 is expressed in leukaemic myeloid cells and that their proliferation is regulated by the cytokine which acts as a synergistic factor.","['Lemoli, R M', 'Fogli, M', 'Fortuna, A', 'Amabile, M', 'Zucchini, P', 'Grande, A', 'Martinelli, G', 'Visani, G', 'Ferrari, S', 'Tura, S']","['Lemoli RM', 'Fogli M', 'Fortuna A', 'Amabile M', 'Zucchini P', 'Grande A', 'Martinelli G', 'Visani G', 'Ferrari S', 'Tura S']","['Institute of Haematology, University of Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'S Phase/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05296.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1995 Oct;91(2):319-26. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05296.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these is decay-accelerating factor (DAF), CD55, a 70kD glycosylated protein which functions to protect host cells from damage by autologous C'. We hypothesized that blockade of DAF function by a monoclonal antibody (mAb) could augment C'-dependent lysis mediated by another mAb to a cell surface antigen expressed on leukaemia cells. Thus, we tested the effects of the anti-DAF mAb 1C6 on the ability of both rabbit and human C' to lyse human leukaemia cells through activation by complement-fixing murine mAb. DAF antigen was highly expressed on most leukaemia cell lines and primary acute leukaemia blast cells tested. Murine mAb to CD15 (PM-81) and to gp 120 (AML-1-99), both IgM, also bound to the majority of myeloid and lymphoid leukaemia cells. Using human serum as a source of C', the addition of mAb 1C6 reduced by an additional 85-94% the numbers of clonogenic HL-60 (myeloid leukaemia) cells lysed by mAb PM-81 alone. Similarly, the addition of mAb 1C6 reduced by an additional 87% the numbers of HL-60 colonies eliminated by mAb AML-1-99 alone. Similar results were observed in an experimental purging model using the myeloid leukaemia cell lines HL-60, U937 or NB4 cells as targets. These results show that mAb 1C6 can effectively block the actions of DAF. In the presence of mAb 1C6, the cytotoxic activity mediated by human C' was similar to that of rabbit C'. These results show that increased tumour cell killing can be achieved through DAF blockade. This finding has relevance to clinical trials using C'-fixing mAb for purging bone marrow of occult tumour cells prior to autologous transplantation.","['Zhong, R K', 'Kozii, R', 'Ball, E D']","['Zhong RK', 'Kozii R', 'Ball ED']","['Division of Hematology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, PA 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD55 Antigens)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'CD55 Antigens/immunology/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Complement System Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/therapy', 'Rabbits', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05289.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1995 Oct;91(2):269-74. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb05289.x.,['CA31888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now demonstrate that the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (OKA) can mimic the effect of DPH by selectively enhancing cytotoxicity of vinblastine (VBL), but not taxol and doxorubicin, in human leukaemia HL-60 cells. Both DPH and OKA potentiate the anti-mitotic effects of VBL by enhanced damage to the mitotic spindle, resulting in prolonged growth arrest. Also, unlike VBL alone, in human leukaemia or non-small-cell lung carcinoma cells treated with VBL plus DPH, recovery from damage to the mitotic spindle is compromised in drug-free medium and cell death by apoptosis in interphase ensues. Since protein phosphatases are involved with the regulation of metaphase to anaphase transit of cells during the mitotic cycle, enhanced VBL cytotoxicity in the presence of DPH or OKA may involve effects during metaphase on the mitotic spindle tubulin leading to growth arrest and apoptosis in interphase. These novel results suggest that DPH or OKA could be powerful tools to study cellular effects of vinca alkaloids and possibly for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.","['Kawamura, K I', 'Grabowski, D', 'Weizer, K', 'Bukowski, R', 'Ganapathi, R']","['Kawamura KI', 'Grabowski D', 'Weizer K', 'Bukowski R', 'Ganapathi R']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Anticonvulsants)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '6158TKW0C5 (Phenytoin)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Anticonvulsants/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Ethers, Cyclic/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Phenytoin/pharmacology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Spindle Apparatus/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vinblastine/*pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1996.33 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1996 Jan;73(2):183-8. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1996.33.,['R01 CA35531/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,PMC2074306,,,,,,,,

Fourteen hybrids, chosen at random, were analysed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and by binding studies involving the monoclonal antibody MRK16, which recognises an external P-gp epitope. Only two hybrids were positive for both MRK16 antibody labelling and mdr1 mRNA. Partial karyotypic analysis of all hybrids revealed that only the MRK16-positive hybrids contained the duplication in chromosome 7 seen in the CEM/A7 parental MDR line.

MDA435/LCC6 cells grow as both malignant ascites and solid tumours in vivo in nude mice and nude rats, with a tumour incidence of approximately 100%. Untreated mice develop ascites following i.p. inoculation of 1 x 10(6) cells and have a reproducible life span of approximately 30 days, with all animals dying within a 48 h period. The in vivo response of MDA435/LCC6 ascites to several cytotoxic drugs, including doxorubicin, etoposide (VP-16), BCNU and mitomycin C, closely reflects the activity of these single agents in previously untreated breast cancer patients. MDA435/LCC6 cells also retain the anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent in vitro growth properties of the parental MDA-MB-435 cells, and can be used in standard in vitro drug screening assays. The drug resistance pattern of the MDA435/LCC6 cells suggests that they may have few active endogenous drug resistance mechanisms. To generate a model for the screening of MDR1-reversing agents, MDA435/LCC6 were transduced with a retroviral vector directing the constitutive expression of the MDR1 cDNA, producing a cell line with a classical MDR1 resistance pattern (MDA435/LCC6MDR1). THese ascites models may be a viable alternative to the murine leukaemia ascites (L1210, P388) and, in conjunction with other breast cancer cell lines, facilitate the in vitro and in vivo screening of new cytotoxic drugs and drug combinations.","['Leonessa, F', 'Green, D', 'Licht, T', 'Wright, A', 'Wingate-Legette, K', 'Lippman, J', 'Gottesman, M M', 'Clarke, R']","['Leonessa F', 'Green D', 'Licht T', 'Wright A', 'Wingate-Legette K', 'Lippman J', 'Gottesman MM', 'Clarke R']","['Vincent T.

Conditioning chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide alone in 231 patients, cyclophosphamide and etoposide or melphalan in 53 patients, and 21 patients were conditioned with cytosine arabinoside and melphalan. Bone-marrow transplantation was autologous in 197 patients, and allogeneic in 108 patients. RESULTS: Thirty (10%) of the 305 patients experienced VOD. In univariate analyses, its incidence was not influenced by instantaneous dose rate (9.6% [10/104] in < or = 4.80 cGy/min group vs. 10% [20/201] in > 4.80 cGy/min group; p = 0.91), fractionation (11% [19/176] in single-dose total-body irradiation vs. 8.5% [11/129] in fractionated total-body irradiation, p = 0.64), age (9% [21/241] in < or = 40-year old-patients vs. 14% [9/64] in > 40-year-old patients, p = 0.29), sex (6% [7/113] in male patients vs. 12% [23/192] in female patients, p = 0.15), type of VOD prevention (16% [16/101] in patients using heparin vs. 10% [14/142] in those receiving dinoprostone and pentoxifylline combination, p = 0.23), type of bone-marrow transplantation (9% [10/108] in allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation group vs. 10% [20/197] in autologous bone-marrow transplantation group, p = 0.96), or type of acute leukemia (9.6% [13/135] in ALL vs. 10% [17/170] in ANLL, p = 0.93). However, VOD incidence was significantly lower in patients whose conditioning chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide alone (6.5% [15/231] vs. 20% [15/74] by other drugs +/- cyclophosphamide, p < 0.0001), and in patients treated after 1985 (7% [16/226] vs. 18% [14/79] in those treated before 1985, p = 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the best independent factors influencing the occurrence of VOD were the male sex (p = 0.03), conditioning chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide alone (p = 0.01), and bone-marrow transplantation after 1985 (p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: In our series of 305 acute leukemia patients treated with allogenic or autologous bone-marrow transplantation, total-body irradiation technique (fractionation or instantaneous dose rate) did not seem to influence the incidence of VOD.","['Belkacemi, Y', 'Ozsahin, M', 'Rio, B', 'Laporte, J P', 'Leblond, V', 'Pene, F', 'Laugier, A']","['Belkacemi Y', 'Ozsahin M', 'Rio B', 'Laporte JP', 'Leblond V', 'Pene F', 'Laugier A']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Hopital Tenon, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

This selective update includes aspects of AL in DS in which a change or advancement in our understanding of this disease has occurred. Despite previous reports describing a worse outcome for these individuals, more recent studies have suggested an improved response to current treatment strategies (including high-dose AraC) equaling, or even surpassing, the survival of non-DS individuals with AL. An increased toxicity to methotrexate in DS patients has also been recognized. While the leukemia of DS infants has been described as megakaryoblastic, the spectrum of in vitro differentiation is much broader including (in addition to megakaryocytic colonies) various myeloid, macrophage, and even erythroid colonies. Although the cause(s) of DS-AL remains unknown, potential candidate genes include those encoded on chromosome 21 that play a role in other defined leukemias in non-DS individuals. The AML1/PEBP2alpha gene maps to the DS critical region and is characteristically associated with two leukemia-associated chromosomal translocations: 1) the 8;21 translocation involving an AML1/ETO fusion transcript commonly seen in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and; 2) a 3;21 translocation identified in certain chemotherapy-related myelodysplasias/leukemias and occasionally in the blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. Similarly, the ETS-related gene, ERG, involved in the AML 16;21 maps to the q22 region of chromosome 21. Lastly, a familial platelet disorder with a propensity to develop myeloid leukemia has been linked to 21q22.1-22.2 and conceivably might involve AML1, ERG or yet another gene.","['Drabkin, H A', 'Erickson, P']","['Drabkin HA', 'Erickson P']","['Division of Medical Oncology, University of Colorado Cancer Center, Denver 80262, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/genetics', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology/therapy', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1995;393:169-76.,['P01HDO17449/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],14,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to determine whether chemoattractants in these organs promote organ-specific metastasis, we utilized human cell lines derived from and/or related to these organs as sources of potential chemoattractants. Secretory proteins derived from the cell lines MG-63 (osteosarcoma), SK-ES-1 (Ewing's sarcoma), and KG-1 (leukemia) stimulated chemomigration of the TSU-pr1 prostate tumor cells in a dose-dependent manner in Boyden chambers. In addition, secretory proteins from a human prostatic stromal cell line (hPS) and from the TSU-Pr1 prostate tumor cell line were also able to stimulate chemomigration of the TSU-pr1 cells through Boyden chambers. Since lymph nodes and bony sites represent organs of hematopoietic/lymphoid proliferation and activation, we undertook identification of specific cytokines present at these sites which may promote the chemomigration of prostate tumor cells. In this context, the cytokines interleukin-1 alpha, interleukin-2, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-beta, transforming growth factor-beta, interferon alpha 2-a, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor did not stimulate chemomigration of the TSU-pr1 prostate tumor cell line. In contrast, the cytokine epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulated chemomigration of the TSU-pr1 prostate tumor cells through the Boyden chambers in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot analysis of secretory proteins from the cell lines KG-1, SK-ES-1, MG-63, hPS, and TSU-pr1 identified EGF-immunoreactive proteins in all cases. In addition, EGF immunoreactivity was localized to the stroma of the human prostate, the osteogenic stroma of pelvic medullary bone, and the stroma within the capsule and trabeculae of pelvic lymph nodes. Hence, these results demonstrate that the cytokine EGF promotes the chemomigration of the TSU-pr1 prostate tumor cell line, and that EGF within the stroma of pelvic lymph nodes and medullary bone may act as a chemoattractant for prostate tumor cells, thereby facilitating the preferential formation of metastatic foci within these organs.","['Rajan, R', 'Vanderslice, R', 'Kapur, S', 'Lynch, J', 'Thompson, R', 'Djakiew, D']","['Rajan R', 'Vanderslice R', 'Kapur S', 'Lynch J', 'Thompson R', 'Djakiew D']","['Department of Surgery, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC 20007, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Prostate,The Prostate,8101368,"['0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Bone Neoplasms/chemistry/pathology/*secondary', 'Bone and Bones/*chemistry/cytology', '*Chemotactic Factors/analysis/pharmacology/physiology', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Cytokines/analysis/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Epidermal Growth Factor/analysis/pharmacology/physiology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Lymph Nodes/*chemistry/cytology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis/*pathology', 'Male', 'Pelvis', 'Prostate/chemistry/cytology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/chemistry/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0045(199601)28:1<1::AID-PROS1>3.0.CO;2-L [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0045(199601)28:1<1::AID-PROS1>3.0.CO;2-L [doi]']",ppublish,Prostate. 1996 Jan;28(1):1-9. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0045(199601)28:1<1::AID-PROS1>3.0.CO;2-L.,"['DK02233/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK46051/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK47508/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The human AML1 gene encodes several related proteins that specifically bind to the sequence TGT/cGGT, located in the promoter regions of a variety of hematopoietic growth factor genes. To examine the abilities of the AML1B protein (which contains 479 amino acids), a shorter AML1A isoform (which contains amino acids 1-250), and the AML1/ETO fusion protein (which contains AML1A amino acids 1-177) to stimulate transcription from the GM-CSF promoter, we performed co-transfection experiments in T cells using a human GM-CSF promoter-CAT reporter gene plasmid and expression vectors that contain the cDNAs for one of the above proteins. Our data demonstrate that AML1B, but not AML1A or AML1/ETO transactivates the GM-CSF promoter, requiring the TGTGGT sequence contained between base pairs -68 and -53. Furthermore, we show that AML1/ETO, but not AML1A, inhibits the ability of AML1B to stimulate CAT expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated the specific binding of AML1 proteins to the GM-CSF promoter TGTGGT sequence, which does not require GM-CSF sequences immediately upstream of this binding site. Our data support a role for AML1B as a transcriptional activator and establish that the AML1/ETO fusion protein can act as a dominant negative protein on the human GM-CSF promoter. Although AML1/ETO does not stimulate the transcription of GM-CSF, it may function by inhibiting the normal activity of AML1B in AML cells with the t(8;21) translocation.","['Frank, R', 'Zhang, J', 'Uchida, H', 'Meyers, S', 'Hiebert, S W', 'Nimer, S D']","['Frank R', 'Zhang J', 'Uchida H', 'Meyers S', 'Hiebert SW', 'Nimer SD']","['Laboratory of Molecular Aspects of Hematopoiesis, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', '*Transcriptional Activation']",1995/12/21 00:00,1995/12/21 00:01,['1995/12/21 00:00'],"['1995/12/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/21 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/21 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1995 Dec 21;11(12):2667-74.,"['CA09512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA64140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK43025/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, in the t(15;17) translocation of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), PML fusion to the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) is the likely molecular basis of leukaemogenesis. Here we show that interferons (IFNs) alpha, beta, and gamma upregulate PML mRNA expression. Analysis of 5' genomic sequences of the PML gene revealed an IFN-alpha/-beta stimulated response element (ISRE) and an IFN-gamma activation site (GAS) in the untranslated first exon. Binding of IFN signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) was demonstrated to be weak for the PML GAS, but strong for the PML ISRE which also seemed to contribute substantially to the IFN-gamma response. Thus, PML is a primary target gene of IFNs and would appear as a suitable candidate for mediating some of their antiproliferative effects. Abnormalities of PML structure, localisation or expression in human malignancy, constitute examples of how an IFN target gene may be altered in oncogenesis.","['Stadler, M', 'Chelbi-Alix, M K', 'Koken, M H', 'Venturini, L', 'Lee, C', 'Saib, A', 'Quignon, F', 'Pelicano, L', 'Guillemin, M C', 'Schindler, C']","['Stadler M', 'Chelbi-Alix MK', 'Koken MH', 'Venturini L', 'Lee C', 'Saib A', 'Quignon F', 'Pelicano L', 'Guillemin MC', 'Schindler C', 'et al.']","['Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Propre de Recherche A0043, Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1995/12/21 00:00,1995/12/21 00:01,['1995/12/21 00:00'],"['1995/12/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/21 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/21 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1995 Dec 21;11(12):2565-73.,['HL21006-19/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,['GENBANK/X91752'],,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we assessed the cardiopulmonary status and exercise capacity of 19 patients (pts; 9M:10F) 1.1 to 7.1 years (mean 4.6 +/- 1.5 years) after successful treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with Dana Farber Cancer Institute protocols. As body mass and nutritional status may influence exercise capacity, we also evaluated their anthropometric status and the plasma levels of rapid turnover proteins. Seven pts designated as ""standard risk for relapse"" (SR) had received low cumulative doses of doxorubicin (50 +/- 21 mg/m2), while twelve pts at ""high or very high risk for relapse"" (HR/VHR) had received higher doses (349 +/- 16 mg/m2). The evaluations included a questionnaire, anthropometric assessments, echocardiography, pulmonary function studies, exercise testing, and nutritional assays. Patients' data were compared with published normative data or with control values from our laboratories. In addition, we compared SR pt data with HR/VHR pt data. No pt had overt symptoms or signs of cardiorespiratory compromise. The pts had a higher percent of body fat than age-matched healthy controls (29.7 +/- 7.9% vs. 20 +/- 6%; P < 0.001). On echocardiography, cardiac systolic function was within normal limits in all. However, HR/VHR pts had lower left ventricular (LV) shortening fractions than SR pts (P < 0.05). LV filling velocity, indicative of diastolic function (the E/A ratio), was normal in most pts. Pulmonary function studies were normal. Exercise capacity was below predicted in most cases but heart rates at peak exercise and leg muscle function were within normal limits, suggesting a deconditioned state. Plasma levels of rapid turnover proteins were also normal. Despite lack of overt morbidity in our pt population, subtle abnormalities persist in cardiac function while pulmonary function is normal. Longitudinal studies will identify if further abnormalities or overt morbidity develop. In later years, continuing obesity and a sedentary state may contribute to clinically relevant heart disease.","['Turner-Gomes, S O', 'Lands, L C', 'Halton, J', 'Hanning, R M', 'Heigenhauser, G J', 'Pai, M', 'Barr, R']","['Turner-Gomes SO', 'Lands LC', 'Halton J', 'Hanning RM', 'Heigenhauser GJ', 'Pai M', 'Barr R']","['Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Anthropometry', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', '*Cardiovascular Physiological Phenomena', 'Cardiovascular System/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Exercise Test', 'Female', 'Heart Function Tests', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nutritional Status', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Respiratory Function Tests', '*Respiratory Physiological Phenomena', 'Respiratory System/drug effects']",1996/03/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199603)26:3<160::AID-MPO3>3.0.CO;2-I [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199603)26:3<160::AID-MPO3>3.0.CO;2-I [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1996 Mar;26(3):160-5. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199603)26:3<160::AID-MPO3>3.0.CO;2-I.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Written into these guidelines is the requirement that information be submitted on mutagenic activity. Although regulatory agencies accept mutagenicity data from both the hprt and tk loci in mammalian cells, many studies suggest that the L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay at the thymidine kinase locus is likely to detect a greater spectrum of mutagenic lesions. Thus, there is increasing emphasis being placed on this assay in many proposed and published guidelines. The L5178Y mouse lymphoma suspension protocol produces both small and large colonies which are the products of mutants growing at different rates. There is a reduction in the proportion of slowly growing mutants with respect to the total population of cells when expression is carried out in suspension. This potentially leads to quantitatively inaccurate assessments of the mutagenic activity of chemicals. Therefore an in situ procedure was developed that more accurately assesses the mutagenic activity of chemicals by maximizing the detection of small colonies. Many guidelines recommend tests that assess the clastogenic activity of chemicals. Some regulatory agencies accept data from the mouse lymphoma mutation assay to detect clastogens if the protocol is optimized for the detection of small colonies or if colony sizing data are submitted. The conventional suspension assay protocol is not sufficiently validated for this purpose. The in situ protocol has greater potential to meet these requirements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Combes, R D', 'Stopper, H', 'Caspary, W J']","['Combes RD', 'Stopper H', 'Caspary WJ']","['Fund for the Replacement of Animals in Medical Experiments (FRAME), Nottingham, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,"['EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'RMW9V5RW38 (Trifluridine)']",IM,"['Aneuploidy', 'Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Size', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Guidelines as Topic', 'Leukemia L5178/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Micronucleus Tests/standards', 'Mutagenicity Tests/*standards', 'Mutation', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Trifluridine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects', '*Tumor Stem Cell Assay/standards', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/mutage/10.5.403 [doi]'],ppublish,Mutagenesis. 1995 Sep;10(5):403-8. doi: 10.1093/mutage/10.5.403.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A panel of murine mAbs raised against HUVEC included one (Moon-1) constantly blocking the CD38-mediated adhesion of several cell lines to HUVEC. Tissue distribution studies and an extended immunohistochemical analysis on the majority of normal human tissues revealed that the Moon-1 molecule displays a unique pattern of expression, being present at high levels on resting and activated vascular endothelium, on the majority of monocytes, platelets, NK cells, and to a lesser extent on T, B, and myeloid cells. The Moon-1 structure of an apparent molecular mass of 120 kDa proved to be a ligand for human CD38, as inferred by the direct binding observed when using a chimeric mouse CD8 alpha-human CD38 (mCD8 alpha-hCD38) molecule as a probe in Western blot experiments. Furthermore, Ab-induced modulation experiments highlighted an association between the Moon-1 molecule and human CD38 on the surface of cell lines coexpressing the two structures, which also share a common regulation system of surface expression.

HOON, G2, and NALM-6 cell lines express similar levels of mRNA for TGF-beta 1 and for TGF-beta receptor I (R-I) and receptor II (R-II). HOON cells express ten times more endoglin than G2 and NALM-6 cells, whereas all three cell lines have low levels of betaglycan relative to other cell types. The receptors were identified by affinity labeling with 125I-labeled TGF-beta 1, chemical cross-linking, and specific immunoprecipitation. Endoglin, R-II, and R-I were co-precipitated by Abs to either endoglin or R-II, indicating that these proteins are forming a receptor complex on leukemic cells; no betaglycan could be immunoprecipitated. The receptor complex is functional, as demonstrated by inhibition of proliferation of HOON cells (80%) and NALM-6 cells (60%) with 25 pM TGF-beta 1. Furthermore, the motility of HOON and NALM-6 cells on immobilized fibronectin, which appears to be alpha 4 beta 1-integrin mediated, was stimulated two- to threefold by TGF-beta 1. These results suggest that active TGF-beta 1 produced in the bone marrow microenvironment might stimulate the motility of normal pre-B cells and the peripheral dissemination of leukemic pre-B cells.","['Zhang, H', 'Shaw, A R', 'Mak, A', 'Letarte, M']","['Zhang H', 'Shaw AR', 'Mak A', 'Letarte M']","['Division of Immunology and Cancer Research, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (ENG protein, human)', '0 (Endoglin)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '145170-29-2 (betaglycan)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Activin Receptors, Type I)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type I)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II)']",IM,"['*Activin Receptors, Type I', 'Antigens, CD', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Endoglin', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*chemistry/genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/biosynthesis/*chemistry/genetics', 'Proteoglycans/biosynthesis/*chemistry/genetics', 'Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type I', 'Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/biosynthesis/*chemistry/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics']",1996/01/15 00:00,1996/01/15 00:01,['1996/01/15 00:00'],"['1996/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Jan 15;156(2):564-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pim-1 gene encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase that is expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic lineage and is implicated in the intracellular signaling processes accompanying lymphocyte activation. We show here that pim-1 mRNA expression is rapidly induced after receptor cross-linking with anti-CD3 Abs. We examined the linkage of pim-1 expression to known signaling pathways generated through the T cell Ag receptor. pim-1 mRNA was not substantially induced after elevation of intracellular free Ca2+. In contrast, PMA, which directly activates PKC, induced rapid pim-1 expression. Further, anti-CD3- or PMA-induced pim-1 expression was markedly reduced by various PKC inhibitors and by deficiency of the PKC epsilon isoform in a mutant T cell line. Thus, T cell Ag receptor-linked pim-1 expression appears to be coupled to the PKC component of transmembrane signaling. Because the activation of protein kinase C has been shown to activate Raf-1 kinase activity, the involvement of Raf-1 in pim-1 expression was also investigated using a human T cell line stably transfected with an inducible Raf expression vector. Although the overexpression of activated Raf was shown to cause a substantial increase in IL-2 expression, no discernible effects on pim-1 were apparent. In addition, we examined transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in PKC-mediated pim-1 expression and observed that both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms are coordinately involved in the up-regulation of the pim-1 proto-oncogene.","['Wingett, D', 'Long, A', 'Kelleher, D', 'Magnuson, N S']","['Wingett D', 'Long A', 'Kelleher D', 'Magnuson NS']","['Department of Veterans Affairs, Boise, ID 83702, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Muromonab-CD3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Induction/physiology', 'Humans', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*physiology', 'Muromonab-CD3/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Sezary Syndrome/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Skin Neoplasms/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/15 00:00,1996/01/15 00:01,['1996/01/15 00:00'],"['1996/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Jan 15;156(2):549-57.,"['T32-AI07025/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibitor studies demonstrated that receptor-initiated activation of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases, phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase C-gamma 1, and activation of protein kinase C occur temporally and precede PKA-I activation. Bypass of both the TCR/CD3 complex and IL-1R and direct activation of protein kinase C by a phorbol ester can also activate PKA-I. To confirm that PKA-I activation via the TCR/CD3 complex and IL-1R requires antecedent protein tyrosine kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma 1, we used wild-type and CD45-deficient (mutant J45.01) Jurkat T cell lines. Unlike wild-type Jurkat T cells, the absence of CD45 tyrosine phosphatase resulted in the failure of receptor-mediated activation of PKA-I activity and of IL-2 mRNA transcription in the mutant J45.01 Jurkat cell line. In conclusion, our data support the concept that a signal derived from ligand binding to both the TCR/CD3 complex and IL-1R receptor mediates rapid activation of the PKA-I isozyme in primary T lymphocytes by sequential activation of an intracellular pathway comprised of CD45 phosphatase/protein tyrosine kinase/polyphosphoinositide/Ca2+/protein kinase C pathway rather than via the conventional surface receptor/stimulatory G protein system.","['Laxminarayana, D', 'Kammer, G M']","['Laxminarayana D', 'Kammer GM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Muromonab-CD3)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)', ""23645-17-2 (adenosine-3',5'-cyclic phosphorothioate)"", '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Benzoquinones', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Cyclic AMP/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/physiology', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/physiology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Muromonab-CD3/pharmacology', 'Phospholipase C gamma', 'Phospholipid Ethers/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Quinones/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*enzymology/immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/physiology']",1996/01/15 00:00,1996/01/15 00:01,['1996/01/15 00:00'],"['1996/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Jan 15;156(2):497-506.,['AR-39501/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surprisingly, when the homologous costimulator molecule B7-2 was substituted for B7-1 in this system, no specific CTL activity was obtained. Similarly, B7-1- but not B7-2-transfected P815 cells generated alloantigen-specific CTL activity from C57BL/6, accessory cell- and CD4(+)-depleted splenocytes, and costimulated proliferation of CD8+ lymphocytes in the presence of low doses of anti-CD3 mAb. In all systems, combined expression of both B7-1 and B7-2 costimulated as effectively as B7-1 alone, arguing against delivery of a dominant negative signal by B7-2. Proliferation of allogeneic, CD4(+)-depleted splenocytes in response to P815 cells, which relies on costimulation by normal accessory cells, was inhibited by anti-B7-1 but not anti-B7-2 mAbs. Finally, indirect evidence suggested a higher avidity of B7-1+ cells than B7-2+ cells for CTLA4.

Murine CD30, although homologous to human CD30, has a 90 amino acid gap in an extracellular region that appears to be duplicated in human CD30. Murine CD30 cDNA was shown to be functional through the production of a soluble murine Ig fusion protein (CD30-Ig) that was active in binding to cells that expressed CD30 ligand. CD30-Ig also served as an immunogen for the production of hamster anti-mouse CD30 mAbs, which recognized both CD30 expressed by murine lymphocytes and CD30 expressed by cells transfected with murine CD30 cDNA. CD30 mRNA is highly expressed in the thymus and in activated spleen cells, but not in other tissues tested. In anti-CD3-activated spleen cells, CD30 ligand is expressed primarily by CD4+ T cells, with peak expression at days 1 and 2, whereas CD30 is expressed primarily by CD8+ T cells, with peak expression on days 4 and 5. Stimulation of CD30 by plate-bound anti-CD30 directly signaled for IL-5 but not IFN-gamma production by CD30+ CTL lines.

A recent sib-pair analysis revealed a tight linkage between markers on 5q31.1 and a major susceptibility gene controlling total serum IgE levels. Due to its location within this cluster and its biologic role in Ig class switching and Th2 cell differentiation, the IL-4 gene has emerged as one major candidate for the atopy gene. In one model, polymorphisms within IL-4 regulatory elements might result in overexpression of the gene, amplifying Th2 cell differentiation and class switching to IgE. In support of this model, we report that the human IL-4 promoter exists in multiple allelic forms that exhibit distinct transcriptional activities in IL-4-positive T cells. A particular allele has an unusually high transcriptional activity. A nucleotide substitution within a recently described OAP40 element located just upstream of an NF-AT site (P sequence) appears to be largely responsible for the increased promotor strength of this particular allelic form of the IL-4 promoter. In EMSAs, this substitution results in a markedly enhanced affinity for sequence-specific complexes exhibiting an AP-1 specificity. The identification of allelic nucleotides, which results in overexpression of the IL-4 gene, provides specific targets for a comprehensive screening of atopic and nonatopic individuals and may provide a clue for genetic predisposition for atopy.","['Song, Z', 'Casolaro, V', 'Chen, R', 'Georas, S N', 'Monos, D', 'Ono, S J']","['Song Z', 'Casolaro V', 'Chen R', 'Georas SN', 'Monos D', 'Ono SJ']","['Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Disease Susceptibility/immunology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity, Immediate/*genetics/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin E/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Th2 Cells/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/15 00:00,1996/01/15 00:01,['1996/01/15 00:00'],"['1996/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Jan 15;156(2):424-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A serial immunoprecipitation with both antibodies further ascertained the FcR gamma association with Fc alpha R alpha. The lysates precleared with anti-FcR gamma antibody were subjected to the second immunoprecipitation with an anti-Fc alpha R alpha monoclonal antibody. By this preclearance, FcR gamma disappeared, and the Fc alpha R alpha appeared to be significantly decreased on SDS-PAGE, suggesting that a part of Fc alpha R alpha was co-absorbed with FcR gamma. Therefore, it may be likely that Fc alpha R is expressed in two forms, namely, with or without FcR gamma. We next reconstituted the Fc alpha R alpha-FcR gamma association by introducing both chains into host cells. The expression of Fc alpha R alpha was achieved by introducing Fc alpha R alpha alone, and the cointroduction of FcR gamma did not enhance Fc alpha R alpha expression on the cell surface, suggesting again the occurrence of the two forms of FC alpha R.","['Saito, K', 'Suzuki, K', 'Matsuda, H', 'Okumura, K', 'Ra, C']","['Saito K', 'Suzuki K', 'Matsuda H', 'Okumura K', 'Ra C']","['Department of Immunology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,"['0 (IgA receptor)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/pathology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Fc/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgG/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['a68338 [pii]', '10.1016/s0091-6749(95)70200-8 [doi]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 1995 Dec;96(6 Pt 2):1152-60. doi: 10.1016/s0091-6749(95)70200-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using these anti-hGMR alpha antibodies in combination with antibodies against IL-3 receptor-alpha (IL-3R alpha), beta c subunits, and c-kit, we examined expression patterns and modulation of these receptor subunits on several human hematopoietic cells, including CD34+ cells and leukemic cell lines. GMR alpha and IL-3R alpha were expressed on GM-CSF- and IL-3-responsive cell lines, such as TF-1 and UT-7, whereas the expression levels were much lower on UT-7E, a GM-CSF- and IL-3-unresponsive subline of UT-7. The GMR alpha subunit was expressed only on mature granulocytes and monocytes, and IL-3R alpha was expressed on monocytes but not on mature granulocytes, and none of these subunits were expressed on lymphocytes. For CD34+ cells, GMR alpha was expressed more abundantly on CD34+ CD33high cells than on CD34+ CD33low cells, whereas IL-3R alpha was expressed more abundantly on CD34+ CD33low cells than on CD34+ CD33high and CD34+ CD33neg cells. Slight but significant expression of the beta c subunit was detected on CD34+ cells. Expression of not only GMR alpha and IL-3R alpha subunits but also c-kit was specifically downregulated by 48-hour incubation with their respective ligands. Receptor transmodulation between GM-CSF, IL-3, and stem cell factor (or kit ligand) was not detected on CD34+ cells in 48-hour cultures. We also detected upregulation of these alpha subunits by IL-1 alpha and interferon-gamma on leukemic cell lines. Our study showed expression levels for each receptor subunit--including GMR, IL-3R, and c-kit on human bone marrow and peripheral blood cells and leukemic cell lines--and revealed differential regulation of the expression of the receptor subunits.","['Kurata, H', 'Arai, T', 'Yokota, T', 'Arai, K']","['Kurata H', 'Arai T', 'Yokota T', 'Arai K']","['Department of Molecular and Developmental Biology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/analysis/biosynthesis/blood', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['a68344 [pii]', '10.1016/s0091-6749(95)70194-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 1995 Dec;96(6 Pt 2):1083-99. doi: 10.1016/s0091-6749(95)70194-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to describe the clinical, histopathologic, and immunologic features in three patients with ATL involving the skin. METHODS: Clinical histories and skin biopsy specimens were reviewed. Immunophenotypic studies were performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes (three patients) and on skin biopsy specimens (one patient). RESULTS: Serologic testing in each patient was positive for HTLV-I. Specific cutaneous lesions of ATL were diverse. Histologic features included markedly epidermotropic lymphoid infiltrates and dermal aggregates of lymphocytes and macrophages resembling granulomas. One patient died 3 months after diagnosis; the other two are alive with residual lymphoma. CONCLUSION: A spectrum of clinical, histologic, and immunophenotypic features are seen in ATL involving skin. Those cases with a chronic course may resemble mycosis fungoides clinically and histologically. Serologic testing for HTLV-I is recommended in all patients with cutaneous lymphoma from endemic areas and in those with other risk factors for HTLV-I infection.","['DiCaudo, D J', 'Perniciaro, C', 'Worrell, J T', 'White, J W Jr', 'Cockerell, C J']","['DiCaudo DJ', 'Perniciaro C', 'Worrell JT', 'White JW Jr', 'Cockerell CJ']","['Department of Dermatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin Neoplasms/immunology/*pathology']",1996/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0190-9622(96)90836-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0190-9622(96)90836-1 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 1996 Jan;34(1):69-76. doi: 10.1016/s0190-9622(96)90836-1.,,,"['J Am Acad Dermatol. 1997 Jan;36(1):133-4.

A further eight isolates that had been recovered from the faeces of patients on the renal unit on neomycin agar were also studied. Eleven of the 14 isolates from the patients with leukaemia showed equal recovery on neomycin agar and blood agar and had MICs > 64 mg/l. In three other isolates there was a 4log10 reduction in recovery on neomycin agar and the MIC was 8 mg/l. Two of the non-selected isolates from the renal unit were recovered equally on the two media, the other 11 isolates showed a 4-5 log10 reduction in recovery.

Childhood Leukaemia Working Party of the United Kingdom Medical Research Council.,1051-3,"AIMS: Children in a United Kingdom national trial for relapsed non-B lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) had their diagnostic and relapse marrow cytomorphology compared to see what changes occur during the evolution of the disease. METHODS: Each relapse slide was assessed blindly for French American British (FAB) type and other morphological features by a panel of three independent microscopists without reference to each other or any diagnostic material. Diagnostic slides had been assessed by the same panel on an earlier occasion. RESULTS: A total of 134 consecutive children was studied. Six (5%) were classified as FAB type L2 at diagnosis, compared with 18 (13%) at relapse (a difference of 9%). Twenty two (16%) changed their FAB type, 17 (13%) from L1 to L2 and five (4%) from L2 to L1. The FAB score fell at relapse in 34 children and rose in 14, a difference of 14%. Cell size was the commonest feature to change (increasing in 22 and diminishing in nine) followed by prominent nucleoli (appearing in 21 and disappearing in six). Forty four (33%) children had vacuolated blasts at diagnosis, compared with 48 (36%) at relapse. Twenty five changed their vacuole score substantially, 14 gaining > 10% and 11 falling < 10%. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reflect the variability of lymphoblast cytomorphology, but also show a trend for cells to have more prominent nucleoli and greater size at relapse. Factors controlling these features of the FAB type are unknown, but they may simply be related to the growth fraction of a particular disease and not to any lineage specific biological feature.","['Lilleyman, J S', 'Stevens, R F', 'Hann, I M', 'Gibson, B E', 'Britton, J A', 'Darbyshire, P J', 'Oakhill, A']","['Lilleyman JS', 'Stevens RF', 'Hann IM', 'Gibson BE', 'Britton JA', 'Darbyshire PJ', 'Oakhill A']","[""Department of Paediatric Oncology, St Bartholomew's Hospital, West Smithfield, London.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Size', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Progression', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Single-Blind Method']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.48.11.1051 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1995 Nov;48(11):1051-3. doi: 10.1136/jcp.48.11.1051.,,,,,,PMC503013,,,,,,,,

This could lead directly (through changes in membrane permeability and fluidity) and/or indirectly (through inhibition of P-glycoprotein phosphorylation via inhibition of the phosphatidylserine-dependent protein kinase C or changes in the conformation and functioning of the membrane-integrated proteins via changes in the structure organization of the surrounding membrane bilayer) to the reversal of MDR. Using differential scanning calorimetry and NMR techniques and artificial membranes composed of phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylserines we found a significant correlation between the MDR-reversing activity of the drugs in doxorubicin-resistant human breast carcinoma MCF-7/DOX and murine leukaemia P388/DOX tumour cells (data taken from the literature) and their ability to interact with phosphatidylserines. Trans- and cis-flupentixol were found to interact most strongly with both the phospholipids, followed by trifluoperazine, chlorpromazine, triflupromazine, flunarizine, imipramine, quinacrine and lidocaine. Differences in the interaction of trans- and cis-flupentixol with the phospholipids studied are suggested to be responsible for their different MDR-reversing ability. Verapamil showed moderate membrane activity, assuming that the membrane interactions are not the only reason for its high MDR-reversing ability. Amiodarone showed very strong interactions with phosphatidylserines and is recommended for further MDR-reversal studies.","['Pajeva, I K', 'Wiese, M', 'Cordes, H P', 'Seydel, J K']","['Pajeva IK', 'Wiese M', 'Cordes HP', 'Seydel JK']","['Medicinal-Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Borstel Research Institute, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Anti-Arrhythmia Agents)', '0 (Dopamine Antagonists)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Membranes, Artificial)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'FA0UYH6QUO (Flupenthixol)', 'N3RQ532IUT (Amiodarone)']",IM,"['Amiodarone/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Calorimetry, Differential Scanning', 'Dopamine Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Flupenthixol/pharmacology', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', '*Membranes, Artificial', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylcholines', 'Phosphatidylserines', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01203070 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1996;122(1):27-40. doi: 10.1007/BF01203070.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, no formation of pits on a bone substrate by vitamin-treated HL-60 cells was detected. Expression of calcitonin receptors (CTR), another osteoclastic marker, was examined by means of the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The human CTR-cDNA (T47D isotype) was amplified from untreated HL-60 cells, but not from cells treated with 1,25(OH)2D3. The CTR mRNA disappeared within 24 h after the treatment. Thus, 1,25(OH)2D3-differentiated HL-60 cells failed to show two intrinsic characteristics of osteoclasts, pit formation on a bone substrate and expression of CTR. We then examined the expression of CTR on established human leukemia cell lines. The CTR mRNA was expressed in myeloblastic ML-1 and promyelocytic HL-60 leukemia cells but not in more mature macrophage-like cell lines, U-937 and THP-1 cells.

Incident cancer was investigated in offspring born in 1952-1991 to parents identified as farm holders in agricultural censuses in Norway in 1969-1989. In the follow-up of 323,292 offspring for 5.7 million person-years, 1,275 incident cancers were identified in the Cancer Registry for 1965-1991. The standardized incidence for all cancers was equal to the total rural population of Norway, but cohort subjects had an excess incidence of nervous-system tumours and testicular cancers in certain regions and strata of time that could imply that specific risk factors were of importance. Classification of exposure indicators was based on information given at the agricultural censuses. Risk factors were found for brain tumours, in particular non-astrocytic neuroepithelial tumours: for all ages, pig farming tripled the risk [rate ratio (RR), 3.11; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.89-5.13]; indicators of pesticide use had an independent effect of the same magnitude in a dose-response fashion, strongest in children aged 0 to 14 years (RR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.63-6.94). Horticulture and pesticide indicators were associated with all cancers at ages 0 to 4 years, Wilms' tumour, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, eye cancer and neuroblastoma. Chicken farming was associated with some common cancers of adolescence, and was strongest for osteosarcoma and mixed cellular type of Hodgkin's disease. The main problem in this large cohort study is the crude exposure indicators available; the resulting misclassification is likely to bias any true association towards unity.","['Kristensen, P', 'Andersen, A', 'Irgens, L M', 'Bye, A S', 'Sundheim, L']","['Kristensen P', 'Andersen A', 'Irgens LM', 'Bye AS', 'Sundheim L']","['National Institute of Occupational Health, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,['0 (Pesticides)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', ""Agricultural Workers' Diseases/epidemiology"", '*Agriculture', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Norway', 'Occupational Diseases/epidemiology', 'Pesticides/*adverse effects', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', '*Rural Population', 'Seasons', 'Sex Factors']",1996/01/03 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/01/03 00:00'],"['1996/01/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/01/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960103)65:1<39::AID-IJC8>3.0.CO;2-2 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960103)65:1<39::AID-IJC8>3.0.CO;2-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1996 Jan 3;65(1):39-50. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960103)65:1<39::AID-IJC8>3.0.CO;2-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Significant increases were seen in acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia, astrocytoma and melanoma. The age-standardised incidence of 14.4 per 100,000 is about 34% higher than in the UK. Most types of cancer had a higher incidence in Australia than in the UK, and the difference was significant for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, astrocytoma and melanoma. Of particular interest is malignant melanoma, whose incidence in Australia is more than 5 times that in the UK, as a result of excessive UV exposure.

Data on the urinary excretion of CP in health care workers were used to estimate the uptake of CP, which ranged from 3.6 to 18 micrograms/day.

The life-time risks (70 years) of urinary bladder cancer in men and leukemias in men and women were found to be nearly the same and ranged from 95 to 600 per million. Based on the patient studies, cancer risks were calculated by multiplication of the 10-year cumulative incidence per gram of CP in patients by the estimated mean total uptake in health care workers over 10 years, 200 days a year. The risk of leukemias in women over 10 years ranged from 17 to 100 per million using the secondary tumor data (linear extrapolation). Comparable results were obtained for the risk of urinary bladder tumors and leukemias in men and women when primary tumor data were used. Thus, on an annual basis, cancer risks obtained from both the animal and the patient study were nearly the same and ranged from about 1.4 to 10 per million. In The Netherlands it is proposed that, for workers, a cancer risk per compound of one extra cancer case per million a year should be striven for (""target risk"") and that no risk higher than 100 per million a year (""prohibitory risk"") should be tolerated. From the animal and the patient study it appears that the target risk is exceeded but that the risk is still below the prohibitory risk.","['Sessink, P J', 'Kroese, E D', 'van Kranen, H J', 'Bos, R P']","['Sessink PJ', 'Kroese ED', 'van Kranen HJ', 'Bos RP']","['Department of Toxicology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Int Arch Occup Environ Health,International archives of occupational and environmental health,7512134,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/drug therapy', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cyclophosphamide/*adverse effects/metabolism/urine', 'Female', '*Health Personnel', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Experimental/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*chemically induced', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Time Factors', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/chemically induced']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00385647 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Arch Occup Environ Health. 1995;67(5):317-23. doi: 10.1007/BF00385647.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This 188-bp sequence is highly conserved between mouse, hamster and human.

To further characterize this abnormality, light-density marrow cells from 15 patients who were in remission from hematologic malignancies and had undergone BMT (eight allogeneic and seven autologous) were studied in two culture systems after their marrows had reconstituted and were compared to normal. The preconditioning regimen for transplantation was fractionated total-body irradiation (TBI) 12 Gy, cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg, and total nodal irradiation 6 Gy. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNCs) from the patients and controls were divided in two fractions; stromal layers (SL) were prepared from the first fraction. To examine the attributes of the stroma, the petri dish surface covered by the SL was measured after 5 weeks in culture, and representative layers were trypsinized and stained with Sudan black, butirate esterase, and acid and alkaline phosphatases. Stromal layers were also studied for their support in the development of blastic colonies (CFU-BI). From the second fraction, the CD34+ population was selected with immunomagnetic beads, and 1 x 10(4) progenitors from patients or controls were seeded onto the opposite group of preformed stroma. Stroma-adhesive precursors were scored for the formation of CFU-BI (> 20 cells) on day 5 of culture. Nonadherent selected CD34+ cells were recovered by standardized washing and quantitated in clonogenic assays (CFU-GM). The median patient age was 26 (SD 6.65) years, and eight of 15 patients were female. The median infused bone marrow (BM) MNC number was 0.9 x 10(8)/kg (SD 0.31). Grafts were studied at a median of 37 (SD 48.43) months from transplant. SL from the patients failed to reach confluence by 5 weeks (median dish area covered 55.5% [SD 32.38] vs. control: 100% [SD 2.35]; p = 0.0001). BMT CD34+ progenitors gave 19.5 (SD 42.2) CFU-Bl, significantly lower than those from normal individuals (127 [SD 62.2]; p = 0.01) when panned on control stroma, while control CD34+ cells were poorly supported on BMT layers (corrected for surface, median 2.5 [SD 42.2] CFU-Bl; p = 0.039). Although numbers of stroma nonadherent CFU-GM were not different between the groups (median BMT 56 [SD 54.5] vs. control 62.5 [SD 60.76]; p > 0.05), the ratio of CFU-Bl to CFU-GM showed a significant reduction in adherent CD34+ progenitors in BMT patients (median 0.28 [SD 0.44] vs. normal 2.09 [SD 1.3]; p = 0.04). None of the values were significantly different between patients receiving allogeneic or autologous grafts. We conclude that post-BMT stroma is defective and supports CFU-Bl growth poorly. Moreover, we documented a significant reduction within the CD34+ cells in the adherent primitive clonogenic precursors that was compensated by a proportional increase in the more mature CFU-GM.","['Novitzky, N', 'Mohamed, R']","['Novitzky N', 'Mohamed R']","['University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre, Groote Schuur Hospital, Observatory, Cape Town, South Africa.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/immunology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunomagnetic Separation', 'Leukemia/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/pathology/therapy', 'Remission Induction', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1995 Dec;23(14):1661-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of bcr-abl was proven by a reverse ""nested primer"" polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that is able to detect 1 pg of hybrid mRNA. We performed 108 investigations on 68 patients containing all three parameters: 12 on untreated patients, seven after interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), seven after low-dose cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), 22 after cyclic high-dose hydroxyurea (HU), 49 after allogeneic BMT, five before and three after stem cell mobilization, and three after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). In 53 cases (49%), cytogenetics and PCR gave identical results. In 40 cases (37%), PCR from single colonies gave additional information compared to cytogenetics (e.g., mosaic in colonies when all metaphases were positive or negative). Most interesting were the results of one patient after IFN, one patient after ASCT, and 10 patients after BMT (14 investigations = 13%), showing only Ph'-negative mitoses accompanied by a negative nested primer PCR from fresh blood/bone marrow but single bcr-abl-positive progenitor colonies. False-positive results could be widely excluded by repeated insertion of negative controls into the experiments. One explanation for these results could be that CML, progenitors survive in the patient's body by being inactive and not proliferating. These cells express no or very little RNA and bcr-abl is not detectable by reverse PCR. When stimulated ex vivo in a colony assay by external growth factors, cells proliferate and produce detectable amounts of hybrid mRNA. The value of these observations is not clear. A follow-up of the patients will show if such sleeping progenitors can be activated in vivo. Concluding our observations, we can say that in special cases (therapy follow-up, detection of minimal residual disease) it could be useful to perform a PCR analysis of single progenitors in parallel with the routine investigations.","['Schulze, E', 'Krahl, R', 'Thalmeier, K', 'Helbig, W']","['Schulze E', 'Krahl R', 'Thalmeier K', 'Helbig W']","['University of Leipzig, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/therapy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1995 Dec;23(14):1649-54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mobilized CD34+ cells peaked between 20 and 26 days after starting chemotherapy at 4.8-75.6 (median 10.8) x 10(4)/mL peripheral blood (PB) (n = 5). Patients treated with additional chemotherapy cycles failed to mobilize adequate numbers of CD34+ cells. PB stem cells (PBSC) were purged using a cocktail of CD10, CD19, and AB4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) coupled to immunomagnetic beads (IMB). The median recoveries of total nucleated cells (TNC) and CD34+ cells after mAb/IMB purging were 84 and 81%. The peak numbers of CD34+ cells collected in a single leukapheresis were median 8.6 x 10(6)/kg pre- and 5.2 x 10(6)/kg postpurge (n = 4). The absolute prepurge CD19+ cells were as low as median 2.7 (range 1.4-19) x 10(6) per leukapheresis. Residual BCR-ABL+ cells in unpurged leukapheresis products were assessed by limiting-log10-dilution nested reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as one in 10(5) to one in 10(6) normal cells and were consistently undetectable in all purged PBSC autografts. We conclude that sufficient numbers of CD34+ cells for PBSCT can be collected after phase II but not at later stages of the GMALL 05/93 high risk protocol; PBSC grafts are 3 log less contaminated with residual BCR-ABL+ cells compared to an historical series of 13 autologous BM grafts; and purging of PBSC with mAb/IMB is feasible with minor loss of CD34+ cells and abolished BCR-ABL signals in the grafts.","['Martin, H', 'Atta, J', 'Zumpe, P', 'Eder, M', 'Elsner, S', 'Rode, C', 'Wassmann, B', 'Bruecher, J', 'Hoelzer, D']","['Martin H', 'Atta J', 'Zumpe P', 'Eder M', 'Elsner S', 'Rode C', 'Wassmann B', 'Bruecher J', 'Hoelzer D']","['Department of Hematology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'DNA/*analysis', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/*cytology', 'Humans', '*Immunomagnetic Separation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1995 Dec;23(14):1612-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two types of hybrid BCR-ABL mRNA have been found, B2A2 and B3A2. As the BCR-ABL rearrangement is specific to leukemic cells, selective inhibition of leukemic cell growth by BCR-ABL antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) has been reported in vitro for CML patients and cell lines. However, controversial results have been obtained from preclinical studies using anti-BCR-ABL ASO, as nonspecific inhibition of leukemic cell growth was evidenced in some cases. B3 exon secondary structure was deduced from its sequence and found to be a loop. According to this predictive structure of exon B3, a 56-mer antisense oligonucleotide targeting the polypurine bases from the B2A2 junction was devised which would inhibit proliferation (MTT assay) of B3A2 junction cell lines (K562 and a murine cell line Ba/F3 transfected with the B3A2 junctional sequence). This ASO had a hairpin-like secondary structure and was found to be much more resistant to the action of nucleases than control 18-mer standard oligonucleotides. Hybridization to its target mRNA occurs via formation of a triplex structure. A concentration of 5 microM of specific 56-mer B2A2 ASO was necessary to demonstrate 50% optical density (OD) reduction for K562 cell line and Ba/F3 transformed by B3A2 cDNA. Sense and non-sense 56-mer sequence or 18-mer linear ASO showed no effect for these concentrations. Western blot showed a partial inhibition of P210 protein; expression of P145abl remains unchanged. The 56-mer ASO also inhibited the proliferation of B2A2 junction cell line BV173 at the same concentration and showed no effect on the HL60 cell line used as control.","['Mahon, F X', 'Ripoche, J', 'Pigeonnier, V', 'Jazwiec, B', 'Pigneux, A', 'Moreau, J F', 'Reiffers, J']","['Mahon FX', 'Ripoche J', 'Pigeonnier V', 'Jazwiec B', 'Pigneux A', 'Moreau JF', 'Reiffers J']","['Laboratoire de Greffe de Moelle, URA CNRS 1456, Universite Bordeaux 2, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Drug Stability', 'Exons', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/chemistry', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1995 Dec;23(14):1606-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phenotypic analysis was performed using flow cytometry, assignment of donor/host lineage by cytogenetics or HLA-specific flow cytometry, and analysis of the T cell receptor (TCR) by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We have previously reported the initial appearance in the blood of AR patients of host CD8+brightCD3low T cells that progressively express increasing amounts of CD3+ cells. We now report that this cell population can differentiate into either a cytotoxic T cell phenotype (CD3+CD8+HLA-DR+CD57-) usually associated with AR of grafts from matched unrelated donors or a suppressor T cell phenotype (CD3+CD8+CD57+HLA-DR-) usually associated with AR of grafts from matched sibling donors. Analysis of the TCR V beta subsets from two patients revealed sorted host CD3+CD8+ cells (purity 90-95%) from the first patient to express V beta 18 almost exclusively. In a second patient with late rejection (55 days post-BMT), the CD3+CD8+ cells were predominantly restricted to V beta 1, 5.1, 7, 9, and 18. Although CD3+CD8+ T cells are known to be associated with AR, cytotoxic and suppressor lineages in AR from the same type of BMT and clonal distribution of T cells in AR have not been reported. Preliminary results suggest that V beta expression in AR of PMRD grafts is restricted and host T cell phenotype may vary. Further studies will investigate whether specific mismatches correlate with specific V beta usage and/or host T cell phenotype.","['Lamb, L S Jr', 'Szafer, F', 'Henslee-Downey, P J', 'Walker, M', 'King, S', 'Godder, K', 'Pati, A R', 'Best, R', 'Steinman, L', 'Geier, S S']","['Lamb LS Jr', 'Szafer F', 'Henslee-Downey PJ', 'Walker M', 'King S', 'Godder K', 'Pati AR', 'Best R', 'Steinman L', 'Geier SS', 'et al.']","['Center for Cancer Treatment and Research, Richland Memorial Hospital, Columbia, SC 29203, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD57 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'CD57 Antigens/analysis', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Graft Rejection', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', '*Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', '*Tissue Donors']",1995/12/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1995 Dec;23(14):1595-600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inhibition of autologous antileukemic immune response by these factors may support immunosurveillance of AML. A well-known inhibitor of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell activity is transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). To evaluate the possible significance of TGF-beta 1 for the impaired cytotoxic activity in AML at time of diagnosis, we looked for the TGF-beta 1-specific mRNA, for the production and release of TGF-beta 1, and for its relevance for immunosuppressing activities in AML. In the culture supernatants of 18 investigated AMLs, we detected various amounts of TGF-beta protein. The TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 protein concentrations were 105 pg/mL (< 50-240 pg/mL) and 32 pg/mL (< 2-91 pg/mL), respectively. In 13 of 15 patients, the leukemic blasts expressed TGF-beta 1 mRNA. To exclude possible interferences with contaminating mononuclear cells (MNC), the data were confirmed by analysis of sorted blast cells and leukemic cell lines. All investigated leukemic cell lines expressed TGF-beta 1 protein and mRNA. The culture supernatants of AMLs inhibited LAK activity strongly in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibition of cytotoxicity could be restored by the addition of neutralizing TGF-beta 1 antibodies. The data suggest TGF-beta 1 to be a relevant factor for the inhibition of cytotoxic activities in AMLs.","['Bergmann, L', 'Schui, D K', 'Brieger, J', 'Weidmann, E', 'Mitrou, P S', 'Hoelzer, D']","['Bergmann L', 'Schui DK', 'Brieger J', 'Weidmann E', 'Mitrou PS', 'Hoelzer D']","['Medical Clinic III, J.W.

Until recently, no cure could be offered to patients relapsing following allogeneic BMT. We present our long-term observations of the first patient with remission reinduced by allogeneic cell therapy (allo-CT) using donor peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). In addition, we review the cumulative international experience with allo-CT used to treat 163 patients, 105 with CML and 58 with other hematologic diseases, who relapsed following allogeneic BMT. The first patient treated by allo-CT was diagnosed with acute resistant pre-B lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in extensive third hematologic and extramedullary relapse shortly after BMT. He was given infusions of donor (sister) PBL in multiple increments. Subsequently, he developed mild, reversible graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) in parallel with regression of all hematologic and cytogenetic disease manifestations. More than 8 years after allo-CT, he is disease-free with Karnofsky score 100% and no evidence of residual male cells by PCR. International data show that relapse after BMT was successfully reversed by donor PBL treatment in 97 of 158 evaluable patients; 72/100 (72%) with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and 25/58 (44.8%) with other malignant hematologic diseases including acute leukemia, lymphoma, and myelodysplastic syndrome. T cell depletion (TCD) for prevention of GVHD was performed for 60/105 (57%) patients with CML and 31/58 (53.4%) patients with other hematologic malignancies. Complete response after allo-CT was obtained in recipients of both TCD-BMT and unmodified BMT. GVHD due to allo-CT developed in 86/158 (54.4%) of the patients, 63/100 (63.0%) with CML and 23/58 (39.6%) with other hematologic diseases. alpha-interferon (IFN-alpha) was given to 67.9% of patients with CML and 28.1% of patients with other diseases. The cumulative experience shows that allo-CT can successfully reverse chemoradiotherapy-resistant relapse of acute leukemia and even more effectively of chronic leukemia independently of alpha-interferon therapy. Although GVHD was frequent among responders, accompanied occasionally by transient or irreversible marrow aplasia, remissions were also obtained in patients with no GVHD. Allo-CT should therefore be considered as treatment of choice for overt relapse or de novo minimal residual disease post-BMT. Administration of donor peripheral blood lymphocytes in graded increments at an early stage of relapse may be the best approach for combining optimal timing at the stage of minimal disease while controlling and minimizing the risk of GVHD on an individual basis.","['Slavin, S', 'Naparstek, E', 'Nagler, A', 'Ackerstein, A', 'Kapelushnik, J', 'Or, R']","['Slavin S', 'Naparstek E', 'Nagler A', 'Ackerstein A', 'Kapelushnik J', 'Or R']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Tissue Donors']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1995 Dec;23(14):1553-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore investigated in vivo and in vitro production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), soluble interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor alpha-chain (sCD25), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in patients before and during various time periods up to 2 years after autologous and allogeneic BMT. Cytokine levels were assessed in patient plasma and in supernatants of patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) cultured for 3 days in the presence of T cell-specific stimulation via CD3 plus IL-2. Our studies show that IFN-gamma plasma levels are decreased in autologous graft recipients before and during the first 30 days posttransplant. In allogeneic graft recipients, IFN-gamma plasma levels are also decreased during the first 30 days posttransplant, but otherwise are comparable to normal control (NC) values. In vitro stimulated PBMNC from autologous graft recipients also exhibit an IFN-gamma production defect before and during the first 30 days posttransplant. In contrast, before and up to 30 days after allogeneic BMT, stimulated IFN-gamma production is comparable to NC values but then gradually decreases, reaching its trough levels at between 61 and 180 days post-BMT. The IFN-gamma production defects in both patient groups seem to be specific, as sCD25, TNF-alpha, and GM-CSF production in stimulated PBMNC is normal or even enhanced at any time after autologous or allogeneic BMT. Deficient IFN-gamma production in patient-derived PBMNC does not correlate with variation in monocyte, T cell, or natural killer (NK) cell numbers during the posttransplantation course.","['Hanenberg, H', 'Dilloo, D', 'Laws, H J', 'Zessack, N', 'Heyll, A', 'Burdach, S']","['Hanenberg H', 'Dilloo D', 'Laws HJ', 'Zessack N', 'Heyll A', 'Burdach S']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Heinrich Heine University Medical Center, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hodgkin Disease/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Plasmacytoma/therapy', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1995 Dec;23(14):1543-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Samples from leukapheresis (LP) products and bone marrow (BM) were obtained on the same day from patients who received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) after cytotoxic chemotherapy. The proportion of CD34+ cells expressing L-selectin tended to be greater in LP products compared with BM. In samples from both sources, the mean fluorescence intensity of CD34 was significantly greater on CD34+/L-selectin-positive cells compared with the CD34+/L-selectin-negative cell subset. Three-color immunofluorescence showed that early CD34+/HLA-DRdim or CD34+/HLA-DR- progenitor cells were strongly positive for L-selectin, whereas L-selectin-negative cells were only found in the CD34+HLA-DRbright subset. The mean fluoresence intensity of VLA-4 and LFA-1 was significantly greater on CD34+ cells from BM compared with LP products. Moreover, a distinct population of CD34dim/VLA-4bright and CD34dim/LFA-1bright cells was found only in samples from BM. This subset may be enriched for myeloid progenitor cells, since the cloning efficiency of CD34+ cells for CFU-GM was significantly greater in BM samples than in LP products. Binding of CD34+ cells to endothelial cells was partially inhibited by a blocking antibody to beta 2-integrin. In conclusion, L-selectin is expressed in significant amounts on more primitive CD34+ cells which circulate in considerable numbers in the peripheral blood. This suggests that L-selectin plays a role in redistribution and homing of hematopoietic progenitor cells to the bone marrow following cytotoxic damage. Conversely, strong expression of VLA-4 and LFA-1 was mainly found on lineage-committed progenitor cells of the bone marrow.","['Mohle, R', 'Murea, S', 'Kirsch, M', 'Haas, R']","['Mohle R', 'Murea S', 'Kirsch M', 'Haas R']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/*analysis', 'L-Selectin/*analysis', 'Leukapheresis', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/*analysis', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasms/pathology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/therapy', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/*analysis']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1995 Dec;23(14):1535-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The specific cytotoxic effectors mediating this effect are as yet undefined, but the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-nonrestricted lysis of tumor cell lines by natural killer (NK) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells from recipients of allogeneic BMTs has been proposed as an in vitro correlate of GVL. In vitro culture or treatment in vivo with interleukin-2 (IL-2) is associated with enhanced NK cytotoxicity and lysis of NK-resistant targets (LAK cytotoxicity). NK, LAK, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) have cytotoxic properties against autologous and allogeneic leukemic targets. These immune effector cells require receptor-ligand interaction for target recognition and adhesion via specific molecules such as integrins, a group of heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins. The integrins include the very late activation (VLA) subfamily, which all share the same beta 1 subunit but have distinct chains. VLA-6 (CDw49f) has been identified on NK cells and binds to laminin, a basement membrane protein found on malignant tumor cells but not normal cells. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to laminin have been found to inhibit in vitro cytotoxicity of the tumor cell line K562, suggesting an important role for VLA-6 in this interaction. The specific aim of this study was to investigate the role of VLA-6 in the interactions of the tumor cell lines K562 and Daudi with peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) acting as effectors in cell-mediated cytotoxicity from normal volunteers, patients recovering from chemotherapy, and patients recovering from autologous or allogeneic BMT. In over 96% of assays, incubation of effector cells with anti-CDw49f mAbs led to detectable inhibition of NK and LAK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. More notably, the degree of anti-VLA6-induced suppression of LAK activity was significantly greater in the normal donors than in any of the patient groups, despite a significantly lower incidence of expression of VLA-6 on NK cells from controls than from patients. This implies a reduced role for this adhesion molecule in LAK activity following some form of in vivo stimulation. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that addition of exogenous IL-2 to the cultures ameliorated the effect of VLA-6 blockade, although the incidence and level of VLA-6 expression was unchanged by IL-2. In contrast, VLA-6 blocking led to a greater reduction in NK activity of BMT recipients than of normal donors, demonstrating that the VLA-6 adhesion pathway is important in this group of patients. These results indicate that the VLA-6-laminin interaction is important in normal NK-target interaction but may play a less significant role in the innate cytotoxic response post-BMT, perhaps reflecting subtle differences in the subsets of NK cells present in BMT recipients compared with normal donors.","['Lowdell, M W', 'Shamim, F', 'Hamon, M', 'Macdonald, I D', 'Prentice, H G']","['Lowdell MW', 'Shamim F', 'Hamon M', 'Macdonald ID', 'Prentice HG']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Integrin alpha6beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Receptors, Laminin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Graft vs Host Reaction', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha6beta1', 'Integrins/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Laminin/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Receptors, Laminin/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1995 Dec;23(14):1530-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we attempt to select the benign progenitor-enriched population from the PB of CML patients. The CD34+ cells isolated from the PB of 12 CML patients in the chronic phase were treated with low doses (5 or 10 micrograms/mL) of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). We expanded these cells for 7 days in liquid cytokine-mediated cultures. This expansion in the presence of interleukin-1 (IL-1) plus stem cell factor (SCF) plus IL-3 or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) plus SCF plus IL-3 seemed at least to preserve the initial clonogenic potential of CD34+ and 5-FU-resistant CD34+ cells. For the presence of BCR-ABL, mRNA from each of the 12 patients was studied by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 10-15 pooled CFU-GM colonies plucked from methylcellulose cultures of starting and expanded populations. Although all PCR results were positive for colonies harvested before liquid culture, we were able to identify BCR-ABL-negative colonies from an expanded CD34+ population cultured in the presence of recombinant cytokines in 11 of 12 patients studied. 5-FU pretreatment of CML CD34+ cells markedly reduced their clonogenic potential and growth factor-mediated cell proliferation but favored higher frequency of BCR-ABL-free colonies. In conclusion, these data show that 5-FU-resistant CD34+ cells from the PB of CML patients contain normal progenitor cells, which can be selected and expanded in short-term cytokine-mediated cultures.","['Jazwiec, B', 'Mahon, F X', 'Pigneux, A', 'Pigeonnier, V', 'Reiffers, J']","['Jazwiec B', 'Mahon FX', 'Pigneux A', 'Pigeonnier V', 'Reiffers J']","['Laboratory of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Bordeaux II, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytapheresis', '*Drug Resistance', 'Fluorouracil/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis/genetics', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1995 Dec;23(14):1509-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, neither an increase in relapse rate nor an aggravation of GVHD has been routinely described when HGFs are used after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT). Early outcomes after HLA-matched allo-BMT in 26 patients with hematologic malignancies treated with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) or recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) from the day of transplantation were analyzed. Results were compared to those from a series of 38 patients treated earlier with an identical approach, but not scheduled to receive HGFs after transplantation. All patients received a preparative regimen consisting of etoposide, cyclophosphamide, and total-body irradiation and GVHD prophylaxis with cyclosporine and a short course of methotrexate (MTX). The analysis has shown that the duration of neutropenia was significantly decreased in the group of patients treated routinely with HGFs (median 17 vs. 20 days; p < 0.001). These patients also required fewer days of intravenous antibiotic therapy (median 20 vs. 34 days; p < 0.001), had fewer positive blood and tissue cultures (median 2 vs. 12 and 13 vs. 28; p = 0.02 and p = 0.05, respectively), needed fewer packed red blood cell transfusions (median 7 vs. 11; p < 0.03), and were discharged earlier from the hospital (median 33.5 vs. 39 days; p < 0.001). The use of HGFs was not associated with an increase in acute GVHD or early leukemic relapse. No side effects were attributable to the simultaneous administration of MTX and HGF during the neutropenic period. A trend toward better 100-day actuarial survival for patients treated with rhG-CSF or rhGM-CSF did not reach statistical significance. A decrease in the number of early deaths from fungal or bacterial infections was found in the cytokine-treated group (p = 0.05). These data suggest that the early use of rhG-CSF or rhGM-CSF after HLA-matched allo-BMT in hematologic malignancies accelerates engraftment, reduces hospitalization time, and improves outcome, without increasing acute GVHD or early relapse. Because MTX-based prophylaxis regimens are associated with prolonged neutropenia, the routine use of HGFs after transplantation may be particularly useful in regimens including MTX.","['Martin-Algarra, S', 'Bishop, M R', 'Tarantolo, S', 'Cowles, M K', 'Reed, E', 'Anderson, J R', 'Vose, J M', 'Bierman, P', 'Armitage, J O', 'Kessinger, A']","['Martin-Algarra S', 'Bishop MR', 'Tarantolo S', 'Cowles MK', 'Reed E', 'Anderson JR', 'Vose JM', 'Bierman P', 'Armitage JO', 'Kessinger A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha 68198-3330, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1995 Dec;23(14):1503-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously demonstrated that a low dose, delivered subcutaneously, of rhG-CSF (50 micrograms/m2) accelerates neutrophil recovery in ABSCT, but the optimal dosage of rhG-CSF is not known. To elucidate the effect of rhG-CSF on neutrophil recovery, we determined serum levels of endogenous and exogenously administered G-CSF in 24 patients receiving ABSCT. Of these, five received bolus subcutaneous injection of 50 micrograms/m2 rhG-CSF, 10 received 150 micrograms/m2, and nine received no rhG-CSF. Endogenous G-CSF levels rose immediately after ABSCT, and an inverse correlation was found between the serum level of G-CSF and the absolute neutrophil count (r = -0.73, p < 0.01). The pre-dose level in patients receiving rhG-CSF rose gradually, reaching a maximum between days 3 and 6. The level gradually decreased as the neutrophil count began to rise, even through administration of the same dose of rhG-CSF continued. Pharmacokinetic data showed that the half-life of elimination of G-CSF (t1/2) exceeded 15 hours during severe neutropenia but decreased during the recovery of neutrophils. These observations suggest that neutrophils provide a negative feedback mechanism for clearing G-CSF from the circulation. Pre-dose levels of G-CSF in patients receiving 50 micrograms/m2 rhG-CSF reached 10 ng/mL, equivalent to the concentrations used in clonogenic assay in vitro to stimulate myeloid progenitor cells.","['Shimazaki, C', 'Uchiyama, H', 'Fujita, N', 'Araki, S', 'Sudo, Y', 'Yamagata, N', 'Ashihara, E', 'Goto, H', 'Inaba, T', 'Haruyama, H']","['Shimazaki C', 'Uchiyama H', 'Fujita N', 'Araki S', 'Sudo Y', 'Yamagata N', 'Ashihara E', 'Goto H', 'Inaba T', 'Haruyama H', 'et al.']","['Second Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Neutrophils', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1995 Dec;23(14):1497-502.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relevance of each pathophysiologic defect was characterized in 16 individuals, and data were compared to results from seven normal volunteers. Bone marrow mononuclear cells were split into two fractions. Stromal layers (SL) were prepared from the first, and a CD34+ enriched population was obtained by immunomagnetic selection from the second. In cross-culture experiments, 1 x 10(4) of the latter from patients or controls were seeded on preformed SL, and adhesive PC were scored for the formation of blast colonies (CFU-Bl) on day 5 of culture. Nonadherent progenitors were recovered and quantitated in a standard clonogenic assay (CFU-GM). There were significantly fewer CD34+ cells in the AA group (median 0.65%, SD 0.39%, vs. 1.62%, SD 1.4%; p = 0.002). No morphological or cytologic differences between normal and aplastic SL were detected. Both equally supported the growth of CFU-Bl from normal progenitors (mean 117, SD 20.4, and 103.1, SD 30.4), while this value was reduced for the aplastic PC (mean 41.06, SD 42.9; p = 0.0002, exact two-tailed test).

Thirty adult Wistar rats were allocated to five groups, according to the drug added to the pulmonary artery flush solution before ischemia (groups 1 and 2: none; group 3: human thioredoxin; group 4: L-cysteine, and group 5: human thioredoxin and L-cysteine) and according to the ex vivo ischemic interval at 37 degrees C (group 1: no ischemia; groups 2-5: 90 min). After ischemia, the lungs were reperfused for 60 min with Krebs-Henseleit solution containing 4% bovine serum albumin. In nonischemic lungs, the pulmonary arterial pressure, airway pressure, wet to dry lung weight ratio and the albumin concentration in bronchoalveolar fluid were within normal ranges. In contrast, all parameters of ischemic untreated lungs were generally poor. Compared to the ischemic untreated lungs, treatment with the combination of human thioredoxin and L-cysteine significantly reduced the wet to dry lung weight ratio (group 2: 9.18 +/- 0.25, group 5: 7.88 +/- 0.27), and the albumin concentration in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (group 2: 78.3 +/- 17.1 micrograms/ml, group 5: 24.0 +/- 3.8 micrograms/ml).

To examine the effect of bisecting GlcNAc on the natural killer (NK) cytotoxicity, the GnT-111 gene was introduced into NK-sensitive K562 cells that have no detectable GnT-III activity. We obtained three clones stably expressing high GnT-III (positive transfectants). Introduction of the GnT-III gene resulted in an increase of bisecting GlcNAc and a decrease of external sialic acid as well as tri- and tetraantennary sugars, as judged by flow cytometry. Compared to controls, the NK cytotoxicity was completely blocked against positive transfectants. The binding of effector cells to positive transfectants was also decreased. After s.c. injection into nude mice, positive transfectants produced spleen colonization, although no spleen lesions were formed by control cells. In nude mice depleted of NK cells by anti-asialo GM1 antibody, both positive transfectants and controls produced spleen colonization equally. These results indicate that K562 cells expressing GnT-III are resistant to NK cytotoxicity, resulting in spleen colonization in nude mice.","['Yoshimura, M', 'Ihara, Y', 'Ohnishi, A', 'Ijuhin, N', 'Nishiura, T', 'Kanakura, Y', 'Matsuzawa, Y', 'Taniguchi, N']","['Yoshimura M', 'Ihara Y', 'Ohnishi A', 'Ijuhin N', 'Nishiura T', 'Kanakura Y', 'Matsuzawa Y', 'Taniguchi N']","['Department of Biochemistry, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.144 (beta-1,4-mannosyl-glycoprotein', 'beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase)', 'V956696549 (Acetylglucosamine)']",IM,"['Acetylglucosamine/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligosaccharides/metabolism', 'Splenic Neoplasms/immunology/pathology/*secondary', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/15 00:00,1996/01/15 00:01,['1996/01/15 00:00'],"['1996/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Jan 15;56(2):412-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In differentiation of leukemia cells, a G1 arrest is a common, if not invariable, occurence and takes place after the appearance of markers of monocytic differentiation in human leukemia HL60 cells treated with 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) at low to moderately high concentrations (F. Zhang et al., Cell Proliferation 27: 643-654, 1994). In the present study, we investigated the protein levels of several G1 regulatory proteins that are potential mediators of the 1,25D3-induced G1 block. During the first 24 h of exposure to a high concentration (4 x 10(-7) M) of 1,25D3, no increase was noted in the immunodetectable levels of cyclins D1 or E, or CDIs p16Ink4, p21Cip1/Waf1, or p27Kip1, even though monocytic differentiation markers were evident, and a prolongation of G1 was noted. After 48 h of exposure 4 x 10(-7) M to 1,25D3, a G1 to S-phase block progressively increased in parallel with the abundance of the p27Kip1 CDI. A transient increase in p21Cip1/Waf1 was noted only at 48 hr. The increase in p27Kip1 protein level was dependent on the concentration of 1,25D3 and was accompanied by an increase in cyclin D and E proteins, which normally peak in mid-G1 and at the G1 to S-phase transition, respectively. These results indicate that p27Kip1 protein is a strong candidate for the cell cycle regulator that blocks the entry into the S-phase in 1,25D3-treated HL60 cells.","['Wang, Q M', 'Jones, J B', 'Studzinski, G P']","['Wang QM', 'Jones JB', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, UMD-New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cdkn1b protein, mouse)', '0 (Cdkn1b protein, rat)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Phenotype', 'Rats', 'S Phase/*drug effects', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",1996/01/15 00:00,1996/01/15 00:01,['1996/01/15 00:00'],"['1996/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Jan 15;56(2):264-7.,['R01-CA-44722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

NGF-induced survival was accompanied by an intense (15- to 30-fold) and steady (> 24 h) activation of p44 and p42 ERKs which waned rapidly (t1/2 approximately 30 min) upon NGF withdrawal. However, concentrations of NGF that induced a weak (4- to 5-fold) stimulation of the ERKs were not sufficient to maintain long-term survival. Moreover, prolonged and intense stimulation of the ERKs by NGF for up to 15.5 h was unable to confer long-term survival, since withdrawal of NGF after this time resulted in neuronal death that was kinetically indistinguishable from the death of neurons that had not been exposed to NGF. By contrast, CNTF and LIF continued to support survival for up to 3 days after eliciting only transient (< 30 min and 1 h respectively) activation of p44 and p42 ERKs, while CPTcAMP induced survival for several days without any measurable activation of the ERKs. Taken together, these data suggest that ERK activation per se is neither necessary nor sufficient for survival and that alternative pathways exist for effecting long-term survival of rat sympathetic neurons.","['Virdee, K', 'Tolkovsky, A M']","['Virdee K', 'Tolkovsky AM']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur J Neurosci,The European journal of neuroscience,8918110,"['0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic AMP/pharmacology', '*Enzyme Activation', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*pharmacology/*physiology', 'Phosphotransferases/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Sympathetic Nervous System/*physiology', 'Time Factors']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1460-9568.1995.tb00637.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Neurosci. 1995 Oct 1;7(10):2159-69. doi: 10.1111/j.1460-9568.1995.tb00637.x.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both molecules are expressed on a restricted fraction of human T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL)/leukemias; however, little is known about their functional and/or clinical significance in these disorders. In this study, the pattern of expression of CD40L was compared with that of the CD26 molecule. A series of 67 human T-cell NHL/leukemias and a panel of leukemia/lymphoma T-cell lines were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and RNA studies. The overall frequency of CD26+ and CD40L+ samples was rather similar (25/67 [37%] v 18/67 [27%]). However, the majority of CD26-expressing cases clustered in the lymphoblastic lymphomas (LBL)/T-acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL; 12/23) and CD30+ anaplastic large-cell (ALC) lymphomas (5/8), whereas CD40L+ lymphomas included a large fraction of mycosis fungoides (11/21 [52%]). CD26 and CD40L coexpression was found only in 2 myocosis fungoides cases and 1 small lymphocytic lymphoma. Thus, the expression of the two antigens was mutually exclusive in almost all T-cell lymphomas/leukemias. Accordingly, lymphoma cell lines expressed either one of the molecules or the relative amounts of CD26 and CD40L were inversely proportional. In contrast, reactive T lymphocytes from patients with non-neoplastic T-cell expansions and in vitro activated CD3+ or CD4+ normal T cells were found to coexpress CD40L and CD26. Results of a multivariate analysis showed that the expression of CD26 in T-cell LBL/ALL patients was associated to a worse outcome in terms of survival, as compared with patients with CD26- tumors (P < or = .0001). Based on our results, it can be concluded that, (1) as opposed to activated or reactive normal T cells, the expression of CD26 and of CD40L is mutually exclusive in human T-cell lymphomas/leukemias; (2) expression of CD26 is restricted to aggressive pathologic entities, such as T-cell LBL/ALL and T-cell CD30+ ALC lymphomas, whereas CD40L is expressed on slow progressing diseases such as mycosis fungoides; and (3) within the T-cell LBL/ALL group of tumors, CD26 may identify a subset of poor prognosis patients.","['Carbone, A', 'Gloghini, A', 'Zagonel, V', 'Aldinucci, D', 'Gattei, V', 'Degan, M', 'Improta, S', 'Sorio, R', 'Monfardini, S', 'Pinto, A']","['Carbone A', 'Gloghini A', 'Zagonel V', 'Aldinucci D', 'Gattei V', 'Degan M', 'Improta S', 'Sorio R', 'Monfardini S', 'Pinto A']","['Division of Pathology, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, Istituto Nazionale di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Aviano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Child', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/15 00:00,1995/12/15 00:01,['1995/12/15 00:00'],"['1995/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65067-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Dec 15;86(12):4617-26.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kinetics of BCR/ABL P210 expression in transgenic mice were very similar to those of BCR/ABL P190 constructs in transgenic mice. mRNA transcripts were detectable early in embryonic development and also in hematopoietic tissue of adult animals. Expression of BCR/ABL in peripheral blood preceded development of overt disease. P210 founder and progeny transgenic animals, when becoming ill, developed leukemia of B, T-lymphoid, or myeloid origin after a relatively long latency period. In contrast, P190-transgenic mice exclusively developed leukemia of B-cell origin, with a relatively short period of latency. The observed dissimilarities are most likely due to intrinsically different properties of the P190 and P210 oncoproteins and may also involve sequences that control transgene expression. The delayed progression of BCR/ABL P210-associated disease in the transgenic mice is consistent with the apparent indolence of human chronic myeloid leukemia during the chronic phase. We conclude that, in transgenic models, comparable expression of BCR/ABL P210 and BCR/ABL P190 results in clinically distinct conditions.","['Voncken, J W', 'Kaartinen, V', 'Pattengale, P K', 'Germeraad, W T', 'Groffen, J', 'Heisterkamp, N']","['Voncken JW', 'Kaartinen V', 'Pattengale PK', 'Germeraad WT', 'Groffen J', 'Heisterkamp N']","['Department of Pathology Research and Laboratory Medicine, Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9038-94-2 (Metallothionein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology', 'Metallothionein/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Transgenes']",1995/12/15 00:00,1995/12/15 00:01,['1995/12/15 00:00'],"['1995/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65065-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Dec 15;86(12):4603-11.,['CA50248/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have also implicated ICE in the induction of apoptosis in vertebrate cells. Because IL-1 plays a major role in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blast proliferation, we sought to investigate the effect of ICE inhibition on AML progenitors. To do this, we used bocaspartyl (benzyl) chloromethylketone (BACMK) an inhibitor designed to penetrate cells and bind covalently to the active site of ICE. Our preliminary experiments showed that incubation of activated peripheral blood cells with 2.5 mumol/L of BAMCK downregulated production of mature IL-1 beta but had no effect on tumor necrosis factor-alpha. To test the effects of the inhibitor on AML cells, we first used the OCI/AML3 cell line. We found that these cells produce IL-1 beta and bind the biotinylated cytokine and that IL-1 inhibitors, such as IL-1 neutralizing antibodies, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and soluble IL-1 receptors, specifically inhibit OCI/AML3 proliferation, indicating that IL-1 beta is an autocrine growth factor for OCI/AML3 cells. The ICE inhibitor suppressed OCI/AML3 growth in a dose-dependent manner (at 0.4 to 4 mumol/L) and downregulated mature IL-1 beta production, as assessed by Western immunoblotting. Similar results were obtained with marrow aspirates from 16 AML patients. The ICE inhibitor suppressed proliferation of AML precursors (by up to 78%; mean, 44%) in a dose-dependent fashion at concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 5 mumol/L but not proliferation of normal marrow progenitors; the suppressive effect was reversed by IL-1 beta. Furthermore, incubation of AML cells with 4 mumol/L BAMCK downregulated the production of mature IL-1 beta, suggesting that the growth-inhibitory effect is mediated through suppression of the biologically active cytokine. Our data indicate that inhibition of ICE suppresses AML blast proliferation and suggest that ICE inhibitors may have a role in future therapies for AML.","['Estrov, Z', 'Black, R A', 'Sleath, P R', 'Harris, D', 'Van, Q', 'LaPushin, R', 'Estey, E H', 'Talpaz, M']","['Estrov Z', 'Black RA', 'Sleath PR', 'Harris D', 'Van Q', 'LaPushin R', 'Estey EH', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-aspartyl (benzyl)chloromethylketone)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Caspase 1', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*physiology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/enzymology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1995/12/15 00:00,1995/12/15 00:01,['1995/12/15 00:00'],"['1995/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65064-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Dec 15;86(12):4594-602.,['P01 CA 55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The therapeutic use of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) to increase the neutrophil count is associated with fewer infections and an improved quality of life. However, the long-term effects of this new therapy are largely unknown. In particular, it is unclear if myeloid leukemia, a known complication of some forms of congenital neutropenia, will occur with increased frequency among patients who receive long-term treatment with hematopoietic growth factors. We report 13 patients with congenital disorders of myelopoiesis who developed leukemic transformation with either myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and 1 who acquired a clonal cytogenetic abnormality without evidence of MDS or AML while receiving rhG-CSF. The bone marrows of 10 patients showed monosomy 7 and 5 had activating RAS mutations. These abnormalities were not detected in pretreatment bone marrows and cessation of rhG-CSF was not associated with either clinical improvement or cytogenetic remission. We conclude that patients with severe forms of congenital neutropenia are at relatively high risk of developing MDS and AML.

However, the role of lL-2 in myeloid development has recently become of interest for several reasons, including the effect gamma c mutations may or may not have on myeloid development in patients with XSCID. Many studies of lL-2 function in the myeloid cell lineage have been performed on a murine background. To study gamma c expression and function in human myeloid precursors, we introduced the human myelomonocytic cell line, Tf-1, with a retroviral vector containing the human lL-2R beta subunit to create functional human intermediate lL-2R consisting of beta gamma c dimers. We have characterized this transfected variant of Tf-1 (Tf-1 beta) with regard to its response to lL-2. Unlike the parental Tf-1 cell line that is deficient in both lL-2R alpha and lL-2R beta expression, the Tf-1 beta transfectant binds and responds to lL-2 through intermediate-affinity lL-2Rs. Scatchard analyses indicate the number of intermediate-affinity receptors on Tf-1 beta is similar to the number found on the well-characterized YT cell line. However, detection of gamma c on Tf-1 beta cells is dramatically less than on YT cells by Western blot analysis and is undetectable by flow cytometric studies and surface iodinations. The gamma c component on YT cells is readily detected by all three methods. We conclude from these studies that the intermediate-affinity lL-2Rs on the Tf-1 cell line behave differently than those on YT cells with respect to gamma c detection.

To understand further the potential role(s) of the PLZF gene product in hematopoiesis, we have examined its expression levels in a variety of murine tissues and in established cell lines that are representative of various stages of myeloid and lymphoid development. We show that murine PLZF(mPLZF) is expressed at the highest levels in undifferentiated, multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cells and that its expression declines as cells become more mature and committed to various hematopoietic lineages. Data obtained with established cell lines are corroborated by results showing the lack of human PLZF protein expression in mature peripheral blood mononuclear cells and high PLZF levels in the nuclei of CD34+ human bone marrow progenitor cells. Interestingly, unlike many transcription factors, PLZF protein in these cells possesses distinct punctate nuclear distribution, suggesting its compartmentalization in the nucleus. Taken together, our data suggest a role for PLZF protein in early hematopoiesis and the requirement of downregulation of its expression for proper differentiation of most hematopoietic lineages.","['Reid, A', 'Gould, A', 'Brand, N', 'Cook, M', 'Strutt, P', 'Li, J', 'Licht, J', 'Waxman, S', 'Krumlauf, R', 'Zelent, A']","['Reid A', 'Gould A', 'Brand N', 'Cook M', 'Strutt P', 'Li J', 'Licht J', 'Waxman S', 'Krumlauf R', 'Zelent A']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre at the Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/ultrastructure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics/*physiology']",1995/12/15 00:00,1995/12/15 00:01,['1995/12/15 00:00'],"['1995/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65058-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Dec 15;86(12):4544-52.,['CA59936-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['GENBANK/L08483', 'GENBANK/L14433', 'GENBANK/L15325', 'GENBANK/L16896', 'GENBANK/L22205', 'GENBANK/M58054', 'GENBANK/M85739', 'GENBANK/P22611', 'GENBANK/P24768', 'GENBANK/S24675', 'GENBANK/S79445', 'GENBANK/U00115', 'GENBANK/U01333', 'GENBANK/U07607', 'GENBANK/X16576', 'GENBANK/X17125', 'GENBANK/X54664', 'GENBANK/X75498', 'GENBANK/X75499', 'GENBANK/X79050', 'GENBANK/X82018', 'GENBANK/Z21943']",,,,,,,,,,

Previous confocal microscopic analysis has shown that the CD34 antigen, a mucin-like cell surface glycoprotein that is expressed by hematopoietic progenitors and all endothelial cells of the adult and embryo, is also found on a subset of luminal hematopoietic-like cells in the yolk sac blood islands as well as on the vascular endothelium lining these early hematopoietic locations. We show here that, as in all other hematopoietic sites thus far examined, immunoaffinity-purified CD34+ nonadherent cells from murine yolk sacs contain the vast majority of erythroid and myeloid progenitor cell colony forming activity. To examine the developmental interactions between these CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells of the yolk sac and the CD34+ yolk sac endothelium, we have immunaffinity-purified adherent endothelial cells from day 10.5 yolk sacs using CD34 antiserum and produced cell lines by transformation with a retrovirus expressing the polyoma middle T antigen. Analysis of these cell lines for CD34, von Willebrand's factor, FLK 1 and FLT 1 expression, and capillary growth in Matrigel indicates that they appear to be endothelial cells, consistent with their original phenotype in vivo. Coculture of yolk sac CD34+ hematopoietic cells on these endothelial cell lines results in up to a 60-fold increase in total hematopoietic cell number after approximately 8 days. Analysis of these expanded hematopoietic cells showed that the majority were of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. In addition, examination of the cultures showed the rapid formation of numerous cobblestone areas, a previously described morphologic entity thought to be representative of early pluripotential stem cells. Scrutiny of the ability of these endothelial cell lines to expand committed progenitor cells showed up to a sixfold increase in erythroid and myeloid colony-forming cells after 3 to 6 days in culture, consistent with the notion that these embryonic endothelial cells mediate the expansion of these precursor cells. Polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that most of the cell lines produce FLK-2/FLT-3 ligand, stem cell factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, leukemia-inhibitory factor, and interleukin-6 (IL-6), whereas there is a generally low or not measurable production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-1, IL-3, transforming growth factor beta-1, erythropoietin, or thrombopoietin. The output of mature hematopoietic cells from these cocultures can be modified to include an erythroid population by the addition of exogenous erythropoietin. These data suggest that endothelial cell lines derived form the yolk sac provide an appropriate hematopoietic environment for the expansion and differentiation of yolk sac progenitor cells into at least the myeloid and erythroid lineages.","['Fennie, C', 'Cheng, J', 'Dowbenko, D', 'Young, P', 'Lasky, L A']","['Fennie C', 'Cheng J', 'Dowbenko D', 'Young P', 'Lasky LA']","['Department of Immunology, Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology', '*Hematopoiesis, Extramedullary', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Immunomagnetic Separation', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor', 'Stem Cell Factor/biosynthesis', 'Yolk Sac/*cytology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",1995/12/15 00:00,1995/12/15 00:01,['1995/12/15 00:00'],"['1995/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65047-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Dec 15;86(12):4454-67.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we performed a randomized controlled multicenter study to define the optimal initial dosage and to identify predictors of response to rHuEpo. A total of 146 patients who had hemoglobin (Hb) levels < or = 11 g/dL and who had no need for transfusion at the time of enrollment entered this trial. Patients were randomized to receive 1,000 U (n = 31), 2,000 U (n = 29), 5,000 U (n = 31), or 10,000 U (n = 26) of rHuEpo daily subcutaneously for 8 weeks or to receive no therapy (n = 29). Of the patients, 84 suffered from MM and 62 from low- to intermediate-grade NHL, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia; 116 of 146 (79%) received chemotherapy during the study. The mean baseline Hb level was 9.4 +/- 1.0 g/dL. The median serum Epo level was 32 mU/mL, and endogenous Epo production was found to be defective in 77% of the patients, as judged by a value for the ratio of observed-to-predicted serum Epo levels (O/P ratio) of < or = 0.9. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed to evaluate treatment efficacy. The median average increase in Hb levels per week was 0.04 g/dL in the control group and -0.04 (P = .57), 0.22 (P = .05), 0.43 (P = .01), and 0.58 (P = .0001) g/dL in the 1,000 U, 2,000 U, 5,000 U, and 10,000 U groups, respectively (P values versus control). The probability of response (delta Hb > or = 2 g/dL) increased steadily and, after 8 weeks, reached 31% (2,000 U), 61% (5,000 U), and 62% (10,000 U), respectively. Regression analysis using Cox's proportional hazard model and classification and regression tree analysis showed that serum Epo levels and the O/P ratio were the most important factors predicting response in patients receiving 5,000 or 10,000 U. Approximately three quarters of patients presenting with Epo levels inappropriately low for the degree of anemia responded to rHuEpo, whereas only one quarter of those with adequate Epo levels did so. Classification and regression tree analysis also showed that doses of 2,000 U daily were effective in patients with an average platelet count greater than 150 x 10(9)/L. About 50% of these patients are expected to respond to rHuEpo. Thus, rHuEpo was safe and effective in ameliorating the anemia of MM and NHL patients who showed defective endogenous Epo production. From a practical point of view, we conclude that the decision to use rHuEpo in an individual anemic patient with MM or NHL should be based on serum Epo levels, whereas the choice of the initial dosage should be based on residual marrow function.","['Cazzola, M', 'Messinger, D', 'Battistel, V', 'Bron, D', 'Cimino, R', 'Enller-Ziegler, L', 'Essers, U', 'Greil, R', 'Grossi, A', 'Jager, G', 'LeMevel, A', 'Najman, A', 'Silingardi, V', 'Spriano, M', 'van Hoof, A', 'Ehmer, B']","['Cazzola M', 'Messinger D', 'Battistel V', 'Bron D', 'Cimino R', 'Enller-Ziegler L', 'Essers U', 'Greil R', 'Grossi A', 'Jager G', 'LeMevel A', 'Najman A', 'Silingardi V', 'Spriano M', 'van Hoof A', 'Ehmer B']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/etiology/*therapy', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Erythropoietin/administration & dosage/biosynthesis/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Life Tables', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Safety']",1995/12/15 00:00,1995/12/15 00:01,['1995/12/15 00:00'],"['1995/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65046-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Dec 15;86(12):4446-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herbimycin A inhibited the proliferation of human monoblastic leukemia U937 cells, but this inhibition was abrogated by the addition of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). On the other hand, a derivative of herbimycin A, 19-allylaminoherbimycin A, inhibited the proliferation of such cells without interference by the addition of GM-CSF. Phosphorylation of MAP kinase and c-myc expression induced by GM-CSF in U937 cells were inhibited by both herbimycin A and 19-allylaminoherbimycin A. The time courses of growth inhibition showed that the growth-inhibitory activity of herbimycin A in U937 cells was initially potent, but gradually decreased in the presence of GM-CSF. Thiol compounds, glutathione (GSH) and 2-mercaptoethanol, abrogated the inhibition of the growth of U937 cells by herbimycin A, but not by 19-allylaminoherbimycin A, like GM-CSF. Intracellular GSH content in U937 cells was increased by treatment with GM-CSF, and decreased with herbimycin A, but returned to the control level with the addition of GM-CSF to herbimycin A. In thin-layer chromatography, after in vitro incubation with herbimycin A and GSH, nothing could be detected at the position of intact herbimycin A, while 19-allylaminoherbimycin A was stably detected. These findings suggest that changes in the intracellular concentration of GSH play a role in the abrogation of the inhibition of U937 cell growth by herbimycin A. In the presence of GSH, 19-allylaminoherbimycin A inhibited the proliferation of U937 cells and Philadelphia chromosome-positive K562 cells more effectively than herbimycin A. Since GSH plays a role in detoxicating several anticancer drugs, 19-allylaminoherbimycin A may have therapeutic advantages over herbimycin A against some types of leukemia.","['Makishima, M', 'Yamamoto-Yamaguchi, Y', 'Honma, Y']","['Makishima M', 'Yamamoto-Yamaguchi Y', 'Honma Y']","['Department of Chemotherapy, Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '60-24-2 (Mercaptoethanol)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '94513-96-9 (19-allylaminoherbimycin A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzoquinones', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Probes', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genes, myc/genetics', 'Glutathione/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mercaptoethanol/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinones/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/12 00:00,1995/12/12 00:01,['1995/12/12 00:00'],"['1995/12/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/12 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['0925-4439(95)00096-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0925-4439(95)00096-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1995 Dec 12;1272(3):199-205. doi: 10.1016/0925-4439(95)00096-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall cancer mortality and seven specific sites were considered: all leukaemias, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, malignant brain tumours, kidney cancer, malignant bone neoplasms, and a broad category of ill-defined tumours. An age-period-cohort model was used to analyse the influence of age, period of death and birth cohort. Recent trends were estimated by restricting analysis to the last three 5-year periods. In general, mortality began to decline at the beginning of the 1970s, with reductions of 36% in males and 45% in females being registered between 1966-1970 and 1986-1990. The use of age-period-cohort models revealed an initially rising period effect attributable to diagnostic advances. The decline in mortality in post-1965 generations and the final downturn in the period effect are both most certainly a consequence of the remarkable progress achieved in the treatment of such tumours. During the final 15 years, there was a relative decline in mortality of approximately 20% every 5 years. However, in the case of malignant renal tumours in males and malignant bone tumours and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in both sexes the situation remained stable.","['Pollan, M', 'Lopez-Abente, G', 'Ruiz-Tovar, M', 'Martinez de Aragon, M V']","['Pollan M', 'Lopez-Abente G', 'Ruiz-Tovar M', 'Martinez de Aragon MV']","['Cancer Epidemiology Unit, National Centre of Epidemiology, Carlos III Institute of Health, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Bone Neoplasms/mortality', 'Brain Neoplasms/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Effect', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kidney Neoplasms/mortality', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Lymphoma/mortality', 'Male', 'Mortality/trends', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Sex Factors', 'Spain/epidemiology']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0959-8049(95)00427-K [pii]', '10.1016/0959-8049(95)00427-k [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1995 Oct;31A(11):1811-21. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(95)00427-k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The participants concluded that nasal T/natural killer (NK) cell lymphoma is a distinct clinicopathologic entity highly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). In situ hybridization for EBV an be very valuable in early diagnosis, especially if tissue is sparse. The cytologic spectrum is broad, ranging from small or medium-sized cells to large transformed cells. Histologic progression often occurs with time. Necrosis is nearly always present, and angioinvasion by tumor cells is seen in most cases. Nasal T/NK cell lymphoma has a characteristic immunophenotype: CD2-positive, CD56-positive, but usually negative for surface CD3. Cytoplasmic CD3 can be detected in paraffin sections. Clonal T-cell receptor gene rearrangement is not found. Tumors with an identical phenotype and genotype occur in other extranodal sites, most commonly in the skin, subcutis, and gastrointestinal tract, and should be referred to as nasal-type T/NK cell lymphomas.

METHODS: Peripheral blood samples of 18 HCL patients were studied by transmission electron microscopy. Five of these patients received IFN treatment and subsequently were evaluated at different intervals for ultrastructural modifications of the peripheral blood. RESULTS: RLC were observed in 66.66% of our 18 HCL patients, but in less than 1% of all the cases contained in the files (consisting of over 8,000 cases) of our Electron Microscopy Unit. The microvilli disappeared after IFN therapy in the patients who did not display RLC before therapy (2 cases), whereas they were fewer, shortened and blunted, but still evident, in the cases where RLC had been observed before therapy (3 cases). Moreover, in the HCL cases with pretherapy RLC, neoplastic cells still synthesized RLC after IFN treatment, but their morphologic aspect was immature. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that: 1) the presence of RLC, when associated to the hairy aspect of the cells, has considerable diagnostic value even though RLC are observed in other rare neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions; 2) HCL cases with pre-therapy RLC exhibited a morphologic response to IFN therapy different from that of cases without pre-therapy RLC; 3) the quantitative and qualitative modifications of RLC following IFN treatment, as yet unexplained, are probably related to IFN action, in line with a previous report.","['Morroni, M', 'Cinti, S']","['Morroni M', 'Cinti S']","['Institute of Normal Human Morphology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ancona - U.S.L. 12, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Ribosomes/*ultrastructure', 'Time Factors']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 1995 Jul-Aug;81(4):249-55.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is now clear that there is a complex interaction between the cytokines with interleukin-6 predominant, but also involving interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor and a group of recently described cytokines including as well interleukin-11, leukaemia inhibitory factor and oncostatin M all of which influence the levels of acute phase proteins. In clinical practice, C reactive protein (CRP) is frequently used as marker of the acute-phase response. It has a short half-life and consequently it is a sensitive measure of cytokine-induced protein synthesis. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) the rate appearance of bony erosions in the early phase of the disease correlated with the mean serum concentration of CRP in some studies. A recent study examining the rate of spinal trabecular bone loss in the first year of rheumatoid disease found a strong correlation between bone loss and serum CRP concentrations. It appears that CRP concentrations reflect the level of ""systemic osteoclast-activating factor"" and are, therefore, a good measure of the general catabolic state of the patient.

We have proposed that the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 delta 4,7,10,13,16,19) may induce structural changes in tumor cell plasma membranes resulting in reduced tumor growth in vitro. Here, we test whether liposomes containing DHA (18:0, 22:6 PC) have antitumor effects in vivo, leading to enhanced longevity of the tumor-bearing host. Male BALB/c mice (6-8 weeks old) were inoculated intraperitoneally with a T27A tumor dose known to cause 100% mortality of syngeneic (BALB/c) mice in less than 2 weeks. Small unilamellar vesicles (liposomes) were prepared, composed of phosphatidylcholine (PC) with 18:0 in the sn-l position and one of the following fatty acids in the sn-2 position: 18:0, 18:1 omega 9 (oleic), 18:3 omega 3 (alpha-linolenic), 20:4 omega 6 (arachidonic), 22:6 omega 3 (docosahexaenoic). The liposomes were injected intraperitoneally into tumor-bearing mice at various times: concurrently with the tumor inoculum, at select times during tumor growth, and when the mice were moribund. Mouse survival was then charted. DHA-containing lipid vesicles (18:0, 22:6 PC) caused a statistically significant increase in survival of the tumor-bearing mice when compared with 18:0, 18:1 PC. Lipid vesicles of 18:0, 18:0 PC showed no benefit, and 18:0, 20:4 PC was not significantly different than 18:0, 18:1 PC. Lipid vesicles containing a different omega-3 fatty acid, 18:0, 18:3 PC, also effectively enhanced tumor-bearing mouse survival. The greatest benefit was achieved if either the liposome treatments were spaced throughout the tumor growth period, or if the tumor inoculum was suspended in the liposome preparation (without further liposome treatments). Neither lipid peroxidation nor prolonged inflammatory responses appeared to be pertinent, leaving membrane structural changes as a feasible mode of liposome action. With antitumor properties of their own, omega-3 fatty acid-containing lipid vesicles may offer an important new avenue in combination cancer therapies.","['Jenski, L J', 'Zerouga, M', 'Stillwell, W']","['Jenski LJ', 'Zerouga M', 'Stillwell W']","['Department of Biology, Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis 46303-5132, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Soc Exp Biol Med,"Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

Multiparameter flow cytometry was used to simultaneously measure nuclear DNA content, RB protein, and MYC or FOS protein per cell. The amount of RB protein per cell increased with progression through the cell cycle. As the amount of RB protein increased, the ratio of RB to MYC or to FOS protein could be determined per cell as a function of cell cycle phase. Although the amount of RB protein per cell increased with progression through successive cell cycle phases, during S phase the relative rate of increase was not as rapid as that of nuclear DNA. The amount of MYC and FOS per cell also increased throughout the cell cycle, but also more slowly than DNA during S. The ratio of the amount of RB protein to MYC protein remained constant throughout the cell cycle, consistent with putative co-regulation suggested by previous studies of promoter structure. In contrast, the ratio of RB protein to FOS protein increased with progression through the phases of the cell cycle, consistent with a putative negative effect of RB on FOS which was found in previous studies with transgenes and reporters. There was no significant change in these ratios with myelo-monocytic differentiation. Although MYC and FOS have both been implicated as growth-promoting oncogenes putatively transregulated by RB, their behavior during the cell cycle relative to RB is thus distinguishable. Interestingly, in the case of all three of these putative cell cycle regulatory proteins, their cell cycle phase-specific expression levels are consistent with a minimum amount per cell that is necessary but not sufficient for progression to the next cell cycle phase.","['Yen, A', 'Varvayanis, S']","['Yen A', 'Varvayanis S']","['Department of Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Soc Exp Biol Med,"Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

Toxicities generally are mild, predictable, and rapidly reversible after therapy is discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, cladribine primarily is used in hairy cell leukemia therapy. Clinical trials of cladribine in treating other hematologic malignancies, primarily chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, have demonstrated encouraging results. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Nursing care for patients who receive cladribine involves management of side effects, which commonly include myelosuppression and fever, and monitoring of hemoglobin, platelet levels, and body temperature. Fever develops in most patients receiving cladribine but is usually transient and easily treated with acetaminophen.

For each type of MDS, MRI patterns of the femoral marrow were evaluated and compared with those in normal subjects as well as in patients with aplastic anemia. Signal intensity alteration, a low signal on T1-weighted SE image and a high signal on STIR image, began in the proximal femoral marrow almost symmetrically in patients with MDS. The area of abnormal signal intensity tended to gradually extend towards the distal portion of the femur as the disease progressed. MRI patterns of the femoral marrow correlated with marrow cellularity, and diffuse marrow infiltration was noted in patients with a more advanced type of MDS or with severe anemia. There were limitations to making an accurate diagnosis of the MDS type on the basis of the MRI pattern. Progression of the MRI appearance in the course of MDS was thought to be a sign suggesting evolution to AML.

Polyamines support sustained growth and are highly regulated in all cells. The rate limiting enzyme for this pathway is ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), an enzyme that exhibits rapid turnover, and converts the amino acid ornithine to putrescine, which in turn is converted to the longer chain amines spermidine and spermine. In animal models of colon carcinogenesis, inhibition of ODC by difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitor, reduces the number and size of colon adenomas and carcinomas. DFMO was first ineffective when used clinically to treat acute leukemia or melanoma and caused clinically significant but reversible ototoxicity. Subsequently, we performed a series of analyses demonstrating that hearing loss was rare below a total cumulative dose of 150 gm/m2 and increased with total cumulative dose of DFMO. The hearing loss was reversible with rapid reversion to baseline hearing. We and others have conducted Phase IIa trials to determine the lowest dose at which DFMO can decrease colon mucosa polyamine content, and found that an oral dose as low as 0.25 gm/m2 per day (perhaps lower) decreases colon tissue putrescine content and lowers the spermidine/spermine ratio. We are currently conducting a long-term randomized Phase IIb trial which serially measures the long-term effect of several low doses (and placebo) of DFMO on sustaining polyamine depletion in colon mucosa, as well as carefully monitoring hearing by audiometry and other sophisticated tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Meyskens, F L Jr', 'Gerner, E W']","['Meyskens FL Jr', 'Gerner EW']","['Department of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, Orange 92668, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem Suppl,Journal of cellular biochemistry.

HTLV-I genome contains the novel pX region in addition to the genes common to all retroviruses. Tax, encoded at the pX region, may play a central role in cellular transformation, however, little information is available on the mechanism. Tax transactivates transcription through three different pathways, namely, CRE, kB motif and CArG box mediated pathways. In ras cooperative focus formation in REF, transcriptional activation through the CArG box seems to play an important role, although transcription through the CRE pathway plays a central role in tax-mediated transformation of Rat-2 cells. These results suggest that the mechanism of transformation by tax varies with the cell type and/or the property of transformation.","['Matsumoto, K']",['Matsumoto K'],['Osaka Red Cross Blood Center.'],['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Nihon Rinsho,Nihon rinsho.

The predicted amino acid sequence of THZif-1 included a DNA-binding domain that contained five tandemly repeated zinc finger motifs. The three amino-terminal sets of zinc finger motifs, including the second finger, were found to be responsible for high-affinity interactions with the triple-helical conformation of NHE, as well as for high-affinity binding to the single-pyrimidine-rich strand of NHE in a sequence-specific manner. Cotransfection, trans-activation and in vitro transcription studies using the wild-type form and THZif-1 with a mutated second zinc finger motif demonstrated that the DNA-binding activity specific for H-form DNA of NHE was a prerequisite for the negative regulation of the expression of the c-myc gene.","['Yokoyama, K', 'Tsutsui, H', 'Fujita, A']","['Yokoyama K', 'Tsutsui H', 'Fujita A']","['RIKEN (The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research), Tsukuba Life Science Center.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Nihon Rinsho,Nihon rinsho.

METHODS--Immunoenzymatic staining procedures, immunoperoxidase and immunoalkaline phosphatase, were used with a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed to HCL associated antigens. Ultrastructural immunostaining was performed using colloidal gold conjugated antibodies. RESULTS--HCL showed strong cytoplasmic reactivity for CD22, CD25, CD103, DBA.44, kappa, or lambda light chains. Peripheral blood diagnostic hairy cells were found in all the cases with absolute counts ranging from 0.11 x 10(9)/l up to 6.4 x 10(9)/l and values increasing with the size of the spleen. A median of 36.5% of leukaemic cells was found in bone marrow aspirates and 70% in bone marrow trephine specimens. The monoclonal antibodies CD22 and DBA.44 showed the highest and the lowest percentage of positive hairy cells, respectively; this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0025). Ultrastructural immunolabelling with DBA.44 showed a cytoplasmic membrane localisation of the antigen in one case of HCL variant. CONCLUSIONS--(1) Immunocytochemistry is a useful technique which enhances the accuracy of diagnosis in HCL; (2) peripheral blood immunocytochemistry is recommended because it highlights hairy cells in all cases; (3) CD22 appears to be the most sensitive of the markers tested; (4) ultrastructural analysis is a useful tool in selected cases of HCL variant.","['Cordone, I', 'Annino, L', 'Masi, S', 'Pescarmona, E', 'Rahimi, S', 'Ferrari, A', 'Giubilei, E', 'Pignoloni, P', 'Faraggiana, T', 'Mandelli, F']","['Cordone I', 'Annino L', 'Masi S', 'Pescarmona E', 'Rahimi S', 'Ferrari A', 'Giubilei E', 'Pignoloni P', 'Faraggiana T', 'Mandelli F']","['Institute of Haematology, La Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis/blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/diagnosis/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.48.10.955 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1995 Oct;48(10):955-60. doi: 10.1136/jcp.48.10.955.,,,,,,PMC502955,,,,,,,,

METHODS--A set of 26 reference samples confirmed as HTLV-I antibody positive were assembled from patients with tropical spastic paraparesis or adult T cell leukaemia and blood donors. Serum samples and simulated antibody positive dried blood spot eluates were tested using the Serodia assay together with two confirmatory tests: HTLV BLOT 2.3, a western blot, and Select-HTLV, an enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Both confirmatory tests use synthetic peptides to differentiate between antibodies to HTLV-I and -II. The modified Serodia assay was then used to test anonymously 10,135 DBS collected from neonates from London. Samples reactive in the modified Serodia test producing a positive result were titrated to an end point and confirmed as before. RESULTS--All 26 eluates made from simulated DBS derived from positive reference samples were identified as positive by the modified Serodia HTLV-I test and were confirmed as anti-HTLV-I positive by EIA. Two eluates derived from relatively low titre reference samples gave indeterminate results on western blotting. Screening of the 10,135 neonatal DBS resulted in six repeat reactives, five of which were confirmed. The remaining reactive sample gave an indeterminate result on western blotting and there was insufficient eluate for testing by EIA. The overall seroprevalence of HTLV-I in this population was 0.05% (five of 10,135). CONCLUSION--The modified Serodia HTLV-I assay provides a sensitive, specific and inexpensive (10 pence/test) method for screening large numbers of DBS. The format of the assay makes it ideally suited for simultaneous screening of antibodies to HIV-1, HIV-2 and HTLV-I using semi-automated equipment.","['Parker, S P', 'Taylor, M B', 'Ades, A E', 'Cubitt, W D', 'Peckham, C']","['Parker SP', 'Taylor MB', 'Ades AE', 'Cubitt WD', 'Peckham C']","['Department of Virology, Institute of Child Health, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Agglutination Tests/standards', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*blood', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Serologic Tests/*methods/standards']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.48.10.904 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1995 Oct;48(10):904-7. doi: 10.1136/jcp.48.10.904.,,,,,,PMC502943,,,,,,,,

After entering the cells, viral particles were frequently detected inside cytoplasmic vesicles of variable size. Their viral envelope was apparently lost during intracytoplasmic transport.

The starting event in the activation of intracellular signaling is the binding of the IL-6/IL-6R alpha subcomplex to two gp130 chains. The homodimerization of gp130 is triggered by two distinct and independent regions of IL-6 called sites 2 and 3. Several IL-6 antagonists have been obtained that affect signaling, but not IL-6 IL-6R alpha subcomplex formation. In this paper, we analyze in detail the impact of these antagonists on gp130 binding and dimerization and show that each signaling variant affects gp130 dimerization in vitro and that biological activity on cells decreases in precise parallel to the decrease in gp130 dimerization in vitro. All IL-6 antagonists can be classified into two groups, mapping at either site 2 or 3 in correspondence to their mode of interaction with gp130. We found that site 3 is a large region, which includes residues at the beginning of helix D spatially flanked by residues in the putative AB loop and located at one extremity of the cytokine 4-helix bundle. Interestingly, in leukemia inhibitory factor, another cytokine that signals through gp130, site 3, is topologically conserved but has evolved to bind leukemia inhibitory factor receptor.","['Ciapponi, L', 'Graziani, R', 'Paonessa, G', 'Lahm, A', 'Ciliberto, G', 'Savino, R']","['Ciapponi L', 'Graziani R', 'Paonessa G', 'Lahm A', 'Ciliberto G', 'Savino R']","['Istituto di Ricerche di Biologie Molecolare (IRBM), Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/29 00:00,1995/12/29 00:01,['1995/12/29 00:00'],"['1995/12/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/29 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.52.31249 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)35384-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Dec 29;270(52):31249-54. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.52.31249.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cDNA was 1,097 base-pairs long, and included 822 base-pairs of an open reading frame. As judged from the deduced amino acid sequence, rMCT is highly homologous to mouse mast cell protease-6, and is considered to be translated as a prepro-enzyme with a 19-amino acid signal peptide, a 10-amino acid activation peptide, and a 245-amino acid mature enzyme. The rMCT mRNA was not detected in peritoneal cells of mast cell-deficient Ws/Ws rats, though it was strongly detected in ones of littermate +/+ and Lewis rats. In addition to in peritoneal mast cells, the rMCT mRNA was detected in the tongue. However, mRNA signals were not detected in the small intestine regardless of N. brasiliensis infection. Nor were mRNA signals detected in RBL2H3 rat basophilic leukemia cells. In the lung, the rMCT mRNA was strongly detected after infection with N. brasiliensis, though it was only faintly detected before infection. These results suggest that the rMCT is basically specific for connective tissue mast cells, but not for mucosal mast cells and that it is up-regulated in the lung during the inflammatory process of a parasitic infection.","['Ide, H', 'Itoh, H', 'Tomita, M', 'Murakumo, Y', 'Kobayashi, T', 'Maruyama, H', 'Osada, Y', 'Nawa, Y']","['Ide H', 'Itoh H', 'Tomita M', 'Murakumo Y', 'Kobayashi T', 'Maruyama H', 'Osada Y', 'Nawa Y']","['Department of Parasitology, Miyazaki Medical College.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tpsb2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (chymase 2)', 'EC 3.4.21.39 (Chymases)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tpsab1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tpsab1 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tpsb2 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chymases', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Complementary/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/enzymology', 'Mast Cells/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organ Specificity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Serine Endopeptidases/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Species Specificity', 'Tryptases']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a124880 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem. 1995 Jul;118(1):210-5. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a124880.,,,,['GENBANK/D38455'],,,,,,,,,,

Because the enzyme functions as part of a peptide regulatory loop, the fact that CD10/NEP itself varies with cellular activation is of considerable interest. In hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell types, the levels of CD10/NEP protein and enzymatic activity correlate with transcript abundance. For these reasons, we investigated the regulation of CD10/NEP transcripts in the phorbol ester-treated acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, REH. When REH cells are treated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), CD10/NEP transcripts rapidly decrease in a labile protein-dependent manner. PMA has a modest effect on CD10/NEP transcription and significantly reduces CD10/NEP mRNA stability. Of note, the predicted secondary structure of the CD10/NEP 3' untranslated region includes several stem loop structures that may affect the stability of CD10/NEP transcripts.","['Ishimaru, F', 'Potter, N S', 'Shipp, M A']","['Ishimaru F', 'Potter NS', 'Shipp MA']","['Department of Medicine, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA, Complementary/chemistry', 'Drug Stability', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neprilysin/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1996 Jan;24(1):43-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vesnarinone alone markedly induced erythroid differentiation of HEL cells. All-trans-retinoic acid also induced erythroid differentiation of the cells, and the differentiation was greatly enhanced by combined treatment with vesnarinone and retinoic acid. HEL cells are highly resistant to some anticancer drugs, including vincristine, but treatment with vesnarinone greatly increased the sensitivity of HEL cells to vincristine. Enhancement of vincristine sensitivity by vesnarinone was not as significant for other leukemia cells. Expression of P-glycoprotein in HEL cells was effectively inhibited by vesnarinone, suggesting that the restoration of vincristine sensitivity is associated with decrease of P-glycoprotein expression in HEL cells. The plasma level of vesnarinone required to induce differentiation of leukemia cells is 30 micrograms/mL, which could be achieved with oral administration. These results suggest that vesnarinone should be useful in differentiation therapy for some types of myelogenous leukemia.","['Sato, S', 'Tomoyasu, S', 'Okabe-Kado, J', 'Hozumi, M', 'Tsuruoka, N', 'Nakai, S', 'Adachi, M', 'Honma, Y']","['Sato S', 'Tomoyasu S', 'Okabe-Kado J', 'Hozumi M', 'Tsuruoka N', 'Nakai S', 'Adachi M', 'Honma Y']","['Department of Chemotherapy, Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Cardiotonic Agents)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '5COW40EV8M (vesnarinone)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cardiotonic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Muramidase/metabolism', 'Pyrazines', 'Quinolines/*pharmacology', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1996 Jan;24(1):37-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cell lines, previously established in our laboratory, are highly radiotolerant without cell detachment and support long-term cultures of CD(34+)-enriched human cord blood cells. RT-PCR analysis of 22 different cytokines or cytokine receptor mRNAs showed an almost identical expression pattern in the two stromal cell lines compared to primary human Dexter-type stroma. Since stromal feeder lines employed in long-term cultures usually are irradiated and grown in media containing corticosteroids, we analyzed the impact of irradiation and dexamethasone on cytokine production in the two cell lines by RT-PCR, Northern blot analysis, bioassays, and RIAs. By RT-PCR analysis, constitutive mRNA expression of c-kit, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-11, Kit ligand (KL), LIF, M-CSF, MIP-1 alpha, TGF-beta, and TNF-alpha was demonstrated in both cell lines, with L87/4 a more potent cytokine producer than L88/5. Northern blot data showed an increase in mRNA levels for GM-CSF, IL-1 beta, and LIF by irradiation and IL-1 alpha treatment in both cell lines. IL-1 alpha-induced GM-CSF, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-11, and LIF mRNA levels were reduced by the addition of dexamethasone, whereas dexamethasone had no influence on the amounts of IL-1 alpha-induced G-CSF mRNA.

One line, WEG-1, retained epithelial morphology and reacted with antibodies to cytokeratins 18, 19, laminin, fibronectin, and beta-catenin. In addition, WEG-1 cells displayed strong nuclear immunoreactivity to SV40 large T-antigen, confirming integration of the retrovirus vector and expression of this gene. WEG-1 cells were negative for nonepithelial markers such as desmin and factor 8. WEG-1 cells did not proliferate in serum-free medium; however, addition of 0.5% FBS supported proliferation to the same extent as 10% FBS. Addition of 50 ng/ml epidermal growth factor to medium containing 0.5% charcoal-stripped FBS restored proliferation comparable with 0.5% whole FBS. Epidermal growth factor or transforming growth factor-alpha (50 ng/ml), but not transforming growth factor-beta, leukemia-inhibiting factor, or fibroblast growth factor, induced the secretion of three proteins (M(r) approximately to 158K, 148K, and 36K). Comparison of protein secretions of WEG-1 cells and UEC showed shared as well as distinct bands. Like UEC, WEG-1 cells secreted PGF2a and PGE2 and expressed PG GH synthase-2. Unlike UEC, WEG-1 cells showed no apical/basal preference for either uptake of methionine or secretion of proteins. The absence of immunoreactive E-cadherin or zona occludens-1 was consistent with the absence of cell polarity in WEG-1 cells. Primary UEC, which polarize in vitro, do not support blastocyst attachment. WEG-1 cells, although not polarized in vitro, also exhibited delayed blastocyst attachment compared with nonuterine cell lines, suggesting that WEG-1 cells partially retained some aspects of UEC function relevant to embryo attachment. WEG-1 cells expressed messenger RNA for Muc-1, an UEC mucin suggested to have antiadhesive properties. Furthermore, WEG-1 cells did not display high affinity heparin binding sites, an activity associated with embryo attachment. WEG-1 cells may provide a model for studying various aspects of UEC function and murine embryo attachment.","['Wegner, C C', 'Cherington, V', 'Clemens, J W', 'Jacobs, A L', 'Julian, J', 'Surveyor, G A', 'Bell, E C', 'Carson, D D']","['Wegner CC', 'Cherington V', 'Clemens JW', 'Jacobs AL', 'Julian J', 'Surveyor GA', 'Bell EC', 'Carson DD']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Molecular Probes)', '0 (Prostaglandins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor alpha)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Cell Line', 'Embryo, Mammalian/physiology', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/*pharmacology', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Methionine/pharmacokinetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Probes/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/metabolism', 'Prostaglandins/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor alpha/*pharmacology', 'Uterus/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.137.1.8536610 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1996 Jan;137(1):175-84. doi: 10.1210/endo.137.1.8536610.,"['CA-44761/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UO1-HD-29963/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['GENBANK/M82862', 'GENBANK/M82863', 'GENBANK/M82864', 'GENBANK/M82865', 'GENBANK/M82866']",,,,,,,,,,

It has been proposed that the subsequent fall in sEPO constitutes a relative erythropoietin (EPO) deficiency, prompting trials of recombinant EPO to reduce red cell transfusion during chemotherapy. We have investigated these phenomena by serial estimations of reticulocytes and sEPO in 11 autologous marrow transplant recipients. sEPO reached two to five times baseline 0 to 5 days after transplant but the inverse relationship between sEPO and haematocrit was maintained. Observed to expected log sEPO (Epo ratio) rose and fell in parallel with sEPO, remaining greater than 1.0 throughout. A progressive fall in reticulocyte count during chemotherapy was followed by an increase during engraftment. The strong inverse relationships between reticulocytes and Epo ratio in the 10 days after initiating chemotherapy support the hypothesis that loss of EPO-receptor bearing erythroid precursors allows a rise in sEPO during chemotherapy. The elevation of Epo ratio levels during engraftment indicates that it is the availability of EPO-sensitive progenitors, rather than the supply of EPO, that limits the rate of resumption of erythropoiesis after high-dose chemotherapy.","['Davies, S V', 'Fegan, C D', 'Kendall, R', 'Beguin, Y', 'Cavill, I']","['Davies SV', 'Fegan CD', 'Kendall R', 'Beguin Y', 'Cavill I']","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Lab Haematol,Clinical and laboratory haematology,7907061,['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin/*blood', 'Hematocrit', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Reticulocyte Count', 'Reticulocytes/pathology', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Lab Haematol. 1995 Jun;17(2):139-44.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The scatterplots could be reproducibly sorted into pattern-specific groups without knowledge of the diagnosis. Precise leukaemic diagnoses were made routinely by conventional morphology, cytochemistry and immunophenotyping. A comparison was then made with the scatterplot patterns. The 51 cases of AML produced examples of all six patterns. The nine cases of ALL produced only three patterns.

Following our demonstration that normal B cells are capable of activating the AP of complement in a CR2-dependent fashion, we have chosen to re-examine the complement-activating ability of B CLL cells in relation to their altered phenotype with respect to CR2 and the complement regulatory membrane proteins, CR1, decay accelerating factor (DAF) (CD55) and membrane cofactor protein (MCP) (CD46). Flow cytometry was used to measure expression of complement receptors and regulatory proteins on CD5+ B cells from CLL patients, as well as the deposition of C3 fragments occurring both in vivo and after in vitro AP activation. We have confirmed the reduced expression of CR1 and CR2 on CLL cells and have shown that AP activation in the presence of homologous, normal serum was reduced on B CLL cells compared with normal B cells. The degree of AP activation correlated directly with CR2 expression. In addition, we observed that CLL cells bear in vivo-deposited C3d,g, although at a significantly lower level than normal B cells.","['Marquart, H V', 'Gronbaek, K', 'Christensen, B E', 'Svehag, S E', 'Leslie, R G']","['Marquart HV', 'Gronbaek K', 'Christensen BE', 'Svehag SE', 'Leslie RG']","['Department of Medical Microbiology, Odense University, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Complement C3)', '0 (Receptors, Complement 3d)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', '*Complement Activation', 'Complement C3/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Complement 3d/analysis']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2249.1995.tb03855.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1995 Dec;102(3):575-81. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2249.1995.tb03855.x.,,,,,,PMC1553367,,,,,,,,

Some of the effects of retroviruses on immune cell function are thought to be mediated through cytokines. Friend ImmunoSuppressive virus-2 (FIS-2) is a low oncogenic murine leukaemia virus (MuLV) that induces lymphadenopathy and immunosuppression in NMRI mice. The role of T cell cytokines during the generation of a primary antibody response in healthy and FIS-2-infected mice was studied following the antibody response to sheep erythrocytes by an in vitro immunization (IVI) technique. In cultures from FIS-2-infected mice, the antibody response was reduced compared with cultures from uninfected mice and the production of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-6 was elevated, whereas the Th1 cytokines IL-2, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were reduced. The suppressed anti-sheep erythrocyte antibody response in cultures from mice infected with FIS-2 seemed to be caused by an insufficient production of IL-2, since addition of recombinant IL-2 stimulated the antibody response. This effect was also observed in cultures depleted of T cells, indicating a direct effect of IL-2 on B cells. A switch to a Th2 cell response and suppression of IL-2 production might play a central role in the immune cell dysfunction induced by FIS-2.","['Faxvaag, A', 'Espevik, T', 'Dalen, A']","['Faxvaag A', 'Espevik T', 'Dalen A']","['Institute of Cancer Research, University of Trondheim, Medisinsk Teknisk Centre, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Formation/drug effects', 'Erythrocytes/*immunology', 'Female', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Immunoglobulin M/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Sheep', 'Th1 Cells/*immunology', 'Th2 Cells/*immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2249.1995.tb03842.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1995 Dec;102(3):487-95. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2249.1995.tb03842.x.,,,,,,PMC1553373,,,,,,,,

Random change or tip of the iceberg?,37-42,"Finding a clone in the bone marrow of a patient with a hematologic disorder is important to confirm the neoplastic nature of the disease and may be indicative of prognosis. Since cytogenetic analysis detects only actively dividing clones, the presence of a single abnormal cell among 20 cells analyzed raises doubts about its clonal nature. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) enables rapid detection of certain chromosomal abnormalities in metaphase and interphase cells, thus enabling detection of minor or inactive clones. Seven patients with hematologic malignancy each having random cell(s) were investigated thus: at diagnosis, with MDS and a cell with +8 (two cases) or +9 (one case) and with AML and a cell with +4 (one case), +7 (one case), or two cells with +9, +22/ +10, +17, +17 (one case). One patient with ALL in remission had one cell with trisomy 4. One patient, a male aged 66 years with refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, was found to have a minor trisomy 8 clone in his diagnostic marrow. A follow-up marrow 42 months later showed no trisomy 8 cell among 62 metaphases analyzed, and the percentage of trisomic cells using FISH on interphase cells was within the control range. This patient has survived for more than 42 months requiring no treatment. Single-cell abnormalities in the other six cases proved to be random events. Thus it appears that single-cell abnormalities may not be clonal or at most indicate the presence of a minor clone well below the level of cytogenetic detection. The prognostic significance of such minor clones is at present unclear.","['Kasprzyk, A', 'Mehta, A B', 'Secker-Walker, L M']","['Kasprzyk A', 'Mehta AB', 'Secker-Walker LM']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Child', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prognosis', '*Trisomy']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165460895001158 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(95)00115-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1995 Nov;85(1):37-42. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(95)00115-8.,,,['Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1996 Aug;90(1):91-2.

We also studied by PCR-SSCP and direct sequencing the p53 gene in patients with specimens available in both chronic phase and blast crisis. We identified p53 mutations in 17% of the blast crisis samples analyzed, whereas no abnormalities were found in CP. This finding suggests that only in a minor fraction of cases are lesions in the p53 gene involved in transformation.

Although the overall organization of HIV-1 RT is known from previously reported crystal structures, no structure of a complex including a metal ion, which is essential for its catalytic activity, has been reported. RESULTS: Here we describe the structures at 1.8 Angstrum resolution of a catalytically active fragment of RT from Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) and at 2.6 Angstrum of a complex of this fragment with Mn2+ coordinated in the polymerase active site. On the basis of similarities with HIV-1 RT and rat DNA polymerase beta, we have modeled template/primer and deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate substrates into the MMLV RT structure. CONCLUSIONS: Our model, in the context of the disposition of evolutionarily conserved residues seen here at high resolution, provides new insights into the mechanisms of catalysis, fidelity, processivity and discrimination between deoxyribose and ribose nucleotides.","['Georgiadis, M M', 'Jessen, S M', 'Ogata, C M', 'Telesnitsky, A', 'Goff, S P', 'Hendrickson, W A']","['Georgiadis MM', 'Jessen SM', 'Ogata CM', 'Telesnitsky A', 'Goff SP', 'Hendrickson WA']","['Waksman Institute, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08855, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Structure,"Structure (London, England : 1993)",101087697,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Metals)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA Primers/chemistry/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/chemistry/metabolism', 'HIV-1/enzymology', 'Metals/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'Protein Conformation', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleoproteins/chemistry', 'Sequence Alignment']",1995/09/15 00:00,1995/09/15 00:01,['1995/09/15 00:00'],"['1995/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0969-2126(01)00223-4 [pii]', '10.1016/S0969-2126(01)00223-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Structure. 1995 Sep 15;3(9):879-92. doi: 10.1016/S0969-2126(01)00223-4.,"['F32 CA09021-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-34102/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conflicting results regarding mdr1 gene expression and clinical outcome have been obtained. Little is known about regulation of mdr1 gene expression, and the conflicting results might be explained by the fact that mdr1 RNA levels do not reflect expression at the protein level. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between mdr1 RNA levels and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) content of leukemic cells from patients with acute myelogenous or lymphocytic leukemia. Mdr1 RNA levels were determined by a quantitative RNA-RNA solution hybridization method, and Pgp by Western blot technique with enhanced chemiluminescence for immunodetection. Pgp was detected in 14/14 leukemic cell samples while mdr1 RNA was detectable (> 0.15 copies/cell) in cells from only six out of the 14 patients. Mdr1 RNA levels did not correlate with the Pgp content of leukemic cells (r = 0.284, p = 0.306). Relapsed leukemias had significantly (p = 0.016) higher levels of Pgp than de novo untreated leukemias (the mean and SD optical density units were 0.56 +/- 0.18 and 0.25 +/- 0.17 respectively) while no difference was found in RNA levels.

Adjuvants examined in this study were sodium glycocholate (Na-GC), sodium deoxycholate (Na-DC), O-n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltopyranoside (LM), and sodium salicylate. Among various additives, bile salts such as Na-GC and Na-DC were the most effective for increasing the cytotoxicity of MMC against L1210 cells. A dose-dependent increase in cytotoxic effect of MMC was observed in the presence of these bile salts. To elucidate a possible mechanism for enhancing the cytotoxic effect of MMC by the bile salts, the cellular uptake of MMC with or without Na-GC was examined using L1210 cells. The cellular concentration of MMC was determined by a reversed-phase HPLC. When Na-GC was coadministered with MMC, the uptake of MMC into L1210 cells was significantly enhanced as compared with MMC alone. Furthermore, the membrane fluidity of L1210 cells, as determined by fluorescence polarization, was increased in the presence of Na-GC. These results suggested that the enhancement of cytotoxicity of MMC by the addition of Na-GC could be attributed to the increasing cellular uptake of MMC due to the increasing membrane fluidity of L1210 cells.","['Tamura, T', 'Fujita, T', 'Itoh, Y', 'Sugimoto, S', 'Yamada, H', 'Murakami, M', 'Yamamoto, A', 'Muranishi, S']","['Tamura T', 'Fujita T', 'Itoh Y', 'Sugimoto S', 'Yamada H', 'Murakami M', 'Yamamoto A', 'Muranishi S']","['Department of Biopharmaceutics, Kyoto Pharmaceutical University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '1720-32-7 (Diphenylhexatriene)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '71316-28-4 (1-(4-(trimethylamino)phenyl)-6-phenylhexa-1,3,5-triene)', 'G59NX3I3RT (Glycocholic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Diphenylhexatriene/analogs & derivatives', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Glycocholic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Membrane Fluidity/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitomycin/*pharmacology', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb.18.1109 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 1995 Aug;18(8):1109-13. doi: 10.1248/bpb.18.1109.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of relapse was then compared against that for matched leukemic control recipients of undepleted cells from the same donors. FCM analysis of the depletion protocol indicated that exposure to anti-Asialo-GM1 antibody eliminated more than half of the donor NK1.1+ cells, but caused no significant losses among the Thy-1+, CD3+, or CD8+ cells. Nevertheless, fatal relapse among the leukemic recipients of the depleted cells was nearly double that found among the leukemic control recipients of undepleted cells, 47.5 vs 25.4% (P = 0.01). In a parallel study, using normal SJL/J recipients, this same depletion protocol was found to have no significant effect on the incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

Eighteen (52.9%) were found to have myeloid blast crisis. Cytochemically, myeloperoxidase (MPO) could be detected only in six patients on light microscopy while in the remaining 12 patients, myeloid differentiation was confirmed only by demonstration of MPO either at ultrastructural level or by the reactivity with anti myeloperoxidase (anti MPO) antibody. Six (17.6%) had lymphoid blast crisis as identified by lymphoid specific markers (CD19; CD10; CD7; CD4) along with the absence of myeloid markers. Heterogenous blast cell populations with mixed lineage differentiation were seen in 4 (11.7%) patients. These cases showed both lymphoid (CD19, CD10) and myeloid (anti MPO and ultrastructural MPO) characteristics. A single case of megakaryoblastic blast crisis was identified with positivity for CD41 and CD42 along with the presence of platelet peroxidase at the ultrastructural level. Five cases (14%) of CML blast crisis remained unclassifiable. These results suggest that blast crisis in CML show an arrest of differentiation at an early stage when compared to de novo acute leukemias. This is particularly evident from the fact that MPO could only be demonstrated ultrastructurally or with anti MPO antibody in the majority of patients with myeloid differentiation. It is expected that utilisation of molecular studies including immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangement and m-RNA expression for myeloperoxidase will provide a better insight into the level of differentiation for the presently unclassifiable cases of CML-blast crisis.","['Nair, C', 'Chopra, H', 'Shinde, S', 'Barbhaya, S', 'Kumar, A', 'Dhond, S', 'Yejamanam, B', 'Sapre, R', 'Chougule, A', 'Advani, S']","['Nair C', 'Chopra H', 'Shinde S', 'Barbhaya S', 'Kumar A', 'Dhond S', 'Yejamanam B', 'Sapre R', 'Chougule A', 'Advani S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Parel, Bombay, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Blast Crisis/*immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Peroxidase/*metabolism']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509107903 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Oct;19(3-4):309-13. doi: 10.3109/10428199509107903.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the effect of anti (alpha) APO1 Ab on spontaneous apoptosis (SA) and bcl-2 expression in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) in vitro. We also investigated the anti-apoptotic activity of interleukin 4 (IL4) on the aAPO1-induced apoptosis in B-CLL cells. Although expression of APO1 on B-CLL cells was not detectable by immunofluorescence, alpha APO1 Ab induced apoptosis in these cells. At 24 hours in culture the number of apoptotic cells was increased by a mean percentage (%) of 27% (range: 21-38) in only half of the cases studied. But in all twelve cases studied, at 48 hours alpha APO1 increased SA by a mean of 72% (range: 26-114) (P < .001) and at 72 hours, the mean % increase was 69% (range: 31-96) in 6/7 cases (P < .001). This effect was alpha APO1 concentration dependent. Interleukin 4 significantly protected B-CLL cells against alpha APO1-induced apoptosis by a mean of 53% (range: 28-76) (P < .001). This protection was specific to IL4 and it was significantly reduced or abolished with alpha IL4 Ab. Expression of bcl-2 protein in untreated cultures was not significantly different from that of the alpha APO1-treated cells; the mean equivalent of soluble fluorochrome (MESF) (range) was 4.9 (3.0-6.8) and 5.2 (3.5-6.0) respectively (P > 0.2). In fresh B-CLL cells the MESF (range) was 4.5 (2.4-6.6).

In contrast, 22 patients with Binet stage A and eight patients with Binet stage B disease were found to be negative for trisomy 12. As occurrence of trisomy 12 was associated with the presence of B-symptoms and hepatosplenomegaly, its association with advanced disease was further considered. In addition, atypical morphology was a common finding in trisomic patients who also displayed higher serum levels of soluble CD25 than patients without trisomy at Binet stage C. No significant differences were detected in serum levels of soluble CD8 and of soluble CD23. No correlation with a lymphocyte doubling time of < 12 months, marked lymphadenopathy, or prior treatment was apparent. However, refractoriness to treatment was evident more frequently in trisomic than in non-trisomic patients (p < .05). In conclusion, trisomy 12 in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia appears to occur predominantly in advanced and symptomatic disease with atypical morphology.

Therefore, the analysis of cytokine receptor mRNA expression in PBMC after allo BMT may provide important information concerning the immune response and the cytokine network system in marrow transplants.","['Tanaka, J', 'Imamura, M', 'Kasai, M', 'Zhu, X', 'Kobayashi, S', 'Hashino, S', 'Higa, T', 'Sakurada, K', 'Asaka, M']","['Tanaka J', 'Imamura M', 'Kasai M', 'Zhu X', 'Kobayashi S', 'Hashino S', 'Higa T', 'Sakurada K', 'Asaka M']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Chronic Disease', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Gene Expression', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509107899 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Oct;19(3-4):281-7. doi: 10.3109/10428199509107899.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic analysis was successful in 38 of 39 patients; 71% had a cytogenetic abnormality and 42% of these involved chromosome 11; 14 of 16 chromosome 11 abnormalities involved the region of 11q23. Non-chromosome 11 abnormalities tended to occur in older patients and to be associated with a lower platelet count; patients with the translocation 9;11 tended to have a lower white count and a higher incidence of therapy-related leukemia. 35 patients were treated with induction therapy including intensive chemotherapy (n = 33) and allogeneic BMT at presentation (n = 2). Patients who entered remission underwent consolidation chemotherapy, autologous BMT, or allogeneic BMT depending on policies at the time of diagnosis. Of 6 patients who underwent further intensive chemotherapy there is 1 long-term disease-free survivor. 3 of 8 patients undergoing autologous BMT and 2 of 3 patients undergoing allogeneic BMT are long-term disease-free survivors.

About half of the cases with loss of a 17p, however, did not show p53 inactivation.

It is one of the largest cytokines and is composed of disulfide-linked subunits of approximately 60 (heavy chain) and 35 kilodaltons (light chain). Recent observations revealed that HGF is mitogenic to various epithelial cells other than hepatocytes and to endothelial cells, and that it also acts as a motogen, morphogen and tumor-suppressor as well as a mitogen. These various biological activities of HGF are presumably transduced through the same receptor, c-Met, which is a member of the tyrosine kinase receptor family. Although it shows multiple biological activities on cells in culture, HGF is most likely the physiological hepatotrophic factor which triggers liver regeneration. It may also function as a renotrophic and pulmotrophic factor after tissue injury. HGF production in the liver, kidney and lung increases after injury to these organs. An elevated HGF level may act as an inducer of compensatory DNA synthesis. The regulation of HGF production is, therefore, important for the control of organ regeneration. HGF is produced mainly by mesenchymal cells such as fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells. Various types of human leukemia cells also secrete HGF both in vitro and in vivo. Some biological activities of HGF on hematopoietic cells, including co-mitogenic activity on myeloid leukemia cell lines, were recently demonstrated. HGF gene expression and the protein production in leukemia and fibroblast cells are modulated by various cytokines and hormones. Those modulators may indirectly affect organ regeneration and other biological processes by controlling HGF production.","['Gohda, E', 'Nakamura, S', 'Yamamoto, I', 'Minowada, J']","['Gohda E', 'Nakamura S', 'Yamamoto I', 'Minowada J']","['Department of Immunochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Kidney/physiology', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Liver Regeneration', 'Lung/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met', 'Rats', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', 'Regeneration', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509107889 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Oct;19(3-4):197-205. doi: 10.3109/10428199509107889.,,97,,,,,,,,,,,,

Short oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) sequences complementary (or antisense) to the bcr-abl junction may have potential as leukaemia-specific therapy. However, the studies on ODN targeting bcr-abl reported so far have used ODN linked by either phosphodiester or phosphorothionate linkages. Both of these ODN structures have drawbacks as potential therapeutic agents (nuclease sensitivity, non-specific effects). In contrast, ODN linked by a mixture of methylphosphonate and conventional linkages can mediate cleavage of bcr-abl mRNA target in a sequence-specific fashion, unlike conventionally linked ODN. Poor ODN uptake into intact cells remains a central difficulty for all ODN structures.

In the initial stage of myelofibrosis in chronic phase CML, atypical small megakaryocytes might leak PDGF, possibly PDGF-AB, together with other growth factors. As the clinical phase of the disease progresses to accelerated or blastic phase, a larger quantity of PDGF-AB or PDGF-BB might be secreted from blastic cells with myeloid phenotype. In addition some fibroblasts may be attracted by the PDGF and proliferate, and deposit collagen as well as fibronectin in the bone marrow stroma.","['Kimura, A', 'Katoh, O', 'Hyodo, H', 'Kuramoto, A', 'Satow, Y']","['Kimura A', 'Katoh O', 'Hyodo H', 'Kuramoto A', 'Satow Y']","['Department of Environment and Mutation, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)'],IM,"['Blast Crisis', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*biosynthesis', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*metabolism']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509059613 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Jul;18(3-4):237-42. doi: 10.3109/10428199509059613.,,47,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since a variety of powerful (homologous) vaccinia virus promoters and foreign (heterologous) promoter systems have been described for use in vaccinia, we have addressed the question of whether a general rule exists that allows the prediction of the optimal promoter/gene combination. We have compared the expression properties of four secreted proteins, the human blood clotting factor IX (FIX), the human blood glycoprotein Protein S (ProtS), the human von Willebrand factor (vWF), and the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) middle surface glycoprotein preS2, with proteins that were reported not to be secreted, the HBV large surface glycoprotein preS1 and the murine leukemia virus (MuLV) BM-5 Eco gag protein. In addition, we have included in our study an internal control protein, the vaccinia virus p11 protein, to monitor possible side effects of the promoter system used. Genes encoding the foreign proteins were placed either under control of a synthetic vaccinia virus early/late promoter (selP) or under control of the bacteriophage T7 promoter (T7/emc system). The secreted proteins were more efficiently expressed when fused to the homologous promoter. Direct comparison of the two promoters indicated that the expression level ranged between 1.4 (ProtS) and 3.9 (FIX)-fold higher with the selP than with the T7 promoter. In contrast, the cell-associated HBV preS1 was more efficiently expressed under the T7 promoter and the MuLV BM-5 Eco gag polypeptide was expressed equally well from both promoters. These data indicate that a careful prediction of optimal promoter/foreign gene combinations for the vaccinia virus expression system is possible. The choice of the optimal promoter/expression system is based on a simple classification scheme, discriminating secreted and nonsecreted proteins.","['Pfleiderer, M', 'Falkner, F G', 'Dorner, F']","['Pfleiderer M', 'Falkner FG', 'Dorner F']","['Immuno AG Biomedical Research Center, Orth/Donau, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Protein Expr Purif,Protein expression and purification,9101496,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protein S)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)', '9001-28-9 (Factor IX)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacteriophage T7', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasm', 'Factor IX/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, gag/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Haplorhini', 'Hepatitis B virus/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/chemistry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein S/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*biosynthesis/classification/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Vaccinia virus/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'von Willebrand Factor/biosynthesis/genetics']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1046-5928(85)71074-1 [pii]', '10.1006/prep.1995.1074 [doi]']",ppublish,Protein Expr Purif. 1995 Oct;6(5):559-69. doi: 10.1006/prep.1995.1074.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In spite of its extensive clinical use, controversies exist about the most appropriate way and dose of intravenous administration: continuous or bolus infusion and standard-, intermediate- or high-dose. The present review focuses on the role and place of each modality of administration of Ara-C and on the potential interest on hematopoietic growth factors recently given concomitantly to Ara-C therapy. Based on available clinical and experimental data, the following conclusions can be drawn: conventional continuous infusion Ara-C-based regimens remain the standard therapy regarding first remission induction. The use of high-dose Ara-C has been followed by improved results in patients with slow initial cytoreduction after a first course of treatment and is an interesting approach for consolidation protocols. In relapsed and refractory adult acute myeloid leukemia, higher than conventional doses undoubtedly enhance the efficacy of Ara-C salvage therapy. Encouraging results emerge from the association of hematopoietic growth factors administered concomitantly to Ara-C based regimens, which need confirmation in prospective randomized placebo controlled comparative trials.","['Thomas, X', 'Archimbaud, E']","['Thomas X', 'Archimbaud E']","[""Service d'hematologie, hopital Edouard-Herriot, Lyon, France.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0007-4551(96)80021-X [pii]'],ppublish,Bull Cancer. 1995 Nov;82(11):911-22.,,57,,,Bases de l'administration intraveineuse de cytosine arabinosid dans le traitement des leucemies aigues myeloides de l'adulte.,,,,,,,,,

Defective transport of folate across the intestine and the blood-brain barrier was reported in the condition 'Congenital Malabsorption of Folate'. This disease is characterized by a severe megaloblastic anaemia of early appearance associated with mental retardation. Anaemia is folate-responsive, but neurological symptoms are only poorly improved because of the inability to maintain adequate levels of folate in the CSF. A familial defect of cellular uptake was described in a family with a high frequency of aplastic anaemia or leukaemia. An isolated defect in folate transport into CSF was identified in a patient suffering from a cerebellar syndrome and pyramidal tract dysfunction. Among enzyme deficiencies, some are well documented, others still putative. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency is the most common. The main clinical findings are neurological signs (mental retardation, seizures, rarely schizophrenic syndromes) or vascular disease, without any haematological abnormality. Low levels of folate in serum, red blood cells and CSF associated with homocystinuria are constant. Methionine synthase deficiency is characterized by a megaloblastic anaemia occurring early in life that is more or less folate-responsive and associated with mental retardation. Glutamate formiminotransferase-cyclodeaminase deficiency is responsible for massive excretion of formiminoglutamic acid but megaloblastic anaemia is not constant. The clinical findings are a more or less severe mental or physical retardation. Dihydrofolate reductase deficiency was reported in three children presenting with a megaloblastic anaemia a few days or weeks after birth, which responded to folinic acid. The possible relationship between congenital disorders such as neural tube defects or dihydropteridine reductase deficiency and disturbances of folate metabolism are discussed. Neurological symptoms present in most of these congenital disorders highlight the role of folate in the central nervous system.","['Zittoun, J']",['Zittoun J'],"[""Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,['935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)'],IM,"['Female', 'Folic Acid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Metabolism, Inborn Errors/*genetics', 'Pregnancy']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(05)80222-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1995 Sep;8(3):603-16. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(05)80222-7.,,51,,,,,,,,,,,,

ADM, however, is not effective against ACR-resistant tumor cells. When tumor cells acquire resistance to ACR, though the resistance is not easily acquired, they show strong cross-resistance to ADM. To study the mechanism underlying these phenomena, we studied the resistance mechanism of ACR- and ADM-resistant P388 leukemia cells. The P388/ACR cells showed 4.9- and 100-fold resistance to ACR and ADM, respectively, whereas the P388/ADM cells showed respectively 2.0- and 270-fold resistance. Both P388/ACR and P388/ADM cells expressed large amounts of P-glycoprotein, and the amount was 3-fold higher in the P388/ACR than in the P388/ADM cells. As a result, the accumulation of vincristine and ADM were greatly reduced in P388/ACR and P388/ADM cells, as compared with the parental P388 cells. The accumulation of ACR, however, was moderately reduced in both the resistant cell lines. ACR accumulation in P388/ACR and P388/ADM cells was reduced to respectively 37 and 64% of the level in P388 cells. The amount and the activity of topoisomerase II were comparable in P388 and P388/ACR cells, but they were reduced in P388/ADM cells. Consequently, the formation of protein (topoisomerase II)-DNA cross-links induced by a topoisomerase II inhibitor was more prominent in the P388 and P388/ACR nuclei than in the P388/ADM nuclei. Notably, ACR could reduce the protein-DNA cross-links equally in the nuclei of P388, P388/ACR, and P388/ADM cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Dong, J', 'Naito, M', 'Tatsuta, T', 'Seimiya, H', 'Johdo, O', 'Tsuruo, T']","['Dong J', 'Naito M', 'Tatsuta T', 'Seimiya H', 'Johdo O', 'Tsuruo T']","['Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (aclacinomycins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics', 'Aclarubicin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia P388', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1995;7(5):245-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Difloxacin, in a concentration-dependent manner, increased the sensitivity of HL-60/AR cells to daunorubicin, adriamycin, and vincristine, and partially corrected the altered drug transport. In addition, difloxacin corrected subcellular distribution of adriamycin by inducing redistribution of the drug from the perinuclear region to the nucleus in HL-60/AR cells.

In RBL-2H3 cells, the cross-linking of high affinity IgE receptors (Fc epsilon R1) activates at least two cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases, Lyn and Syk, and stimulates secretion, membrane ruffling, spreading, pinocytosis, and the formation of actin plaques implicated in increased cell-substrate adhesion. In addition, Fc epsilon R1 cross-linking activates PI 3-kinase. It was previously shown that wortmannin causes a dose-dependent inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity and also inhibits antigen-stimulated degranulation. We report that the antigen-induced synthesis of inositol(1,4,5)P3 is also markedly inhibited by wortmannin. Consistent with evidence in other cell systems implicating phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)P3 in ruffling, pretreatment of RBL-2H3 cells with wortmannin inhibits membrane ruffling and fluid pinocytosis in response to Fc epsilon R1 cross-linking. However, wortmannin does not inhibit antigen-induced actin polymerization, receptor internalization, or the actin-dependent processes of spreading and adhesion plaque formation that follow antigen stimulation in adherent cells. Wortmannin also fails to inhibit either of the Fc epsilon R1-coupled tyrosine kinases, Lyn or Syk, or the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase as measured by in vitro kinase assays. Strikingly, there is substantial in vitro serine/threonine kinase activity in immunoprecipitates prepared from Fc epsilon R1-activated cells using antisera to the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. This activity is inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with wortmannin or by the direct addition of wortmannin to the kinase assay, suggesting that PI 3-kinase itself is capable of acting as a protein kinase. We conclude that Fc epsilon R1 cross-linking activates both lipid and protein kinase activities of PI 3-kinase and that inhibiting these activities with wortmannin results in the selective block of a subset of Fc epsilon R1-mediated signaling responses.","['Barker, S A', 'Caldwell, K K', 'Hall, A', 'Martinez, A M', 'Pfeiffer, J R', 'Oliver, J M', 'Wilson, B S']","['Barker SA', 'Caldwell KK', 'Hall A', 'Martinez AM', 'Pfeiffer JR', 'Oliver JM', 'Wilson BS']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque 87131, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Androstadienes/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antigens/immunology', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/*biosynthesis', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pinocytosis/drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Rats', '*Receptor Aggregation', 'Receptors, IgE/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syk Kinase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wortmannin', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1091/mbc.6.9.1145 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 1995 Sep;6(9):1145-58. doi: 10.1091/mbc.6.9.1145.,"['GM-49814/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-01315/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC301273,,,,,,,,

Three immunological subgroups may exist. The most predominant CD10-positive pre-B-cell type, corresponding to a precursor B-cell neoplasm, frequently involves the head and neck. The second, CD10-negative or mature B-cell type, defined by the absence of CD10 or presence of surface membrane immunoglobulins combined with expression of CD19 or CD20, often involves the mediastinum. The final group is a CD5-positive B-cell type corresponding to a blastic variant of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).

The scheduled intent-to-treat interim analysis included 115 patients (30%) with prolonged neutropenia after chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia/high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or solid tumors undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation. Sixty-five patients had been randomized to receive prophylactic aerosol amphotericin B inhalations at a dose of 10 mg twice daily (group A); for the remaining 50 patients no aerosol amphotericin B prophylaxis was used (group B). No serious side effects from amphotericin B inhalations occurred, but coughing (54%), bad taste (51%), and nausea (37%) caused early cessation of aerosol amphotericin B prophylaxis in 23% (15/65) of courses. In group A, the incidence of proven, probably, or possible IPA was 5% (3/65) as compared with 12% (6/50) in group B (p > 0.05).

Clusters of AgNORs and isolated dots were counted separately in 24 cases of CML at diagnosis, in 19 cases during the relapse of the chronic phase after treatment, and in 16 cases of blast crisis. For comparison, 20 cases of normal bone marrow were studied. Each cell type had its own characteristic AgNOR pattern, as has been described for normal bone marrow. There was no significant difference in the number of AgNORs between cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. Compared with normal granulopoiesis, myeloblasts in CML at diagnosis had lower numbers of clusters, which decreased further during relapse of chronic phase and in blast crisis. Promyelocytes and myelocytes showed significantly fewer dots. The number of AgNOR clusters correlates inversely with the duration of the cell cycle. Therefore, these findings are consistent with the progressive loss in proliferative activity of immature precursors described during the course of CML. As the number of dots indicates cellular maturation, their lower number in promyelocytes and myelocytes in CML favors the concept of a discordant maturation process described in this disease. The separate counting of clusters and dots provides a useful, simple, and cheap method of describing cytokinetic changes during the course of this myeloproliferative disorder.","['Gilberti, M F', 'Metze, K', 'Lorand-Metze, I']","['Gilberti MF', 'Metze K', 'Lorand-Metze I']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, State University of Campinas, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Granulocytes/pathology/*ultrastructure', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Nucleolus Organizer Region/*ultrastructure']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01697979 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1995 Dec;71(6):275-9. doi: 10.1007/BF01697979.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The total cDNA complexity is here reduced to such a level that spots which in more complex gels served as landmark spots are not present in each pool, and thus cannot serve as landmarks anymore. The image analysis of such gels and especially the matching of spots is not reliable under these circumstances. In order to achieve reliable matching, additional samples were created, such that pools were co-electrophoresed according to a special concatenation scheme; these samples then contained over-lapping elements (e.g., pools 1 + 2 + 3 and 3 + 4 + 5 have at least those spots in common, which originate from pool 3).

Despite the effective correction of gas exchange by mechanical ventilation, the mortality in this population is expected to be extremely high due to unavoidable fatal infection of immunocompromised host and the poor prognosis of primary malignancy. However, modern specific treatment of leukemia and lymphoma has made these conditions curable in many cases, and even severe myelotoxic neutropenia does not always lead to uniformly fatal outcome. We studied survival in 113 cases of ARF retrospectively selected according to the uniform criteria of this syndrome. No selection was made as to the diagnosis, stage, and response to the treatment of the underlying disease. The group consisted of 51% male and 49% female patients aged 34, on an average; 69% of these with acute leukemia, 22% with malignant lymphoma, and 9% with other conditions. Sixty-five (58%) patients were subjected to mechanical ventilation (MV). Forty-two were treated after a Protocol on intensive care of ARF which contained standard requirements to management of patients. Another group of 71 patients admitted to intensive care units before this Protocol was introduced were historical controls. Total survival was 19.5%. In the MV group survival was 15% with 10 cases of cure, ARF developing during severe neutropenia in 3 out of these 10 cases. The results became evidently better after the Protocol was introduced, improving from 16 to 27%. The primary disease dramatically influenced the results: long-term survival was significantly poorer in patients with relapses and resistant to chemotherapy, with 100% mortality within 8 months after discharge.

Despite their higher IL-1 beta concentration, supernatants from BLV-positive cows stimulated proliferation of murine thymocytes in the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-biphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay similar to supernatants from BLV-negative cows, but showed about 30% less IL-1 activity than supernatants from BLV-negative cows on the IL-1-dependent cell line LBRM-33 1 A-5, and about five times more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activity on the TNF-sensitive murine fibroblast cell line L-929.

To gain insight into the factors accounting for lymphocytosis, experiments were conducted to determine the functional activation status of lymphocytes from BLV seronegative and BLV infected aleukemic cows with PL. Stimulation with the B lymphocyte mitogen Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain I (SAC), recombinant human interleukin-2 (rIL-2), or pokeweed mitogen (PWM), a T lymphocyte-dependent B lymphocyte mitogen, revealed differences in the pattern of expression of IL-2 receptor alpha (IL-2R alpha) and major histocompatibility (MHC) class II molecules on B and T lymphocytes from uninfected and BLV infected PL cows. rIL-2 induced expression of IL-R alpha on B lymphocytes from PL cows but not B lymphocytes from BLV seronegative cows. SAC alone, or in combination with rIL-2, had no effect on B lymphocytes from BLV seronegative cows. However, rIL-2 alone or in combination with SAC induced expression of IL-2R alpha on B lymphocytes from PL cows. PWM stimulated expression of IL-2R alpha on bovine B lymphocytes regardless of BLV status, and induced a significantly higher level of expression on B lymphocytes from PL cows. Mitogens and rIL-2 had a similar stimulatory effect on induction of IL-2R alpha expression on CD4 T lymphocytes regardless of BLV status. Only PWM induced expression of IL-2R alpha on bovine CD8 T lymphocytes and induced a significantly higher level of expression on this T lymphocyte subset from PL cows. Examination of freshly isolated B lymphocytes from PL cows revealed increased spontaneous expression of the MHC class II molecule compared to B lymphocytes from control cows. None of the culture conditions examined induced MHC-II expression on CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes from BLV seronegative cows. In contrast, SAC+IL-2 and PWM induced MHC-II expression on CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes from BLV infected PL cows, resulting in a significantly greater proportions of these lymphocyte subsets expressing this molecule compared to CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes from control cows. The data indicate that infection with BLV affects the response of B and T lymphocytes to signals of activation, up-regulating the expression of surface molecules involved in both direct contact and cytokine-mediated T lymphocyte-dependent B lymphocyte activation.","['Stone, D M', 'Hof, A J', 'Davis, W C']","['Stone DM', 'Hof AJ', 'Davis WC']","['Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology, Washington State University, Pullman 99164-7040, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*immunology', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*biosynthesis', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/classification/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/*immunology']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2427(95)05423-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2427(95)05423-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1995 Sep;48(1-2):65-76. doi: 10.1016/0165-2427(95)05423-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA damaged by the drug has proved to be a valuable tool for exploring the details of the nucleotide excision repair pathway.","['Zamble, D B', 'Lippard, S J']","['Zamble DB', 'Lippard SJ']","['Department of Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge 02139, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Trends Biochem Sci,Trends in biochemical sciences,7610674,"['0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (High Mobility Group Proteins)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cisplatin/*therapeutic use', 'DNA Adducts', 'DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'High Mobility Group Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0968-0004(00)89095-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0968-0004(00)89095-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Trends Biochem Sci. 1995 Oct;20(10):435-9. doi: 10.1016/s0968-0004(00)89095-7.,,33,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of MRP by neuroblastoma cells correlates with N-myc oncogene amplification, a well-established prognostic indicator in patients with neuroblastoma. METHODS: To relate MRP gene expression to established prognostic markers and the clinical outcome of neuroblastoma, we analyzed MRP expression in specimens of primary tumors from 60 patients with neuroblastoma. RESULTS: Levels of MRP gene expression were significantly higher in tumors with N-myc amplification than in tumors without such amplification (P < 0.001). High levels of MRP expression were strongly associated with reductions in both survival and event-free survival (P < 0.001) in the overall study population and in subgroups of patients without N-myc amplification and patients with localized disease. For the overall study population, the five-year cumulative survival rates in the groups with high and low levels of MRP expression were 57 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 37 to 78 percent) and 94 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 86 to 100 percent), respectively. In contrast, expression of the MDR1 multi-drug-resistance gene was not predictive of survival or event-free survival. After adjustment by multivariate analysis for the effects of N-myc amplification and other prognostic indicators, high levels of MRP expression retained significant prognostic value for poor survival (relative hazard, 14.9; P = 0.01) and poor event-free survival (relative hazard, 9.7; P = 0.004), whereas N-myc amplification had no prognostic value. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of MRP gene expression in patients with neuroblastoma correlate strongly with poor outcome. The findings suggest that expression of this multidrug-resistance gene accounts for the association between N-myc amplification and reduced survival.","['Norris, M D', 'Bordow, S B', 'Marshall, G M', 'Haber, P S', 'Cohn, S L', 'Haber, M']","['Norris MD', 'Bordow SB', 'Marshall GM', 'Haber PS', 'Cohn SL', 'Haber M']","[""Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neuroblastoma/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Survival Rate']",1996/01/25 00:00,1996/01/25 00:01,['1996/01/25 00:00'],"['1996/01/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/25 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199601253340405 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1996 Jan 25;334(4):231-8. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199601253340405.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This acute febrile illness is characterized by myalgias, headache, thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum aminotransferase levels. The disease is difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are non-specific, intraleukocytic inclusions (morulae) may not be seen, and the serologic results are often initially negative. Little is known about the causative agent because it has never been cultivated. METHODS: We studied three patients with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, including unexplained fever after probable exposure to ticks, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Peripheral blood was examined for ehrlichia microscopically and with use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Blood was inoculated into cultures of HL60 cells (a line of human promyelocytic leukemia cells), and the cultures were monitored for infection by Giemsa staining and PCR. RESULTS: Blood from the three patients, only one of whom had inclusions suggestive of ehrlichia in neutrophils, was positive for human granulocytic ehrlichiosis on PCR. Blood from all three patients was inoculated into HL60 cell cultures and caused infection, with intracellular organisms visualized as early as 5 days after inoculation and cell lysis occurring within 12 to 14 days. The identity of the cultured organisms was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy, PCR analysis, and DNA sequencing. DNA from the infected cells was sequenced in regions of the 16S ribosomal gene reported to differ between the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis and closely related species, including Ehrlichia equi and E. phagocytophila which cause infection in animals. The sequences from all three human isolates were identical and differed from the strain of E. equi studied in having guanine rather than adenine at nucleotide 84. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the cultivation of the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis in cell culture. The ability to isolate this organism should lead to a better understanding of the biology, treatment, and epidemiology of this emerging infection.","['Goodman, J L', 'Nelson, C', 'Vitale, B', 'Madigan, J E', 'Dumler, J S', 'Kurtti, T J', 'Munderloh, U G']","['Goodman JL', 'Nelson C', 'Vitale B', 'Madigan JE', 'Dumler JS', 'Kurtti TJ', 'Munderloh UG']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota School of Medicine, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (DNA, Ribosomal)']",IM,"['Agranulocytosis/*microbiology', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Bacterial/*genetics', 'DNA, Ribosomal/genetics', 'Ehrlichia/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Ehrlichiosis/*microbiology', 'Female', 'Granulocytes', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thrombocytopenia/microbiology']",1996/01/25 00:00,1996/01/25 00:01,['1996/01/25 00:00'],"['1996/01/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/25 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199601253340401 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1996 Jan 25;334(4):209-15. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199601253340401.,['9R01-AI37772-04/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,['N Engl J Med. 1996 Jan 25;334(4):262-3.

The object of this study is to evaluate our data in Campinas, Brazil and hope ""to make one dot on the geographic map of this disease more clear."" PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1978 and 1988, 46 patients under the age of 17 years with biopsy-proven Hodgkin's Disease (HD) were referred for evaluation at Centro Boldrini in Campinas, Sao Paulo state, in Brazil. Thirty-seven of them were treated and followed-up only at this Center and are the subjects of this analysis. All the original histological slides were obtained, reviewed, and classified according to the Rye system. Staging procedures included exploratory laparotomy in 33 of 37 children, but none had lymphangiography. Treatment was individualized until January 1986 when the German protocol was adopted. RESULTS: Nineteen cases were classified as nodular sclerosis, 14 as mixed cellularity, and three as lymphocyte depleted. Mean age was 7 years; male/female ratio was 2:1. Fifty percent were advanced stages III and IV and 46% (17/37) had at least one of the systemic B symptoms. Mean follow-up was 81 months (range from 41 to 174 months). Five-year actuarial overall survival was 78%. Two children (5%) had acute myeloid leukemia at 25 and 49 months after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Although distribution of histological subtypes of our cases is similar to other reports in developed countries, as well as percentage of advanced stages III/IV, our patients fared worse when compared to those reports.

Levels of 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) and the methylated metabolites of 6MP in red blood cells of the patients with hepatotoxicity, were not significantly different when compared to patients without hepatotoxicity, suggesting similar absorption of 6MP in both groups. Time to achieve peak 6MP levels was significantly longer in the symptomatic patients compared to the asymptomatic patients (P = 0.005). Peak levels and standardized concentration versus time curve (AUC) per 1 mg of 6MP per m2 of body surface area were significantly lower in the patients with hepatotoxicity (P = 0.016; P = 0.037, respectively). A significant correlation between peak 6MP levels and standardized AUC (r = 0.729, P < 0.0001) was found. These results suggest accumulation of 6MP and its metabolites in the liver of the patients with GI symptoms, leading to hepatotoxicity.","['Berkovitch, M', 'Matsui, D', 'Zipursky, A', 'Blanchette, V S', 'Verjee, Z', 'Giesbrecht, E', 'Saunders, E F', 'Evans, W E', 'Koren, G']","['Berkovitch M', 'Matsui D', 'Zipursky A', 'Blanchette VS', 'Verjee Z', 'Giesbrecht E', 'Saunders EF', 'Evans WE', 'Koren G']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cholestasis, Intrahepatic/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liver/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism']",1996/02/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199602)26:2<85::AID-MPO3>3.0.CO;2-Q [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199602)26:2<85::AID-MPO3>3.0.CO;2-Q [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1996 Feb;26(2):85-9. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199602)26:2<85::AID-MPO3>3.0.CO;2-Q.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nine strains of C. gingivalis showed no bands by the conventional electrophoresis of digested DNA.

After unsuccessful treatment with intravenous administration of fluconazole, a percutaneous transhepatic intraportal administration of Amphotericin B (AMPH-B) (20 mg/day) was started, followed by the consolidation chemotherapy. When the first positive blood culture was obtained for Candida, a reservoir was embedded in the subcutaneous layer of the right iliac region and the intrahepatic arterial administration of AMPH-B (5 to 20 mg/day) by the Infusor (Baxter Healthcare Corporation), a portable, disposable drug delivery system that provides a constant drug flow, was started.

The system used to evaluate this was based on i.v. injection of 100 nm of distearoyl phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol liposomes with covalently bound streptavidin. The circulation lifetime of these liposomes was increased by procedures that involved blockade of liposome uptake by phagocytic cells in the liver and/or the incorporation of a poly(ethylene glycol)-modified phospholipid [poly(ethylene glycol)2000-modified distearoyl phosphatidylethanolamine]. Blockade of liver phagocytic cells with a low predose (2 mg/kg of drug) of liposomal doxorubicin increased the circulation half-life of the streptavidin liposomes from less than 1 hr to greater than 3 hr. A further 2-fold increase in circulating half-life (to approximately 7.5 hr) was achieved by using liposomes with 2 mole % of poly(ethylene glycol)2000-modified phosphatidylethanolamine. In combination with RES blockade, the circulation lifetimes of poly(ethylene glycol)phosphatidylethanolamine containing streptavidin liposomes could be increased to greater than 12 hr. The ability of these liposomes to move from the plasma compartment to an extravascular compartment was measured by using the peritoneal cavity as a convenient, accessible, extravascular site. The tendency for liposomes to accumulate in this site was not, however, clearly dependent on circulating blood levels. Comparable levels of liposomes in the peritoneal cavity were achieved when using systems that exhibited significantly different circulation lifetimes.","['Longman, S A', 'Tardi, P G', 'Parr, M J', 'Choi, L', 'Cullis, P R', 'Bally, M B']","['Longman SA', 'Tardi PG', 'Parr MJ', 'Choi L', 'Cullis PR', 'Bally MB']","['British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '9013-20-1 (Streptavidin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins/pharmacokinetics', '*Drug Carriers', 'Female', 'Leukemia P388/pathology', '*Liposomes', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mononuclear Phagocyte System/drug effects', 'Peritoneal Cavity', 'Phospholipids/chemistry', 'Polyethylene Glycols/pharmacokinetics', 'Streptavidin', 'Tissue Distribution']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1995 Dec;275(3):1177-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
