DESIGN: Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial. SUBJECTS: 74 herpes simplex virus seropositive patients aged 18-84. Thirty seven patients received acyclovir (800 mg by mouth daily) and 37 placebo. The patients were examined daily for 28 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Occurrence of herpes labialis, intraoral ulcers, and acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis. RESULTS: The two populations were comparable in age, sex, type of antineoplastic treatment, and history of herpes labialis. Acute oral infections occurred in 25 of the acyclovir treated patients and 36 of the placebo treated patients (relative risk 0.69 (95% confidence interval 0.55 to 0.87)). This difference was due to a reduction in the incidence of herpes labialis (one case versus eight cases; relative risk 0.13 (0.02 to 0.95)), intraoral ulcers excluding the soft palate (one case versus 13 cases; relative risk 0.08 (0.01 to 0.56)), and acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis (one case versus eight cases; relative risk 0.13 (0.02 to 0.95)). However, ulcers on the soft palate were diagnosed with similar frequency in the two groups. Isolation of herpes simplex virus type 1 in saliva was reduced from 15 cases in the placebo group to one case in the acyclovir group (relative risk 0.07 (0.01 to 0.48)). CONCLUSION: Intraoral ulcers excluding the soft palate are most often due to infection with herpes simplex virus, whereas ulcers on the soft palate have a non-herpetic aetiology. The findings suggest that acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis may also be due to herpes simplex virus. Prophylaxis with acyclovir should be considered for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia during remission induction therapy.","['Bergmann, O J', 'Ellermann-Eriksen, S', 'Mogensen, S C', 'Ellegaard, J']","['Bergmann OJ', 'Ellermann-Eriksen S', 'Mogensen SC', 'Ellegaard J']","['Department of Medicine and Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Amtssygehuset, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,['X4HES1O11F (Acyclovir)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Acyclovir/*therapeutic use', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Gingivitis, Necrotizing Ulcerative/prevention & control', 'Herpes Labialis/prevention & control', 'Herpes Simplex/*prevention & control/virology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Diseases/*prevention & control/virology', 'Opportunistic Infections/complications/*prevention & control', 'Stomatitis, Herpetic/prevention & control', 'Ulcer/prevention & control/virology']",PMC2549556,1995/05/06 00:00,1995/05/06 00:01,['1995/05/06 00:00'],"['1995/05/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/06 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.310.6988.1169 [doi]'],ppublish,BMJ. 1995 May 6;310(6988):1169-72. doi: 10.1136/bmj.310.6988.1169.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most patients initially respond to chemotherapy at the time of first clinical admission, but often relapse and become refractory to further treatment not only to the drugs used in the first treatment but also to a variety of other drugs. Laboratory investigations have now provided a cellular basis for this clinical observation of multidrug resistance (MDR). Expression of a glycoprotein (referred to as P-glycoprotein) in the membrane of cells made resistant in vitro to naturally occurring anticancer agents like anthracyclines, Vinca alkaloids and epipodophyllotoxins, has been shown to be responsible for the so-called classical MDR phenotype. P-glycoprotein functions as an ATP-dependent, unidirectional drug efflux pump with a broad substrate specificity, that effectively maintains the intracellular cytotoxic drug concentrations under a non-cytotoxic threshold value. Extensive clinical studies have shown that P-glycoprotein is expressed on virtually all types of haematological malignancies, including acute and chronic leukaemias, multiple myelomas and malignant lymphomas. Since in model systems for P-glycoprotein-mediated MDR, drug resistance may be circumvented by the addition of non-cytotoxic agents that can inhibit the outward drug pump, clinical trials have been initiated to determine if such an approach will be feasible in a clinical situation. Preliminary results suggest that some haematological malignancies, among which are acute myelocytic leukaemia, multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, might benefit from the simultaneous administration of cytotoxic drugs and P-glycoprotein inhibitors. However, randomised clinical trials are needed to evaluate the use of such resistance modifiers in the clinic.","['Nooter, K', 'Sonneveld, P']","['Nooter K', 'Sonneveld P']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Rotterdam Cancer Institute, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cytotechnology,Cytotechnology,8807027,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Vinca Alkaloids)']",,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Vinca Alkaloids/pharmacology']",,1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00744665 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytotechnology. 1993;12(1-3):213-30. doi: 10.1007/BF00744665.,,"['mdr1', 'mdr3']",107,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In studies conducted thus far most isolates have been obtained after selection in either adriamycin or mitoxantrone. The work in this area is in its early stages and very little is known about the molecular events which contribute to this mode of drug resistance. At the present time no protein with drug binding properties comparable to Pgp has been identified in non-Pgp mdr isolates. Evidence based on the finding that all isolates do not respond in the same way to reversal agents such as verapamil suggests the possibility that more than one mechanism may exist for non-Pgp mdr. Future studies may thus reveal that cells contain a multiplicity of genes which upon transcriptional activation can function to alter drug transport processes and thus contribute to the development of mdr. Identifying and characterizing these genes will be important since they may function in transport systems of normal cells. The exact identify of proteins which contribute to non-Pgp mdr remains to be determined. One protein designated P190 has been found to be overexpressed in cell lines of human promyelocytic leukemia, lung and adenocarcinoma treated with adriamycin. The protein also is increased in some clinical samples from patients undergoing chemotherapy. P190 which has a minor sequence homology with Pgp can bind ATP and may thus contribute to the energy dependent drug efflux systems found in cells containing this protein. Transfection studies with a P190 cDNA should determine whether this protein actually contributes to drug resistance. Many other protein changes have been detected in non-Pgp mdr cells but the importance of these in resistance also remains to be determined. In some systems a particular protein change can be identified in multiple independent isolates suggesting a correlation between the development of resistance and the presence of this cellular alteration. Experiments conducted thus far on the mechanism of non-Pgp mdr are intriguing. Studies utilizing fluorescence microscopy to follow the fate of daunomycin suggests that the drug passes to the interior of the cell and eventually localizes in the Golgi apparatus. Drug located at this site may move directly into an efflux pathway for rapid extrusion from the cell. Evidence also indicates that as drug leaves the Golgi some may be sequestered into other organelles such as lysosomes or mitochondria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Center, M S']",['Center MS'],"['Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan 66506.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cytotechnology,Cytotechnology,8807027,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Drug Resistance/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00744660 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytotechnology. 1993;12(1-3):109-25. doi: 10.1007/BF00744660.,,,91,['CA-37585/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the hydrodynamic behavior of cells near a wall in simple shear flow using a model leukocyte system that we have also used extensively in cell-substrate adhesion studies. Specifically, we measured the velocity of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells near a surface in a parallel-plate flow chamber and compared it to the motion of polystyrene beads and glutaraldehyde-fixed RBL cells. We found that RBL cells (13 microns diameter) travel 25% faster than polystyrene beads of 14.5 microns diameter for a wide range of shear rates (20-180 s-1); this suggests that RBL cells would travel 39% faster than polystyrene beads of equivalent size. Glutaraldehyde-fixed RBL cells travel at a velocity between those of live cells and 14.5-microns beads. These differences in velocities have been observed over both polyacrylamide gel and glass substrates. Application of a theory for hard sphere motion near a wall in simple shear flow at low Reynolds number [Goldman, A.J.; Cox, R.G.; Brenner, H. Chem. Eng. Sci. 1967b, 22, 653-660] to our measured cell velocities suggests that cells are separated from the wall by > or = 550 nm. Such large separation distances have also been predicted by others who have used hard sphere theory to analyze the effect of shear flow on cell motion near walls. However, the extensive receptor-mediated cell adhesion seen in these systems is inconsistent with these separation distances, which are approximately 30 times greater than the distance required for receptor-ligand contact. Instead, we propose that, because of cell deformability and cell surface roughness, cells remain within a separation distance that allows for molecular contact while they travel faster than the hard sphere theory predicts. Therefore, the theory of Goldman and co-workers, while adequate for hard sphere motion, is likely not accurate for cellular motion.","['Tempelman, L A', 'Park, S', 'Hammer, D A']","['Tempelman LA', 'Park S', 'Hammer DA']","['School of Chemical Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Biotechnol Prog,Biotechnology progress,8506292,,,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Movement', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukocytes/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bp00025a012 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Prog. 1994 Jan-Feb;10(1):97-108. doi: 10.1021/bp00025a012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Without a quantitative model, it is difficult to characterize its kinetics. Our group has shown that the cell survival rate can be characterized by use of the n-target theory, which involves only two parameters: the number of hypothetical inactivation targets (n) and the first-order death rate (k). In this study, we used different recombinant viruses to examine the effect of heterologous protein expression on the cell survival rate. The proteins expressed were beta-galactosidase, human T-cell leukemia virus type I p40x, human interleukin-2, and human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). The survival rate was affected by protein expression, but the n value remained constant if the protein expression level was high (above 30 mg/L). Low-level expression of secreted, glycosylated tPA resulted in a reduced n value, which was restored to the normal value when the tPA signal peptide and prosequence were deleted. In addition, if the n value was normal (10-11), the level of protein expression correlated negatively with the death rate. However, if the n value was reduced by unfavorable culture conditions or foreign protein expression, the expression level correlated positively with the death rate. A dimensionless plot with kt as the dimensionless time shows that alteration of the k value while retaining constant n is equivalent to a rescaling of time. Therefore, the survival curves with constant n reduce to a single curve on the dimensionless plot.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Wu, S C', 'Jarvis, D L', 'Dale, B E', 'Liao, J C']","['Wu SC', 'Jarvis DL', 'Dale BE', 'Liao JC']","['Department of Chemical Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station 77843.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Biotechnol Prog,Biotechnology progress,8506292,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Occlusion Body Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (Viral Structural Proteins)', '0 (polyhedrin protein, Nucleopolyhedrovirus)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'EC 3.4.21.68 (Tissue Plasminogen Activator)']",,"['Animals', 'Baculoviridae/*genetics', '*Cell Death', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Moths', 'Occlusion Body Matrix Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Tissue Plasminogen Activator/*biosynthesis', 'Viral Proteins/genetics', 'Viral Structural Proteins', 'beta-Galactosidase/*biosynthesis']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bp00025a006 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Prog. 1994 Jan-Feb;10(1):55-9. doi: 10.1021/bp00025a006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rifampicin was shown to strongly enhance vinblastine accumulation in both rat hepatoma RHC1 and human leukemia K562 R7 multidrug resistant cells, but had no effect in rat SDVI drug-sensitive liver cells. By contrast, two other rifamycins, rifamycins B and SV, had no or only minor effect on vinblastine accumulation in RHC1 cells. Efflux experiments revealed that rifampicin was able, like the well-known chemosensitizer agent verapamil, to decrease export of vinblastine out of resistant cells. Rifampicin, when used at a concentration close to plasma concentrations achievable in humans (25 microM), was able to increase sensitivity of RHC1 cells to both vinblastine and doxorubicin. Rifampicin was also demonstrated to inhibit P-gp radiolabeling by the photoactivable P-gp ligand azidopine, thereby suggesting that the antituberculosis compound can interfere directly with P-gp drug binding sites. These results thus indicate that rifampicin was able to down-modulate P-gp-associated resistance through inhibition of P-gp function.","['Fardel, O', 'Lecureur, V', 'Loyer, P', 'Guillouzo, A']","['Fardel O', 'Lecureur V', 'Loyer P', 'Guillouzo A']","[""Unite de Recherches Hepatologiques U 49 de l'INSERM, Hopital de Pontchaillou, Rennes, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'VJT6J7R4TR (Rifampin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Rats', 'Rifampin/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Vinblastine/metabolism']",,1995/05/11 00:00,1995/05/11 00:01,['1995/05/11 00:00'],"['1995/05/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/11 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/11 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(95)00045-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(95)00045-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1995 May 11;49(9):1255-60. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(95)00045-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At 1 mM reduced glutathione derivative, only reduced glutathione diester markedly increased the cellular concentration of reduced glutathione. There was little delivery of reduced glutathione monoethyl ester into the cells. Reduced glutathione, and monoethyl and diethyl ester derivatives all increased the cellular concentration of cysteine; reduced glutathione diethyl ester also increased the cellular concentration of gamma-glutamylcysteine. Reduced glutathione diethyl ester also increased the cellular concentration of gamma-glutamylcysteine. Reduced glutathione esters were de-esterified intracellularly where the diester was rapidly converted to the monoester. The diester was also converted to the monoester extracellularly by interaction with cell surface esterases and by a much slower spontaneous hydrolysis. This indicates that the diester of reduced glutathione was a much more effective vehicle for delivery of reduced glutathione into cells than the monoester. Reduced glutathione diester also increased the cellular concentrations of cysteine and gamma-glutamylcysteine, suggesting that de novo synthesis of reduced glutathione was also stimulated.","['Minhas, H S', 'Thornalley, P J']","['Minhas HS', 'Thornalley PJ']","['Department of Chemistry and Biological Chemistry, University of Essex, Colchester, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Dipeptides)', '7W95D60F4J (S-ethyl glutathione)', '97451-40-6 (glutathione diethyl ester)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'M984VJS48P (gamma-glutamylcysteine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Dipeptides/analysis', 'Glutathione/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/05/17 00:00,1995/05/17 00:01,['1995/05/17 00:00'],"['1995/05/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/17 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(94)00518-Q [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(94)00518-q [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1995 May 17;49(10):1475-82. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(94)00518-q.,,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current studies, we examined by competitive inhibition with [3H]MTX as permeant some of the structural features that determine preferences among folate compounds and their analogues as permeants for this ATPase. The results show that folate compounds are preferred over simple quinazolines (5,8-dideaza-pteridines), and IL5-CH3-folateH4, and probably other 5-substituted folates are preferred over folic acid. In the latter regard, the observed equivalence in preference to IL5-CH3-folateH4 of the 4-oxa-pyridopyrimidine, lometrexol (DDATHF), probably relates to its close similarity to folateH4. The results also suggest that the 4-position in the case of folate analogues, but not in the case of the quinazoline analogues, is an important determinant with 4-amino preferred over 4-oxa. They also suggest that the N10 position on the bridge region in both series of compounds, and probably for the pyridopyrimidine lometrexol, is not an important determinant.

From 1988 to 1994, 180 subcutaneous ports were inserted in children more than 1 year old. Initial diagnosis was acute leukaemia (n = 79), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 33), and solid tumour (n = 51). Median age was 85 months. All venous procedures were performed through the device. Chemotherapy was either moderate (n = 13) or intensive (n = 119) or very intensive (n = 48), including 16 patients undergoing marrow transplantation. Cumulative venous access totalled 55,770 patient days with a mean of 305 days/subcutaneous port. The cause of device removal was, end of treatment (n = 111), death due to malignancy (n = 20), catheter related infection (n = 7), and occlusion of the system (n = 4). Mechanical complications occurred in 19 ports; 16 were due to clots, of which 14 were cleared with instillation of urokinase. Documented infectious episodes occurred in 47 ports, recurred once in 14, and twice in five cases. Among these infections, 47 were septicaemic; 31 due to Staphylococcus epidermidis. Twenty seven of initial septic episodes were considered to be catheter related; the rate was 15%/subcutaneous port or 0.05/100 catheter days. Risk factors for the development of a first infection were age below 4 years and the time of use. Since February 1993, vancomycin (50 micrograms/ml) has been given and this has reduced the rate of S epidermidis infection from 26/83 subcutaneous port to 4/97. Life table analysis showed that the infection free interval for staphylococcus was significantly better after this technique ws initiated (log rank rest=0.02). Time saved was approximately 30minutes/patient/week compared with external catheters, or 45 hours/month for the cohort of children treated. Subcutaneous ports in paediatric cancer patients are reliable, safe, and durable and may offer an attractive alternative to external catheters for prolonged venous access and intensive treatment.","['Rubie, H', 'Juricic, M', 'Claeyssens, S', 'Krimou, A', 'Lemozy, J', 'Izard, P', 'Guitard, J', 'Ane, M', 'Prere, M F', 'Fedacou, F']","['Rubie H', 'Juricic M', 'Claeyssens S', 'Krimou A', 'Lemozy J', 'Izard P', 'Guitard J', 'Ane M', 'Prere MF', 'Fedacou F', 'et al.']","['Unit of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Hospital Purpan, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,['6Q205EH1VU (Vancomycin)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Bacterial Infections/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Catheters, Indwelling/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Equipment Contamination', 'Equipment Failure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis/etiology', 'Staphylococcal Infections/etiology/prevention & control', 'Staphylococcus epidermidis', 'Vancomycin/*administration & dosage']",PMC1511239,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/adc.72.4.325 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1995 Apr;72(4):325-9. doi: 10.1136/adc.72.4.325.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the growth regulation of human acute promyelocytic leukemia NB-4 cells by combinations of IFNs and RA, and explored the possible biochemical interactions between IFNs and RA by studying the regulation of expression of IFN- and RA-inducible cellular pathways by RA and IFN respectively. We observed that combinations of IFNs and RA inhibited NB-4 cell growth significantly more than either agent alone. Analysis of cellular inducible pathways demonstrated that RA augmented levels of gene expression: (i) induced by IFN-alpha such as 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase, mRNA 561 and mRNA 6-16; (ii) induced by IFN-gamma such as 2A and P56; and (iii) induced by both IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma such as mRNA 1-8. Furthermore, IFNs also augmented the expression of RAR-alpha mRNA and RAR-alpha. Co-treatment of NB-4 cells by IFN-gamma plus RA induced a sub-set of IFN-induced genes which were not induced by either IFN-gamma or RA alone. These results suggest that gene inducing interactions, the transregulation of IFN-inducible and RA-inducible gene expression pathways by RA and IFNs, respectively, may be closely related to the potentiation of growth inhibition of NB-4 cells by combinations of IFNs and RA. These findings may be useful in establishing a rationale for using IFNs and RA or combinations of IFNs and RA in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia.","['Kumar, R', 'Korutla, L']","['Kumar R', 'Korutla L']","['Department of Medicine, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)""]",IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/biosynthesis/genetics"", 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1995 Mar-Apr;15(2):353-60.,,,,['CA 56564/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Non-myelogenous leukemic cell lines (MOLT-4, K-562) were similarly sensitive to ascorbic acid and hydrogen peroxide, but relatively resistant to etoposide, TNF, hyperthermia and UV irradiation. Furthermore, these treatments except for UV irradiation, did not induce any apparent DNA fragmentation in MOLT-4 and K-562 cells. An autodigestion experiment revealed that all of these six cell lines contained divalent cation-independent endonuclease activity as a major endonuclease. The ability of this endonuclease to produce oligonucleosome-size DNA fragmentation was stimulated at acidic, but not at neutral pH. Since this enzyme activity was not detected in the lysosomal enzyme-free nuclei, prepared from all six cell lines, the cytoplasmic localization of this enzyme was suggested. The results suggest that the endonuclease activity might be differently regulated between myelogenous and non-myelogenous leukemic cell lines.","['Yanagisawa-Shiota, F', 'Sakagami, H', 'Kuribayashi, N', 'Iida, M', 'Sakagami, T', 'Takeda, M']","['Yanagisawa-Shiota F', 'Sakagami H', 'Kuribayashi N', 'Iida M', 'Sakagami T', 'Takeda M']","['First Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Cations, Divalent/pharmacology', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Hot Temperature', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/*pathology', 'Lysosomes/enzymology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",,1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1995 Mar-Apr;15(2):259-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, however, potent cancer chemopreventive agents induce HL-60 cell differentiation at very low dose levels. Thus, as part of our search for natural product chemopreventive agents, extracts derived from nearly 400 plants were tested for their potential to induce HL-60 cell differentiation. As a result, 17 plant extracts were judged to be active (ED50 values < or = 4 micrograms/ml). One of most potent leads was an extract derived from Dirca occidentalis Gray (Thymelaeaceae) (ED50, 0.14 micrograms/ml), and bioassay-guided fractionation led to the identification of genkwanin (I), (+/-)-lariciresinol (II) and sitoindoside II (IV) as active principles, with ED50 values of 18.3, 1.1 and 0.069 microM, respectively.

Characterization of Lf receptors was performed by flow cytofluorimetry using either Lf labelled on its glycan moiety with fluorescein or purified anti-lymphocyte Lf receptor antibodies. High affinity receptors for Lf were characterized only at the surface of human activated lymphocytes and of non-activated platelets. These two receptors possess common physicochemical properties and antigenic epitopes. Low affinity receptors for Lf were characterized on monocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils. These receptors are immunologically different from those found on activated lymphocytes and on non-activated platelets. Cell-lines of human lymphocyte T and megakaryocyte possess lactotransferrin receptors whose properties are similar to those found on peripheral blood cells.

The majority of patients with acute leukaemia were in first complete remission (CR), while 11 AML patients and 9 ALL patients were in advanced stage of the disease (> I CR or relapse). The BM was reinfused without purging. The conditioning regimen for all ALL and proportion of AML patients consisted of cyclophosphamide (CY) 120 mg/kg and fractionated total body irradiation (TB) in a total dose of 12 Gy. 18 AML patients received busulfan 16 mg/kg instead of TBI. Leukaemia-free survival (LFS) for first CR AML patients was 48% at 43 months with the median follow-up of 17 months. Probability of relapse was 44%. LFS for advanced AML was only 9% and the probability of relapse 89%. LFS for first CR ALL patients was 72% at 53 months with the median follow-up of 15 months, while probability of relapse was only 23%. For advanced ALL, LFS was 32% at 33 months and probability of relapse 64%. Probability of toxic death for first CR patients was 11%. We found a predictive value of viability testing and in vitro CFU-GM assay for haematologic recovery after ABMT.

The median leukocyte dose was 0.6 x 10(9)/kg in total. Instead of leukapheresis products, we used pooled buffy coats from random donors, with a high relative content of lymphocytes and especially T lymphocytes. The leukocyte concentrates were irradiated with 15 Gy. In all 10 patients, we observed prompt and sustained myeloid marrow recovery following LT. Such an effect of LT has never been described before. We hypothesize that in the internal milieu of these aplastic patients the transfused leukocytes were stimulated to secrete cytokines, the result being a cascade-like phenomenon and stimulation and proliferation of the patient's own bone marrow cells.

Value in donor selection.,1302-8,"Between May 1989 and February 1994, we performed 48 volunteer unrelated donor BMTs for first chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia using in vivo T cell depletion for acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) prophylaxis. In 40 cases, adequate material was available to measure the frequency of antirecipient MHC cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursor (CTLp) cells in the blood of potential donors. This supplemented standard serological typing, one-dimensional isoelectric focusing for class I proteins, and allogenotyping for DR and DQ alleles using DNA RFLP analysis in the donor selection process. All recipients were conditioned with cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg, TBI 1320 cGy, and intravenous Campath 1G. GvHD prophylaxis consisted of CsA, short-course methotrexate, and intravenous Campath 1G. Minimum follow-up in all surviving recipients was 100 days. The development of aGvHD and the probability of leukemia-free survival were compared between the high frequency group (CTLp > 1 in 100,000) (n = 15) and the low frequency group (CTLp < 1 in 100,000) (n = 25). There was a trend for increasing grade of aGvHD, which was statistically significant in the high frequency group when compared with the low frequency group (P = 0.003). Both a high frequency of CTLp (relative risk [RR] = 9.0, P = 0.016) and HLA mismatch (RR = 6.7, P = 0.023) were predictors of severe aGvHD (grade III or IV). Multivariate analysis showed that CTLp group (RR = 3.4, P = 0.015) and CMV status (RR = 3.9, P = 0.008) were predictors of leukemia-free survival. Further investigation showed an interaction between the two, such that CMV seropositive recipients in the high frequency group had a relative risk of 9.4 (P = 0.0001) of treatment failure (death or relapse) when compared with other combinations. We conclude that with our present GvHD prophylaxis regimen, CTLp frequency analysis predicts post-BMT outcome and is a valuable aid in donor selection.","['Spencer, A', 'Brookes, P A', 'Kaminski, E', 'Hows, J M', 'Szydlo, R M', 'van Rhee, F', 'Goldman, J M', 'Batchelor, J R']","['Spencer A', 'Brookes PA', 'Kaminski E', 'Hows JM', 'Szydlo RM', 'van Rhee F', 'Goldman JM', 'Batchelor JR']","['LRF Centre for Adult Leukaemia, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/pathology', '*Tissue Donors']",,1995/05/15 00:00,1995/05/15 00:01,['1995/05/15 00:00'],"['1995/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Transplantation. 1995 May 15;59(9):1302-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ratio of standardized mortality/morbidity ratios (SMRs) for patients exposed to Thorotrast and controls was the relative risk, which was analyzed by multiplicative regression (RRREG). For mortality from all causes, RRREG was significantly increased mainly due to cancer, benign and unspecified tumors and benign liver conditions, while RRREG for all other causes combined was not significantly increased. The RRREG was significantly associated with the injected amount of Thorotrast for cancer and for benign liver conditions, while no other dependence on the amount of Thorotrast was seen. Cancer incidence was significantly increased, caused mostly by liver cancer, leukemia, metastases and cancer at unspecified sites. The risk for cancer other than liver, hematological, brain, metastases and cancer at unspecified sites combined was also significantly increased, but the temporal trend of RR for this category of sites did not indicate a radiation effect. A significant association between relative risk of cancer and injected amount of Thorotrast was largely accounted for by liver cancer. Thus increased mortality among patients exposed to Thorotrast is due mainly to cancer and benign liver diseases, and increased cancer incidence is caused by high risks of liver cancer, leukemia and ill-defined types (metastases, etc.). The time trend and dependence of the amount of Thorotrast injected do not support that cancer at most other sites is related to radiation from Thorotrast.","['Andersson, M', 'Carstensen, B', 'Storm, H H']","['Andersson M', 'Carstensen B', 'Storm HH']","['Danish Cancer Society, Division for Cancer Epidemiology, Copenhagen.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,['9XA7X17UQC (Thorium Dioxide)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebral Angiography/*methods', 'Cerebral Arteries/*diagnostic imaging', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/mortality', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Morbidity', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Differentiation', 'Sex Factors', '*Thorium Dioxide/adverse effects']",,1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1995 Jun;142(3):305-20.,,,,['N01-CP-21152/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results strongly suggest a role for erythroid cell-derived PDGF in normal erythropoiesis and provide documentation of the regulated production of a pleiotropic cytokine by erythroid cells.","['Keutzer, J C', 'Sytkowski, A J']","['Keutzer JC', 'Sytkowski AJ']","['New England Deaconess Hospital, Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Phenylhydrazines)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '064F424C9K (phenylhydrazine)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Models, Biological', 'Phenylhydrazines/pharmacology', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Spleen/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC41828,1995/05/23 00:00,1995/05/23 00:01,['1995/05/23 00:00'],"['1995/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/23 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.11.4967 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 May 23;92(11):4967-71. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.11.4967.,,,,"['5 F32 HL08563/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK38841/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This gene is fused by reciprocal translocation with a variety of other genes in acute lymphoblastic and myelogenous leukemias, and it undergoes self-fusion in acute myeloid leukemias with normal karyotype or trisomy 11. Here we report an alteration of the ALL-1 gene in a gastric carcinoma cell line (Mgc80-3). Characterization of this rearrangement revealed a three-way complex translocation, involving chromosomes 1 and 11, resulting in a partial duplication of the ALL-1 gene. Sequencing of reverse transcription-PCR products and Northern blot analysis showed that only the partially duplicated ALL-1 gene was transcribed, producing an mRNA with exon 8 fused to exon 2. This report of ALL-1 gene rearrangement in a solid tumor suggests that ALL-1 plays a role in the pathogenesis of some solid malignancies. The absence of the normal transcript in this cell line, in association with the loss-of-heterozygosity studies on chromosome 11q23 seen in solid tumors, suggests that ALL-1 is involved in tumorigenesis by a loss-of-function mechanism.","['Baffa, R', 'Negrini, M', 'Schichman, S A', 'Huebner, K', 'Croce, C M']","['Baffa R', 'Negrini M', 'Schichman SA', 'Huebner K', 'Croce CM']","['Jefferson Cancer Institute, Jefferson Cancer Center, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Introns', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Rodentia', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers']",PMC41819,1995/05/23 00:00,1995/05/23 00:01,['1995/05/23 00:00'],"['1995/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/23 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.11.4922 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 May 23;92(11):4922-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.11.4922.,,['ALL-1'],,"['CA39860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The consequence of the translocation is fusion of the helix-loop-helix domain of TEL, an ETS-like putative transcription factor, to the DNA-binding and transactivation domains of the transcription factor AML1. These data show that TEL, previously shown to be fused to the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, can be implicated in the pathogenesis of leukemia through its fusion to either a receptor tyrosine kinase or a transcription factor.

Few programs of pediatric home chemotherapy have been described or evaluated. The purpose of this work was to compare prospectively chemotherapy in the hospital to chemotherapy at home with respect to billed medical charges, out-of-pocket expenses, and quality of life. METHODS: Eligibility criteria for home therapy were defined. Parents and nurses were trained. Billed charges, loss of wages, out-of-pocket expenses, medical outcome, and quality of life of 14 patients for one course of chemotherapy in the hospital were compared with those for an identical course at home. RESULTS: Daily charges for chemotherapy were $2329 +/- 627 in the hospital and $1865 +/- 833 at home; out-of-pocket costs, $68 +/- 31 and $11 +/- 6, respectively; and loss of income, $265 +/- 233 and $67 +/- 107, respectively. Patients' independence, well-being, appetite, mood, and school work were significantly better at home, and parental time at work and with the family was greater. CONCLUSION: Administration of selected chemotherapy at home results in lower billed charges, reduced expenses, reduced loss of income for parents, and a more satisfying lifestyle for patients and parents.","['Close, P', 'Burkey, E', 'Kazak, A', 'Danz, P', 'Lange, B']","['Close P', 'Burkey E', 'Kazak A', 'Danz P', 'Lange B']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hershey Medical Center, PA 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*economics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/economics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cost of Illness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Fees and Charges', 'Female', 'Home Infusion Therapy/*economics', 'Hospital Charges', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Philadelphia', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of Life']",,1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pediatrics. 1995 Jun;95(6):896-900.,,,,['MCJ 425-027/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PDGF-B and IL-1 beta stimulated proliferation of cultivated KS spindle cells in vitro. Analysis of gene expression in vivo revealed that both factors as well as the PDGF beta-receptor are present in KS lesions. By contrast, IL-6 had no effect and OSM inhibited proliferation of cultivated KS spindle cells. Again, the effect of these factors on cultivated KS spindle cells in vitro was reflected by the gene expression observed in KS lesions in vivo. Neither the expression of IL-6 receptor nor of OSM could be detected in KS lesions by in situ hybridization. Moreover, in situ hybridization revealed an identical pattern of gene expression in cultivated KS spindle cells and KS spindle cells in vivo with respect to the above-mentioned cytokines [PDGF-B, IL-1 beta, IL-1 alpha, IL-6, OSM] and their receptors [PDGF beta-receptor, gp130, IL-6 receptor, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor].

The median survival of patients with the acute and lymphomatous forms of the disease is short, despite the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy. METHODS: We treated 19 patients with acute or lymphomatous forms of adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma with oral zidovudine (200 mg five times daily) and interferon alfa (Intron A, 5 to 10 million units subcutaneously each day). Seven of these patients had either relapsed after multiagent cytotoxic chemotherapy or failed to respond to that treatment. RESULTS: Major responses were achieved in 58 percent of the patients (11 of 19), including complete remission in 26 percent (5 of 19). Four patients in whom prior cytotoxic therapy had failed had major responses, two of which were complete remissions. Six patients have survived for more than 12 months, with the longest remission since the discontinuation of treatment lasting more than 59 months.

Cardiotoxicity is often progressive, and some patients have disabling symptoms. Our objective was to identify risk factors for late cardiotoxicity. METHODS: We examined echocardiograms from 120 children and adults who had received cumulative doses of 244 to 550 mg of doxorubicin per square meter of body-surface area for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia or osteogenic sarcoma in childhood, a mean of 8.1 years earlier. Measurements of blood pressure and left ventricular function, contractility (measured as the stress-velocity index), end-diastolic posterior-wall thickness, end-diastolic dimension, mass, and afterload (measured as end-systolic wall stress) were compared with sex-specific values from a cohort of 296 normal subjects. RESULTS: All echocardiographic measurements were abnormal at follow-up a minimum of two years after the end of therapy, with more frequent and severe abnormalities in female patients. In a multivariate analysis, female sex and a higher cumulative dose of doxorubicin were associated with depressed contractility (P < or = 0.001), and there was an interaction between these two variables. Independent and significant associations were found between a higher rate of administration of doxorubicin and increased afterload (P < or = 0.001), left ventricular dilatation, and depressed left ventricular function; between a higher cumulative dose and depressed left ventricular function (P < or = 0.001); between a younger age at diagnosis and reduced left-ventricular-wall thickness and mass and increased afterload; and between a longer time since the completion of doxorubicin therapy and reduced left-ventricular-wall thickness and increased afterload (P < or = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Female sex and a higher rate of administration of doxorubicin were independent risk factors for cardiac abnormalities after treatment with doxorubicin for childhood cancer; the prevalence and severity of abnormalities increased with longer follow-up.","['Lipshultz, S E', 'Lipsitz, S R', 'Mone, S M', 'Goorin, A M', 'Sallan, S E', 'Sanders, S P', 'Orav, E J', 'Gelber, R D', 'Colan, S D']","['Lipshultz SE', 'Lipsitz SR', 'Mone SM', 'Goorin AM', 'Sallan SE', 'Sanders SP', 'Orav EJ', 'Gelber RD', 'Colan SD']","[""Department of Cardiology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart Diseases/*chemically induced/diagnostic imaging', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Myocardial Contraction/drug effects', 'Osteosarcoma/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Survivors', 'Ultrasonography', 'Ventricular Function, Left/drug effects']",,1995/06/29 00:00,1995/06/29 00:01,['1995/06/29 00:00'],"['1995/06/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/29 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199506293322602 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1995 Jun 29;332(26):1738-43. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199506293322602.,,,,"['CA06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,"['N Engl J Med. 1995 Nov 16;333(20):1359-60.

Cancer and Leukemia Group B.,1671-7,"BACKGROUND: Elderly patients with primary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) are less likely to enter remission than younger adults, in part because of a higher mortality rate related to severe myelosuppression. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has been shown to shorten the duration of neutropenia and decrease infectious complications when administered after chemotherapy to patients with lymphomas and solid tumors. METHODS: We randomly assigned 388 patients 60 years of age or older who had newly diagnosed primary AML to receive placebo or GM-CSF (5 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day intravenously over a period of six hours) in a double-blind manner, beginning the day after the completion of three days of daunorubicin (45 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day) and seven days of cytarabine (200 mg per square meter per day by continuous intravenous infusion). If leukemia cells persisted in the marrow three weeks after the initiation of chemotherapy, further daunorubicin (two days) and cytarabine (five days) were administered. GM-CSF or placebo was given daily until the neutrophil count was at least 1000 per cubic millimeter, there was evidence of the regrowth of leukemia, or severe toxic effects attributable to the study infusion occurred. Patients who had a complete remission were then randomly assigned to receive one of two intensification regimens. RESULTS: Of 388 patients (median age, 69 years), 193 were randomly assigned to receive GM-CSF and 195 to placebo. The rate of complete remission was 51 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 44 to 59 percent) among those assigned to GM-CSF and 54 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 47 to 61 percent) among those assigned to receive placebo (P = 0.61). The reasons for failure (early death, death during marrow hypoplasia, and persistent leukemia), the incidence of severe or lethal infection, and the incidence of the regrowth of leukemia (2 percent overall) were similar in the two groups. The median duration of neutropenia was slightly shorter (P = 0.02) in the patients who received GM-CSF (15 days) than in those who received placebo (17 days), but the clinical importance of this result was minimal because the growth factor failed to lower the treatment-related mortality rate or improve the rate of complete remission. CONCLUSIONS: GM-CSF, in the dose and schedule we used, does not stimulate the regrowth of leukemia, but it also does not decrease the severe myelosuppressive consequences of initial chemotherapy or improve the response rate in patients 60 years of age or older with primary AML. It should not be recommended for use in such patients.","['Stone, R M', 'Berg, D T', 'George, S L', 'Dodge, R K', 'Paciucci, P A', 'Schulman, P', 'Lee, E J', 'Moore, J O', 'Powell, B L', 'Schiffer, C A']","['Stone RM', 'Berg DT', 'George SL', 'Dodge RK', 'Paciucci PA', 'Schulman P', 'Lee EJ', 'Moore JO', 'Powell BL', 'Schiffer CA']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Regression Analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1995/06/22 00:00,1995/06/22 00:01,['1995/06/22 00:00'],"['1995/06/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/22 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199506223322503 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1995 Jun 22;332(25):1671-7. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199506223322503.,,,,"['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37055/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,['N Engl J Med. 1995 Jun 22;332(25):1712-3.

Surprisingly, we find that growth of a significant percentage of THP1 cells is arrested in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. G2 arrest correlates with cell-specific repression of the gene encoding p34cdc2, a crucial regulator of G2/M progression. Intriguingly, TPA-mediated repression of the cdc2 promoter was independent of the transcription factor E2F, distinguishing this pathway from mechanisms responsible for repression of cdc2 transcription in response to serum starvation. The region of the cdc2 promoter required for repression was located from bp -22 to -2 from the major transcriptional start site. This sequence, which we term the R box, directs the uncoupling of the basal promoter from upstream activators following TPA treatment. Analysis of THP1 nuclear proteins revealed a 55-kDa protein that was induced by TPA and interacted with the cdc2 promoter in an R-box-dependent manner. These observations provide evidence for the existence of cell-type- and promoter-specific pathways for the assembly of stable transcriptional initiation complexes that function to differentially regulate the expression of cell cycle control genes in mammalian cells.","['Sugarman, J L', 'Schonthal, A H', 'Glass, C K']","['Sugarman JL', 'Schonthal AH', 'Glass CK']","['Division of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0651, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Phorbol Esters)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'G2 Phase', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC230561,1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.15.6.3282 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1995 Jun;15(6):3282-90. doi: 10.1128/MCB.15.6.3282.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess the transforming potential of this novel gene, we introduced it into NIH 3T3 murine fibroblasts by using an expression vector that also contained the neomycin resistance gene. Cells selected for resistance to the neomycin analog G418 formed aberrant colonies in monolayer cultures, marked by increased cell density and altered morphology. Transfected cells also grew readily in soft agar, producing colonies whose sizes correlated with E2A-HLF expression levels. Subclones expanded from colonies with high levels of the protein reproducibly formed tumors in nude mice and grew to higher plateau-phase cell densities in reduced-serum conditions than did parental NIH 3T3 cells. By contrast, NIH 3T3 cells expressing mutant E2A-HLF proteins that lacked either of the bipartite E2A trans-activation domains or the HLF leucine zipper domain failed to show oncogenic properties, including anchorage-independent cell growth. Thus, both of the E2A trans-activation motifs and the HLF leucine zipper dimerization domain are essential for the transforming potential of the chimeric E2A-HLF protein, suggesting a model in which aberrant regulation of the expression pattern of downstream target genes contributes to leukemogenesis.","['Yoshihara, T', 'Inaba, T', 'Shapiro, L H', 'Kato, J Y', 'Look, A T']","['Yoshihara T', 'Inaba T', 'Shapiro LH', 'Kato JY', 'Look AT']","[""Department of Experimental Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Adenovirus E2 Proteins)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2a-Hlf fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Adenovirus E2 Proteins/*genetics/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/pharmacology', 'Leucine Zippers/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/pharmacology', 'Plasmids', 'Protein Folding', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC230557,1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.15.6.3247 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1995 Jun;15(6):3247-55. doi: 10.1128/MCB.15.6.3247.,,,,"['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 59571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test this possibility 587 patients with CML in chronic phase were randomly allocated to receive lymphoblastoid cell-line interferon-alpha n1 (IFN-alpha, n = 293) or chemotherapy with busulphan or hydroxyurea (no IFN-alpha, n = 294) as maintenance after initial induction treatment with cytotoxic drugs. There was a significant survival benefit for patients in the IFN-alpha arm when analysed on the basis of intention to treat (2p = 0.0009). The median survival for those allocated IFN-alpha was 61 months and no IFN-alpha was 41 months. Out of 269 patients with Philadelphia-positive CML in the IFN-alpha arm with at least 6 months follow-up, 211 were evaluable for haematological response: 145 (68%) achieved good responses (A+ or A type), 37 (18%) had partial responses (B type) and 29 (14%) had poor responses (C type). Patients with types A and B responses had a better survival than those in the no IFN-alpha arm; patients with type C responses had survival equivalent to the no IFN-alpha arm. Of these 269 patients, 26 of whom had not started IFN-alpha, 59 (22%) achieved a significant degree of cytogenetic response but 210 (78%) did not have a response. Cytogenetic responders survived significantly longer than non-responders and even non-responders survived longer than patients in the no IFN-alpha arm. Since cytogenetic non-responders had worse than average prognostic features, they may also benefit from IFN-alpha therapy. We conclude that treatment with IFN-alpha prolongs the survival of patients with CML; benefits of IFN-alpha are not confined to cytogenetic responders but may extend to most, if not all patients receiving IFN-alpha treatment; and cytogenetic response to IFN-alpha treatment identifies patients with a relatively good prognosis.","['Allan, N C', 'Richards, S M', 'Shepherd, P C']","['Allan NC', 'Richards SM', 'Shepherd PC']","['CML Trial Office, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Survival Analysis']",,1995/06/03 00:00,1995/06/03 00:01,['1995/06/03 00:00'],"['1995/06/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/03 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0140-6736(95)92596-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0140-6736(95)92596-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1995 Jun 3;345(8962):1392-7. doi: 10.1016/s0140-6736(95)92596-1.,,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Control animals were injected with an equal volume of saline. After 24 h, hearts were isolated and perfused. Following an equilibration period, the hearts were subjected to 1 h ischemia and 1 h of reperfusion. All treated groups showed significant increases in percent recovery of developed tension (% preischemic) when compared to saline-treated control hearts. In addition there were significant decreases in lactate dehydrogenase release (LDH), accumulation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and accumulation of carbonyl proteins. These results correlate with increases in myocardial MnSOD activity.

The catalytic activity of DNA-dependent protein kinase is carried by a 350-kD subunit (p350). In light of the recently described role of Ku in repairing double-strand DNA breaks, we investigated the regulation of Ku and p350 levels in neutrophils, a terminally differentiated cell type destined to undergo apoptosis. Since the appearance of double-strand DNA breaks is characteristic of apoptosis, we were interested in the possibility that Ku might oppose programmed cell death. Analysis of peripheral blood cells by flow cytometry using anti-Ku and anti-p350 monoclonal antibodies revealed that neutrophils were unstained, whereas resting (G0) lymphocytes were positive. The absence of Ku in mature neutrophils was confirmed by Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Ku antigen. In contrast, the human promyelocytic leukemia line, HL-60, which undergoes differentiation toward neutrophils after dimethylsulfoxide treatment, was positive for Ku and p350. In view of the short lifespan of neutrophils and the prolonged half-life of Ku and p350 (> 5 d), these data suggested that Ku was actively degraded during myeloid differentiation. Analysis of HL-60 cells by flow cytometry revealed that Ku staining was bimodal. Cells in G1/G0, S, or G2/M were all stained positively, whereas cells with a subdiploid DNA content characteristic of apoptosis were Ku negative. Similar results were obtained with phytohemagglutin-stimulated human lymphocytes. These data suggest that the Ku antigen is actively degraded in both myeloid cells destined to undergo apoptosis and apoptotic lymphocytes, raising the possibility that degradation of Ku may help to prevent the inappropriate repair of fragmented nuclear DNA during apoptosis.","['Ajmani, A K', 'Satoh, M', 'Reap, E', 'Cohen, P L', 'Reeves, W H']","['Ajmani AK', 'Satoh M', 'Reap E', 'Cohen PL', 'Reeves WH']","['Department of Medicine, Thurston Arthritis Research Center, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PRKDC protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (XRCC5 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Xrcc6 protein, human)', 'EC 4.2.99.- (Ku Autoantigen)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Antigens, Nuclear', '*Apoptosis', 'Autoantibodies/immunology', 'Autoantigens/*analysis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/analysis', '*DNA Helicases', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*analysis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Ku Autoantigen', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology/immunology/*physiology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Neutrophils/enzymology/immunology/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC2192057,1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.181.6.2049 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1995 Jun 1;181(6):2049-58. doi: 10.1084/jem.181.6.2049.,,,,"['P50-AR42573/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P60-AR30701/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AR40391/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the study presented here, the full-length PML cDNA was transfected into B104-1-1 cells (NIH/3T3 cells transformed by the activated neu oncogene) by retrovirally mediated gene transfer. We found that expression of PML could reverse phenotypes of B104-1-1 including morphology, contact-limiting properties, and growth rate in both transient-expression and stable transfectants. We also demonstrated that PML is able to suppress clonogenicity of B104-1-1 in soft agar assay and tumorigenicity in nude mice. These results strongly support our previous finding that PML is a transformation or growth suppressor. Our results further demonstrate that expression of PML in B104-1-1 cells has little effect on cell cycle distribution. Western blot analysis demonstrated that suppression of neu expression in B104-1-1 by PML was insignificant in the transient transfection experiment but significant in the PML stable transfectants. This study suggests that PML may suppress neu expression and block signaling events associated with activated neu. This study supports our hypothesis that disruption of the normal function of PML, a growth or transformation suppressor, is a critical event in APL leukomogenesis.","['Liu, J H', 'Mu, Z M', 'Chang, K S']","['Liu JH', 'Mu ZM', 'Chang KS']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Clone Cells', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, erbB-2', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Mice', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/analysis/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",PMC2192078,1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.181.6.1965 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1995 Jun 1;181(6):1965-73. doi: 10.1084/jem.181.6.1965.,,['neu'],,['CA-55577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So called costimulatory signals, mediated by other cell surface interactions or soluble cytokines produced by antigen presenting cells, are also required for complete T cell activation. High levels of cytokine gene expression in T cells also required both TCR and costimulatory signals. The granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor requires sequences in the promoter as well as a powerful enhancer located 3kb upstream to respond to TCR-like signals. These promoter and enhancer regions are mainly activated by the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). The activation of NFAT by TCR signals has been well described for interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-4 gene transcription in T cells. Costimulatory signals, such as activation of the CD28 cell surface molecule on T cells, lead to activation through a distinct region of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) promoter. This region is termed the CK-1 or CD28RE and appears to bind specific members of the NF-kappa B family of transcription factors. Human T leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infects T cells and can lead to increase GM-CSF expression. We have found that the HTLV-1 transactivator protein, tax, acts as a costimulatory signal for GM-CSF and IL-2 gene transcription, in that it can cooperate with TCR signals to mediate high level gene expression. Tax activates the GM-CSF promoter through the CK-1/CD28RE region and also activates nuclear factor-kappa B binding to this region. However, other transcription factors or coactivators of NF-kappa B are required for tax activation but these remain to be identified. The CK-1/CD28RE of GM-CSF shows a high degree of similarity to the IL-2 CD28RE and the IL-3 gene also contains a related region. This observation, together with the fact that both GM-CSF and IL-2 respond to TCR signals via NFAT, implies a high degree of conservation in the regulation of cytokine gene expression in T cells.","['Shannon, M F', 'Himes, S R', 'Coles, L S']","['Shannon MF', 'Himes SR', 'Coles LS']","['Division of Human Immunology, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, South Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'CD28 Antigens/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/genetics/*physiology', 'Interleukin-3/genetics', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.57.5.767 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1995 May;57(5):767-73. doi: 10.1002/jlb.57.5.767.,,,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human peripheral blood-derived monocytes/macrophages were highly sensitive to TCS (ID50 at 1.70 micrograms/ml).

Human T cell lines and macrophage cell lines were more sensitive (ID50 < 0.9 microgram/ml) to TCS than B cell lines and myeloid lines.

While the virus appears to maintain a state of latency in most infected cells, high level virion production is an essential step in the HTLV-I life cycle. The virally-encoded Tax protein, a potent activator of gene expression, is believed to control the switch from latency to replication. Tax stimulation of HTLV-I transcription is mediated through cellular activating transcription factor/cAMP response element binding proteins, which bind the three 21-base pair (bp) repeat viral enhancer elements. In this report, we show that viral latency may result from a highly unstable interaction between CREB and the HTLV-I 21-bp repeats, resulting in rapid dissociation of CREB from the viral promoter. In the presence Tax, the dissociation rate of CREB from a 21-bp repeat element is decreased. This stabilization is highly specific, requiring the amino-terminal region of CREB and appropriate 21-bp repeat sequences. We suggest that Tax stabilization of CREB binding to the viral promoter leads to an increase in gene expression, possibly providing the switch from latency to high level replication of the virus.","['Brauweiler, A', 'Garl, P', 'Franklin, A A', 'Giebler, H A', 'Nyborg, J K']","['Brauweiler A', 'Garl P', 'Franklin AA', 'Giebler HA', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factor 2)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 2', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/growth & development', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Virus Latency/*genetics']",,1995/05/26 00:00,1995/05/26 00:01,['1995/05/26 00:00'],"['1995/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.21.12814 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)49749-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 May 26;270(21):12814-22. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.21.12814.,,,,['CA-55035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In myeloid leukemia cells, CDP/cut binding activity as assayed on the promoter of the phagocyte-specific cytochrome heavy chain gene gp91-phox varies inversely with expression of gp91-phox mRNA. We used two approaches to ascertain whether CDP/cut serves as a repressor of gp91-phox gene expression. First, we used transient transfection assays in 3T3 cells to demonstrate that the CDP/cut binding site from the gp91-phox promoter acts as a negative regulatory element in artificial promoter constructs. Second, we isolated a stable transformant of HL-60 myeloid cells constitutively expressing transfected CDP/cut cDNA. Stable transformants carrying expression vector alone or expressing CDP/cut mRNA were induced to differentiate along the macrophage lineage with phorbol ester or along the neutrophil lineage with dimethyl sulfoxide or retinoic acid/dimethylformamide. Northern blot analysis was used to assess induction of mRNAs encoding gp91-phox, and the myeloid oxidase cytosolic components, p47 and p67. In the stable transformant expressing transfected CDP/cut cDNA, gp91-phox induction was selectively reduced, whereas morphologic differentiation and induction of mRNA for myeloid oxidase components p47 and p67 were unaffected. These data provide persuasive evidence that CDP/cut acts to repress the gp91-phox gene.","['Lievens, P M', 'Donady, J J', 'Tufarelli, C', 'Neufeld, E J']","['Lievens PM', 'Donady JJ', 'Tufarelli C', 'Neufeld EJ']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CUX1 protein, human)', '0 (Cux1 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '8696NH0Y2X (Dimethylformamide)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (CYBB protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Dimethylformamide/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Globins/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Macrophages/physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'NADPH Oxidase 2', '*NADPH Oxidases', 'Neutrophils/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transformation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/05/26 00:00,1995/05/26 00:01,['1995/05/26 00:00'],"['1995/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.21.12745 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)49740-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 May 26;270(21):12745-50. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.21.12745.,,,,"['DK01977/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL49196/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the enzymes required for the synthesis of leukotrienes from arachidonic acid is 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). Azelastine, which is preferentially taken up by the lung and alveolar macrophages, inhibits leukotriene generation in the airways. This property of azelastine may contribute to its therapeutic efficacy in the long-term treatment and management of rhinitis and asthma. Azelastine does not directly inhibit 5-LO in disrupted murine peritoneal cells and rat basophilic leukemia cells (IC50 > 100 microM), but does have moderate 5-LO inhibitory activity in intact murine peritoneal cells (IC50 = 10 microM, 5 min) and in chopped guinea pig liver (IC50 = 14 microM, 2 hr). The generation and release of leukotrienes in human neutrophils and eosinophils is also inhibited by azelastine (IC50 = 0.9-1.1 microM). Furthermore, azelastine is a potent and specific inhibitor of allergen-induced generation of leukotrienes in the nose of the guinea pig (ID50 < 100 micrograms/kg, im, 20 min) as well as in patients with rhinitis (2 mg, po, 4 hr; ID50 < 30 micrograms/kg). Azelastine also inhibits allergen-induced, leukotriene-mediated, pyrilamine-resistant bronchoconstriction (oral ID50 = 60 micrograms/kg, 2 hr and 120 micrograms/kg, 24 hr). This profile suggests that azelastine may be a novel inhibitor of Ca(2+)-dependent translocation of 5-lipoxygenase from cytosol to the nuclear envelope or a FLAP inhibitor rather than a direct 5-LO inhibitor.","['Chand, N', 'Sofia, R D']","['Chand N', 'Sofia RD']","['Wallace Laboratories, Division of Carter-Wallace, Inc., Cranbury, New Jersey 08512, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Asthma,The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma,8106454,"['0 (Bronchodilator Agents)', '0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Phthalazines)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'ZQI909440X (azelastine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/metabolism', 'Bronchodilator Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukotrienes/*biosynthesis', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Phthalazines/*pharmacology']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/02770909509089512 [doi]'],ppublish,J Asthma. 1995;32(3):227-34. doi: 10.3109/02770909509089512.,,,46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results suggests that c-Myc cooperates with BCR/ABL and is necessary for the growth of Ph1-positive leukemias.","['Nieborowska-Skorska, M', 'Ratajczak, M Z', 'Calabretta, B', 'Skorski, T']","['Nieborowska-Skorska M', 'Ratajczak MZ', 'Calabretta B', 'Skorski T']","['Jefferson Cancer Institute, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Folia Histochem Cytobiol,Folia histochemica et cytobiologica,8502651,"['0 (DNA, Antisense)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division', 'DNA, Antisense/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, myc/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Folia Histochem Cytobiol. 1994;32(4):231-4.,,['c-myc'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the primary structures of p57, they have two unique amino acid sequence motifs, a WD repeat and a leucine zipper motif. Furthermore, p57 shared sequence similarity (40%) with coronin, an actin-binding protein responsible for chemotaxis, cell motility, and cytokinesis of Dictyostelium discoideum, which has only the WD repeat. p57 also showed an actin-binding activity and was mainly expressed in immune tissues. From these results, we conclude that p57 is a coronin-like novel actin-binding protein in mammalian cells but may also have a different function from coronin.","['Suzuki, K', 'Nishihata, J', 'Arai, Y', 'Honma, N', 'Yamamoto, K', 'Irimura, T', 'Toyoshima, S']","['Suzuki K', 'Nishihata J', 'Arai Y', 'Honma N', 'Yamamoto K', 'Irimura T', 'Toyoshima S']","['Pharmaceutical Basic Research Laboratories, Japan Tobacco Inc., Kanagawa.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (F-actin-binding proteins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '145420-64-0 (coronin proteins)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Actins/analysis', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cattle', '*Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', '*Leucine Zippers', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Microfilament Proteins/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Homology', 'Spleen/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/05/15 00:00,1995/05/15 00:01,['1995/05/15 00:00'],"['1995/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-5793(95)00393-N [pii]', '10.1016/0014-5793(95)00393-n [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1995 May 15;364(3):283-8. doi: 10.1016/0014-5793(95)00393-n.,,,,,"['GENBANK/D44496', 'GENBANK/D44497']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This antibody, termed AMC, was reactive with compounds that had 5-methylcytosine structure (i.e. 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine, 5-methylcytidine and 5-methylcytosine). AMC had the highest reactivity to 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine among reactive compounds and had no or very slight cross-reactivity to cytidine-related compounds and any other compounds. Analysis of immunoreactive materials in urine revealed that 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine rather than 5-methylcytidine was, contrary to our expectation, the major component. Then the inhibition ELISA system using AMC was established and urinary levels of 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine in healthy individuals and cancer patients were determined. The mean excretion levels of healthy individuals was 0.90 +/- 0.43 nmol/mumol creatinine and the cut-off value was set at the mean + 2 S.D. of healthy individuals (1.76 nmol/mumol creatinine).

The relative amounts of proteins HMG1, HMG2 and histone H1 zero were evaluated densitometrically by SDS-PAGE of 5 per cent w/v perchloric acid extracts of blood cells. Concerning the HMG1 and HMG2, the main conclusions were: the expression of these HMG proteins was higher in malignant cells, namely leukemia cell lines, then in lymphocytes or granulocytes and the distribution of HMG1 and HMG2 was highly cell-specific. In comparison with lymphoid cells, the levels of HMG1/2 were higher in myeloid cells. The results revealed that in myeloid cells HMG2 prevails over HMG1. There was no direct correlation between HMG1/2 expression and proliferation activity. The levels of HMG1/2 did not depend on the transcription of chromatin either. However, there was some connection between irreversibly differentiated nonproliferating cells and a loss of HMG1/2 proteins. Reversibly differentiated leukemic cells retain their HMG1/2 levels. Similarly to HMG1/2,H1 zero showed a strong cell specificity. The level of H1 zero was different in the various blood cell types. As compared with lymphoid cells, the level of H1 zero was several-fold higher in myeloid cells, regardless of whether they were normal or malignant. Moreover, there was an accumulation of H1 zero in differentiating HL-60 cells accompanied by only a slight decline in cell proliferation; this agrees with the idea that H1 zero expression is not directly associated with the inhibition of cell growth. Rather higher expression of H1 zero is related to changes during cell differentiation.","['Cabart, P', 'Kalousek, I', 'Jandova, D', 'Hrkal, Z']","['Cabart P', 'Kalousek I', 'Jandova D', 'Hrkal Z']","['Department of Cellular Biochemistry, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Biochem Funct,Cell biochemistry and function,8305874,"['0 (High Mobility Group Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'High Mobility Group Proteins/biosynthesis/*blood', 'Histones/biosynthesis/*blood', 'Humans', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbf.290130209 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biochem Funct. 1995 Jun;13(2):125-33. doi: 10.1002/cbf.290130209.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was designed to investigate CR1 expression on human leukemia-derived CD4+ T cell lines. The expression of CR1, as well as the complement receptor type 2 (CR2) and membrane cofactor protein (MCP), were analyzed on cells from the SUP-T1, CEM-SS, HUT-78, and MOLT-3 cell lines by flow cytometry. All four cell lines expressed CR2 and MCP, but only the SUP-T1 cell line contained CR1+ cells. Within the SUP-T1 cell line, a mean of 8.5% of the cells were CR1+. Scatchard analysis indicated that approximately 2700 CR1 molecules were expressed per CR1+ SUP-T1 cell, a value that corresponds to the quantitative expression of CR1 on normal peripheral blood T lymphocytes. Separation of CR1+ and CR1- cells within the SUP-T1 cell line by flow cytometry and subsequent reculture of the sorted cells showed that both the enriched CR1+ and the enriched CR1- cell populations returned to a mixed CR1 phenotype over time. These data suggest that SUP-T1 cells can express CR1, but only transiently. Two-color flow cytometric analysis indicated that the expression of CR1 by SUP-T1 cells did not fluctuate with the cell cycle. SUP-T1 cells were also cultured in the presence of agents known to activate T cells. Phytohemagglutinin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced a transient increase in the percentage of SUP-T1 cells expressing CR1, compared to cells cultured in media alone. These results suggest that CR1 expression is up-regulated during T cell activation. The CR1+ SUP-T1 cell line, as well as the CR1- cell lines, may provide useful models for investigating how CR1 expression is regulated and for exploring a possible role for CR1 in the pathogenesis of AIDS.","['Yaskanin, D D', 'Waxman, F J']","['Yaskanin DD', 'Waxman FJ']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City 73190, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Receptors, Complement 3b)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Cycle/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Receptors, Complement 3b/*analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0008-8749(85)71108-2 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1995.1108 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1995 Jun;163(1):139-47. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1995.1108.,,,,['R01 AI 25964/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether c-RAF-1 plays a role in the growth of BCR/ABL-dependent cells, we examined whether c-RAF-1 associates with and/or is regulated by BCR/ABL and, if so, whether this interaction is functionally significant for BCR/ABL-dependent growth of chronic myelogenous leukemia cells and for growth factor-dependent proliferation of normal bone marrow cells. We show that c-RAF-1 enzymatic activity is regulated by BCR/ABL, although the protein does not associate with BCR/ABL. Downregulation of c-RAF-1 expression with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides or cDNA constructs, and inhibition of c-RAF-1 activity by its dominant negative mutants, inhibited both BCR/ABL-dependent growth of chronic myelogenous leukemia cells and growth factor-dependent proliferation of normal hematopoietic progenitors and the MO7 cell line without affecting the BCR/ABL-and growth factor-independent proliferation of HL-60 cells.

After removing cells by centrifugation, rhIL-5 was purified by first adjusting the culture medium to the calculated pI value of mature IL-5 (pI 7.44) and then passing the conditioned medium through tandem linked anion- and cation-exchange columns.

Follow-up of antibody titres, however, gave confirmation of the presence of fungal infection as well as the response to antifungal treatment.","['Ormala, T', 'Korppi, M', 'Katila, M L', 'Ojanen, T', 'Perkkio, M']","['Ormala T', 'Korppi M', 'Katila ML', 'Ojanen T', 'Perkkio M']","['Department of Paediatrics, Kuopio University Hospital, Finland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Norway,Acta Paediatr,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",9205968,"['0 (Antibodies, Fungal)', '0 (Antigens, Fungal)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Fungal/*blood', 'Antigens, Fungal/*blood', 'Candida albicans/*immunology', 'Candidiasis/diagnosis/etiology/*immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Feces/microbiology', 'Female', 'Hemagglutination Tests/methods', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Latex Fixation Tests/methods', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications/therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1651-2227.1995.tb13606.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Paediatr. 1995 Feb;84(2):183-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1651-2227.1995.tb13606.x.,,,,,,,['Acta Paediatr. 1995 Aug;84(8):964.

In leukemia and Hodgkin's disease, all immunoglobulin isotypes decreased during therapy. A profound depression of immunoglobulin M levels, lasting well after completion of therapy, was seen in all tumor types. The mitogenic response was attenuated in patients with leukemia at diagnosis but was rapidly restored after institution of therapy.

So far, very few attempts have been made to evaluate the potential value of cytotoxicity assays for this purpose. The present study was undertaken as a first attempt to investigate the relationship between cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs in vitro and pharmacokinetic parameters in vivo in patients, at suggested maximum tolerated doses. Using the fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay (FMCA), we determined the concentration giving 50% cell survival (IC50) in vitro, for 25 cytotoxic drugs in fresh preparations of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and of tumor cells from patients with acute or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (ALL or CLL). Using linear regression, we investigated the relationship between the IC50s and clinically achievable peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) or concentration-time products (C x T) in humans. The clinical data was obtained from the literature. Based on all drugs tested, good correlations were obtained between IC50s for CLL cells, and both Cmax and C x T (R approximately 0.7, p < 0.0002), and for ALL cells and normal PBMC between IC50 and Cmax, while the two latter cell types showed somewhat weaker relationships to C x T. Using the IC50 data of CLL cells, predictions of Cmax and C x T exceeded 1 log for only four drugs. No tendencies to under- or overprediction within different classes of drugs were noted. The results demonstrate a significant relationship between toxicity in vitro and achievable systemic exposure of anticancer drugs in humans, which suggests that non-clonogenic in vitro assays for drug sensitivity testing may provide pharmacokinetic information useful in the development of investigational cytotoxic drugs.","['Fridborg, H', 'Nygren, P', 'Larsson, R']","['Fridborg H', 'Nygren P', 'Larsson R']","['Department of Oncology, University Hospital, Uppsala University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-199502000-00007 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1995 Feb;6(1):64-9. doi: 10.1097/00001813-199502000-00007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This toxicity predominantly involves modification of the O6 position of guanine with an alkyl moiety. The enzyme responsible for repair of O6-alkylguanine adducts, O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (alkyltransferase), is expressed at low levels in bone marrow (BM) cells. High alkyltransferase expression prevents the cytotoxicity and carcinogenicity of nitrosoureas in several transgenic and in vitro gene transfer models. We used gene transfer using a novel myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (MPSV) based retrovirus (vM5MGMT) to express the human alkyltransferase cDNA (MGMT) in human and murine hematopoietic cells. Transduced K562 cells had very high levels of alkyltransferase expression and significantly increased resistance to 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl) nitrosourea (BCNU) as compared with untransduced K562 cells. Primary murine BM progenitors showed a high transduction efficiency with vM5MGMT and have increased BCNU resistance in vitro. After BM transplantation with vM5MGMT-transduced BM cells and BCNU treatment of these mice, BM, spleen and thymus had a 10- to 40-fold increase in alkyltransferase expression that persisted for at least 23 weeks posttransplantation. Progenitor cells procured from mice expressing high levels of alkyltransferase also had increased resistance to BCNU.

GVHD can be eliminated by depleting mature donor T cells from the BM inoculum, thereby facilitating the development of graft-host tolerance. However, T-cell depletion often results in an increased incidence of graft rejection and an increased frequency of leukemia relapse. Thus, although graft-host tolerance is a desirable outcome, it can pose a significant threat to leukemia-bearing hosts. Using a major histocompatability complex (MHC)-matched allogeneic model of BMT (B10.BR into AKR), we found that irradiated recipients given donor BM alone displayed mixed T-cell chimerism and did not develop GVHD. Graft-host tolerance developed by 8 weeks after BMT in these chimeras, and they were susceptible to low-dose leukemia challenge. When sufficient numbers of donor spleen cells, as a source of T-cells, were added to the BM graft, AKR hosts developed severe and lethal GVHD. Antihost reactive donor T cells persisted in chimeras undergoing GVHD, indicating that graft-host tolerance did not develop. When administration of the spleen cells was delayed for 7 to 21 days after BMT, there was significantly less mortality because of GVHD. Day 21 was the optimal time for infusion of cells without development of GVHD. Graft-host tolerance was broken by the delayed infusion of donor cells, as indicated by the persistence of antihost-reactive donor T cells in these chimeras in T-cell receptor cross-linking and mixed lymphocyte reaction assays. Importantly, the persistence of antihost-reactive donor T cells correlated with along-term antileukemic effect that was still present at 100 days after transplant. Multiple infusions of immunocompetent donor cells could be administered without increasing the risk for GVHD if delayed until 21 days post-BMT. Delayed infusions of donor spleen cells also resulted in a long-term antileukemic effect in the absence of GVHD in an MHC-haplotype-mismatched model of BMT (SJL into [SJL x AKR]F1). Although delayed infusion of normal donor cells did not induce GVHD, spleen cells from donors previously sensitized to host alloantigens induced GVHD when infused 21 days after BMT. Thus, the ability of previously activated cells to induce GVHD was not inhibited in the same manner as naive cells. Results from limiting dilution analysis assays indicated that alloactivated interleukin-2-secreting CD4+ T cells were preferentially inhibited over cytolytic T cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Johnson, B D', 'Truitt, R L']","['Johnson BD', 'Truitt RL']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Histocompatibility', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Immunocompetence', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Spleen/transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Time Factors']",,1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77477-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Jun 1;85(11):3302-12.,,,,['CA39854/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Primary diagnoses included nine solid tumors and eight leukemias. Ten secondary leukemias were acute myeloid leukemia (AML), one was of mixed lineage, two were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and four presented as myelodysplasia. Of 15 cases with 11q23 involvement, 11 (73%) were cytogenetically identifiable; four cases had molecular rearrangement only. By Southern blot, rearrangements within the ALL-1 gene were similar to sporadic cases. The results of this analysis suggest the following: (1) In most pediatric cases of topoisomerase II inhibitor-associated leukemia, there is disruption of the breakpoint cluster region of the ALL-1 gene at chromosomal band 11q23. (2) Exposure histories vary in secondary 11q23 leukemia, as the only topoisomerase II inhibitor was dactinomycin in one case, and, in another case, no topoisomerase II inhibitor was administered. (3) There is clinical, morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular heterogeneity in pediatric secondary 11q23 leukemia. (4) There are some survivors of pediatric secondary 11q23 leukemia, but the outcome is most often fatal.","['Felix, C A', 'Hosler, M R', 'Winick, N J', 'Masterson, M', 'Wilson, A E', 'Lange, B J']","['Felix CA', 'Hosler MR', 'Winick NJ', 'Masterson M', 'Wilson AE', 'Lange BJ']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine 19104, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dactinomycin/*adverse effects', 'Etoposide/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Genes', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced/*genetics/mortality', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced/*genetics/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*chemically induced/*genetics/mortality', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Teniposide/*adverse effects', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",,1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77469-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Jun 1;85(11):3250-6.,,"['ALL-1', 'HRX', 'MLL', 'htrx1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CY24-68 is more telomeric than Ig gamma, separated by approximately 1 megabase (Mb). FISH studies were performed on four patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), one with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), one with plasma cell leukemia (PCL), and three cell lines. In each patient with t(8;14), t(14;18), and t(3;14), the signal of Ig gamma gene was observed on der(14) and that of CY24-68 at respective partner sites of these translocations, 8q24.1, 18q21.3, and 3q27. Interphase nuclei with a signal of Ig gamma clearly separated from that of CY24-68 were more frequently encountered in all of the patients (45% to 74%) than those in normal controls (4% to 5%). Even in cases where only interphase nuclei were available for FISH studies, 14q32 translocations are detected as shown in two patients each with NHL and t(11;14)-carrying PCL. In two cell lines, HS-1 derived from ALL carrying t(8;14) and FR4 derived from a plasmacytoma carrying a complex form of t(8;14), the signal of Ig gamma was observed at the breakpoint region 8q24.1 of the der(8) in addition to the der(14), indicating that translocation event occurred within the Ig gamma locus. Intense Ig gamma signal was found at the breakpoint region on the der(14)t(11;14) in HBL-2 derived from NHL, indicating amplification of the Ig gamma gene, and presumably the resultant chimeric DNA between Ig gamma and DNA sequences at 11q13. The present approach allowed us to unequivocally detect tumor-specific breakpoints of 14q32 translocations. Furthermore, interphase FISH provides a rapid diagnostic procedure to detect 14q32 translocations in B-cell malignancies.","['Taniwaki, M', 'Nishida, K', 'Ueda, Y', 'Misawa, S', 'Nagai, M', 'Tagawa, S', 'Yamagami, T', 'Sugiyama, H', 'Abe, M', 'Fukuhara, S']","['Taniwaki M', 'Nishida K', 'Ueda Y', 'Misawa S', 'Nagai M', 'Tagawa S', 'Yamagami T', 'Sugiyama H', 'Abe M', 'Fukuhara S', 'et al.']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin gamma-Chains)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '4158-89-8 (tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Yeast', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/ultrastructure', 'Cosmids', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Fluorescent Dyes', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin gamma-Chains/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Metaphase', 'Rhodamines', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77465-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Jun 1;85(11):3223-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies suggested that protein tyrosine phosphorylation may be involved in IL-9 signaling pathways. However, tyrosine kinases activated by IL-9 have not been identified. In this report we show that IL-9 induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the JAK family tyrosine kinases including JAK1, JAK3, and Tyk2. The kinetic studies indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of JAK kinases induced by IL-9 occurred within 1 minute, peaked by 5 to 10 minutes, and persisted at least for 45 minutes. Furthermore, we show that signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) 91 or related protein and an 88-kD Stat 91-associated protein are rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following IL-9 treatment. Gel shift assays confirm that nuclear extracts from MO7E cells stimulated with IL-9 specifically interact with a DNA element termed gamma activated site.

Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is the current treatment of choice for patients who do not have histocompatible sibling donors or who are otherwise inegligible for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. About 50% of patients respond to an initial course of ATG, and many nonresponders can be salvaged by subsequent treatment with cyclosporine (CsA). To determine whether simultaneous administration of these agents could further improve response rates, we enrolled 55 patients in a therapeutic trial of 4 days of ATG and 6 months of CsA. Among the 51 patients who had not received previous courses of ATG or CsA, 67% had responded by 3 months, and 78% had responded by 1 year (response was defined as an increase in peripheral blood counts sufficient that a patient no longer met the criteria for severe disease). There was a high incidence of relapse (36% actuarial risk at 2 years), but most relapsed patients responded to additional courses of immunosuppression, and relapse was not associated with a significant survival disadvantage. Evolution to myelodysplastic syndromes and acute leukemia was rare (1 of 51 patients), but the later appearance of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria was more common (5 of 51 patients). Actuarial survival was 86% at 1 year and 72% at 2 years.

Although all-trans RA does not bind to RXRs, RAR/RXR heterodimers or RXR/RXR homodimers bind to specific DNA response elements and modulate proliferation and differentiation of normal and malignant cells. Because the development of clinical resistance to all-trans RA has been associated with a progressive decrease in plasma drug concentrations, we evaluated the ability of 9-cis RA to induce in vitro cytodifferentiation in subclones of a retinoid-sensitive and resistant APL cell line (NB4) and in short-term cultures of fresh leukemic cells aspirated from patients. We also evaluated the clinical activity and pharmacokinetics of 9-cis RA (LGD 1057) in patients with APL who were previously treated with all-trans RA. In vitro tests of both retinoid-sensitive NB4 cells, as well as samples of fresh cells from 11 patients with APL, showed relatively equivalent degrees of sensitivity to both 9-cis RA and all-trans RA at concentrations ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-8) mol/L; however, no substantial cytodifferentiation was observed using either drug alone or in combination (10(-6) mol/L of each) in retinoid-resistant NB4 cells. Seven patients with APL who had previously relapsed from a remission induced by all-trans RA were treated with 9-cis RA at daily oral doses ranging from 30 to 230 mg/m2. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the mean terminal plasma half-life of 9-cis RA (1.3 hours) changed very little after several weeks of dosing, although the mean change per dose level in area under the plasma concentration x time curves and peak plasma concentrations showed a decrease by 49% and 45%, respectively. Peak plasma concentrations equaled or exceeded concentrations that were effective against retinoid-sensitive cells in vitro. Despite these favorable pharmacokinetic results, only one of the seven patients achieved complete remission, corroborating in vitro studies of blasts from three of the nonresponders that showed a relatively equivalent degree of resistance to both retinoids. Our results suggest that while 9-cis RA may not induce its own catabolism to the same degree as all-trans RA, this feature does not appear to overcome clinically acquired resistance to all-trans RA in APL. Nonetheless, the drug can induce complete remissions in patients with APL and may be useful for extended therapy in other diseases. Future studies should address the use of lower doses in patients who have not previously received retinoid therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Miller, W H Jr', 'Jakubowski, A', 'Tong, W P', 'Miller, V A', 'Rigas, J R', 'Benedetti, F', 'Gill, G M', 'Truglia, J A', 'Ulm, E', 'Shirley, M']","['Miller WH Jr', 'Jakubowski A', 'Tong WP', 'Miller VA', 'Rigas JR', 'Benedetti F', 'Gill GM', 'Truglia JA', 'Ulm E', 'Shirley M', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Cornell University Medical College, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retinoids/pharmacology', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,1995/06/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77440-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Jun 1;85(11):3021-7.,,,,"['CA-09207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-57645/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alternate donor options include the patient (autologous bone marrow transplantation), an HLA-haploidentical partially mismatched related donor, an HLA-phenotypically matched or partially mismatched unrelated donor, and an HLA-similar cord blood stem cell donor. When an allogeneic approach is preferred the risk of graft failure, graft-versus-host disease, fatal infection, and delayed immunoreconstitution is significantly greater than expected with a matched sibling donor. This has not always translated into inferior disease-free survival, possibly due to lower relapse rates seen in some studies from a graft-versus-leukemia effect potentially enhanced by major histocompatibility complex disparity. The degree and type of mismatch differs between alternative donors with broad variation in donor availability. Improvements are emerging in the prevention and treatment of graft rejection, acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, and infectious complications that should result in improved survival, particularly when transplantation is applied to patients earlier in the disease course. No clear preference among alternate donor options has been established. In centers with experience, the use of an alternative donor option is not experimental in nature. The risk and outcome must be weighed on an individual patient basis.

A comparison with the binding to leukemia cells.,428-36,"In the presence of albumin Merocyanine 540 (MC540) exhibits a very limited binding to the outer surface of the membrane of normal erythrocytes, whereas pronounced binding is observed to leukemia cells. To find out whether this difference is due to differences in the composition or structural organization of the cell membrane we analyzed effects of a number of covalent and non-covalent perturbations of the red cell membrane on the binding and fluorescence characteristics of membrane-bound MC540. It is shown that exposure of the cells to cationic chlorpromazine, neuraminidase or photodynamic treatment with AlPcS4 as sensitizer caused a limited increase (30-50%) of MC540 binding, together with a red shift of the fluorescence emission maximum and an increase of the relative fluorescence quantum yield of membrane-bound MC540. Other forms of perturbation of the membrane structure, like hyperthermia (48 degrees C) and treatments that produce a decrease of phospholipid asymmetry in addition to accelerated flip-flop, did not result in increased MC540 binding, but did cause a red shift of the fluorescence emission maximum and an increase of the relative fluorescence quantum yield. These changes in fluorescence properties indicate a penetration of the dye into more hydrophobic regions in the membrane. MC540, bound to Brown Norway myelocytic leukemia cells, exhibited a red shift of the fluorescence emission maximum and an increased relative fluorescence quantum yield as compared to MC540 bound to untreated erythrocytes. These changes were of the same order of magnitude as in photodynamically treated red blood cells. Dye binding per surface area, however, was about 3-times higher with these leukemia cells than with photodynamically treated red blood cells. This demonstrates that certain perturbations of the erythrocyte membrane evoked a MC540 binding that became qualitatively comparable to the dye binding to leukemia cells, although dye binding per surface area was still significantly lower.","['Lagerberg, J W', 'Kallen, K J', 'Haest, C W', 'VanSteveninck, J', 'Dubbelman, T M']","['Lagerberg JW', 'Kallen KJ', 'Haest CW', 'VanSteveninck J', 'Dubbelman TM']","['Sylvius Laboratories, Department of Medical Biochemistry, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Lipid Bilayers)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '122170-90-5 (aluminum tetrasulfophthalocyanine)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'U42B7VYA4P (Chlorpromazine)']",IM,"['Cell Membrane/chemistry/metabolism', 'Chlorpromazine/pharmacology', 'Cholesterol/physiology', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/chemistry/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Light', 'Lipid Bilayers/chemistry', 'Neuraminidase/pharmacology', 'Organometallic Compounds/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidinones/*metabolism', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/05/04 00:00,1995/05/04 00:01,['1995/05/04 00:00'],"['1995/05/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/04 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2736(95)80032-B [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(95)80032-b [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1995 May 4;1235(2):428-36. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(95)80032-b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The induced expression of UCH-L1 in differentiated Reh cells argues for a role of this enzyme, and the ubiquitin system, in B-cell differentiation.","['al-Katib, A M', 'Mohammad, R M', 'Maki, A', 'Smith, M R']","['al-Katib AM', 'Mohammad RM', 'Maki A', 'Smith MR']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Wayne State University, School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', 'EC 3.1.2.- (Thiolester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Thiolester Hydrolases/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase']",,1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1995 Feb;6(2):211-7.,,,,['1 R29 CA50715/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tyrosine-phosphorylated p190 also complexes with rasGAP, a regulator of Ras activity, thus possibly linking Ras and Rho pathways. Leukemic cells induced to differentiate along myelomonocytic lineages have increased filamentous actin (as evidenced by phalloidin staining) and extended pseudopodia, and become irregularly shaped and flattened, suggesting altered Rho and Rac function. We, therefore, hypothesized that changes in p190 and its association with rasGAP are an integral part of these shape changes. During phorbol 13-myristate 25-acetate-induced monocytic differentiation of HL60 promyelocytic and RWLeu4 chronic myelogenous leukemic cells, the total amount of p190 decreases rapidly but returns to initial levels by 12 h. In RWLeu4, this was accompanied by commensurate changes in p190 tyrosine phosphorylation and association with p120 type I rasGAP. Association of p190 and type I rasGAP was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation with antibodies to either protein. An additional band at M(r) 100,000 (p100) was detected in immunoprecipitates after 12 h of phorbol 13-myristate 25-acetate treatment. Reverse transcription-PCR and immunoblot analyses suggest that p100 is type II rasGAP, an alternatively spliced product of p120 type I rasGAP. p100 was expressed only in response to direct protein kinase C activators, but all classes of differentiation agents increased tyrosine-phosphorylated p190. Rho and Rac are known to be involved in regulating actin polymerization. The results presented here show that the association of p190 with type I rasGAP parallels increases in actin polymerization and cell adhesion. This suggests a role for p190-rasGAP interactions in phorbol 13-myristate 25-acetate-induced cytoskeletal reorganization.","['Cheng, J C', 'Frackelton, A R Jr', 'Bearer, E L', 'Kumar, P S', 'Kannan, B', 'Santos-Moore, A', 'Rifai, A', 'Settleman, J', 'Clark, J W']","['Cheng JC', 'Frackelton AR Jr', 'Bearer EL', 'Kumar PS', 'Kannan B', 'Santos-Moore A', 'Rifai A', 'Settleman J', 'Clark JW']","['Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island 02908, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (ARHGAP35 protein, human)', '0 (ARHGAP5 protein, human)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RASGRF1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (ras GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (ras-GRF1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins', '*Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/agonists', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'ras GTPase-Activating Proteins', 'ras-GRF1']",PMC3376091,1995/02/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1995 Feb;6(2):139-48.,,,,"['R01 GM047368/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA39235/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM047368-05/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM47368/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA13943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['NIHMS242055'],,,,,,,,,,

We report here that neutrophils are the first nucleated mammalian cell type demonstrated to be devoid of immunoreactive PARP. Both NB4 acute promyelocytic leukaemia and HL-60 (acute myelocytic leukaemia) cells were differentiated into non-malignant neutrophils with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). Western blot analysis demonstrated that ATRA had no effect on PARP expression in HL-60 cells. However, PARP was completely down-regulated in NB4 cells within 36 h of treatment initiation. This decrease in PARP polypeptide coincided with growth arrest and preceded the appearance of neutrophilic differentiation features. NB4 cells require a combination of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-D3) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to differentiate completely into monocyte/macrophages, whereas HL-60 cells can be made to differentiate by combined or single agents. PARP expression was up-regulated 90-fold when NB4 cells were treated with PMA and 1,25-D3 together, and this increase accompanied expression of the monocyte/macrophage phenotype. Only modest changes in PARP expression were observed when each agent was used alone in NB4 cells or when HL-60 cells were differentiated along the monocyte/macrophage pathway. In addition, PARP activity was modulated in a pattern similar to protein levels when NB4 cells were induced to differentiate along the neutrophilic and monocyte/macrophage pathways. This suggests that the activity of PARP may be controlled through regulation of protein levels during NB4 cell differentiation. We conclude that PARP levels are dramatically modulated during monocyte/macrophage and neutrophilic differentiation. On the basis of the tremendous changes in PARP polypeptide and total activity during myeloid differentiation, we propose that modulation of PARP gene expression is required for cellular maturation in both lineages.","['Bhatia, M', 'Kirkland, J B', 'Meckling-Gill, K A']","['Bhatia M', 'Kirkland JB', 'Meckling-Gill KA']","['Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Monocytes/*enzymology', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC1136853,1995/05/15 00:00,1995/05/15 00:01,['1995/05/15 00:00'],"['1995/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3080131 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1995 May 15;308 ( Pt 1):131-7. doi: 10.1042/bj3080131.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, ferritin synthesis is highly regulated by the iron status of the cell through post-transcriptional mechanisms that involve a specific high-affinity interaction between an iron-responsive element (IRE) in the 5' untranslated region of ferritin mRNA and a 98 kDa cytoplasmic protein, the iron-regulatory factor (IRF). The mechanisms that regulate the expression of the iron storage protein ferritin were investigated in erythroid (Friend erythroleukemia cell, FLC) and fibroblastic (L929 and B6) cell lines after exposure to various iron compounds. Both hemin (ferric protoporphyrin IX) and iron (as ferric ammonium citrate, FAC) were used as inducers of ferritin synthesis. Administration of hemin increases ferritin synthesis 8-12 fold both in erythroid and in non-erythroid cell lines, whereas FAC is a weak inducer of ferritin in FLC (only 5-fold). These results correlate with ferritin mRNA expression in FLC observed after hemin treatment compared to the effect exerted by FAC administration. This differential effect suggests that heme is the physiological compound able to stimulate ferritin synthesis in erythroid cell lines and that it plays an important physiological role in regulating gene expression in developing erythroid cells.","['Coccia, E M', 'Stellacci, E', 'Perrotti, E', 'Marziali, G', 'Battistini, A']","['Coccia EM', 'Stellacci E', 'Perrotti E', 'Marziali G', 'Battistini A']","['Laboratory of Virology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,8809253,"['0 (Ferric Compounds)', '0 (Quaternary Ammonium Compounds)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)', 'UVP74NG1C5 (ferric ammonium citrate)']",IM,"['Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Ferric Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Ferritins/*drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Transferrin/analysis/drug effects/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents. 1994 Jul-Sep;8(3):81-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with PML were studied. Their cytogenetic study was performed with G-band techniques. ATRA was given orally as a single dosis of 50 mg/m2 a day, or divided in two doses. After attaining complete remission (CR), ATRA was maintained for 1-3 months in association with minimal doses of Ara-C or alpha-interferon. A rotation of three therapeutic regimes (TRAP, POMP and DOAP) was subsequently administered. RESULTS: Twelve of the patients were women and 9 men; 15 were adults and 6 were children, the median age being 19 years (range: 6-60 years). Only two patients had leucocytosis, all others presented with leucopenia. Platelet count below 30 x 10(10)/L was found in 67% of the cases, while some sort of bleeding was present in 81% of them. Laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation was seen in 52% of the cases, and t (15; 17) appeared in 67% of the evaluable cytogenetic studies. CR was attained in 17 patients (81%) within a mean of 40 days. Headache was the commonest untoward effect of the treatment. Eight patients developed leucocytosis during treatment, white-cell count being over 20 x 10(9)/L in six of them. Fever without infectious signs was present in 5 patients, and in 3 of them the temperature recovered with steroid therapy. Two patients had retinoic acid syndrome prior to achieving CR. Four patients relapsed and 13 (76%) have maintained CR after 1 to 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of CR in this series is within the limits reported in the literature. The secondary effects of the treatment are the same than those reported by others, and they were transient and well tolerated. The response to steroids of those patients with fever secondary to ATRA is noteworthy. The efficacy of ATRA, in general terms, in the induction of CR in PML seems confirmed by these results.","['Hernandez, P', 'Carnot, J', 'Dorticos, E', 'Espinosa, E', 'Gonzalez, A', 'Hernandez, G', 'Nordet, I', 'Perez, A', 'Valdes, C', 'Vergara, B']","['Hernandez P', 'Carnot J', 'Dorticos E', 'Espinosa E', 'Gonzalez A', 'Hernandez G', 'Nordet I', 'Perez A', 'Valdes C', 'Vergara B']","['Instituto de Hematologia e Inmunologia, La Habana, Cuba.']",['spa'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Cuba', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1994 Oct;39(5):357-63.,Tratamiento de la leucemia promielocitica con acido retinoico: resultados en Cuba.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An attempt was also made to verify if such behaviour correlated with the characteristics of the disease or with the cell-surface markers of the leukaemic population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was carried out on 21 patients with secondary acute leukaemia (12 had previous myelodysplastic syndrome, MDS-AL, and 9 had previous chronic myeloproliferative syndromes, MPS-AL). Peripheral blood mononucleated cells were cultured on methyl-cellulose with MCL-PHA stimulation. The dishes were examined after 7 days of incubation in humid 37 degrees C environment with 5% CO2. Direct or indirect immunofluorescence was used for the immunophenotypic analysis and the patients were divided in two groups: 1) immature phenotype, which include those cases expressing only precursor (CD34) or pan-myeloid (CD33/13) antigens, and (2) mature phenotype, comprising the caes with granulomonocytic (CD15, CD14), erythroid (glycophorin) or megakaryocytic (CD61) differentiation. The statistical analysis was done with the BMDP programme. RESULTS: Up to 95% of the secondary acute leukaemias proliferate in vitro, as opposed to 82% of the de novo ones, the difference not being significant (p = 0.14). Successful cell showing was clearly superior in the former (p = 0.02), mostly due to higher proliferation of the MPS-AL cells. Neither the clinico-biologic characteristics of the patients nor the phenotype of the blast cells correlated with the in vitro behaviour of CFU-L. Only CD19 antigen expression and nuclear TdT provided a lesser in vitro growth (p = 0.05 and p-0.06, respectively). CONCLUSION: In general terms, secondary leukaemias, especially MPS-AL, show higher in vitro growth than de novo acute myeloblastic leukaemias.","['Almeida, J', 'del Canizo, M C', 'Galende, J', 'Vidriales, B', 'Nieto, M J', 'Hernandez, M D', 'Rodriguez, M J', 'San Miguel, J F']","['Almeida J', 'del Canizo MC', 'Galende J', 'Vidriales B', 'Nieto MJ', 'Hernandez MD', 'Rodriguez MJ', 'San Miguel JF']",['Departamento de Medicina de la Univesidad de Salamanca y Hospital Universitario de Salamanca.'],['spa'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*complications', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1994 Oct;39(5):331-5.,Estudio de las celulas clonogenicas de las leucemias agudas secundarias a sindromes mieloproliferativos y mielodisplasicos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tests for antiphospholipid antibodies (APA) included the measurement of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) with a solid-phase immunoassay, and the detection of the lupus-like anticoagulant (LA) activity. Fifteen patients with AML (33.3%) and 9 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (40.9%) presented elevated APA at diagnosis, as compared to 3 out of 174 persons of the control group (p < 0.0001). APA titles became normal in all patients responding to treatment, whereas non-responders retained elevated levels. In addition, 2 patients (1 with AML and 1 with NHL) who had normal APA at diagnosis and were either refractory to treatment or in relapse, subsequently developed LA and/or aCL positivity. At presentation, the mean levels of IgG- and IgM-aCL in patients were not significantly different from controls, and concordance between aCL and LA results reached just 12%. With regard to the clinical course, we were not able to detect any statistically significant difference between patients with normal and elevated APA. Pretreatment concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in AML, and soluble form of the receptor for interleukin-2 (sIL-2r) in NHL were found significantly elevated compared to controls (p < 0.001, p = 0.011 and p = 0.016 respectively). In addition, the levels of these cytokines correlated with IgG-aCL at the different times of laboratory investigations.

The inhibition is shown to be correlated with prevention of dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRB) in cells and bypass of G1 prolongation in the cell cycle. These results suggest that pRB-mediated G1 prolongation is necessary for MEL cells to commit to terminal differentiation. However, further experiments demonstrate that the simple cell cycle exit is not sufficient for commitment to terminal differentiation. Induction of dephosphorylation of pRB and subsequent G1 prolongation by forskolin does not lead MEL cells to differentiate. Additional pRB has been expressed in MEL cells by transfection with a neo-resistant plasmid containing RB cDNA under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. Exogenously expressed pRB is hyperphosphorylated in logarithmically growing MEL cells without any noticeable change in growth rate between the transfected cell line and the parental cell line. This result suggests that pRB in MEL cells is regulated by protein kinases and protein phosphatases and not by transcription.","['Zhuo, S', 'Fan, S', 'Huang, S', 'Kaufman, S']","['Zhuo S', 'Fan S', 'Huang S', 'Kaufman S']","['Laboratory of Neurochemistry, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Ethers, Cyclic/pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'G1 Phase', 'Gene Expression', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC41918,1995/05/09 00:00,1995/05/09 00:01,['1995/05/09 00:00'],"['1995/05/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/09 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.10.4234 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 May 9;92(10):4234-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.10.4234.,,,,['CA57496/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When this complication occurs in the immunocompromised host, evolution is virtually fatal in all cases despite surgical and medical treatment. We describe in this report the case of a child with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who developed pulmonary aspergillosis, and subsequent cerebral dissemination during therapeutic induction. Due to multifocal cerebral lesions, surgery was impossible. The patient was administered long term treatment including amphotericin B, flucytosine and itraconazole for 9 months, during which time a neutropenic period occurred with reactivation of cerebral mycotic lesions, in spite of modification of antileukaemic therapy.

The dek-can fusion gene is present in t(6;9) acute myeloid leukemia and the set-can fusion gene is present in one case of acute undifferentiated leukemia. In order to obtain leads towards the molecular basis of these diseases, we have studied the cellular localization of the DEK-CAN and SET-CAN fusion proteins and their normal counterparts. DEK-CAN and SET-CAN were localized exclusively in the nucleus, and also DEK and SET were found to be nuclear proteins. However, CAN was mainly located at the nuclear and cytoplasmic face of the nuclear envelope. This observation is in accordance with the presence of an amino acid repeat in the C-terminal part of CAN, common to the family of nucleoporins. The C-terminal part also contains a nuclear location domain as shown by deletion analysis. This domain may be important for the presence of CAN at the nucleoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope. The relocation of the carboxyterminal part of CAN due to DEK-CAN and SET-CAN may reinforce a nuclear function of the CAN protein.","['Fornerod, M', 'Boer, J', 'van Baal, S', 'Jaegle, M', 'von Lindern, M', 'Murti, K G', 'Davis, D', 'Bonten, J', 'Buijs, A', 'Grosveld, G']","['Fornerod M', 'Boer J', 'van Baal S', 'Jaegle M', 'von Lindern M', 'Murti KG', 'Davis D', 'Bonten J', 'Buijs A', 'Grosveld G']","[""Department of Genetics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Dek protein, human)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (NUP214 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', '*Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Histone Chaperones', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Envelope/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,1995/05/04 00:00,1995/05/04 00:01,['1995/05/04 00:00'],"['1995/05/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/04 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/04 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1995 May 4;10(9):1739-48.,,"['can', 'dek', 'set']",,['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report the full-length sequence, expression, and chromosomal localization of the PTP-U2 gene. The cDNA for PTP-U2, which was obtained from a human normal kidney library, predicts a protein of 1216 amino acids, -140 kDa, that contains a single transmembrane domain and a single intracellular catalytic domain. The extracellular domain of PTP-U2 contains 14 putative N-glycosylation sites and eight repeats of fibronectin type III-like motif. These data suggest that PTP-U2 is structurally similar to HPTP beta and DPTP10D, which have been reported previously. Northern blot analysis revealed that there were two different transcripts for PTP-U2. In kidney and brain, gene expression of PTP-U2 was detected as a 5.4 kb mRNA and in lung and placenta as 3.5 kb. The 3.5 kb transcript was also detected in human leukemia cell lines (eg., U937). Interestingly, its gene expression was enhanced by various differentiation-inducing agents, such as phorbol ester, dihydroxy vitamin D3, retinoic acid, and dimethyl sulfoxide. The bacterially expressed PTP-U2 fusion protein exhibited intrinsic tyrosine phosphatase activity.

And administration of these cryopreserved PBSC is useful in reducing myelosuppression following intensive/ultra high-dose chemotherapy. In this study, several courses of intensive chemotherapy (1 course: VP-16 300mg/m2 x 5 days + carboplatin 400-500mg/m2 x 3 days) and one course of ultra-high dose chemotherapy (1 course: VP-16 400mg/m2 x 8 days + carboplatin 800mg/m2 x 5 days + MCNU 250, 200mg/m2 x each day) with PBSC transfusion were applied in four cases of pediatric malignant brain tumors (2 cases of medulloblastoma, one case of pineoblastoma and anaplastic ependymoma) after surgical reduction. With PBSC transfusion, myelosuppression following high-dose chemotherapy could be overcome without serious complication in all cases. Three cases showed complete remission and one showed partial remission after the operation and intensive chemotherapy. However, CSF dissemination appeared in two cases and they died 20 and 28 months after the onset respectively.

Blast transient proliferation appears most frequently at neonatal age and usually resolves spontaneously in two or three months. Two patients, a girl and a boy, with neonatal onset of TMD are reported. They both presented trisomy 21 mosaicism according to bone marrow cytogenetic analysis. Patient 1, on one end of the spectrum, showed a ""classic"" benign course with rapid resolution and favorable outcome. Patient 2, on the other hand, had two blast outbursts both followed by spontaneous remissions. He failed to thrive and never reached a good general condition, dying at 5 months of age from a respiratory infectious complication. The necropsy showed generalized extramedullary hemopoiesis without evidence of bone marrow blast infiltration or myelofibrosis. TMD has some clinical and laboratory features that make it unique and distinguishable from true congenital leukemia with which it may be initially mistaken. It usually has a benign course followed by a favorable outcome. As trisomy 21 mosaicism may not have overt phenotypic stigmata, it is possible that many cases of TMD in these children may have a silent, non-detected course.

In the last few years, several reports seem to suggest that the new anthracycline derivative idarubicin and the anthraquinone mitoxantrone have some advantages in the management of untreated or relapsed acute leukaemias compared with older anthracyclines. This could be due to a different interaction of these drugs with multidrug resistance. To evaluate this possibility, we compared the activity of doxorubicin (DOXO), epirubicin (EPI), idarubicin (IDA) and mitoxantrone (MITO) on a murine, multidrug resistant, leukaemic cell line (P-388/Dx) cultured in vitro. ID50 of IDA and MITO was in the ng range whereas that of DOXO and EPI was in the microgram(s) range. Moreover, IDA has a resistance index of 50 whereas DOXO has one of 250. Verapamil is able to almost completely abolish the resistance to IDA. Efflux experiments confirm that verapamil increases IDA intracellular concentration.

Review of the literature.,43-7,"Retinoids are derivates of vitamin A. They play an important role in embryogenesis and differentiation of normal cells. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA, Tretinoin) and 13-cis retinoid acid (cRA, Isotretinoin) are the most important isomers. The first treatment with retinoids in a patient with an acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is reported in 1983. Since 1988 studies are done investigating the effect of retinoids in APL. These studies demonstrate, that retinoids can achieve a high remission rate in patients with APL but without curing patients. A combination with chemotherapy is always necessary. The main advantage of using retinoids in this disease is a rapid improvement of the hemostatic disorder and the absence of an aplastic phase. Side effects of retinoids are those of the hypervitaminosis A syndrome and have to be considered in every patient treated with this drug. The addition of alpha-Tocopherol seems to ameliorate the toxicity of retinoic acid (RA). The theoretical background of the treatment with retinoids in APL as well as the clinical studies done so far are explained in detail.","['Graf, N', 'Riesinger, P', 'Reinhard, H']","['Graf N', 'Riesinger P', 'Reinhard H']","['Klinik fur Kinder- u.

The trans-1R,4R- and trans-1S,4S-diastereomers of AdoMao, as well as the corresponding diastereomers of the unmethylated precursor molecule nor-AdoMao, were then evaluated as inhibitors of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMet-DC) from both bacterial and human sources. All four of the analogues acted as time-dependent, irreversible inhibitors of AdoMet-DC from Escherichia coli, exhibiting remarkably constant Ki values ranging between 20.6 and 23.7 microM. These analogues also inhibited the human form of AdoMet-DC, although this form of the enzyme was able to discriminate between AdoMao (Ki values of 21.2 microM for the trans-1R,4R form and 19.6 microM for the trans-1S,4S form) and nor AdoMao (Ki values of 95.2 microM for the trans-1R,4R form and 30.9 microM for the trans-1S,4S form). The trans diastereomers of AdoMao and nor-AdoMao were next evaluated for their ability to inhibit trypanosomal growth in vitro against cultured Trypanosoma brucei brucei bloodforms. All four of these analogues were effective growth inhibitors, with IC50 values ranging between 0.9 and 10.1 microM. The two most effective analogues, trans-1S,4S-AdoMao (IC50 0.9 microM) and trans-1S,4S-AdoMao (IC50 3.0 microM) were also effective against two clinical isolates of the pathogenic organism Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, KETRI 243 and KETRI 269. The most promising analogue in all respects was trans-1S,4S-AdoMao, which was subsequently found to have minimal effects on cell growth, AdoMet-DC activity, and intracellular polyamine levels in the sensitive human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60. Thus, the S-adenosylmethionine analogue trans-1S,4S-AdoMao acts as an effective inhibitor of AdoMet-DC and appears to serve as a parasite-specific trypanocidal agent in vitro.","['Guo, J', 'Wu, Y Q', 'Rattendi, D', 'Bacchi, C J', 'Woster, P M']","['Guo J', 'Wu YQ', 'Rattendi D', 'Bacchi CJ', 'Woster PM']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Allied Health Professions, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan 48202.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', ""0 (S-(5'-deoxy-5'-adenosyl)-1-aminoxy-4-(methylsulfonio)-2-cyclopentene)"", '0 (Trypanocidal Agents)', 'EC 4.1.1.50 (Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase)']",IM,"['Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Cyclopentanes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Deoxyadenosines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Trypanocidal Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology']",,1995/05/12 00:00,1995/05/12 00:01,['1995/05/12 00:00'],"['1995/05/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/12 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00010a021 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1995 May 12;38(10):1770-7. doi: 10.1021/jm00010a021.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conjugates 9a-f containing sn-1 alkyl (< C16) and sn-2 fatty acyl (< C14) and sn-1 alkyl (< C14) and sn-2 fatty acyl (< C16) substituents of the glycerol were water-soluble by shaking, while those with the sn-1 alkyl (> C16) and the sn-2 fatty acyl (> C16) such as conjugate 1 were sparingly soluble. Conjugates 9a-c,e were almost completely solubilized in water by shaking. However, a large portion of conjugates 9d and 9f in water by shaking exist in micelles with mean diameters ranging 7.0-55.2 nm. The partition coefficients (1-octanol/PBS) of the water-soluble conjugates were about 9-18 times greater than that of ara-C. A single dose (300 mg/kg) of conjugates 9d and 9f produced a significant increase in life span (ILS 206 to > 543%) with 17-67% long-term survivors (> 45 days) in mice bearing ip-implanted L1210 lymphoid leukemia. These results were comparable to those of the previous conjugate 1 and Cytoros (2). In contrast, conjugates 9a-c,e at single doses were less effective (ILS 69-178% with no long-term survivors). However, two (qd, 1, 7) or three (qd 1, 5, 9) divided doses of these conjugates were found to be as effective as a single dose of the previous conjugates. The three divided doses (150 mg/kg per day) of conjugates 9d, 9e, and 9f produced a remarkable antitumor activity in L1210 leukemic mice (ILS > 350% with > 50% long-term survivors).

We injected groups of female C3H strain mice with doses of 239Pu citrate from 500 to 10000 Bq to investigate the dose-related spectrum of tumor types induced during a lifetime. Survival time was reduced strikingly in all the injected mice due to much earlier induction of bone and lymphoid tumors as compared to the control animals that showed a variety of soft tissue tumors after a longer period of survival. Induction of osterosarcomas was dose-dependent, being maximal in 70% of the animals that received a mean skeletal dose of 10 Gy or less, but was 48% or less at 20 Gy or more. Non-thymic lymphomas accompanied by lymphocytic leukemia were observed in only 4-6% of the animals that received a dose of 10 Gy or less whereas it was maximal in 17-19% at 20 Gy or more. In contrast, there were no bone tumors in the control animals, rather thymic lymphomas or histiocytic lymphomas were found very late in 20% and other soft tissue tumors, including lung, liver and ovary tumors, were noted in 60%. Neither myeloid leukemia nor other myelogenous neoplasias were found in the control and 239Pu-injected animals that received a mean skeletal dose of 3 Gy or more.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Women with metastatic breast cancer who had measurable disease, required laboratory tests, had received no prior chemotherapy for metastases, had a Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) performance status < or = 2, and provided informed consent were eligible. Treatment included the following: arm I--cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF); arm II--vinblastine, doxorubicin, thiotepa, and halotestin (VATH); and arm III--VATH alternating with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, vincristine, and prednisone (CMFVP) on cycles 3, 5, 7, 9, etc. Doses were modified for toxicities. Standard CALGB response and toxicity criteria were used. RESULTS: Between August 1982 and February 1987, 497 women were entered and 491 were treated on study. Pretreatment characteristics were well balanced and the median follow-up duration was 79 months. There were no significant differences in response (complete [CR] plus partial [PR]) at 50% on arm I, 57% on arm II, and 51% on arm III. The median TTFs were 8, 8, and 9 months, respectively, in favor of arm III when compared with arm I (P = .028). The median survival times for treatment arms I, II, and III were 15, 17, and 17 months, respectively. After multivariate regression analyses, only estrogen receptors (ER), performance status, and number of metastatic sites influenced TTF and survival. Leukopenia was the most common grade 3 or 4 toxicity, occurring in 90%, 80%, and 92% of patients per arm, respectively. Lethal toxicities were seen in four, five, and six women, respectively. Overall, there were more grade > or = 3 toxicities on arm II than I, and most occurred on arm III (P = .02). CONCLUSION: The VATH regimen appears similarly effective to the CAF regimen as initial therapy. Alternating CMFVP with VATH did not improve response rate or survival. After accounting for other variables, treatment arm was not related to outcome. New therapeutic regimens are still needed.","['Aisner, J', 'Cirrincione, C', 'Perloff, M', 'Perry, M', 'Budman, D', 'Abrams, J', 'Panasci, L', 'Muss, H', 'Citron, M', 'Holland, J']","['Aisner J', 'Cirrincione C', 'Perloff M', 'Perry M', 'Budman D', 'Abrams J', 'Panasci L', 'Muss H', 'Citron M', 'Holland J', 'et al.']","['University of Maryland Cancer Center, Baltimore, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)', '9JU12S4YFY (Fluoxymesterone)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'CAF protocol', 'CMFVP protocol', 'TAVH protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Fluoxymesterone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Regression Analysis', 'Thiotepa/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Treatment Failure', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.6.1443 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Jun;13(6):1443-52. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.6.1443.,,,,"['CA12011/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with LB NHL were eligible for this randomized study if they were less than 22 years of age at diagnosis and had < or = 25% blasts in the bone marrow. Of 307 patients registered, 281 were fully eligible and assessable. Patients were stratified by extent of disease at diagnosis. RESULTS: The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate for patients with localized disease was 84%, and for patients with disseminated disease, 67%. There were four relapses in 28 patients with localized disease. Two hundred six patients had mediastinal primary tumors and despite local radiation, 34 of 63 failures in these patients involved the primary tumor site with or without other involvement. After adjusting for extent of disease at diagnosis, the regimens did not differ significantly with respect to risk for adverse events. The acute toxicity was primarily neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, with greater initial toxicity in patients on the LSA2L2 regimen. Three patients developed acute myelogenous leukemia. CONCLUSION: Long-term EFS in children with LB NHL can be achieved in the majority of patients. Disease progression, which includes recurrence at the primary tumor site, is a major cause of treatment failure in patients with mediastinal presentations. Addition of DAUN and L-ASP to the COMP regimen does not produce a more effective treatment than LSA2L2.","['Tubergen, D G', 'Krailo, M D', 'Meadows, A T', 'Rosenstock, J', 'Kadin, M', 'Morse, M', 'King, D', 'Steinherz, P G', 'Kersey, J H']","['Tubergen DG', 'Krailo MD', 'Meadows AT', 'Rosenstock J', 'Kadin M', 'Morse M', 'King D', 'Steinherz PG', 'Kersey JH']","['University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'COMP protocol', 'LSA(2)L(2) protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Recurrence', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Treatment Failure', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.6.1368 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Jun;13(6):1368-76. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.6.1368.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bcl-2 gene is frequently rearranged in nodal follicular lymphomas as well as in diffuse lymphoproliferations, but has generally been regarded as most useful in the recognition of the former of these lesions. However, little is known regarding BCLP expression in cutaneous lymphoid infiltrates. Using an immunohistochemical technique and a monoclonal antibody (clone no. 124) the authors examined 67 examples of cutaneous lymphoid infiltrates--31 cases of malignant lymphoma of the skin (MLS) and 36 examples of cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasias (CLH)--to determine if patterns of BCLP reactivity could distinguish CLH from MLS or primary from secondary involvement of the skin by malignant lymphoma. Fifty-eight per cent of MLS cases were BCL-positive, as were 33% of CLH. Three of four cases of follicular cutaneous lymphoma showed BCLP-positivity in neoplastic follicles, whereas similar structures in cases of CLH with a follicular pattern were BCLP-negative. Sixty per cent of primary MLSs and 57% of secondary lymphomas were reactive for BCLP. These data suggest that immunostains for BCLP are of little help in the separation of benign from malignant cutaneous lymphoid infiltrates, and that they are likewise incapable of separating primary from secondary MLS. BCLP immunostains may have a limited adjuvant diagnostic role in distinguishing reactive from neoplastic follicular lymphoid lesions of the skin.","['Triscott, J A', 'Ritter, J H', 'Swanson, P E', 'Wick, M R']","['Triscott JA', 'Ritter JH', 'Swanson PE', 'Wick MR']","['Lauren V.

We suggest an extension, termed LQR, to include also the other two ""Rs"" of radiobiology, cell cycle redistribution, and reoxygenation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this approach, redistribution and reoxygenation are both regarded as aspects of a single phenomenon, which we term resensitization. After the first portion of a radiation exposure has decreased the average radiosensitivity of a diverse cell population by preferentially sparing less sensitive cells, resensitization gradually restores the average sensitivity of the population towards its previous value. The proposed LQR formula is of the same form as the original LQ formula, but with two extra parameters, an overall resensitization magnitude and a characteristic resensitization time. The LQR model assumes that resensitization is monotonic rather than oscillatory in time, i.e., always tends to increase average cellular sensitivity as overall time increases. We argue that this monotonicity assumption is likely to hold in clinical situations, though a possible extension is discussed to account for oscillatory decay of resensitization effects. RESULTS: The LQR model gives reasonable fits to relevant experimental data in the literature, reproducing an initial rise in cell survival, due to repair, as the treatment time is increased, followed by a resensitization-related decrease in survival due to redistribution and/or reoxygenation for treatment times of the order of the cell cycle time, and a final survival increase due to repopulation as the treatment time is increased still further. CONCLUSION: The LQR model is a simple and potentially useful extension of the LQ model for computing more realistic isoeffect relations for early responding tissues, including tumors, when comparing different radiotherapeutic protocols.","['Brenner, D J', 'Hlatky, L R', 'Hahnfeldt, P J', 'Hall, E J', 'Sachs, R K']","['Brenner DJ', 'Hlatky LR', 'Hahnfeldt PJ', 'Hall EJ', 'Sachs RK']","['Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/*radiation effects', 'Cell Hypoxia/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Leukemia P388', '*Linear Models', 'Mice']",,1995/05/15 00:00,1995/05/15 00:01,['1995/05/15 00:00'],"['1995/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(95)00544-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(95)00544-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1995 May 15;32(2):379-90. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(95)00544-9.,,,,['CA-63897/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,['NASA'],['Non-programmatic'],,,,,,,,

DNA typing of HLA-A3 subtypes and -B7.,1-8,"A molecular investigation of the HLA-A, -B, -C, I82, D6S128, and D6S265 loci was carried out using RFLP and PCR analyses in 331 healthy individuals, 21 HLA-A3B7 homozygous subjects, and 17 HLA homozygous cell lines. New polymorphic RFLP patterns were noted at the HLA-A and -B loci which were useful for distinguishing subtypes of HLA-A3 and -B44. Strictly specific bands were observed for HLA-A3, -A11, -B7, -B57. and -Cw4. Molecular identification of two HLA-A3 subtypes was possible by HLA-A RFLP and D6S265 PCR analyses. The two alleles of the I82 locus were associated with different HLA-A3 subtypes. It was shown that the serologically HLA-A3 homozygous cell line EHM was heterozygous for the two subtypes.

The HMC-1 mast cells were cultured with or without recombinant human IL-4 and then activated with the calcium ionophore ionomycin. Stimulation of non-IL-4-treated cells with ionomycin (10 microM) for periods of 30 min to 8 hr induced expression of mRNA encoding IL-3, IL-4 and IL-8 but was without effect on levels of mRNA for tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or beta-actin. Culture of the cells with IL-4 (100 ng/ml) for 24 hr led to a small increase in resting levels of mRNA for IL-3 and IL-8 but not for IL-4, TNF-alpha or beta-actin. More notably, the IL-4 treatment produced a pronounced elevation of mRNA for IL-3 and IL-8 when the cells were subsequently activated with ionomycin. The IL-4 treatment produced a negligible effect on IL-4 mRNA, and no effect on TNF-alpha or beta-actin mRNA levels in ionomycin-activated cells. Quantitation of cDNA by competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed that the IL-4 treatment produced a sixfold increase in ionomycin-induced levels of cellular IL-3 mRNA, a fourfold increase in induced IL-8 mRNA and less than a twofold increase in induced IL-4 mRNA. The IL-4 treatment led to a 15- to 20-fold increase in ionomycin-induced secretion of IL-3 product and a doubling of induced IL-8 product. These effects of IL-4 were not associated with increased mast cell numbers. We conclude that IL-4 alone is a weak activator of IL-3 and IL-8 gene expression in mast cells, but is able to enhance activation signals in stimulated mast cells leading to transcription and secretion of these two cytokines.","['Buckley, M G', 'Williams, C M', 'Thompson, J', 'Pryor, P', 'Ray, K', 'Butterfield, J H', 'Coleman, J W']","['Buckley MG', 'Williams CM', 'Thompson J', 'Pryor P', 'Ray K', 'Butterfield JH', 'Coleman JW']","['Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Interleukin-8/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/genetics']",PMC1415136,1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1995 Mar;84(3):410-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was not the case for any of five mouse plasmacytoma cell lines and six lines derived from patients with multiple myeloma or plasma cell leukemia. All of these lines contain Lap18, although the level of this protein in the mouse but not the human plasmacytoma cell-line cells is relatively low. All the neoplastic plasma cell-line cells phosphorylate Lap18 on culture with PMA, but this does not induce growth arrest nor result in down-regulation of Lap18 expression. Further experiments are required to test whether there is a mechanistic relationship between the continued growth of plasmacytoma cell lines and their failure to down-regulate Lap18 on culture in PMA.","['Jones, N A', 'Rowlands, D C', 'Johnson, W E', 'MacLennan, I C', 'Brown, G']","['Jones NA', 'Rowlands DC', 'Johnson WE', 'MacLennan IC', 'Brown G']","['Department of Immunology, University of Birmingham Medical School, Edgbaston, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Microtubule Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (STMN1 protein, human)', '0 (Stathmin)', '0 (Stmn1 protein, mouse)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Microtubule Proteins', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphoproteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Plasmacytoma/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Stathmin', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2900130105 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1995 Jan-Feb;13(1):29-43. doi: 10.1002/hon.2900130105.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The consistent occurrence of above N-ras mutation in leukemias indicates that it plays an important role in DMBA-leukemogenesis.","['Osaka, M', 'Matsuo, S', 'Koh, T', 'Liang, P', 'Kinoshita, H', 'Maeda, S', 'Sugiyama, T']","['Osaka M', 'Matsuo S', 'Koh T', 'Liang P', 'Kinoshita H', 'Maeda S', 'Sugiyama T']","['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)']",IM,"['9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Genes, ras', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Preleukemia/genetics', 'Rats']",,1995/05/04 00:00,1995/05/04 00:01,['1995/05/04 00:00'],"['1995/05/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/04 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['030438359403714T [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(94)03714-t [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1995 May 4;91(1):25-31. doi: 10.1016/0304-3835(94)03714-t.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our laboratory has synthesized a new series of anti-tumor agents, the aza-anthracenediones, which are structurally related to mitoxantrone but contain a heterocyclic, rather than a carbocyclic, chromophore. Both the in vivo and in vitro anti-tumor activities of these compounds were exquisitely sensitive to the positioning of the nitrogen atom within the heterocyclic backbone. Compounds having a 2-aza were 30- to 100-fold more potent than the 1-aza or the di-aza compounds against L1210 cells in vitro. When tested in vivo, the 2-aza-anthracenediones had marked anti-tumor activity, in some cases curative, whereas the 1-aza-anthracenediones had but minimal antitumor activity. To define the importance of the aza positioning on DNA reactivity, spectral shift and gel mobility assays were used. The spectral shift assay suggested that the 2-aza compounds reacted with DNA solely through intercalation whereas the 1-aza-anthracenediones, and mitoxantrone all reacted with DNA through intercalative and non-intercalative processes. The affinity of DNA binding was five to seven times greater for the 2-aza compounds compared to the 1-aza or the di-aza derivatives. The retardation of supercoiled pBR322 DNA mobility in agarose gel electrophoresis further suggested an intercalative type of DNA interaction. Differences in DNA interaction appear related to but can not completely account for differences in cytotoxicity of the aza anthracenediones.","['Hazlehurst, L A', 'Krapcho, A P', 'Hacker, M P']","['Hazlehurst LA', 'Krapcho AP', 'Hacker MP']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington 05405, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthraquinones/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Heterocyclic Compounds', '*Intercalating Agents', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mitoxantrone/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/05/04 00:00,1995/05/04 00:01,['1995/05/04 00:00'],"['1995/05/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/04 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304383595910355 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(95)91035-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1995 May 4;91(1):115-24. doi: 10.1016/0304-3835(95)91035-5.,,,,['CA 22435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies were designed to identify and characterize specific PGs that serve as receptors for LpL and to examine effects of cell differentiation on LpL binding. PG synthesis was examined by radiolabeling THP-1 monocytes and macrophages (a cell line originally derived from a patient with acute monocytic leukemia) with [35S]sodium sulfate and [3H]serine or [3H]glucosamine. Radiolabeled PGs isolated from the cell surface were purified by chromatography and identified as chondroitin-4-sulfate (CS) PG and heparan sulfate (HS) PG. A sixfold increase in CSPG and an 11-fold increase in HSPG accompanied cell differentiation. Whereas HS glycosaminoglycan chains from both monocytes and macrophages were 7.5 kD in size, CS chains increased in size from 17 kD to 36 kD with cell differentiation, and contained hexuronyl N-acetylgalactosamine-4,6-di-O sulfate disaccharides. LpL binding was sevenfold higher to differentiated cells, and affinity chromatography demonstrated that two cell surface PGs bound to LpL: HSPG and the oversulfated CSPG produced only by differentiated cells. We conclude that differentiation-associated changes in cell surface PG of human macrophages have functional consequences that could increase the atherogenic potential of the cells.","['Edwards, I J', 'Xu, H', 'Obunike, J C', 'Goldberg, I J', 'Wagner, W D']","['Edwards IJ', 'Xu H', 'Obunike JC', 'Goldberg IJ', 'Wagner WD']","['Wake Forest University, Department of Comparative Medicine, Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157-1040, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",9505803,"['0 (Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans)', '0 (Disaccharides)', '0 (Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '9050-30-0 (Heparitin Sulfate)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Disaccharides/metabolism', 'Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans', 'Heparitin Sulfate/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Proteoglycans/biosynthesis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1161/01.atv.15.3.400 [doi]'],ppublish,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 1995 Mar;15(3):400-9. doi: 10.1161/01.atv.15.3.400.,,,,"['HL-25161/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-45095/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-45848/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous genetic risk factors for childhood AML have been defined, including Down syndrome, neurofibromatosis, and Fanconi anemia. Research into environmental risk factors has been limited by the rarity of this disease; however, studies of AML in adults have implicated ionizing radiation, solvents, and petroleum products as potential etiologic agents. The largest analytic study of childhood AML found that occupational exposures of either parent to pesticides, paternal exposure to petroleum products, and postnatal exposures to pesticides are increased in children with AML. In addition, maternal use of marijuana during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of AML, especially the monocytic subtypes. Further study of childhood AML, including occurrence of the disease as a second malignancy, is needed in order to confirm these findings and to increase our understanding of this leukemia.","['Bhatia, S', 'Neglia, J P']","['Bhatia S', 'Neglia JP']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Minnesota School of Medicine, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/etiology']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199505000-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1995 May;17(2):94-100. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199505000-00002.,,,72,,,,['J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1995 May;17(2):91-3.

As a result, the dose of radiotherapy has been reduced from 24 to 18 Gy to reduce the severity of these late effects. To compare the effects of 24 and 18 Gy CI on growth, puberty, and growth hormone (GH) secretion, a cohort of survivors of childhood ALL were studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of a total of 48 children, 28 (14 boys, 14 girls) had received 24 Gy and 20 (eight boys, 12 girls) had received 18 Gy. Similar chemotherapy regimens had been used in both groups, and age at diagnosis (5.2 +/- 2.7 vs. 5.1 +/- 2.8 years, 18 Gy vs. 24 Gy) and mean height at diagnosis [standard deviation score (SDS) 0.17 +/- 0.17 vs. 0.05 +/- 0.17, 18 Gy vs. 24 Gy] were comparable. RESULTS: Growth rates in both groups did not differ for the first 5 years after diagnosis. After this time, however, a significant height decrease was observed in children who had received 24 Gy but not in children who had received 18 Gy (at 8 years the change in SDS from diagnosis was -0.32 +/- 0.14 vs. -0.73 +/- 0.16, 18 Gy vs. 24 Gy, p < 0.05). Menarche occurred earlier in the girls in the 24-Gy group (at 12.9 +/- 0.3 vs. 11.7 +/- 0.4 years of age, 18 Gy vs. 24 Gy, p < 0.02). Overnight GH concentrations (12-h sampling every 20 min) were reduced in both groups compared with healthy age-matched control children but were even lower in the 24-Gy group (12.7 +/- 0.7 mU/L vs. 7.9 +/- 0.6 vs. 6.1 +/- 0.5 [6.4 +/- 0.4 ng/ml vs. 3.9-0.3 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.3]; control vs. 18 Gy and 24 Gy, p < 0.001; 18 Gy vs. 24 Gy, p < 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Although both doses of CI impair GH secretion, 24 Gy has a greater impact on growth in the long term. This effect may be exaggerated by the induction of early puberty in some children.","['Stubberfield, T G', 'Byrne, G C', 'Jones, T W']","['Stubberfield TG', 'Byrne GC', 'Jones TW']","['Department of Endocrinology, Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, Western Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,['9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Body Height/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Growth/*radiation effects', 'Growth Hormone/*metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*radiotherapy', 'Puberty/radiation effects', 'Sex Factors']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199505000-00012 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1995 May;17(2):167-71. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199505000-00012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: All childhood cases (0-14.9 years at diagnosis) reported during the 5-year period of 1985-1989 to the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) Cancer Registry for childhood malignancies were reviewed and analyzed according to age, Murphy's stage, gender, site, and survival. RESULTS: The annual incidence of NHL is 0.7 per 100,000 children in the five Nordic countries, constituting 5% of all childhood malignancies. Age distribution was even; the male/female ratio was 3:1. Age and stage were shown by Cox regression analysis to be independent prognostic factors. Older age and lower stage affected outcome favorably. The stage and site distribution was similar to previous reports. Survival data were in accordance with those expected with modern treatment protocols. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and relative frequency of NHL in childhood in the five Nordic countries is in agreement with previously reported data, but the even distribution of cases throughout childhood is a new finding. Older age at onset and stage of disease affect outcome favorably, whereas male gender contrary to acute lymphoblastic leukemia was not found to affect outcome.","['Marky, I', 'Schmiegelow, K', 'Perkkio, M', 'Jonsson, O G', 'Storm-Mathiesen, I', 'Gustafsson, G', 'Kreuger, A', 'Langmark, F']","['Marky I', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Perkkio M', 'Jonsson OG', 'Storm-Mathiesen I', 'Gustafsson G', 'Kreuger A', 'Langmark F']","['Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO), Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Iceland/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Norway/epidemiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Registries', 'Sex Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199505000-00011 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1995 May;17(2):163-6. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199505000-00011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 239 neutropenic episodes among 42 children receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy between 1988 and 1991 compared the incidence of septicemia based on the prophylactic use of vanc paste. RESULTS: A total of 236 consecutive neutropenic episodes were evaluable, 121 with vanc paste and 115 without. AHS sepsis occurred in one child using vanc paste and in six children not using vanc paste (p = 0.06). Excluding staph-only positive blood cultures, which would not be reduced with a topical oral antibiotic drug, there were 6 and 13 positive blood cultures in the vanc-paste and nonvanc-paste patients, respectively (p = 0.09). There was no increase in incidence of gram-negative bacteremia among vanc-paste recipients. Vancomycin resistance was not encountered. CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests that vanc paste effectively reduces AHS sepsis, does not increase gram-negative bacteremia, and is not associated with vancomycin resistance.

We have increased our knowledge of regulatory growth factors, the receptors through which they act, and the secondary messengers involved in transducing the growth/differentiation signals from the cytoplasmic membrane to the nucleus. This knowledge has revealed potential mechanisms for inducing the neoplastic transformation of hematopoietic cells. This applies in particular to the role of viral oncogenes and cellular protooncogenes and, more recently, to the role of tumor suppressor genes. Protooncogenes are intimately involved in the processes of cell proliferation and differentiation. Therefore, any amplification, mutation, structural alteration, or change in transcriptional regulation of protooncogenes might lead to or be associated with induction of the malignant phenotype. Based on the importance of these genes in leukemogenesis and the maintenance of the malignant phenotype, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that targeted disruption of leukemogenic genes may be of therapeutic value.","['Hijiya, N', 'Gewirtz, A M']","['Hijiya N', 'Gewirtz AM']","['Department of Pathology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Animals', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', '*Proto-Oncogenes']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199505000-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1995 May;17(2):101-12. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199505000-00003.,,"['ALL-1', 'PML/RAR&agr;', 'Ros', 'bcr', 'c-kit', 'c-myb', 'c-myc', 'e-abl', 'p53']",125,,,,['J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1995 May;17(2):91-3.

Here, we present the indepth results of an ongoing study of macrophage differentiation pathways in cutaneous macrophage disorders and in vitro. Up to now, a total of 40 cases of cutaneous macrophage disorders (histiocytoses and granulomas) and related diseases were examined using a panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to macrophage differentiation antigens (mAb MS-1, mAb alpha CD1a, mAb alpha CD34, mAb RM 3/1, mAb alpha CD11c, mAb alpha CD36, mAb MAC 387, mAb 27E10, polyclonal antibodies alpha MRP-8 and -14, mAb alpha CD68, mAb 25F9, mAb DRC1-R4/23, and mAb 1F10). Of these, MS-1 high molecular weight protein, synthesized by non-continuous sinusoidal endothelial cells and highly dendritic perivascular macrophages in normal human organs, is the most specific macrophage differentiation marker. MS-1 high molecular weight protein is selectively expressed by cutaneous non-Langerhans cell histocytoses, and proves to be a valuable diagnostic tool for these diseases. MS-1 high molecular weight protein is not found in Langerhans cell histiocytosis cells, epithelioid cells in sarcoidosis, and palisading histiocytes in granuloma annulare. MS-1+ macrophages may be found intermingled in cellular type dermatofibroma and in foreign body granulomas; they differ from MS-1+ non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis cells by their highly dendritic morphology, and thus rather resemble the MS-1+ macrophages in normal skin. RM 3/1 antigen shows a similar, but broader expression pattern including non-Langerhans cell histiocytoses, xanthelasmata palpebrarum, foreign body granulomas, granuloma annulare, and cellular type dermatofibroma. Moreover, xanthelasmata palpebrarum paradigmatically represent a class of macrophage lesions with strong RM 3/1, but little MS-1 antigen expression. In sarcoidosis, RM 3/1+ macrophages are only found at the very periphery of epithelioid cell granulomas. In contrast, 25F9 antigen is strongly and consistently expressed in epithelioid cells of sarcoidosis, and in foreign body granulomas. In cultured human monocytes/macrophages, RM 3/1 antigen is expressed early on, while MS-1 high molecular weight protein and 25F9 antigen are late and very late macrophage differentiation antigens, respectively. Expression of RM 3/1 antigen and MS-1 high molecular weight protein is inducible by glucocorticoid and interleukin-4, and less so by interleukin-13 and interleukin-10, and combinations thereof, while 25F9 antigen seems to be less influenced by these agents. Interferon-gamma (and less so tumor necrosis factor-alpha) inhibit expression of all three antigens in cultured human monocytes/macrophages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Kodelja, V', 'Goerdt, S']","['Kodelja V', 'Goerdt S']","['Hautklinik, Universitatsklinikum Benjamin Franklin, Freie Universitat Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Exp Dermatol,Experimental dermatology,9301549,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD163 antigen)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Granuloma/*pathology', 'Histiocytosis/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Macrophage Activation/drug effects', 'Macrophages/*pathology', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0625.1994.tb00287.x [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Dermatol. 1994 Dec;3(6):257-68. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0625.1994.tb00287.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied the effect of verapamil on Pgp expression levels in a cell line originating from acute myeloblastic leukemia and resistant to adriamycin, K562/ADR. In this line, the addition of 15 microM verapamil in the culture medium gives a 3-fold decrease of Pgp expression after 72 hours of treatment. Similar results have been obtained for two other MDR cell lines, which suggest that this phenomenon is not specific of a single model. The level of mdr1 mRNAs is decreased in the presence of verapamil (with a maximum effect obtained at the 24th hour), which suggests that the mechanism of action of verapamil is transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional. We have also studied the effect of verapamil on the level of expression of mdr1 mRNAs in non-drug selected cells such as the HEL line (human acute myeloblastic leukemia) and the parental K562 line, which present a very low level of expression of Pgp, detectable only by PCR. In these lines, verapamil treatment has no effect on the level of expression of mdr1 mRNAs. The effect of verapamil is therefore restricted to drug-selected lines presenting high levels of Pgp expression. The impact of the negative regulation of Pgp expression on the MDR phenotype has been studied in the K562/ADR line. When the cells are treated for 72 h by verapamil, there is a decrease of resistance and an increase of intracellular accumulation of anticancer agents such as daunorubicin or vinblastine. Negative regulation of Pgp expression appears therefore as a possible strategy for MDR phenotype reversal. The effect of verapamil, whose molecular mechanism of action is being studied, could constitute a basis for this strategy.","['Muller, C', 'Bailly, J D', 'Jaffrezou, J P', 'Goubin, F', 'Laurent, G']","['Muller C', 'Bailly JD', 'Jaffrezou JP', 'Goubin F', 'Laurent G']","['Laboratoire de pharmacologie et de toxicologie fondamentales, Toulouse, France.']",['fre'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Models, Biological', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",,1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Cancer. 1994 May;81(5):386-91.,Modulation pharmacologique de l'expression de la P-glycoproteine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activators of protein kinase C (PKC), such as phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and the synthetic diacylglycerol, 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (diC8), were found to have the same effect even though PMA and diC8 do not cause the activation of phospholipase C. Although the kinetics are different depending on the stimulant, activation of PKC using multivalent antigen, PMA or diC8 also causes the polymerization of actin and an increase in the F-actin content of the cells. In all cases, a good correlation was observed between F-actin levels, activation of PI and PIP kinases, and the increased production of PIP and PIP2. However, in the case of antigen, there is no correlation between actin polymerization and the total amount of PIP and PIP2. Staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinases, blocks the F-actin response and the increased synthesis of PIP and PIP2 with similar dose dependencies. Furthermore, depletion of PKC activity through long-term exposure to PMA, inhibited both the F-actin response and the increased synthesis of PIP and PIP2 induced by either DNP-BSA or diC8. These results suggest that activation of PKC precedes the activation of PI and PIP kinases and that under certain circumstances activation of the kinases and the increased synthesis of PIP and PIP2 may be involved in the polymerization of actin in RBL cells, possibly through the interaction of the polyphosphoinositides with actin-binding proteins such as gelsolin and profilin.","['Apgar, J R']",['Apgar JR'],"['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Biopolymers)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin)', '0 (phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate)', '1069-87-0 (1,2-dioctanoylglycerol)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Actins/*metabolism', 'Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Biopolymers', 'Diglycerides/pharmacology', 'Dinitrophenols/immunology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Immunologic Capping', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate', 'Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/immunology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Staurosporine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC275817,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1091/mbc.6.1.97 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 1995 Jan;6(1):97-108. doi: 10.1091/mbc.6.1.97.,,,,['R01-GM42388/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient transplanted with haploidentical marrow developed grade 2 graft vs. host disease (GVHD), which was controlled with steroid and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) therapy. One of the two patients grafted with unrelated umbilical cord blood developed mild grade 1 GVHD of the skin, which rapidly cleared with steroid therapy.

It can be employed successfully to reconstitute hematopoiesis following allogeneic transplantation. One current drawback of cord blood as a treatment has been a risk of transfusion reactions attributable to ABO blood group mismatch. Removal of red cells from the cord blood has led to reduction of the stem cells by 30-50%. In this paper we report red cell depletion by a method that employs 3% gelatin to effectively sediment the erythrocytes and selectively deplete red cells but permits 94% recovery of nucleated cells and enrichment of colony-forming cells by granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units, erythrocyte burst-forming units, and granulocyte-macrophage-megakaryocyte colony-forming units in the cord blood preparation. This technique has been employed in our study to remove red cells from the cord blood of a male infant delivered by cesarean section, which has permitted treatment of a female sibling suffering from leukemia. The recipient was 8 years old and weighted 36.7/kg. Complete HLA identity between the two siblings was established. A cord blood cell transplant of cryopreserved and later thawed cells (4 x 10(7) nucleated cells per kilogram) was administered to the patient after intensive myeloablative chemotherapy. The patient exhibited a prompt hematologic recovery (absolute neutrophil count > 500 by day 31, 100% male cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood by day 25) and has experienced a 13-month disease-free survival to date.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Pahwa, R N', 'Fleischer, A', 'Shih, S', 'Uckan, D', 'Durham, S', 'Garofalo, P', 'Karayalcin, G', 'Shende, A', 'Redner, A', 'Paley, C']","['Pahwa RN', 'Fleischer A', 'Shih S', 'Uckan D', 'Durham S', 'Garofalo P', 'Karayalcin G', 'Shende A', 'Redner A', 'Paley C', 'et al.']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Schneider Children's Hospital of Long Island Jewish Medical Center, New Hyde Park, New York 11042, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,['9000-70-8 (Gelatin)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cell Separation', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Erythrocytes', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Gelatin', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Remission Induction']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood Cells. 1994;20(2-3):267-73; discussion 273-4.,,,,['AG05628-09/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was designed to analyze in which proportion of AML patients the immunological detection of MRD is feasible, based on the presence of aberrant phenotypes that allow the distinction of leukemic from normal cells. For this purpose we have prospectively investigated the blast cells from 40 AML patients at diagnosis with a large panel of MoAb in double and triple staining combinations analyzed at flow cytometry, in order to detect aberrant phenotypes on blast cells (lineage infidelity, antigenic overexpression, and asynchronous antigenic expression, as well as aberrant light-scatter pattern). In the analysis of the 40 AML cases more than one blast cell subset, distinguished by its different antigenic expression, was detected in 85% of the patients: five different phenotypic blast cell subsets were observed in six cases, four in 13 patients, three subsets in three cases, and two in 12 patients; only six cases showed a homogeneous phenotypical blast cell population. Twenty-nine of the 40 AML cases analyzed (73%) showed the existence of at least one aberrant phenotype: in 15 cases the myeloid blast cells co-expressed lymphoid-associated antigens (CD2, CD5, CD7, and/or CD19)--lineage infidelity--; asynchronous antigen expression was detected in 25 patients (CD34+CD56+, CD34+CD11b+, CD34+CD14+, CD117+CD15+, CD33-CD13+, CD13-CD15+, HLADR + CD15 , HLADR-CD14+CD11b+ CD4+); seven cases displayed antigen overexpression (CD13, CD33, CD15, or CD14); and in 13 patients leukemic cells had an abnormal FSC/SSC distribution according to their phenotype.

METHODS: Sera and muscle biopsy samples from 9 Jamaican PM patients were compared with specimens from American HTLV-I-positive PM patients and normal controls. Sera were evaluated for HTLV antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. The biopsy samples were analyzed for HTLV-I/II DNA by polymerase chain reaction and were also immunohistochemically stained for HTLV gp46 envelope protein. RESULTS: Seven of the 8 Jamaican PM patients from whom sera were available were HTLV-I seropositive. The muscle biopsies of all 9 Jamaican patients demonstrated severe lymphocytic infiltration, cellular degeneration, myofiber atrophy, and fibrosis. Each muscle biopsy specimen contained HTLV-I DNA. Two of 6 samples demonstrated intense staining for HTLV-I gp46 in many of the invading mononuclear cells and weak staining for HTLV-I gp46 in many of the invading mononuclear cells and weak staining in the adjacent myocytes. Two other specimens were weakly positive for gp46 in rare mononuclear cells. All control specimens were negative for the presence of HTLV-I DNA and protein. CONCLUSION: HTLV-I is associated with an inflammatory muscle disease characterized by direct invasion of the affected muscle by HTLV-I-infected mononuclear cells.","['Sherman, M P', 'Amin, R M', 'Rodgers-Johnson, P E', 'Morgan, O S', 'Char, G', 'Mora, C A', 'Iannone, R', 'Collins, G H', 'Papsidero, L', 'Gibbs, C J Jr']","['Sherman MP', 'Amin RM', 'Rodgers-Johnson PE', 'Morgan OS', 'Char G', 'Mora CA', 'Iannone R', 'Collins GH', 'Papsidero L', 'Gibbs CJ Jr', 'et al.']","['State University of New York Health Science Center, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Biopsy', 'DNA, Viral/*isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Gene Products, env/*analysis', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*blood', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muscles/chemistry/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymyositis/blood/immunology/pathology/*virology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*analysis']",,1995/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/art.1780380518 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 1995 May;38(5):690-8. doi: 10.1002/art.1780380518.,,,,"['5UO1 AI-27658/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL-43602-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['Arthritis Rheum. 1996 Mar;39(3):535.

Laboratory data from calcium efflux and diatom mobility experiments were used with the gyromagnetic equation to predict combinations of 60 Hz and static magnetic fields hypothesized to enhance leukemia risk. The laboratory data predicted 19 bands of the static field magnitude with a bandwidth of 9.1 microT that, together with 60 Hz magnetic fields, are expected to have biological activity. We then assessed the association between this exposure metric and childhood leukemia using data from a case-control study in Los Angeles County. ELF and static magnetic fields were measured in the bedrooms of 124 cases determined from a tumor registry and 99 controls drawn from friends and random digit dialing. Among these subjects, 26 cases and 20 controls were exposed to static magnetic fields lying in the predicted bands of biological activity centered at 38.0 microT and 50.6 microT. Although no association was found for childhood leukemia in relation to measured ELF or static magnetic fields alone, an increasing trend of leukemia risk with measured ELF fields was found for subjects within these static field bands (P for trend = 0.041). The odds ratio (OR) was 3.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.4-30.5] for subjects exposed to static fields within the derived bands and to ELF magnetic field above 0.30 microT (compared to subjects exposed to static fields outside the bands and ELF magnetic fields below 0.07 microT). When the 60 Hz magnetic fields were assessed according to the Wertheimer-Leeper code for wiring configurations, leukemia risks were again greater with the hypothesized exposure conditions (OR = 9.2 for very high current configurations within the static field bands; 95% CI = 1.3-64.6). Although the risk estimates are based on limited magnetic field measurements for a small number of subjects, these findings suggest that the risk of childhood leukemia may be related to the combined effects of the static and ELF magnetic fields. Further tests of the hypothesis are proposed.","['Bowman, J D', 'Thomas, D C', 'London, S J', 'Peters, J M']","['Bowman JD', 'Thomas DC', 'London SJ', 'Peters JM']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Bioelectromagnetics,Bioelectromagnetics,8008281,['SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)'],IM,"['Calcium/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Movement/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diatoms/radiation effects', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Housing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Los Angeles/epidemiology', 'Magnetics/*adverse effects', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bem.2250160111 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioelectromagnetics. 1995;16(1):48-59. doi: 10.1002/bem.2250160111.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The half-lives of both doses of 5-FP were at least 2-fold longer than the half-lives of the same doses of 5-FU, and the clearance rates of 5-FP were 3-fold slower. 5-FP was converted rapidly to 5-FU, in vivo.

Although viral protein expression is considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of HTLV-I-associated diseases, limited information is known regarding host cell mechanisms that control viral gene expression. This study was designed to evaluate modulation of HTLV-I gene expression following induction of the cellular stress response in HTLV-I-infected lymphocytes. The cellular stress response was elicited by treatment with either Na arsenite or thermal stress and was monitored by demonstrating increased expression of the 72-kDa heat shock protein. Induction of the cellular stress response in HTLV-I-infected lymphocytes resulted in significantly increased HTLV-I-mediated syncytia formation due to enhanced HTLV-I envelope (gp46) expression. Intracellular viral proteins and released p24 capsid protein were increased in stressed infected lymphocytes as compared to nonstressed infected lymphocytes. Furthermore, HTLV-I-LTR reporter gene constructs had increased activity (three- to sixfold) in a transiently transfected, uninfected lymphocyte cell line following induction of the cellular stress response. Quantitation of HTLV-I RNA expression by slot blot analysis of infected lymphocytes suggested variable increases in RNA accumulation. Northern blot analysis demonstrated no qualitative changes in expression of RNA species. These data suggest a relationship between modulation of viral replication and a basic cellular response to stress and have important implications for understanding host cell control mechanisms of HTLV-I expression.","['Andrews, J M', 'Oglesbee, M J', 'Trevino, A V', 'Guyot, D J', 'Newbound, G C', 'Lairmore, M D']","['Andrews JM', 'Oglesbee MJ', 'Trevino AV', 'Guyot DJ', 'Newbound GC', 'Lairmore MD']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (HSP72 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Sodium Compounds)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (p24 protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '48OVY2OC72 (sodium arsenite)']",IM,"['Arsenites/pharmacology', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/drug effects/*physiology', 'Gene Products, env/physiology', 'HSP72 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'HTLV-I Antigens/physiology', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Hot Temperature', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/*physiology/*virology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Sodium Compounds/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/04/20 00:00,1995/04/20 00:01,['1995/04/20 00:00'],"['1995/04/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/20 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(85)71218-4 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1995.1218 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1995 Apr 20;208(2):816-20. doi: 10.1006/viro.1995.1218.,,,,['CA 55185/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we studied two mutants of HIV-1 for their ability to interfere with the production of wild-type virus. Both mutants lack the entire matrix domain of gag and either lack [myr(-)MA(-)] or contain [myr(+)MA(-)] an amino-terminal myristate (myr) addition sequence at the beginning of the capsid domain. Previously we have demonstrated that expression of both mutant constructs leads to assembly and release of mutant viruses, although only myr(+)MA(-) particles are released efficiently. Particles produced by both matrix-deficient mutants are noninfectious and poorly incorporate and/or retain viral envelope glycoproteins. In this study, we further show that expression of myr(+)MA(-), but not myr(-)MA(-) interferes with wild-type HIV-1 virus production in transient expression assays. Our data suggest that wild-type and myristylated MA(-) Gag protein interacts at some point during assembly and that Gag myristylation has a greater effect on the assembly pathway than the matrix domain.","['Lee, P P', 'Linial, M L']","['Lee PP', 'Linial ML']","['Division of Basic Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Gene Products, tat)', '0 (Myristic Acids)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '0 (tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0I3V7S25AW (Myristic Acid)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Capsid/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tat/biosynthesis', 'Genes, gag/*genetics', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'HIV-1/*genetics/*growth & development/pathogenicity', 'HeLa Cells/virology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myristic Acid', 'Myristic Acids/metabolism', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Transfection', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/genetics', 'Virion/growth & development', 'Virus Cultivation', 'tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",,1995/04/20 00:00,1995/04/20 00:01,['1995/04/20 00:00'],"['1995/04/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/20 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(85)71216-0 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1995.1216 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1995 Apr 20;208(2):808-11. doi: 10.1006/viro.1995.1216.,,,,"['K16DE00161/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AI-12729/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (3 days) treatment of lymphocytes from the non-infected and from the BLV-infected sheep resulted in a significant (P < 0.01) increase in the mean of PCNA levels only in the non-infected sheep. The mean lymphocyte counts of the BLV-infected sheep were not significantly different from the mean counts of the non-infected sheep at the time of lymphocyte protein analysis. Thus, these findings showed, similar to human leukemia and malignancies, that high levels of PCNA were found in lymphocytes from BLV-infected sheep compared with those from the non-infected sheep, and this was independent of high cell count.

A growing body of data is now available on the molecular events that lead to DNA damage. DNA cleavage in nucleosomic or oligonucleosomic fragments is related to the appearance of unusual and very characteristic ultrastructural changes. The nucleus is especially affected, and shows chromatin rearrangements consisting of cup-shaped marginations, sharply separated from diffuse chromatin areas.

We use a Dirichlet-multinomial model to accommodate general discrete multivariate responses. We present Bayesian decision criteria and monitoring boundaries for early termination of studies with unacceptably high rates of adverse outcomes or with low rates of desirable outcomes. Each stopping rule is constructed either to maintain equivalence or to achieve a specified level of improvement of a particular event rate for the experimental treatment, compared with that of standard therapy. We avoid explicit specification of costs and a loss function. We evaluate the joint behaviour of the multiple decision rules using frequentist criteria. One chooses a design by considering several parameterizations under relevant fixed values of the multiple outcome probability vector. Applications include trials where response is the cross-product of multiple simultaneous binary outcomes, and hierarchical structures that reflect successive stages of treatment response, disease progression and survival. We illustrate the approach with a variety of single-arm cancer trials, including bio-chemotherapy acute leukaemia trials, bone marrow transplantation trials, and an anti-infection trial. The number of elementary patient outcomes in each of these trials varies from three to seven, with as many as four monitoring boundaries running simultaneously.

The immunological mechanisms that control growth of preneoplastic cells are, however, not known. T cells expressing gamma delta T-cell receptors (TCR) were first described as lymphocytes with reactivity against various tumour cells, which suggests that gamma delta T cells could mediate tumour surveillance. Here we show that TCRV gamma 1.1J gamma 4C gamma 4 transgenic mice are spontaneously resistant to acute T-cell leukaemias but cannot reject non-haematopoietic tumours. TCRV gamma 1.1J gamma 4C gamma 4+ hybridomas isolated from these mice react in vitro against almost all haematopoietic tumour cell lines tested. Recognition of tumour cells depends on the gamma delta TCR but is independent of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, MHC class II, or TAP-2 peptide transporter expression. Ligand recognition is influenced by the murine Nromp gene, which confers resistance or susceptibility to tuberculosis, lepra and leishmaniasis. These data indicate that TCRV gamma 1.1+ T cells confer spontaneous immunity against haematopoietic tumours in vivo and link innate resistance to bacterial infections with tissue-specific tumour surveillance by gamma delta+ T cells.","['Penninger, J M', 'Wen, T', 'Timms, E', 'Potter, J', 'Wallace, V A', 'Matsuyama, T', 'Ferrick, D', 'Sydora, B', 'Kronenberg, M', 'Mak, T W']","['Penninger JM', 'Wen T', 'Timms E', 'Potter J', 'Wallace VA', 'Matsuyama T', 'Ferrick D', 'Sydora B', 'Kronenberg M', 'Mak TW']","['Amgen Institute, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Hybridomas/immunology', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mycobacterium bovis/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/05/18 00:00,1995/05/18 00:01,['1995/05/18 00:00'],"['1995/05/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/18 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/375241a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1995 May 18;375(6528):241-4. doi: 10.1038/375241a0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies were aimed at determining the mechanism by which intracellular GTP depletion induced by these agents results in inhibition of DNA synthesis. Incubation of human CEM leukemia cells for 2 hr with IC50 concentrations of either mizoribine (4 microM) or mycophenolic acid (0.5 microM) reduced cellular GTP levels an average of 68% or 58%, respectively, compared with the levels in control cells. Under similar conditions, mizoribine and mycophenolic acid decreased the amount of [3H]adenosine incorporated into primer RNA by 75% and 70%, respectively, relative to the untreated controls, but had no significant effect on total RNA synthesis. Repletion of the guanine nucleotide pools by coincubation of CEM cells with guanosine plus 8-aminoguanosine prevented both the inhibition of primer RNA synthesis and the inhibition of tumor cell growth induced by these agents. Additional studies demonstrated that GTP depletion alone was capable of directly inducing inhibition of primer RNA synthesis. Primer RNA synthesis was inhibited an average of 84% in whole-cell lysates that lacked GTP but contained all remaining ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. On an M13 DNA template, RNA-primed DNA synthesis catalyzed by the purified complex of DNA primase (EC 2.7.7.6) and DNA polymerase alpha (EC 2.7.7.7) was decreased an average of 70% in the absence of GTP, compared with synthesis in the presence of 0.5 mM GTP.

In patch-clamp experiments, ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid-induced depletion of internal Ca2+ stores led to activation of two distinct membrane conductances, a Ca2+ current and a Cl- current. The Ca2+ current was blocked by 100 microM La3+, which did not affect the Cl- current. In contrast, 500 microM 4,4'-diisothiocyanato-2,2'-disulfonic acid produced selective blocked of the Cl- current. Remarkably, the Cl- channel blockers 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB), niflumic acid, and N-phenylanthranilic acid (NPAA) inhibited not only the Cl- current but also the Ca2+ current. IC50 values for the blockade of the Ca2+ inward current by NPPB, niflumic acid, and NPAA were determined to be 23, 150, and 190 microM, respectively. In secretion experiments, thapsigargin-induced depletion of internal Ca2+ stores stimulated serotonin release, which was found to be strictly dependent on extracellular Ca2+. In the presence of 100 microM La3+ secretion was almost completely inhibited. In contrast, only 50% of secretion was suppressed by 500 microM 4,4'-diisothiocyanato-2,2'-disulfonic acid, which fully blocked the Cl- current without affecting Ca2+ influx, as monitored by electrophysiological experiments. The other Cl- channel blockers produced a very different pattern for the inhibitory dose dependence of secretion, with IC50 values for NPPB, niflumic acid, and NPAA of 23, 60, and 180 microM, respectively. Taken together, these findings suggest that Ca2+ store depletion leads to concomitant activation of Cl- and Ca2+ currents. Blockade of the latter is apparently an additional mode of action for diarylaminocarboxylate-type Cl- channel blockers inhibiting mast cell secretory responses.","['Reinsprecht, M', 'Rohn, M H', 'Spadinger, R J', 'Pecht, I', 'Schindler, H', 'Romanin, C']","['Reinsprecht M', 'Rohn MH', 'Spadinger RJ', 'Pecht I', 'Schindler H', 'Romanin C']","['Institute for Biophysics, University of Linz, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Chloride Channels)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Nitrobenzoates)', '0 (Terpenes)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '3A35O9G3YZ (5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '6I3K30563S (Lanthanum)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chloride Channels/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Chlorides/metabolism', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Ion Transport/drug effects', 'Lanthanum/pharmacology', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mucous Membrane/cytology/metabolism', 'Nitrobenzoates/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Terpenes/pharmacology', 'Thapsigargin']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1995 May;47(5):1014-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed an ROS-resistant variant of the human erythroleukemic cell line K562 by culturing cells in glucose oxidase to produce hydrogen peroxide. Testing the activity of the scavenger systems for ROS showed these cells had a 25- to 28-fold increase in catalase activity. We therefore termed this variant cell line K562-CAT. There was no similar increase in glutathione content or activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. To determine what effect the increased catalase activity would have on the immune response to these tumor cells, we compared K562 and K562-CAT sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) activated polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN), natural killer (NK), and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. K562-CAT showed a significant increase in resistance to TNF alpha-activated PMN but not to NK or LAK, confirming the role of ROS in the former but not the latter. We also tested K562-CAT sensitivity to cisplatin and mitomycin C, agents known to involve ROS in their cytotoxic mechanism. There was no increased resistance in K562-CAT compared to parental K562, indicating that catalase is not involved in tumor cell resistance to those drugs. Given the characteristics of its resistance to the immune response, K562-CAT or a similar catalase-hyperexpressing cell line could be useful in determining the significance of TNF alpha-activated PMN in antitumor defenses.","['Sauri, H', 'Kim, A T', 'Shau, H']","['Sauri H', 'Kim AT', 'Shau H']","['Division of Surgical Oncology, UCLA School of Medicine 90024-1782, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Surg Res,The Journal of surgical research,0376340,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)']",IM,"['Antibody Formation', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Catalase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/physiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/physiology', '*Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-4804(85)71083-9 [pii]', '10.1006/jsre.1995.1083 [doi]']",ppublish,J Surg Res. 1995 May;58(5):526-35. doi: 10.1006/jsre.1995.1083.,,,,['CA09010-18/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, 2 of the 16 F-MuLV-induced tumors had viruses integrated in the distal 3' end of c-myb. To determine the precise locations of these integrations, it was necessary to clone sequences encoding the 3' c-myb exons and to prepare a physical map of this region.

In this study, we compared the abilities of HIV-1 MA mutants to incorporate Env protein complexes with long and short cytoplasmic tails. While the mutant particles failed to incorporate the authentic HIV-1 Env protein complex, they retained the ability to efficiently and functionally incorporate the amphotropic murine leukemia virus Env protein complex, which has a short cytoplasmic tail. Moreover, incorporation of the autologous Env protein complex could be restored by a second-site mutation that resulted in the truncation of the cytoplasmic tail of the HIV-1 transmembrane glycoprotein. Remarkably, the second-site mutation also restored the ability of MA mutants to replicate in MT-4 cells. These results imply that the long cytoplasmic tail of the transmembrane glycoprotein is responsible for the exclusion of the HIV-1 Env protein complex from MA mutant particles.","['Mammano, F', 'Kondo, E', 'Sodroski, J', 'Bukovsky, A', 'Gottlinger, H G']","['Mammano F', 'Kondo E', 'Sodroski J', 'Bukovsky A', 'Gottlinger HG']","['Division of Human Retrovirology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (HIV Antigens)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (p17 protein, Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1)']",IM,"['Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*metabolism', 'HIV Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/genetics/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Mutation', '*Viral Proteins', 'Virus Replication/genetics', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",PMC189100,1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.6.3824-3830.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 Jun;69(6):3824-30. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.6.3824-3830.1995.,,,,"['AI28691/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI29873/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to study the effects of overexpression of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor in hematopoietic cells, a Harvey sarcoma virus-derived retroviral vector containing the murine c-fms cDNA was pseudotyped with Friend murine leukemia virus and inoculated into newborn DBA/2 mice. This viral complex induced monoclonal or oligoclonal leukemias with a shorter latency than that for Friend murine leukemia virus alone. Unexpectedly, 60% of the integrated fms proviruses had deletions at the 5' end of the c-fms gene. Sequence analysis of seven mutant proviruses indicated that the deletions always included the c-fms ligand binding domain and either occurred within the c-fms sequences, leaving the fms open reading frame unchanged, or joined VL30 sequences located at the 5' end of the parental retroviral vector to internal c-fms sequences, resulting in truncated fms proteins devoid of the canonical signal peptide. In contrast to all tyrosine kinase receptors transduced in retroviruses, no helper gag- or env-derived sequences were fused to the rearranged fms sequences. Viral supernatants isolated from hematopoietic tumors with viruses with deletions were able to transform NIH 3T3 cells as efficiently as parental fms virus, indicating that deletions resulted in constitutive activation of the c-fms gene.

P. Kavanaugh, D. G. Miller, W. Zhang, W. Law, S. L. Kozak, D. Kabat, and A. D. Miller, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:7071-7075, 1994). CHO cells express the hamster homolog of Ram-1 but are resistant to amphotropic retroviruses. Although the amphotropic envelope glycoprotein gp70 bound weakly onto control CHO cells, CHO/rRam-1 cells had novel high-affinity binding sites, and the resulting strongly adsorbed gp70 was only slowly removed from cell surfaces, with a half-life of greater than 6 h. CHO/rRam-1 cells were also specifically and efficiently killed by exposure to amphotropic gp70 followed by antiserum to gp70 in the presence of complement. Infection with an appropriately pseudotyped form of amphotropic retrovirus 4070A did not perturb control CHO cells or inhibit their phosphate transport. In contrast, 4070A infection of CHO/rRam-1 cells caused major alterations including cell-cell fusions, a specific 40% down-modulation of the rRam-1 component of phosphate transport, and complete interference to super-infection by amphotropic viruses. The 4070A virus-infected CHO/rRam-1 cells retained a substantial cell surface pool of rRam-1 that functioned as a phosphate transporter but not as a viral receptor. We conclude that amphotropic gp70 binds more strongly to rRam-1 than to the homologous hamster protein and that this stable attachment is necessary for infection, interference, membrane fusion, and pathogenesis.","['Kozak, S L', 'Siess, D C', 'Kavanaugh, M P', 'Miller, A D', 'Kabat, D']","['Kozak SL', 'Siess DC', 'Kavanaugh MP', 'Miller AD', 'Kabat D']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201-3098, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Phosphate-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cricetinae', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Products, env/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phosphate-Binding Proteins', 'Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism']",PMC189055,1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.6.3433-3440.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 Jun;69(6):3433-40. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.6.3433-3440.1995.,,,,"['CA25810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM48709/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 21-bp repeats can be subdivided into three motifs known as A, B, and C, each of which is important for maximal gene expression in response to Tax. The B motif contains nucleotide sequences known as a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) or tax-response element which binds members of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors. Though mutations of this element in the HTLV-I LTR eliminate tax activation, Tax will not activate most other promoters containing these CRE sites. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which Tax activates gene expression in conjunction with members of the ATF/CREB family. We found that Tax enhanced the binding of one member of the ATF/CREB family, CREB 1, to each of the three HTLV-I LTR 21-bp repeats but not another member designated CRE-BP1 or CREB2. Tax enhanced the binding of CREB1 to nonpalindromic CRE binding sites such as those found in the HTLV-I LTR, but Tax did not enhance the binding of CREB1 to palindromic CRE binding sites such as found in the somatostatin promoter. This finding may help explain the failure of Tax to activate promoters containing consensus CRE sites. These studies were extended by use of the mammalian two-hybrid system. Tax was demonstrated to interact directly with CREB1 but not with other bZIP proteins, including CREB2 and Jun. Site-directed mutagenesis of both Tax and CREB1 demonstrated that the amino terminus of Tax and both the basic and the leucine zipper regions of CREB1 were required for direct interactions between these proteins both in vivo and in vitro. This interaction occurred in vivo and thus did not require the presence of the HTLV-I 21-bp repeats, as previously suggested. These results define the domains required for interaction between Tax and CREB that are likely critical for the activation of HTLV-I gene expression.","['Yin, M J', 'Paulssen, E J', 'Seeler, J S', 'Gaynor, R B']","['Yin MJ', 'Paulssen EJ', 'Seeler JS', 'Gaynor RB']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235-8594, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (G-Box Binding Factors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'G-Box Binding Factors', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription Factors']",PMC189054,1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.6.3420-3432.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 Jun;69(6):3420-32. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.6.3420-3432.1995.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These proviruses exhibit a unique sequence motif in the long terminal repeat (LTR), namely, a 21-bp tandem triplication beginning 25 bp downstream of the enhancer. The repeated finding of the triplication-containing LTR in non-B-cell, non-T-cell lymphomas of the spleen suggests that the unique LTR is an essential participant in the development of tumors of this particular phenotype. The nucleotide sequence of the triplication-containing LTR most closely resembles that of FeLV subgroup C. Studies performed to measure the ability of the triplication-containing LTR to modulate gene expression indicate that the 21-bp triplication provides transcriptional enhancer function to the LTR that contains it and that it substitutes at least in part for the duplication of the enhancer. The 21-bp triplication confers a bona fide enhancer function upon LTR-directed reporter gene expression; however, the possibility of a spacer function was not eliminated. The studies demonstrate further that the triplication-containing LTR acts preferentially in a cell-type-specific manner, i.e., it is 12-fold more active in K-562 cells than is an LTR lacking the triplication. A recombinant, infectious FeLV bearing the 21-bp triplication in U3 was constructed. Cells infected with the recombinant were shown to accumulate higher levels of viral RNA transcripts and virus particles in culture supernatants than did cells infected with the parental type. The triplication-containing LTR is implicated in the induction of tumors of a particular phenotype, perhaps through transcriptional regulation of the virus and/or adjacent cellular genes, in the appropriate target cell.","['Athas, G B', 'Lobelle-Rich, P', 'Levy, L S']","['Athas GB', 'Lobelle-Rich P', 'Levy LS']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana 70112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral', 'Dogs', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Lymphoma/*virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*virology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC189044,1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.6.3324-3332.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 Jun;69(6):3324-32. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.6.3324-3332.1995.,,,,['CA-48801/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Testing the replication efficiency of the vectors with a helper virus and helper plasmids allowed for separation of the mutant vectors into three groups. The replication efficiency of the first group was reduced by a factor of 7; these mutants contained deletions in the 5' end of the gag gene. The second group of mutants had replication reduced by a factor of 50 and had deletions including the 5' untranslated leader region. The third group of mutants replicated at levels comparable to those of the parental vector and contained deletions of the 3' end of the gag gene, the pol gene, and the env gene. Analysis of cytoplasmic and virion RNA levels indicated that vector RNA expression was not affected but that the vector RNA encapsidation was less efficient for group 1 and group 2 mutants. Additional mutations revealed two regions important for RNA encapsidation. The first region is a 132-nucleotide-base sequence within the gag gene (nucleotides 1015 to 1147 of the proviral DNA) and facilitates efficient RNA encapsidation in the presence of the second region. The second region includes a 147-nucleotide-base sequence downstream of the primer binding site (nucleotide 551) and near the gag gene start codon (nucleotide 698; gag begins at nucleotide 628) and is essential for RNA encapsidation. We conclude that the encapsidation signal is discontinuous; a primary signal, essential for RNA encapsidation, is largely in the untranslated leader region between the primer binding site and near the gag start codon. A secondary signal, which facilitates efficient RNA encapsidation, is in a 132-nucleotide-base region within the 5' end of the gag gene.","['Mansky, L M', 'Krueger, A E', 'Temin, H M']","['Mansky LM', 'Krueger AE', 'Temin HM']","['McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin Medical School, Madison 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Capsid/*physiology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', '*Genes, gag', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",PMC189039,1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.6.3282-3289.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 Jun;69(6):3282-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.6.3282-3289.1995.,,['gag'],,"['CA07175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09075-17/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This result was surprising, as these supernatants were not expected to contain high levels of IL-4. We therefore explored the possibility that IL-12 itself, that remained in the supernatants, could induce proliferation of CT4S cells. In this series of experiments we demonstrate that CT4S cells proliferate to recombinant as well as to naturally produced IL-12, and that IL-4 and IL-12 synergize in supporting proliferation of CT4S cells. The proliferation induced by IL-12, as well as the synergistic effect with IL-4, can be reversed by neutralizing anti-IL-12 antibodies. Proliferation of CT4S can be abrogated completely by a combination of antibodies against IL-4 and IL-12. Our data have important implications for the use of CT4S as a specific bioassay for IL-4, since both IL-4 and IL-12 may be found together in at least some culture supernatants. Furthermore, our results suggest that the CT4S line (or a derivative selected from it) could be used as a bioassay for detection of IL-12 in combination with the specific antibodies.","['Xu, H', 'Rizzo, L V', 'Caspi, R R']","['Xu H', 'Rizzo LV', 'Caspi RR']","['National Eye Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Interleukin-12/*administration & dosage', 'Interleukin-4/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Recombinant Proteins']",,1995/04/26 00:00,1995/04/26 00:01,['1995/04/26 00:00'],"['1995/04/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/26 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['002217599500008X [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(95)00008-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1995 Apr 26;181(2):245-51. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(95)00008-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that a 77-kDa protein associates with pp125FAK in the mast cell analog, rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. When pp125FAK immunoprecipitates were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay, there was prominent phosphorylation on tyrosine of pp125FAK and of a 77-kDa protein. By V8 protease digestion mapping and by immunoblotting with two different anti-pp125FAK antibodies, the 77-kDa protein was distinct from pp125FAK. This Fak Associated Protein or FAP was detected in RBL-2H3 cells but not in fibroblasts. The aggregation of the high affinity IgE receptor, Fc epsilon RI, induced the in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation of FAP. However, there was a marked decrease in the in vitro phosphorylation of FAP in the immunoprecipitates from Fc epsilon RI aggregated cells. Both of these Fc epsilon RI-mediated effects were enhanced by cell adhesion. There was strong association of FAP with non-tyrosine-phosphorylated pp125FAK. Thus this interaction does not appear to be mediated by the Src homology 2 domain. Together the data indicate that FAP associates with pp125FAK and suggest that FAP may play a role in Fc epsilon RI signaling.","['Hamawy, M M', 'Minoguchi, K', 'Swaim, W D', 'Mergenhagen, S E', 'Siraganian, R P']","['Hamawy MM', 'Minoguchi K', 'Swaim WD', 'Mergenhagen SE', 'Siraganian RP']","['Laboratory of Immunology, NIDR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-1188, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Ptk2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Ptk2 protein, rat)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Immunoglobulin E/*immunology', '*Immunologic Capping', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/05/19 00:00,1995/05/19 00:01,['1995/05/19 00:00'],"['1995/05/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/19 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.20.12305 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)47974-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 May 19;270(20):12305-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.20.12305.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similarities and differences in signal transduction with interleukin-4 and insulin.,12286-96,"Interleukin-13 (IL-13) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) are related in structure and function and are thought to share a common receptor component. We have investigated the signal transduction pathways activated by these two growth factors, as well as insulin, in cell-lines and primary cells of lymphohemopoietic origin. All three factors induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein of 170 kDa (p170), which coimmunoprecipitated with the p85 subunit of P13'-kinase, via high affinity interactions mediated by the SH2 domains of p85. Antibodies raised against the entire insulin-receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) protein immunoprecipitated p170 much less efficiently than they did IRS-1 from 3T3 cells. However, antibodies directed against the conserved pleckstrin homology domain of IRS-1 immunoprecipitated both p170 and IRS-1 with similar efficiency, suggesting they share structural similarities in this region. In lymphohemopoietic cells, IL-13, IL-4, and insulin failed to induce increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, or its association with grb2, modification of Sos1, or activation of erk-1 and erk-2 mitogen-activated protein kinases, suggesting that p170 mediates downstream pathways distinct from those mediated by IRS-1. Both IL-13 and IL-4 induced low levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk-2 and Jak-1. IL-4 also activated the Jak-3-kinase, but, despite other similarities, IL-13 did not. Insulin failed to activate any of the known members of the Janus family of kinases. In that Jak-3 is reported to associate with the IL-2 gamma c chain, these data suggest that the IL-13 receptor does not utilize this subunit. However, both IL-13 and IL-4 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the IL-4-140 kDa receptor chain, suggesting that this is a component of both receptors in these cells and accounts for the similarities in signaling pathways shared by IL-13 and IL-4.","['Welham, M J', 'Learmonth, L', 'Bone, H', 'Schrader, J W']","['Welham MJ', 'Learmonth L', 'Bone H', 'Schrader JW']","['Biomedical Research Centre, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Grb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (IL13RA1 protein, human)', '0 (IRS1 protein, human)', '0 (Il13ra1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '0 (Interleukin-13 Receptor alpha1 Subunit)', '0 (Irs1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-13)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells/metabolism', '*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Insulin/pharmacology', 'Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins', 'Interleukin-13/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-13 Receptor alpha1 Subunit', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Janus Kinase 3', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phosphoproteins/immunology/metabolism/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism', 'Plasmacytoma/pathology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/drug effects/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-13', 'Receptors, Interleukin-4', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/05/19 00:00,1995/05/19 00:01,['1995/05/19 00:00'],"['1995/05/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/19 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.20.12286 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)47972-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 May 19;270(20):12286-96. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.20.12286.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these sites is termed the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE). We have tested the function of an ISRE consensus sequence in the human HLA class I gene HLA-A2 and confirmed previous studies that showed that the HLA-A2 ISRE consensus sequence does not mediate a response to interferons. However, deletion of the ISRE consensus sequence caused a several-fold reduction in the constitutive expression of the HLA-A2 gene in K562 and Jurkat cells. Mobility shift assays performed with the HLA-A2 ISRE revealed the presence of a constitutive binding protein (ISRE/CBP). This protein binds specifically to the HLA-A2 ISRE sequence, and binding is not efficiently competed by the ISRE sequences of the HLA-B7 or ISG54 genes. Substitution of the HLA-B7 or ISG54 ISRE sequences for the HLA-A2 ISRE sequence caused a severalfold reduction in the constitutive expression of the HLA-A2 gene. Mass determinations showed the ISRE/CBP to be 105 kDa, different than any previously characterized ISRE binding proteins. We propose that ISRE/CBP is a novel positive transcriptional regulatory factor for the HLA-A2 gene that may contribute to the differential expression of HLA-A versus HLA-B genes.","['Waring, J F', 'Radford, J E', 'Burns, L J', 'Ginder, G D']","['Waring JF', 'Radford JE', 'Burns LJ', 'Ginder GD']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (HLA-B7 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Carrier Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Consensus Sequence', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', '*Genes, MHC Class I', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/*genetics', 'HLA-B7 Antigen/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/05/19 00:00,1995/05/19 00:01,['1995/05/19 00:00'],"['1995/05/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/19 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.20.12276 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)47971-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 May 19;270(20):12276-85. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.20.12276.,,,,['R01-CA45634/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L-chiro-Ins(2,3,5)P3 closely resembles Ins(1,4,5)P3 and D-Ins(1,4,6)P3 except for a difference in the orientation of a single hydroxyl group at either the equivalent 3-OH or 2-OH position of Ins(1,4,5)P3, respectively. Similarly, L-chiro-Ins(2,3,5)P3 resembles D-scyllo-Ins(1,2,4)P3, but has a different orientation of both the equivalent 3-OH and 2-OH positions. Since Ins(1,4,5)P3, DL-Ins(1,4,6)P3, and DL-scyllo-Ins(1,2,4)P3 did not inhibit PI 3-kinase activity, this suggests that the orientation of the two hydroxyl groups at the 2- and 3-positions plays a pivotal role in the inhibitory action of inositol phosphate analogues on PI 3-kinase activity.

Degradation of I kappa B-alpha is enhanced by Tax, resulting in the liberation of some NF-kappa B, which then translocates into the nucleus. Here we have investigated the mechanism by which Tax causes degradation of I kappa B-alpha. Two I kappa B-alpha mutants defective in extracellular signal-induced degradation of I kappa B-alpha also blocked Tax-mediated kappa B-dependent transactivation when cotransfected into Jurkat T cells. Cotransfected wild-type I kappa B-alpha or an irrelevant mutant did not significantly effect transactivation induced by Tax. The signal-defective I kappa B-alpha proteins are mutated at either of two closely spaced serines in the N terminus of the protein (Ser32 and Ser36). In wild-type I kappa B-alpha, one or both of these serines are inducibly phosphorylated with extracellular stimuli, and such phosphorylation appears necessary for subsequent degradation and thus activation of NF-kappa B. These results suggest that Tax triggers I kappa B-alpha degradation and thus NF-kappa B activation by a mechanism that converges with that induced by extracellular stimulation such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin or tumor necrosis factor alpha. A role for Tax in activating signal transduction pathways upstream of I kappa B-alpha is implied.","['Kanno, T', 'Brown, K', 'Siebenlist, U']","['Kanno T', 'Brown K', 'Siebenlist U']","['Laboratory of Immunoregulation, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-1876, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RELB protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '147337-75-5 (Transcription Factor RelB)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Serine/chemistry', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor RelB', '*Transcription Factors', '*Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",,1995/05/19 00:00,1995/05/19 00:01,['1995/05/19 00:00'],"['1995/05/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/19 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.20.11745 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)47898-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 May 19;270(20):11745-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.20.11745.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The protein products of this gene contain the basic-helix-loop-helix motif characteristic of a large family of transcription factors that bind to the canonical DNA sequence CANNTG as protein heterodimers. TAL1 expression by erythroid cells in vivo and in chemical-induced erythroleukemia cell lines in vivo suggested the gene might regulate aspects of erythroid differentiation. Since the terminal events of erythropoiesis are controlled by the glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin (Epo), we investigated whether the expression or activity of the TAL1 gene and its protein products were affected by Epo in splenic erythroblasts from mice infected with an anemia-inducing strain of Friend virus (FVA cells). Epo elicited a rapid, dose-related increase in TAL1 mRNA by increasing transcription of the gene and stabilizing one of its mRNAs. An Epo-inducible TAL1 DNA binding activity was identified in FVA cell nuclear extracts that subsequently decayed despite accumulating mRNA and protein. Induction of DNA binding activity was associated temporally with Epo-induced phosphorylation of nuclear TAL1 protein. These results indicate that Epo acts at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels on the TAL1 locus in Friend virus-induced erythroblasts and establish a link between Epo signaling mechanisms and a member of a family of transcription factors involved in the differentiation of diverse cell lineages.","['Prasad, K S', 'Jordan, J E', 'Koury, M J', 'Bondurant, M C', 'Brandt, S J']","['Prasad KS', 'Jordan JE', 'Koury MJ', 'Bondurant MC', 'Brandt SJ']","['Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Erythroblasts/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects']",,1995/05/12 00:00,1995/05/12 00:01,['1995/05/12 00:00'],"['1995/05/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/12 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.19.11603 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)50239-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 May 12;270(19):11603-11. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.19.11603.,,"['SCL', 'TAL1']",,"['R01 DK31513/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R29HL49118/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data from Southern and Northern blot analysis, and analysis of sequence similarity with a recently cloned mouse adenylyl cyclase (10), indicated that the human adenylyl cyclase was a species variant of type VII adenylyl cyclase. The sequence of the novel human adenylyl cyclase indicated it was a member of the type II adenylyl cyclase family, and we compared the regulatory characteristics of the novel human enzyme with those of type II adenylyl cyclase. The human type VII and rat type II adenylyl cyclases, expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, were activated by prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), but only type VII was activated by isoproterenol. The stimulation of type VII adenylyl cyclase by PGE1 and isoproterenol was attenuated by pretreatment of the cells with staurosporine. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate synergistically enhanced the stimulation of both type VII and type II enzyme activity by PGE1 and by the constitutively active Gs mutant Gs (Q227L). The human type VII adenylyl cyclase activity was unresponsive to capacitatively induced changes in intracellular Ca2+. The functional characteristics of human type VII adenylyl cyclase resemble those of the rat type II enzyme, but the enzymes may respond differently to in vivo phosphorylation conditions. While the mRNA for adenylyl cyclase type II was found in several brain areas, the message for type VII adenylyl cyclase was localized primarily to the cerebellar granule cell layer.","['Hellevuo, K', 'Yoshimura, M', 'Mons, N', 'Hoffman, P L', 'Cooper, D M', 'Tabakoff, B']","['Hellevuo K', 'Yoshimura M', 'Mons N', 'Hoffman PL', 'Cooper DM', 'Tabakoff B']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center Denver 80262, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenylyl Cyclases/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Alprostadil/pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Brain/*enzymology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Library', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Kidney', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organ Specificity', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transfection']",,1995/05/12 00:00,1995/05/12 00:01,['1995/05/12 00:00'],"['1995/05/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/12 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.19.11581 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)50236-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 May 12;270(19):11581-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.19.11581.,,,,"['32483/PHS HHS/United States', 'AA09014/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present studies examine whether cleavage of the thrombin receptor by cathepsin G can account for these diverse effects. When added to cells that normally respond to thrombin, cathepsin G prevented a subsequent cytosolic Ca2+ increase caused by thrombin, but had no effect on responses to the thrombin receptor agonist peptide, SFLLRN. These effects were observed in cells in which cathepsin G had little or no agonist effect (human umbilical vein endothelial cells and HEL cells), as well as in cells in which cathepsin G acted as an agonist (platelets and CHRF-288 cells). Binding studies using monoclonal antibodies with defined epitopes within the first 60 residues of the thrombin receptor N-terminus showed that incubation of platelets and endothelial cells with cathepsin G abolished the binding of all of the antibodies, while thrombin abolished only the binding of antibodies whose epitopes were N-terminal to the known thrombin cleavage site between Arg41 and Ser42. Analysis of peptide proteolytic fragments identified three potential cleavage sites for cathepsin G: Arg41-Ser42, Phe43-Leu44, and Phe55-Trp56. Cleavage at Phe55-Trp56 would account for both the observed loss of all of the antibody binding sites and the inhibition of receptor activation by thrombin. Two approaches were used to determine whether a solitary cleavage at Arg41-Ser42 could result in receptor activation. In the first, HEL cells were exposed to cathepsin G or thrombin in the presence of an antibody whose epitope includes Phe55. The antibody inhibited responses to thrombin, but augmented the response to cathepsin G. In the second, COS-1 cells were transfected with variant thrombin receptors in which Phe55 and Trp56 were mutated to alanine. Transfected wild-type receptors responded to thrombin, but not cathepsin G, while the variant receptors responded to both proteases. These results 1) suggest that the ability of cathepsin G to inhibit responses to thrombin, but not SFLLRN, is due to cleavage of the receptor at Phe55-Trp56, deleting the tethered ligand domain, and 2) show that cathepsin G can activate thrombin receptors, but only if the cleavage site at Phe55-Trp56 is mutated or otherwise protected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Molino, M', 'Blanchard, N', 'Belmonte, E', 'Tarver, A P', 'Abrams, C', 'Hoxie, J A', 'Cerletti, C', 'Brass, L F']","['Molino M', 'Blanchard N', 'Belmonte E', 'Tarver AP', 'Abrams C', 'Hoxie JA', 'Cerletti C', 'Brass LF']","['Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (thrombin receptor peptide (42-47))', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (CTSG protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Cathepsin G)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cathepsin G', 'Cathepsins/*blood', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA Primers', 'Endothelium, Vascular/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology', 'Oligopeptides/chemical synthesis/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Thrombin/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Thrombin/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Umbilical Veins']",,1995/05/12 00:00,1995/05/12 00:01,['1995/05/12 00:00'],"['1995/05/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/12 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.19.11168 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)50182-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 May 12;270(19):11168-75. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.19.11168.,,,,"['CA-16520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-19525/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL40387/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These studies showed that CLM in the presence or absence of Ca2+ had no effect on binding of [3H]vinblastine (VBL) by P-gp in inside-out plasma membrane vesicles. However, profound inhibition of ATP-dependent [3H]VBL efflux by these vesicles was demonstrated by the addition of subnanomolar concentrations of CLM (IC50 = 0.15 +/- 0.02 nM). The addition of 1 microM Ca2+ reduced the inhibition of [3H]VBL efflux by CLM, shifting the concentration required for inhibition to the nM range (IC50 = 2.55 +/- 0.35 nM). The inhibition of as 0.01 mM Ca2+, and no inhibition occurred with concentrations greater than 0.2 mM Ca2+. Binding of CLM, itself, to P-gp was demonstrated in two ways. The P-gp content of detergent-solubilized plasma membrane from MEL/VCR-6 cells could be appreciably depleted by treating this material with CLM-Sepharose beads as shown by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western blotting with anti-P-gp antibody (C219) before and after CLM-Sepharose treatment. Also, depletion of P-gp from solution by CLM was less in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+. Blotting of P-gp after SDS-PAGE of plasma membrane from MEL/VCR-6 cells was also obtained using 125I-CLM as a probe. These results strongly suggest that the MDR 3 homolog of P-gp is a CLM-binding protein and that direct interaction of Ca(2+)-CLM with P-gp, while not affecting its binding of [3H]VBL, down-modulates the translocation of this agent in the presence of ATP.","['Schlemmer, S R', 'Yang, C H', 'Sirotnak, F M']","['Schlemmer SR', 'Yang CH', 'Sirotnak FM']","['Program of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Calmodulin)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium/*pharmacology', 'Calmodulin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/metabolism']",,1995/05/12 00:00,1995/05/12 00:01,['1995/05/12 00:00'],"['1995/05/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/12 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.19.11040 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)50163-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 May 12;270(19):11040-2. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.19.11040.,,,,"['CA 08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 56517/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, we injected 111In-oxine-labeled ATL-43T cells into SCID and CB17 mice. On day 6, significant accumulation of radioactivity was found in the spleen and thymus of SCID mice (33.3 +/- 9.4 and 10.0 +/- 3.6% injected dose/g of tissue [%ID/g], respectively) in comparison with that in CB17 mice (19.1 +/- 2.5 and 3.7 +/- 0.9%ID/g, respectively). Next, we injected radiolabeled anti-Tac monoclonal antibody (MoAb) recognizing human interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) alpha chain or isotype-matched control MoAb RPC5 in SCID mice bearing ATL-43T cells 4 weeks after cell inoculation. The amounts of radioactivity found in the spleen and thymus of SCID mice injected with 125I-labeled anti-Tac MoAb (22.5 +/- 6.9 and 22.8 +/- 9.6 %ID/g, respectively) were significantly higher than those in the corresponding organs of SCID mice injected with 125I-labeled RPC5 MoAb (12.0 +/- 5.1 and 7.5 +/- 4.6 %ID/g, respectively). Similar results were obtained with 111In-labeled anti-Tac MoAb. These results were consistent with the histological findings of SCID mice bearing ATL-43T cells, indicating that ATL-43T cells infiltrated preferentially into the lymphoid organs, such as the spleen and thymus, and proliferated there. Thus, the radiometric techniques employed in this study were very useful to evaluate the proliferation sites of ATL-43T cells in SCID mice. Furthermore, this murine model could give us an opportunity to test the feasibility of therapeutic application of radiolabeled anti-Tac MoAb.","['Takaori-Kondo, A', 'Hosono, M', 'Imada, K', 'Yao, Z S', 'Sakahara, H', 'Yamabe, H', 'Konishi, J', 'Okuma, M', 'Uchiyama, T']","['Takaori-Kondo A', 'Hosono M', 'Imada K', 'Yao ZS', 'Sakahara H', 'Yamabe H', 'Konishi J', 'Okuma M', 'Uchiyama T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Kyoto University.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Indium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '5UTX5635HP (Oxyquinoline)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', '*Cell Division', 'Indium Radioisotopes', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oxyquinoline', 'Radiometry', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC5920819,1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['091050509599415N [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1995.tb03058.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1995 Mar;86(3):322-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1995.tb03058.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have also examined the invasive capacity of these leukemia cell lines into reconstituted basement membrane, Matrigel, which was used for in vitro invasion assay. Among the human leukemia cell lines used in this study, only the granulocytic sarcoma cell line was found to secrete type IV collagenase constitutively. Other myeloid leukemia cell lines such as HL-60 and U-937 produced type IV collagenase only after treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. All the cell lines secreted similar amounts of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases. In vitro invasion assay revealed that the granulocytic sarcoma cell line showed higher invasive capacity than the other cell lines.

In order to study this GvL-specific T-cell response in vitro, proliferative T-cell clones from post-BMT PBMCs were generated by stimulation with a patient's leukemic cells. One CD4+ T-cell clone (designated M-33) displayed strong proliferative activity against the patient's leukemic cells but not against the patient's EBV-LCLs. The induction of proliferation, however, appeared not to be leukemia specific. Detailed analysis of the reactivity patterns revealed that T-cell clone M-33 recognizes an as yet unknown nonpolymorphic determinant in the context of self HLA-DRw52, presented by all but one type of APC. T-cell clone M-33 proliferated upon stimulation by PB-MCs, freshly isolated B cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, leukemic B cells, and nonleukemic B-cell blasts; solely in vitro EBV-transformed B cells and in vivo EBV-infected B cells failed to induce proliferation of T-cell clone M-33. Neither surface expression of MHC or accessory molecules on the EBV cells nor suppression caused by the EBV-infected cells could explain their failure to stimulate T-cell clone M-33.

In this study, the expression of matrix metalloproteinase gelatinase B (MMP-9), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and their inhibitors was investigated during early mouse embryo development. Transcripts for tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1,-2,-3) and uPA receptor were detected throughout pre- and peri-implantation development whilst MMP-9 and uPA mRNAs were first detected in peri-implantation blastocysts associated with the invasive phase of implantation. Through use of in situ hybridization, it was shown that MMP-9 transcripts were strongly expressed in the network of trophoblast giant cells at the periphery of implanting 7.5 day embryos and TIMP-3 transcripts were strongly expressed in the decidua immediately adjacent to the implanting embryo. uPA transcripts were preferentially expressed in the ectoplacental cone and its derivatives. Because these proteinases are regulated by growth factors and cytokines in other tissues, the effect of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) on their activity was investigated. Both LIF and EGF, like the proteinases, have been implicated in peri-implantation development. Blastocysts collected on day 4 of pregnancy were cultured 2 days in TCM 199 + 10% fetal bovine serum to allow outgrowth followed by 24 hour culture in defined media containing either LIF or EGF. Conditioned media were assayed for uPA activity by a chromogenic assay and MMP activity by gelatin zymography. Both LIF and EGF stimulated uPA and MMP-9 activity in blastocyst outgrowths after 3 days of culture (day 7). Proteinase activity was assayed again at the 5th to 6th day of culture (day 9 to 10). EGF was found to have no effect whereas LIF decreased production of both proteinases. These results demonstrate that proteinase activity in early embryos can be regulated by growth factors and cytokines during the implantation process and, in particular, they demonstrate the possible involvement of LIF in establishment of the correct temporal programme of proteinase expression.","['Harvey, M B', 'Leco, K J', 'Arcellana-Panlilio, M Y', 'Zhang, X', 'Edwards, D R', 'Schultz, G A']","['Harvey MB', 'Leco KJ', 'Arcellana-Panlilio MY', 'Zhang X', 'Edwards DR', 'Schultz GA']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry, University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Plaur protein, mouse)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-3)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blastocyst/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagenases/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Embryo Implantation/*physiology', 'Endopeptidases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'In Situ Hybridization', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9', 'Metalloendopeptidases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Plasminogen Activators/genetics', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-3', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/genetics/metabolism']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Development. 1995 Apr;121(4):1005-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells were stained by indirect immunofluorescence methods using a polyclonal antiserum generated with a 21-amino-acid peptide representing amino acids 219-239 of human topoisomerase I. Immunohistochemical staining was followed by staining with Hoechst dye 33342, allowing DNA content to be determined in each cell. Cell cycle analysis showed that nuclear topoisomerase I content doubled (2.2-fold increase) as the cells progressed from G1 to G2/M phases of the cell cycle. However, when normalized for nuclear size, topoisomerase I content per nuclear area remained almost constant (1.3-fold increase). For comparison, we measured the amount of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a protein whose expression fluctuates during the cell cycle. Nuclear PCNA content increased 2.7-fold from G1 to S phase, then declined in G2/M- phases, whereas PCNA content per nuclear area increased 1.7-fold from G1 to S phase. We also measured topoisomerase I content in leucine-deprived cells to determine if altered growth conditions affect topoisomerase I protein expression. Compared to CEM cells in logarithmic growth, leucine-deprived CEM cells had 1.8-fold less topoisomerase I content per nuclear area. Subnuclear distribution studies of proliferating CEM cells showed topoisomerase I to be localized predominantly in the nucleoli throughout the cell cycle. In contrast, leucine-deprived cells exhibited a perinuclear distribution of topoisomerase I. Our results show that FDIM is a useful technique in determining the cell cycle position and both the content and the distribution of topoisomerase I as well as other nuclear proteins in individual cells.","['Baker, S D', 'Wadkins, R M', 'Stewart, C F', 'Beck, W T', 'Danks, M K']","['Baker SD', 'Wadkins RM', 'Stewart CF', 'Beck WT', 'Danks MK']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38101-0318, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'P976261J69 (bisbenzimide ethoxide trihydrochloride)']",IM,"['Antibody Specificity', 'Benzimidazoles/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism', 'G1 Phase/physiology', 'G2 Phase/physiology', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/instrumentation', 'S Phase/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990190208 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1995 Feb 1;19(2):134-45. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990190208.,,,,"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been used successfully in the treatment of pediatric pulmonary hemangioma and hairy cell leukemia. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of topical and subcutaneous (s.c.) alpha-interferon on corneal neovascularization. Corneal neovascularization was induced in 40 male New Zealand white rabbits by placing silk sutures (7.0) bilaterally in each rabbit eye at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions of the cornea, 3 mm from the limbus. Animals were randomized into two main treatment groups for topical (group 1) and s.c. (group 2) administration of interferon. Group 1 (n = 24) was then randomized into four subgroups and treated daily with topical doses of (a) rabbit specific alpha-interferon; (b) alpha-interferon plus 1% prednisolone acetate; (c) 1% prednisolone acetate; and (d) buffered phosphate control. Group 2 (n = 16) was randomized into two subgroups that received s.c. injections every other day of (a) alpha-interferon and (b) phosphate buffer. Rate of corneal neovascularization was documented photographically, with the end-point being the arrival of vessels at the suture for each group. The results of this study indicated that at the concentration and dosing regimens we used, neither topical nor s.c. alpha-interferon inhibits the rate of corneal vascular growth significantly when compared with our phosphate buffered solution control group (p = 0.88 and p = 0.84, respectively).

First, we examined DNAs from B cells from 140 B-CLL patients representing all Rai stages of disease for the loss of 13q14 using two microsatellite markers mapping distal to the Rb locus. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of D13S133 was infrequent, occurring in 5 of 140 (4%) patients. The frequency for LOH of D13S218 was 33 of 140 (24%) samples and was independent of Rai stage of disease. Rb protein was detected in 19 of 23 (83%) samples. Of 4 patients lacking detectable Rb gene expression, only one showed LOH of D13S218. Rb protein levels varied from undetectable to high in samples with or without LOH for D13S218, and the levels were also independent of Rai stage of disease. Our findings support the role of DBM on 13q14, rather than Rb, as the candidate tumor suppressor gene that is frequently targeted for deletion in B-CLL.

Molecular, cellular, and clinical considerations.",1-12,"Glucocorticoids have been included in almost all treatment regimens for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia for decades. However, optimal agents, doses, and/or schedules have yet to be defined despite extensive clinical application. New data on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and molecular mechanisms of action of glucocorticoids have suggested alternative approaches in ALL. These suggest that prolonged, i.e. 28 day, glucocorticoid therapy may be unnecessary as exposure to glucocorticoid induces down-regulation of glucocorticoid receptors. Dexamethasone may be superior to prednisone in conventional equi-effective doses. Blast sensitivity to glucocorticoids correlates closely with sensitivity to other, putatively non-cross-resisting agents and with outcome after multi-agent therapy, suggesting overlapping mechanisms of action, and focusing attention on the determinants of the threshold for apoptosis. Increasing success in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia has led to increasing awareness of avascular necrosis of bone as a potentially disabling sequela of glucocorticoid therapy, especially in adolescent and young adult patients.","['Gaynon, P S', 'Lustig, R H']","['Gaynon PS', 'Lustig RH']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin-Madison 53792-4108, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Child', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/physiology']",,1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199502000-00001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1995 Feb;17(1):1-12. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199502000-00001.,,,141,"['2U10CA05436-28/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R55 CA58044/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, some typical gastric adenocarcinomas were also recently reported to demonstrate EBV relevance. The present study was designed to detect EBV in primary gastric lymphoma, using the in situ hybridization (ISH) method, in which oligonucleotide probes for the EBER1 RNA and the EBV DNA W region have been used. Of the 49 cases of primary gastric lymphoma studied, which all showed B cell immunophenotype, EBER1 sequences could only be found in four cases, including two low-grade cases and two high-grade cases of histological subtypes while the number of positive cells was less than 50% of the tumor cells. In one case of low-grade mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, the EBER1-positive neoplastic cells were found in the regional lymph node, but the primary site of the stomach showed no positive signals. The EBV presence was further confirmed by the EBV DNA ISH. Using the ISH method, rare or occasional positive lymphoid cells (probably non-tumorous bystander cells) could be detected in 10 other cases including all histological subtypes. The present study shows that only a small proportion of primary gastric lymphoma is associated with EBV, and such positive cases could be found in both high- and low-grade histological subtypes. It is also suggested that the EBV presence in the neoplastic cells of some cases of primary gastric lymphoma is most likely a secondary phenomenon.","['Liu, Q', 'Ohshima, K', 'Masuda, Y', 'Kikuchi, M']","['Liu Q', 'Ohshima K', 'Masuda Y', 'Kikuchi M']","['First Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Japan', 'Lymphoma/pathology/*virology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/virology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/pathology/*virology']",,1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1827.1995.tb03433.x [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Int. 1995 Feb;45(2):131-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.1995.tb03433.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients who developed post-transplant complications had significantly higher TNF alpha levels than those without complications (mean 620 pg/ml vs 440 pg/ml, P = 0.04). In particular this effect is associated with patients who developed grade II-IV acute GVHD (mean 960 pg/ml, P < 0.001) and chronic GVHD (mean 724 pg/ml, P = 0.001). High TNF alpha levels were the only statistically significant risk factor for acute GVHD. IL-1 beta and IL-6 levels were not correlated with TNF alpha levels or posttransplantation complications. In multivariate analysis of chronic GVHD, patient age > 17 years and CMV disease were the only statistically significant risk factors. Relapse was associated with low levels of TNF alpha during conditioning (mean 318 pg/ml, P = 0.02). In multivariate analysis, high risk disease was the only factor that correlated with relapse. Low risk patients had significantly higher levels than high risk patients (551 vs 377, P= 0.04). CML and MDS patients had higher TNF alpha levels than acute leukemia patients. There was no difference in TNF alpha levels between patients conditioned with BU/CY and CY/TBI.

GVHD is thought to mediate a beneficial graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect believed to be important for disease-free survival in cancer patients. However, it is uncertain if GVHD and GVL are mediated by unique effector cell populations in the graft. The lack of bone marrow donors for individuals needing HLA-matched, unrelated BMT has recently led to the use of cord blood for transplantation. Cord blood transplantation has generated much enthusiasm because of its very low incidence of GVHD, even in HLA-mismatched situations, owing to intrinsic defects in mature T cell functions. Concerns have arisen, however, as to whether cord blood would mediate a significant GVL activity in vivo in the absence of GVHD, and thus prevent relapse in patients treated for malignancies. In this study in vitro and in vivo assessments have been made of the ability of cord blood to mediate GVL activity, focusing on non-specific effector cell mechanisms. Although minimal non-specific cytotoxic activity is found in freshly isolated cord blood (both NK and LAK cell activity), it is rapidly induced and displays a spectrum of lytic activity similar to adult peripheral blood. The kinetics of LAK cell induction in cord blood as well as the responsiveness to IL-2 stimulation was identical to adult peripheral blood.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Harris, D T']",['Harris DT'],"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Arizona, Tucson 85721, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*blood/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia/*blood/therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1995 Jan;15(1):17-23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifty of these patients (38%) were previously exposed to IFN-alpha for a median duration of 14 months (range, 1 to 61 months), whereas 83 patients (62%) exclusively received hydroxyurea and/or busulfan therapy between 1 and 129 months (median, 15 months) pretransplant. Using the categorized treatment duration with each pretransplant cytoreductive agent as a measure for individual patient exposure to each agent, prolonged ( > 12 months) IFN-alpha administration was identified as the sole significant pretransplant therapy-related predictor of transplant outcome by proportional hazards regression analysis. The adjusted risk ratio (RR) of transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 2.5-fold higher (95% confidence limits [95% CL], 1.4 to 4.5; P < .004) compared with other pretransplant therapy and this was mainly attributable to a 3.1-fold higher RR (95% CL, 1.4 to 6.4; P < .005) of fatal posttransplant infections after prolonged IFN-alpha treatment pretransplant. Marrow graft failure developed exclusively among 7 of 30 patients (23%) with donors other than HLA-identical family members and was further restricted to patients who had been previously exposed to IFN-alpha. The probability of graft failure was 49% +/- 28% in 17 patients pretreated with IFN-alpha compared with 0% for the other 13 patients with mismatched family or unrelated donors (P < .008). In addition, a significant delay in neutrophil and platelet count reconstitution was observed among patients with donors other than HLA-identical family members after pretransplant IFN-alpha exposure. No influence of pretransplant cytoreductive therapy on either acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease or leukemic relapse was detected in this study. As a consequence of its adverse effect on TRM, prolonged pretransplant IFN-alpha treatment was independently associated with a 2.5-fold lower likelihood (95% CL, 1.4 to 4.5; P < .003) of 5-year overall survival and with a 2.3-fold lower likelihood (95% CL, 1.3 to 4.2; P < .004) of 5-year disease-free survival postransplant after adjustment for other significant prognostic factors in multivariate analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Beelen, D W', 'Graeven, U', 'Elmaagacli, A H', 'Niederle, N', 'Kloke, O', 'Opalka, B', 'Schaefer, U W']","['Beelen DW', 'Graeven U', 'Elmaagacli AH', 'Niederle N', 'Kloke O', 'Opalka B', 'Schaefer UW']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital of Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",,1995/05/15 00:00,1995/05/15 00:01,['1995/05/15 00:00'],"['1995/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76475-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 May 15;85(10):2981-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, exogenous NO produced by adding the NO-generator S-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine gave a dose-dependent upregulation of transferrin receptor expression by K562 erythroleukemia cells and increased levels of transferrin receptor mRNA. NO did not affect the affinity of transferrin binding by the transferrin receptor. NO alone did not alter intracellular ferritin levels, but it did abrogate the inhibitory effect of the iron chelator desferrioxamine and potentiated the stimulatory effect of additional iron. NO also caused some increase in ferritin mRNA levels, which might mask any IRP-/IRE-mediated inhibitory effect of NO on ferritin translation. Although NO did not affect net iron uptake, it increased release of iron from K562 cells pulsed previously with 59Fe, and subcellular fractionation showed that it also increased the proportion of intracellular iron bound to ferritin. These findings provide direct evidence that NO can affect cellular iron metabolism and suggest that NO produced in vivo by activated bone marrow macrophages might affect erythropoiesis.","['Oria, R', 'Sanchez, L', 'Houston, T', 'Hentze, M W', 'Liew, F Y', 'Brock, J H']","['Oria R', 'Sanchez L', 'Houston T', 'Hentze MW', 'Liew FY', 'Brock JH']","['Tecnologia de los Alimentos, Facultad de Veterinaria, Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '79032-48-7 (S-Nitroso-N-Acetylpenicillamine)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'GNN1DV99GX (Penicillamine)']",IM,"['Ferritins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/*pharmacology', 'Penicillamine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Transferrin/genetics/*metabolism', 'S-Nitroso-N-Acetylpenicillamine', 'Transferrin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/05/15 00:00,1995/05/15 00:01,['1995/05/15 00:00'],"['1995/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76472-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 May 15;85(10):2962-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recent identification of G1 cyclins that are likely to control both the progression through G0 and G1 phase and the G1/S transition prompted us to study the mRNA expression of D-type cyclins in the peripheral blood lymphocytes from 34 patients with B-CLL, 7 patients with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL), and 2 patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Cyclin D2 mRNA was, on average, 5- to 10-fold overexpressed in most of the samples studied (B-CLL, 29/34; LPL, 7/7; MCL, 0/2) as compared with normal resting B lymphocytes, in which cyclin D2 mRNA was barely detectable. In situ hybridization with cyclin D2 digoxigenin-labeled mRNA probe showed that all the cells from a given sample were stained with approximately the same intensity. Cyclin D3 was never detected in any of the samples tested, whereas cyclin D1 was expressed in only the 3 cases (1 LPL and 2 MCL) bearing a t(11;14) translocation. A trisomy 12 was found in 4 of 19 (21%) B-CLL or LPL cases for which cytogenetic analysis was available. Although the cyclin D2 gene has been mapped to chromosome 12p13, there was no apparent correlation between trisomy 12 and the level of cyclin D2 expression. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry after staining with propidium iodide consistently showed that more than 96% of the cells were in G0/G1 phase, whatever the importance of cyclin D2 overexpression was, and that cyclin D2 overexpression in B-CLL was not associated with any modifications of the cell cycle repartition. No consistent overexpression of cyclin D2 was found in acute myeloid leukemias. In conclusion, overexpression of cyclin D2 mRNA was found to be an almost constant feature in B-CLL and LPL. Therefore, it led us to hypothesize, with the support of data from some transfection experiments previously reported in murine hematopoietic cell lines, that cyclin D2 might play a role in B-CLL pathogenesis, possibly by preventing cells from programmed cell death.","['Delmer, A', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista, F', 'Tang, R', 'Ramond, S', 'Faussat, A M', 'Marie, J P', 'Zittoun, R']","['Delmer A', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista F', 'Tang R', 'Ramond S', 'Faussat AM', 'Marie JP', 'Zittoun R']","['Laboratoire de Cinetique et Culture Cellulaires, Hotel-Dieu, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCND2 protein, human)', '0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Cyclin D2', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4', '*Cyclin-Dependent Kinases', 'Cyclins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/pathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics']",,1995/05/15 00:00,1995/05/15 00:01,['1995/05/15 00:00'],"['1995/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76462-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 May 15;85(10):2870-6.,,['CDK4'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular consequence of a t(5;12) is a fusion between the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-B gene on chromosome 5 and a novel ETS-like gene, TEL, on chromosome 12. We report on three patients with a t(5;12)(q33;p13) diagnosed as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and one case of a t(10;12)(q24;p13) in a progressive MDS, with eosinophilia and monocytosis. Involvement of the TEL gene in these chromosome translocations was investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with cosmid probes containing selectively the 5' end or 3' end of TEL. Hybridization of these cosmids to the der(5)/der(10) or a der(12), respectively, demonstrated a rearrangement of TEL in both translocations, showing that the t(10;12) is a variant translocation of the t(5;12). Cloning of the fusion cDNA of one case of t(5;12) showed that the breakpoint occurred at the RNA level at exactly the same position as reported by Golub et al (Cell 77:307, 1994). In addition, the TEL gene on chromosome 12 could be localized between two probes previously mapped to 12p13, namely PRB1 and D12S178, leading to a better definition of the position of TEL in this chromosome region. Moreover, in the case involving chromosome 10, the breakpoint occurred between cKTN206 and cKTN312/LYT-10 at 10q24. Clinicohematological data in these studies as well as the restriction mapping of chromosomal breakpoints strongly suggest that (1) common features in MDSs involving the TEL gene are monocytosis and eosinophilia, (2) chromosomes other than no. 5 may be involved and at least a t(10;12)(q24;p13) variant chromosome translocation does exist in these MDSs, and (3) both standard and variant 12p/TEL translocations may be identified by FISH with appropriate probes.","['Wlodarska, I', 'Mecucci, C', 'Marynen, P', 'Guo, C', 'Franckx, D', 'La Starza, R', 'Aventin, A', 'Bosly, A', 'Martelli, M F', 'Cassiman, J J']","['Wlodarska I', 'Mecucci C', 'Marynen P', 'Guo C', 'Franckx D', 'La Starza R', 'Aventin A', 'Bosly A', 'Martelli MF', 'Cassiman JJ', 'et al.']","['Center for Human Genetics, University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Aberrations/genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/genetics', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,1995/05/15 00:00,1995/05/15 00:01,['1995/05/15 00:00'],"['1995/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76459-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 May 15;85(10):2848-52.,,"['PDGRFB', 'TEL']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the traditional TRAcP cytochemical stain cannot be performed effectively on sections of paraffin-embedded tissues that are important resources for histopathologic evaluation in diagnosis and treatment of HCL. Wide variation in expression of TRAcP activity by hairy cells (HCs) within and among patients is an interesting biologic phenomenon that has not been explained and can cause some diagnostic uncertainty as well. To solve the problem of staining TRAcP in paraffin sections and to begin to address the questions of variable TRAcP expression in HCL, we developed a monoclonal antibody to TRAcP, 9C5, for immunohistochemical identification of HCs. In smears of blood and bone marrow, immunocytochemistry of TRAcP using 9C5 was as specific but slightly less sensitive than direct cytochemical staining of enzymatic activity. In paraffin sections of spleen and bone marrow from HCL patients, immunohistochemistry with 9C5 stained the HCs with high sensitivity and specificity and clearly showed the characteristic diffuse infiltration by HCs. Other cells noted to stain strongly with 9C5 were occasional macrophages in bone marrow smears and osteoclasts and occasional tissue macrophages in paraffin sections. These are cells known to express abundant TRAcP activity. Immunohistochemistry with anti-TRAcP monoclonal antibody 9C5 may have utility as an added option in the diagnosis of HCL, as a means to evaluate residual disease in HCL patients undergoing new treatments, and as a way to address questions regarding variable expression of TRAcP activity by HCs within and among patients with HCL. Also, 9C5 has potential as a reagent for the immunoassay of bone-derived serum TRAcP in patients with certain bone diseases and cancers with bone metastasis.","['Janckila, A J', 'Cardwell, E M', 'Yam, L T', 'Li, C Y']","['Janckila AJ', 'Cardwell EM', 'Yam LT', 'Li CY']","['Medicine Service, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Louisville, KY 40206, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/*analysis/immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Isoenzymes/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*diagnosis/enzymology', 'Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase']",,1995/05/15 00:00,1995/05/15 00:01,['1995/05/15 00:00'],"['1995/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76457-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 May 15;85(10):2839-44.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its role in the pathogenesis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) has not been studied. Recently, inactivation of this gene was reported in cases of leukemia with monosomy 18. As monosomy 18 is frequently observed in low-grade NHL, we investigated the incidence of altered DCC gene expression in patients with NHL, and correlated it with the number of copies of chromosome 18. Fifteen unselected cases of NHL were studied for evidence of DCC gene expression by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The results were correlated with Southern blot analysis of the DCC gene and with the number of copies of chromosome 18 determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The controls were tissues from normal colon mucosa and normal tonsils. Eight of 15 (53%) NHL cases lacked DCC mRNA, and one expressed substantially less than normal. Southern blot analysis showed normal configuration of the DCC gene in all samples. Two copies of chromosome 18 were found in 9 of 11 samples studied by FISH: one case had a subpopulation of cells with monosomy 18 and one had trisomy 18. All controls expressed DCC. We conclude that DCC gene expression is frequently absent or decreased in NHL and may be involved in the pathogenesis of NHL.

In contrast, oligoclonality as deduced from diversity of T-cell receptor (TcR)-delta gene rearrangements of the immature types (ie, V delta 2-D delta 3, D delta 2-D delta 3) has not been reported, so far. We detected oligoclonality characterized by the coexistence of different junctional regions of identical V delta 2-D delta 3 rearrangements in four childhood precursor B-ALLs. No variation was found in the IgH gene status. Therefore, we define these populations as subclones. Two leukemias displayed the variants in an unequal proportion. In the other two leukemias, for which similar quantities of the coexisting rearrangements were detected, single cell-nuclei polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed two separate leukemic populations. Subclone formation could not be demonstrated by Southern blot hybridization, but was detectable after PCR amplification of the V delta 2-D delta 3 rearrangement and separation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The variants arose independently from each other, as deduced from their individual sequences. Using subclone-specific oligonucleotides for hybridization to amplified DNA obtained at diagnosis and during follow-up from bone marrow samples, we demonstrate, (1) specificity of all subclone-deduced probes, (2) that one residual leukemic cell can be detected in 10(4) to 10(5) normal mononuclear cells in a semiquantitative assay, and (3) that none of the subclones persisted after induction therapy. We propose that in a leukemic cell population, TcR-delta gene diversity arises after rearrangements of the IgH genes resulting in apparent clonality at the IgH gene level. However, cells are oligoclonal, if the TcR-delta gene rearrangements are considered. As various subclones may respond differently to chemotherapy, they may hamper the detection of minimal residual disease. Therefore, we use all subclone-specific oligonucleotides for hybridization to amplified DNA from follow-up samples.","['Ghali, D W', 'Panzer, S', 'Fischer, S', 'Argyriou-Tirita, A', 'Haas, O A', 'Kovar, H', 'Gadner, H', 'Panzer-Grumayer, E R']","['Ghali DW', 'Panzer S', 'Fischer S', 'Argyriou-Tirita A', 'Haas OA', 'Kovar H', 'Gadner H', 'Panzer-Grumayer ER']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St Anna Kinderspital, Clinical Department of Blood Group Serology, University of Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics']",,1995/05/15 00:00,1995/05/15 00:01,['1995/05/15 00:00'],"['1995/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76452-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 May 15;85(10):2795-801.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the HOX4A gene was expressed in erythroleukemia HEL and K562 cells but not in promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. To study the role of the HOX4A gene in erythropoiesis, expression vectors containing the HOX4A gene in the sense or antisense orientation were introduced into HEL cells. The sense transfectants overexpressing the HOX4A gene formed aggregates, which were composed of densely associated cells adhering to tissue-culture dishes, whereas the parental HEL cells and antisense transfectants adhered poorly to the dishes. Furthermore, the sense transfectants overexpressing the HOX4A gene attached more efficiently to fibronectin and collagen than did the antisense transfectants and parental HEL cells. Northern blot analysis showed that integrin beta 3 mRNA levels were significantly increased in the HEL cells overexpressing the HOX4A gene, whereas the integrin beta 1 and alpha IIb mRNA levels did not show a distinct correlation with HOX4A mRNA levels. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis showed that the sense transfectants overexpressing the HOX4A gene expressed increased levels of integrin alpha IIb beta 3 (GP IIb-IIIa) complex as compared with the parental HEL cells and antisense transfectants.

Cytogenetic and molecular studies performed simultaneously on 474 bone marrow and/or blood samples from 300 patients treated with alpha-interferon-based therapy were compared. Molecular results were expressed as the percentage of rearranged BCR bands versus the total scintigraphic signal. The percentage of Ph+ metaphases was calculated on 25 metaphases. The results of molecular studies obtained on both peripheral blood and bone marrow samples were identical. The rank correlation between the BCR quantification and the percentage of Ph positivity in 465 samples was excellent (r = .78). However, of 99 samples with a normal karyotype, 24% had a BCR rearrangement. Of 86 samples with no BCR rearrangement, 13% showed a Ph chromosome. Of 49 samples with partial cytogenetic remission (Ph+ metaphases, 1% to 34%), 23% had no BCR rearrangement. In samples with a minor or no cytogenetic response (Ph+ metaphases, > 34%), BCR analysis overestimated the degree of response in 73 of 326 samples (22%). Nevertheless, survival analysis by BCR quantification level showed statistically better outcome for patients in complete or partial molecular response (P < .01). Molecular quantification of BCR was useful in monitoring the course of Ph+ CML.

Twenty to 40 years often elapse from viral infection to overt ATL, suggesting that other genetic events must occur to produce frank leukemia. The p15 (MTS2) and p16 (CDKN2/MTS1) genes located on chromosome 9p have been implicated as candidate tumor-suppressor genes in several types of tumors. We examined for alterations of these genes in ATL using Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analyses. Both p15 and p16 genes were homozygously deleted in 4 of 23 acute/lymphomatous ATL (17%). An additional 3 (13%) and 4 (17%) acute/lymphomatous samples had hemizygous deletions in at least one exon of p15 and p16, respectively. One of 14 chronic ATL samples had a homozygously deleted p16 gene and another had a hemizygous deletion of p16. Neither homozygous nor hemizygous deletions of the p15 gene were found in chronic ATL. In total, 10 of 37 (27%) ATL samples had loss of the p15 and/or p16 genes. No point mutations of the p15 and p16 genes were found. The ATL patient with a homozygously deleted p16 in the chronic phase rapidly progressed to acute ATL and died within 6 months of the initial diagnosis. One instructive patient had no detectable deletion of the p15 and p16 genes during the chronic phase of ATL but had a homozygous deletions of both genes when she progressed to acute ATL. Our results suggest an association of p15/p16 deletions with development of acute ATL.","['Hatta, Y', 'Hirama, T', 'Miller, C W', 'Yamada, Y', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Hatta Y', 'Hirama T', 'Miller CW', 'Yamada Y', 'Tomonaga M', 'Koeffler HP']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, CA 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', '*Cyclin-Dependent Kinases', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Endopeptidases', 'Gene Deletion', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,1995/05/15 00:00,1995/05/15 00:01,['1995/05/15 00:00'],"['1995/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76439-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 May 15;85(10):2699-704.,,"['MTS1', 'MTS2']",,"['CA42710/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK41936/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK42792/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, advantage has been taken of these M1 variants to investigate the relationship between p53-mediated G1 arrest and apoptosis. Flow cytometric cell cycle analysis has provided evidence that activation of wild-type (wt) p53 function in M1 cells resulted in the induction of G1 growth arrest; this was clearly seen in the M1p53/bcl-2 cells because of the delay in apoptosis that unmasked p53-induced G1 growth arrest. This finding was further corroborated at the molecular level by analysis of the expression and function of key cell cycle regulatory genes in M1p53 versus M1p53/bcl-2 cells after the activation of wt p53 function; events that take place at early times during the p53-induced G1 arrest occur in both the M1p53 and the M1p53/bcl-2 cells, whereas later events occur only in the M1p53/bcl-2 cells, which undergo delayed apoptosis, thereby allowing the cells to complete G1 arrest. Finally, it was observed that a spectrum of p53 target genes implicated in p53-induced growth suppression and apoptosis were similarly regulated, either induced (gadd45, waf1, mdm2, and bax) or suppressed (c-myc and bcl-2), after activation of wt p53 function in M1p53 and M1p53/bcl-2 cells. Taken together, these findings show that wt p53 can simultaneously induce the genetic programs of both G1 growth arrest and apoptosis within the same cell type, in which the genetic program of cell death can proceed in either G1-arrested (M1p53/bcl-2) or cycling (M1p53) cells. These findings increase our understanding of the functions of p53 as a tumor suppressor and how alterations in these functions could contribute to malignancy.","['Guillouf, C', 'Grana, X', 'Selvakumaran, M', 'De Luca, A', 'Giordano, A', 'Hoffman, B', 'Liebermann, D A']","['Guillouf C', 'Grana X', 'Selvakumaran M', 'De Luca A', 'Giordano A', 'Hoffman B', 'Liebermann DA']","['Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (GADD45 protein)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Mdm2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, myc', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mice', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,1995/05/15 00:00,1995/05/15 00:01,['1995/05/15 00:00'],"['1995/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76438-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 May 15;85(10):2691-8.,,"['Waf1', 'bax', 'bcl-2', 'c-myc', 'gadd45', 'mdm2', 'p53']",,"['1RO1CA43618/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1RO1CA51162/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1RO1CA60994/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess the incidence and clinico-biologic correlations of p16 homozygous deletion in hemopoietic tumors, we studied a panel of 244 DNA samples representative of distinct acute (99 cases) and chronic (57 cases) leukemia subtypes, myelodysplastic (22 cases) and myeloproliferative (15 cases) syndromes, and lymphomas (51 cases). A 361-bp probe complementary to the p16 exon 2 gene sequences was generated by polymerase chain reaction and used in Southern blot hybridization against these tumor DNAs. Homozygous deletions of p16 (p16-/-) were detected in 10 of 58 (17%) cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of either B or T lineage and in no other tumors. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of p16 exons 1 and 2 was also performed in 40 of the 58 ALL cases and in 16 lymphomas. In no cases were point mutations detected. The comparison of clinical features at presentation in p16-/- and in p16 germline ALL cases showed a greater leukemic cell mass (P = .001) and higher white blood cell counts (P = .01) in the former group. Two ALL cases in which diagnostic and relapse DNA samples were available showed p16-/- in both specimens. We conclude that homozygous p16 gene deletions characterize a subset of ALL with features of aggressive disease.","['Fizzotti, M', 'Cimino, G', 'Pisegna, S', 'Alimena, G', 'Quartarone, C', 'Mandelli, F', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Lo Coco, F']","['Fizzotti M', 'Cimino G', 'Pisegna S', 'Alimena G', 'Quartarone C', 'Mandelli F', 'Pelicci PG', 'Lo Coco F']","['Department of Human Biopathology, University La Sapienza of Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', '*Cyclin-Dependent Kinases', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Sequence Deletion']",,1995/05/15 00:00,1995/05/15 00:01,['1995/05/15 00:00'],"['1995/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76437-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 May 15;85(10):2685-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The unique amino acid sequences found in these oncogenic fusion proteins represent true tumor-specific antigens that are potentially immunogenic. Although these leukemia-specific fusion proteins have an intracellular location, they might be recognized immunologically by T lymphocytes if peptides derived from the unique sequences are capable of presentation by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on leukemic cells. The ability of a series of synthetic peptides corresponding to the junctional sequences of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)-derived bcr-abl and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)-derived PML-RAR alpha fusion proteins to bind to purified class I molecules was studied. A series of 152 peptides 8, 9, 10, and 11 amino acids in length, spanning the b3a2 and b2a2 breakpoints for CML and PML-RAR alpha A and B breakpoints for APL were analyzed for HLA A1, A2.1, A3.2, A11, A24, B7, B8, and B27 binding motifs. Twenty-one CML peptides and 4 APL peptides were predicted to be potential HLA class I binders. The peptides were tested for binding to appropriate purified HLA molecules in a competition radioimmunoassay. Four peptides derived from b3a2 CML breakpoint bound with high (< 50 nmol/L) or intermediate (< or = 500 nmol/L) affinity to HLA A3, A11, and B8. None of the CML b2a2 or PML-RAR alpha A or B junctional peptides showed affinity of this magnitude for the HLA class I molecules tested. This is the first evidence that tumor-specific breakpoint peptides can bind human MHC class I molecules and provides a rationale for developing a therapeutic vaccine strategy.","['Bocchia, M', 'Wentworth, P A', 'Southwood, S', 'Sidney, J', 'McGraw, K', 'Scheinberg, D A', 'Sette, A']","['Bocchia M', 'Wentworth PA', 'Southwood S', 'Sidney J', 'McGraw K', 'Scheinberg DA', 'Sette A']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/*immunology/metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*immunology/metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Peptides/chemistry/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*immunology/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*immunology', 'Transcription Factors/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,1995/05/15 00:00,1995/05/15 00:01,['1995/05/15 00:00'],"['1995/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76436-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 May 15;85(10):2680-4.,,"['PML', 'RAR&agr;', 'abl', 'bcr']",,"['P01CA64593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA55349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trimetrexate (TMTX), a second-generation folate antagonist, is still active against MTX-transport-resistant cells because it enters cells by passive diffusion and does not use the reduced folate transport system for cell entry. Therefore, although leucovorin (LV) protects MTX-sensitive cells from TMTX toxicity, MTX-transport defective cells are poorly rescued by LV. Severe combined immunodeficiency mice bearing MTX-transport-resistant CCRF-CEM acute lymphoblastic leukemia tumors were treated with TMTX alone or with the combination of TMTX and LV, with tumor regressions in both groups (P < .001) and without significant toxicity. These results indicate that TMTX with LV protection may be a useful therapeutic regimen for patients with MTX-transport-defective acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

These live recombinant vaccine candidates were used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits. Immunization regimens included inoculation of the poxvirus recombinant alone as well as prime/boost protocols using gp63 HTLV-I envelope precursor protein in Alum as the subunit boost. All animals were exposed to an HTLV-I cell-associated challenge (5 x 10(4) cells) from a primary culture of the HTLV-IBOU isolate. The results indicated that two inoculations of the ALVAC-based HTLV-Ienv vaccine candidate protected animals against viral challenge 5 months following the last immunization. However, a combination protocol with ALVAC-env and two additional boosts of gp63 surprisingly failed to confer protection, suggesting that administration of the subunit preparation might be deleterious. Further, in the case of the NYVAC HTLV-Ienv recombinant, protection was afforded as early as 2 months following the first immunization. Last, all the protected animals in the NYVAC and ALVAC trials were challenged 5 months following the initial challenge exposure with 5 ml of blood from an HTLV-IBOU-infected animal, and subsequently became infected. Protection conferred by the attenuated HTLV-Ienv recombinant poxvirus vaccine in the rabbit model might be instrumental for optimizing the immunogenicity of poxvirus-based vaccine candidates against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), particularly because of the need to enhance protection against cell-to-cell transmission.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Franchini, G', 'Tartaglia, J', 'Markham, P', 'Benson, J', 'Fullen, J', 'Wills, M', 'Arp, J', 'Dekaban, G', 'Paoletti, E', 'Gallo, R C']","['Franchini G', 'Tartaglia J', 'Markham P', 'Benson J', 'Fullen J', 'Wills M', 'Arp J', 'Dekaban G', 'Paoletti E', 'Gallo RC']","['Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Vaccines, Synthetic)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/*immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/prevention & control', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/chemistry/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunity', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rabbits', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Time Factors', '*Vaccination', 'Vaccines, Synthetic', '*Viral Vaccines']",,1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/aid.1995.11.307 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1995 Feb;11(2):307-13. doi: 10.1089/aid.1995.11.307.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In BALB/c mice, at least five of these genes are likely to encode a functional class I gene product. Some of these T region products are ubiquitously expressed, while others are expressed by just a few tissues. In the second category, the thymus leukemia (TL) antigen, which is encoded in the T region by T3 and T18 genes, is expressed primarily by intestinal epithelial cells and thymocytes. Inspection of the sequences of the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains, which could encode a peptide binding site in these molecules, indicates that in several cases conserved amino acids important for peptide binding by classical class I molecules are present, suggesting that these nonclassical class I molecules can bind nonamer peptides. On the other hand, analysis of the sequence of the T10d gene product suggests that it can not bind nonamer peptides in a fashion similar to classical class I molecules. Although there are so far no examples of the recognition of defined peptides in the context of T region gene products, there are several examples of T cell recognition of these class I molecules. Both alpha beta and gamma delta T cell receptors are involved in this recognition. Transgenic mice that over express the TL antigen show a variety of abnormalities in thymocyte differentiation and function, providing some support for the hypothesis that this nonclassical class I molecule plays a role in T-cell differentiation. Despite this, the most likely function for T region encoded and other nonclassical class I gene products is a specialized antigen presenting function, perhaps in restricted anatomic sites or to specialized T-cell populations.","['Teitell, M', 'Cheroutre, H', 'Panwala, C', 'Holcombe, H', 'Eghtesady, P', 'Kronenberg, M']","['Teitell M', 'Cheroutre H', 'Panwala C', 'Holcombe H', 'Eghtesady P', 'Kronenberg M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, UCLA 90024.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Crit Rev Immunol,Critical reviews in immunology,8914819,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Tla antigens)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Genes, MHC Class I', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/genetics/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Crit Rev Immunol. 1994;14(1):1-27.,,,170,"['AG 10152/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 52511/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 08042/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mol Pharmacol 45: 578-586, 1994). In order to learn more about this G-protein activation, we studied the effects of histamine and various 2-substituted histamine derivatives in various cell types and on purified G-proteins. In HL-60 cells, histamine and 2-methylhistamine increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in a clemastine-sensitive manner. Phenyl- and thienyl-substituted histamines increased [Ca2+]i as well, but their effects were not inhibited by histamine receptor antagonists. 2-Substituted histamines activated high-affinity GTPase in HL-60 cell membranes in a PTX-sensitive manner, with the lipophilicity of substances increasing their effectiveness. Although HEL cells do not possess histamine receptors mediating rises in [Ca2+]i, 2-(3-bromophenyl)histamine increased [Ca2+]i in a PTX-sensitive manner. It also increased GTP hydrolysis by Gi-proteins in HEL cell membranes. All these stimulatory effects of 2-substituted histamine derivatives were seen at concentrations higher than those required for activation of H1-receptors. In various other cell types and membrane systems, 2-substituted histamine derivatives showed no or only weak stimulatory effects on G-proteins. 2-Substituted histamine derivatives activated GTP hydrolysis by purified bovine brain Gi/Go-proteins and by pure Gi2 (the major PTX-sensitive G-protein in HL-60 and HEL cells). Our data suggest the following: (1) histamine and 2-methylhistamine act as H1-receptor agonists in HL-60 cells; (2) incorporation of bulky and lipophilic groups results in loss of H1-agonistic activity of 2-substituted histamine derivatives in HL-60 cells but causes a receptor-independent G-protein-stimulatory activity; (3) the effects of 2-substituted histamine derivatives on G-proteins are cell-type specific.","['Hageluken, A', 'Grunbaum, L', 'Klinker, J F', 'Nurnberg, B', 'Harhammer, R', 'Schultz, G', 'Leschke, C', 'Schunack, W', 'Seifert, R']","['Hageluken A', 'Grunbaum L', 'Klinker JF', 'Nurnberg B', 'Harhammer R', 'Schultz G', 'Leschke C', 'Schunack W', 'Seifert R']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie, Freie Universitat Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Histamine Agonists)', '0 (Receptors, Histamine)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Histamine/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Histamine Agonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Histamine/drug effects/*metabolism']",,1995/03/30 00:00,1995/03/30 00:01,['1995/03/30 00:00'],"['1995/03/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/30 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(94)00514-M [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(94)00514-m [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1995 Mar 30;49(7):901-914. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(94)00514-m.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These comparisons have shown that DMSO-induced differentiation is associated with downregulation of the delta, epsilon and theta isoforms. High levels of c-myb expression prevent the downregulation of epsilon, but not delta and theta, and also appear to have resulted in lower constitutive levels of PKC alpha.

The identity between the two proteins has been established on the basis of a strong heparin binding affinity and a complete homology in the amino acid sequences of N-terminal region as well as of several tryptic peptides. Furthermore, the cDNA encoding this protein has been isolated from MEL cell mRNA, by means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and its sequence was found to correspond to that of amphoterin.

Unlike previous reports, infection appeared to be possibly endogenous or possibly environmental in origin rather than due to cross infection; the morbidity was low and age was not a determinant for infection. The duration of hospital stay and the primary diagnosis were found to be determinants for infections, those with lymphoid malignancies being at the highest risk. The diagnostic category at greatest risk were those most intensively treated, with protracted neutropenia and prolonged antibiotic exposure.

RESULTS: Of the 158 cultures that were performed, one (1%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0% to 4%) was a true positive; 11 (7%; 95% CI, 3% to 13%) were false positive; 143 (91%; 95% CI, 87% to 95%) were true negative; and three (2%; 95% CI, 1% to 6%) were false negative. Thus, the sensitivity of culture was 0.25, and the specificity was 0.93. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus was the single pathogenic organism that grew, yet was judged to be a contaminant in three episodes. Among the 95 rashes in which fewer than four types of culture were performed, viral culture may have been helpful in one case (1%; 95% CI, 0% to 6%). CONCLUSIONS: Cultures of skin tissue from immunocompromised cancer patients with rashes were often unable to diagnose infection or the absence of infection. Clinical judgement was crucial to the interpretation of culture results.","['Chren, M M', 'Lazarus, H M', 'Salata, R A', 'Landefeld, C S']","['Chren MM', 'Lazarus HM', 'Salata RA', 'Landefeld CS']","['Department of Dermatology, Skin Diseases Research Center, University Hospitals of Cleveland, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Dermatol,Archives of dermatology,0372433,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bacteria/*isolation & purification', 'Bacteriological Techniques', 'Biopsy', 'Female', 'Herpesviridae Infections/diagnosis', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', '*Neoplasms/microbiology/pathology', 'Pyoderma/microbiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Skin Diseases, Bacterial/*microbiology/pathology', 'Skin Diseases, Viral/diagnosis', 'Staphylococcus/isolation & purification', 'Urticaria/*microbiology/pathology']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Dermatol. 1995 May;131(5):552-5.,,,,"['CA14548/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30AR39750/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four IgE myeloma proteins, representing both light-chain types, one chimeric IgE protein, and polyclonal serum IgE blocked the direct binding of FITC-labeled IgE(DES) myeloma protein to KU812 cells in a dose-dependent and nearly equimolar way. Although not as efficiently as human IgE (from five to eight times less on a molar basis), both rat and mouse IgE blocked IgE(DES)-FITC binding to KU812 cells. In sharp contrast, all four human IgG subclasses, both IgA subclasses, and IgM myeloma proteins, as well as monomeric and heat-aggregated polyclonal human IgG, were unable to block significantly IgE(DES)-FITC binding to KU812 cells (< 0.5% on a molar basis). The cytophilic epitope on IgE was heat-susceptible (56 degrees C, 2 h), lost after reduction alkylation, and resident in the papain-derived Fc epsilon-fragment, but not in the papain-derived Fab epsilon- and Fc'epsilon-fragments nor in the pepsin-derived F(ab')2 epsilon- and Fc""epsilon-fragments. Washing and displacement experiments indicated that a major part of IgE reacted with high affinity to KU812 cells. The results indicate that the binding of IgE to KU812 cells is highly specific and involves the classical high-affinity Fc epsilon RI-receptor. Although the density of receptors is low, this human cell line offers a unique model to study IgE/Fc epsilon RI interactions.","['Magnusson, C G', 'Haard, J', 'Matsson, P', 'Karlsson, T', 'Nilsson, K', 'Johansson, S G']","['Magnusson CG', 'Haard J', 'Matsson P', 'Karlsson T', 'Nilsson K', 'Johansson SG']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Allergy,Allergy,7804028,"['0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate/metabolism', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1398-9995.1995.tb02485.x [doi]'],ppublish,Allergy. 1995 Jan;50(1):72-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1398-9995.1995.tb02485.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared to control donors (390 U/ml), CLL patients in average had eight-fold lower levels of TNF bioactivity (50 U/ml). The depressed levels were observed over a wide range of LPS concentrations (0.01 to 10 micrograms/ml). Furthermore, after stimulation with S. aureus bacteria, CLL samples gave three-fold lower levels, as well. TNF levels were not decreased because of defective bioactivity of TNF, since strongly reduced levels of TNF protein were also detected in an immunoassay. Finally, interleukin-6 levels after LPS stimulation were decreased threefold. Flow cytometry analysis with CD14 antibodies demonstrated comparable numbers of monocytes for control donors and CLL patients (698 +/- 802 and 427 +/- 267, respectively). This suggests that deficient cytokine production was not due to a reduction in monocyte number, but rather to a functional impairment. The deficiency in cytokine production observed after ex vivo stimulation of whole blood from CLL patients suggests that in vivo during bacterial infection, CLL patients will exhibit an inappropriate response as well.","['Dahlke, E', 'Schlag, R', 'Langenmayer, I', 'Frankenberger, M', 'Kafferlein, E', 'Subkowski, T', 'Emmerich, B', 'Ziegler-Heitbrock, H W']","['Dahlke E', 'Schlag R', 'Langenmayer I', 'Frankenberger M', 'Kafferlein E', 'Subkowski T', 'Emmerich B', 'Ziegler-Heitbrock HW']","['Institute for Immunology, Klinikum Innenstadt, University of Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Biological Assay', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Monocytes', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Reference Values', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830490113 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1995 May;49(1):76-82. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830490113.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The p56lck gene expression was also investigated in selected cases. The expression pattern of CD45 RA/RO antigen was defined as of RA, mixed, or RO type. All but one CD7+ CD5- CD2- case were of the RA type. The CD7+ CD5+ CD2- prothymic stage included seven RA and one mixed type cases. One CD7+ CD5- CD2+ case was of the RA type, but the other was of the RO type. The CD7+ CD5+ CD2+ prothymic stage included three RA and four mixed type cases. All seven CD3- CD4+ CD8+ (double-positive) thymic cases were of the RO type. The CD3+ CD4+ CD8+ (triple-positive) stage included two RO and three mixed-type cases. One CD3+ CD4+ CD8- late thymic case was of the mixed type. The peripheral stage cases included five RA, three RO, and two mixed type cases. All ATL cases were of the RO type. The expression of p56lck gene in the prothymic stage was less marked than that in the thymic stage. On the basis of these results, the following sequence of pattern of the CD45 RA/RO antigen expression along with T-lineage differentiation was reconstructed: prothymic stage [RA and mixed type]-->double-positive thymic stage [RO type]-->triple-positive thymic stage [RO and mixed type]-->peripheral stage [RA, mixed, and RO type]. While one RO-type CD7+ CD5- CD2- and one RO-type CD7+ CD5- CD2+ cases were not in accord with this sequence, the pattern of CD45 RA/RO antigen expression in most of T-lineage neoplasms could be determined by the respective stage of differentiation. The poor expression of the p56lck gene by the prothymic blasts compared with the thymic blasts may be related to the expression pattern of the CD45 RA/RO molecules, which exhibits phosphatase activity. The consistent RO-type expression in the ATL cases may reflect the activated status of the neoplastic T cells due to the presence of the HTLV-I gene. Alternatively, the target cells for HTLV-I-induced neoplastic transformation may possible be of the RO type.","['Kawano, S', 'Tatsumi, E', 'Yoneda, N', 'Tani, A', 'Nakamura, F']","['Kawano S', 'Tatsumi E', 'Yoneda N', 'Tani A', 'Nakamura F']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kobe University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830490103 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1995 May;49(1):6-14. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830490103.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We treated 19 elderly patients with AML, including seven with a prior myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with a combination of low dose cytarabine, hydroxyurea, and GM-CSF. The percentage of blasts in S-phase was evaluated prior to and 24 hr after starting the GM-CSF infusion. Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry using propidium iodine staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibody to the myeloid antigen CD 33. Seven out of nineteen (37%) achieved a complete remission (CR) and six (31%) a partial remission (PR) for an overall response rate of 68% (13/19). There were three early deaths from infectious complications or organ failure. One patient died from disseminated fungal infection after attaining a PR. The medial overall survival was 9.5 months with a range of 1 to 23+ months. The projected median survival for the patients with de novo AML is greater than 23 months. The percentage of CD 33+ cells in S-phase increased from a mean of 11.6+/-2.7 (SEM) pre GM-CSF to 19.0+/-3.7 (SEM) post GM-CSF (P < 0.001). Patients with prior MDS demonstrated a greater increment (post-pre) in S-phase activity after GM-CSF administration (P = 0.02). There was a correlation between the increase in percent of CD 33+ cells in S-phase and the degree of cytoreduction as determined by the day 14 bone marrow biopsy (r = .78). The toxicity of the regimen was limited to the hematopoietic system. Sixteen out of nineteen patients (84%) and 12/13 (92%) of the responding patients had bone marrow aplasia on day 14. No patients experienced > grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicity. There was no neurologic or cardiac toxicity.

Thirty-three patients (63%) were male, median age 59 (range 16-81) years, 47 patients (90%) were white, and 42 patients (81%) had a performance status of < 2. Myelodysplastic changes were observed in at least 1 cell lineage in all cases, and in 2 cell lineages in 45 of 52 (86%) cases. Fifty percent or more of cases studied were positive for CD11b, CD13, CD15, CD33, glycophorin-A, and HLA-DR markers. Fourteen of 27 cases (52%) in whom karyotypic analyses were conducted had cytogenetic abnormalities. Five (19%) were simple (< 3 karyotypic abnormalities), while 9 (33%) were complex (> or = 3 abnormalities). We observed either a complete or partial loss of chromosomes 5, 7, or 12p, or the presence of trisomy 8, in 11 of 27 (41%) patients. Cases of AML-M6 were divided into group 1 (14 patients with bone marrow proerythroblasts and basophilic erythroblasts > 25% of all erythroblasts) and group 2 (38 patients with proerythroblasts and basophilic erythroblasts < or = 25% of all erythroblasts). We observed no significant differences between groups 1 and 2 in regard to sex, age, race, performance status, percentage of blood erythroblasts or myeloblasts, percentage of bone marrow erythroblasts, and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) or myelodysplasia scores. Six of 6 (100%) patients of group 1, and 7 of 21 (33%) patients of group 2, had normal karyotypes (P = .006). Nine of 13 (69%) patients of group 1 and 15 of 33 (45%) patients of group 2 had a complete remission (CR) (P = .2). Eight of 11 (73%) cytogenetically normal patients achieved CR: 5 of 6 (83%) in group 1, and 3 of 5 (60%) in group 2. Five of 12 (42%) cytogenetically abnormal patients achieved CR. No difference in duration of survival (group 1, median = 4.6 months vs. group 2, median = 10.2 months; P = .93) was observed between the 2 groups.

Host cells were detected by interphase cytogenetics in all patients posttransplant, at times varying from 28-1,825 days, whereas routine analysis detected host cells in only 4 patients, 3 of whom were found to be in relapse. The significance of the persistence of host cells is unknown, but it does not appear to indicate impending relapse.","['Vrazas, V', 'Ooms, L M', 'Rudduck, C', 'Szer, J', 'Campbell, L J', 'Garson, O M']","['Vrazas V', 'Ooms LM', 'Rudduck C', 'Szer J', 'Campbell LJ', 'Garson OM']","[""Victorian Cancer Cytogenetics Service, St. Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia/therapy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosomes, Human', 'Cytogenetics/methods', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/therapy', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Reference Values', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830490104 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1995 May;49(1):15-20. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830490104.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequent cancer experiences in SCC patients were compared with the cancer incidence in the Danish population using ratios of observed cancers to expected cancers as a measure of the relative risk. Overall, patients with SCC were at increased risk of new malignancies (relative risk (RR) = 1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-1.7). Significantly elevated risks were found for cancers of the respiratory organs (RR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.4-2.0); cancers of the lip, buccal cavity, and pharynx (RR = 3.1, 95% CI 2.1-4.5); non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (RR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.4-3.5); leukemia (RR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.7-3.5); malignant melanoma (RR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.5-4.3); and cancer of the small intestine in men (RR = 4.1, 95% CI 1.1-10.6). The risk of new cancers (other than nonmelanoma skin cancers) was higher in patients diagnosed with SCC before the age of 60 years (RR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.5-2.5) than in those diagnosed with SCC at or after that age (RR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.2-1.4). The data confirmed previous strong associations between SCC and malignant melanoma and cancers of the major salivary glands. A previously undocumented significant excess of smoking-related cancers was observed after an SCC diagnosis, suggesting that smoking may be involved in the development of SCC. Since a variety of other squamous cell cancers have already been linked to smoking, the authors speculate that some general effect of smoking might act on all human squamous epithelia. The observed significant associations with lymphoma and leukemia and the high risk of subsequent malignancies in young SCC patients merit further attention.","['Frisch, M', 'Melbye, M']","['Frisch M', 'Melbye M']","['Danish Epidemiology Science Centre, Statens Seruminstitut, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,"['Aged', '*Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/epidemiology', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', '*Skin Neoplasms/epidemiology']",,1995/05/15 00:00,1995/05/15 00:01,['1995/05/15 00:00'],"['1995/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a117358 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 1995 May 15;141(10):916-22. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a117358.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TGF-beta was not demonstrated in marrows with a normal level of reticulin fibrosis; however, TGF-beta was observed within collagen in marrows having collagen fibrosis or increased reticulin fibrosis. The extent of TGF-beta deposition paralleled the severity of fibrosis (P < .0001), and occurred even with normal or reduced numbers of megakaryocytes. Using another TGF-beta antibody, LC(1-30), which detects intracellular TGF-beta, TGF-beta was detected by immunofluorescence in discrete sites in the cytoplasm of immature and mature myeloid and large granular lymphocytic leukemia cells. These sites colocalized with areas detected by an anti-granule antibody (D545) suggesting that TGF-beta was stored in granules. However, neither the TGF-beta mRNA content nor the degree of TGF-beta secretion by these leukemic cells correlated with the extent of TGF-beta deposition in the marrow. Thus, TGF-beta deposition in marrow may contribute to myelofibrosis, but the source of this cytokine in the absence of megakaryocytes requires further study.","['Johnston, J B', 'Dalal, B I', 'Israels, S J', 'Oh, S', 'McMillan, E', 'Begleiter, A', 'Michaud, G', 'Israels, L G', 'Greenberg, A H']","['Johnston JB', 'Dalal BI', 'Israels SJ', 'Oh S', 'McMillan E', 'Begleiter A', 'Michaud G', 'Israels LG', 'Greenberg AH']","['Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, Manitoba Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/*metabolism']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/103.5.574 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1995 May;103(5):574-82. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/103.5.574.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It can occur in immunocompetent as well as immunocompromised recipients. The existence of atypical TA-GVHD that resolves spontaneously and does not exhibit all of the manifestations has been suggested, but there has been to date no documented diagnosis of GVHD supported by evidence of engraftment. CASE REPORT: A female patient presented and was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML:M4), and, after unsuccessful combination chemotherapy, she received a transfusion and developed manifestation of TA-GVHD as well as evidence of chimerism. TA-GVHD was proved by demonstrating Y chromosome-specific genes in the skin by polymerase chain reaction. The manifestations of clinical GVHD abated within 4 months. CONCLUSION: Polymerase chain reaction analysis of Y chromosomes in specimens from female patients is useful in the diagnosis of suspected cases of spontaneously resolving TA-GVHD.","['Mori, S', 'Matsushita, H', 'Ozaki, K', 'Ishida, A', 'Tokuhira, M', 'Nakajima, H', 'Kizaki, M', 'Sugiura, H', 'Kikuchi, A', 'Handa, M']","['Mori S', 'Matsushita H', 'Ozaki K', 'Ishida A', 'Tokuhira M', 'Nakajima H', 'Kizaki M', 'Sugiura H', 'Kikuchi A', 'Handa M', 'et al.']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biopsy', 'DNA/analysis', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Skin/chemistry/pathology', '*Transfusion Reaction', 'Y Chromosome']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1995.35595259155.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 1995 May;35(5):431-5. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1995.35595259155.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Homologous- and cross-desensitization studies using sequential addition of nucleotides showed that the ADP-induced calcium response in HEL cells was mediated mainly by purinoceptor(s) for which ADP but not ATP was an agonist. There were also minor contributions from purinoceptors for which ATP and ADP are both agonists (probably P2U and P2Y). ATP inhibited the ADP-induced calcium response in HEL cells. This inhibition was overcome by raising the ADP concentration, thus indicating that ATP was an antagonist for the HEL cell ADP receptor. AMP was also an antagonist, albeit weak, for the HEL cell ADP receptor. Antagonism of the ADP-induced calcium response by ATP was similarly observed in MEG-01 cells, another human megakaryocyte-like cell line, but not in 293 cells, a nonhematopoietic cell line. These studies suggest that HEL cells express an ADP receptor for which ATP and AMP are antagonists. This characteristic of the HEL cell ADP receptor is also displayed by the platelet P2T receptor.

This article presents a discussion of suffering as a possible meaning of cancer for patients and family members. Suffering is addressed in the context of its definition as an experience of the whole person. First, to illustrate suffering, a narrative of a young man treated for leukemia with bone marrow transplantation is presented. The narrative focuses on the man's suffering as he struggles to make meaning of what has happened to him, a struggle that ends with his death. The second part of the article presents eight aphorisms or succinct principles of suffering. Each aphorism is discussed with examples from the case narrative and related literature.","['Kahn, D L', 'Steeves, R H']","['Kahn DL', 'Steeves RH']","['School of Nursing, University of Texas, Austin 78701, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Semin Oncol Nurs,Seminars in oncology nursing,8504688,,IM,"['Adult', 'Attitude to Death', 'Family/psychology', '*Grief', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/psychology', '*Life Change Events', 'Male', 'Mental Processes', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Pain/*psychology']",,1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0749-2081(95)80037-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0749-2081(95)80037-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol Nurs. 1995 Feb;11(1):9-16. doi: 10.1016/s0749-2081(95)80037-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regaining a belief in a comprehensible world often begins with the confirmation of a definitive diagnosis and the initiation of therapy. The meaning of therapy will vary depending on the availability of viable treatment options, the natural history of cancer, the daily challenges of living with cancer, and the outcome of treatment. This article reviews the literature on the meaning of cancer therapy, explanatory models of therapy, and the meaning of personal control during treatment. A qualitative study of 23 adults with leukemia who were waiting to undergo a bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was conducted to describe the personal meaning of leukemia and BMT. The findings indicate that seeking confirmation for the diagnosis of leukemia is often impersonal, fraught with uncertainty, and surrounded by an unexplained sense of urgency. When making the decision to undergo BMT, people transformed the biomedical estimates of survival into personal terms to humanize the odds and to inflate their perceived chances of survival. Before undergoing BMT, individuals recalled their previous experiences with cancer therapy in an effort to make the unknown future more predictable. Ways to self-monitor daily progress and suggestions for mitigating the devastating effects of bad news were identified. Physicians were identified as controlling the BMT treatment regimen, whereas nurses were perceived as controlling the daily care routines. Implications include the need to give patients preparatory information about what to expect in therapy as well as the need to help them identify how they can cope effectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Haberman, M']",['Haberman M'],"['Oncology Nursing Society, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol Nurs,Seminars in oncology nursing,8504688,,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', '*Attitude to Health', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Internal-External Control', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*psychology/*therapy', 'Philosophy', 'Quality of Life']",,1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0749-2081(95)80039-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0749-2081(95)80039-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol Nurs. 1995 Feb;11(1):23-31. doi: 10.1016/s0749-2081(95)80039-5.,,,36,"['1F31 NU05698-01/NU/BHP HRSA HHS/United States', 'CA09472-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective. SETTING: Children's Health Care-Minneapolis hematology/oncology inpatient ward and outpatient clinic. PATIENTS: Ten immune-compromised children (mean +/- SD age 7.4 +/- 4.0 yrs, weight 31.6 +/- 25.9 kg) with leukemia or other hematologic disease. INTERVENTIONS: Serum was sampled before and after a single 6-mg/kg intravenous dose and after seven oral 3-mg/kg doses of fluconazole. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mean (SD) pharmacokinetics were distribution half-life 1.67 (1.25) hours, elimination half-life 15.62 (3.21) hours, total body clearance 0.63 (0.19) ml/min/kg, volume of distribution for the central compartment 0.56 (0.10) L/kg, volume of distribution at steady state 0.77 (0.12) L/kg, absorption half-life 0.41 (0.26) hour, and oral bioavailability 0.92 (0.09). Volume of distribution for the central compartment was highly correlated with body surface area (r2 = 0.891) and weight (r2 = 0.949). Volume of distribution at steady state correlated with body surface area (r2 = 0.986), and total body clearance correlated with body surface area (r2 = 0.867). CONCLUSIONS: Fluconazole elimination was well described using a two-compartment model. Oral absorption was rapid and nearly complete. Children have a larger volume of distribution for the central compartment and faster elimination rate than adults. Body surface area and weight are important factors in determining pharmacokinetics in these patients.","['Seay, R E', 'Larson, T A', 'Toscano, J P', 'Bostrom, B C', ""O'Leary, M C"", 'Uden, D L']","['Seay RE', 'Larson TA', 'Toscano JP', 'Bostrom BC', ""O'Leary MC"", 'Uden DL']","[""Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Children's Health Care-Minneapolis, MN 55404, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,['8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)'],IM,"['Absorption', 'Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Biological Availability', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Half-Life', 'Hematologic Diseases/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Prospective Studies']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 1995 Jan-Feb;15(1):52-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell adhesion molecules CD11a/CD18, CD11b/CD18, CD29, and CD54 do not appear to be mediating VES-induced cell adhesion. HL-60 cells treated with VES adhere to fibronectin-coated plastic and secrete elevated levels of fibronectin. A 72-kDa fibronectin-binding membrane molecule was detected on VES-treated HL-60 cells, and antibodies to fibronectin were shown to inhibit VES-induced cell aggregation.

In the nervous system LIF affects neuronal differentiation, and may be important during cerebral infection and inflammation. To clarify the cellular source of LIF in the brain, we examined the expression of LIF mRNA by primary cortical astrocyte cultures and an immortalized microglial cell line. The microglial cell line did not express LIF mRNA in response to pro-inflammatory agents such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that induced expression of other cytokine mRNAs. In contrast, primary astrocyte cultures grown in serum-containing medium expressed LIF mRNA constitutively, and this expression was regulated by pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory stimuli. Agents which activate the cAMP and protein kinase C second messenger systems also increased LIF mRNA in astrocyte cultures. These results suggest that astrocytes, but not microglia, may be an important source of LIF during cerebral inflammation and infection.","['Murphy, G M Jr', 'Song, Y', 'Ong, E', 'Lee, Y L', 'Schmidt, K G', 'Bocchini, V', 'Eng, L F']","['Murphy GM Jr', 'Song Y', 'Ong E', 'Lee YL', 'Schmidt KG', 'Bocchini V', 'Eng LF']","['Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305-5485, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Neurosci Lett,Neuroscience letters,7600130,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/*metabolism', 'Autoradiography', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Inflammation', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microglia/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics']",,1995/01/16 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/01/16 00:00'],"['1995/01/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/01/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['030439409411165F [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3940(94)11165-f [doi]']",ppublish,Neurosci Lett. 1995 Jan 16;184(1):48-51. doi: 10.1016/0304-3940(94)11165-f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have employed nitrogen mustard resistant B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) as a clinically relevant model to study this phenomenon. Resistance in B-CLL is associated with enhanced repair of nitrogen mustard crosslinks. In order to identify the repair pathway responsible for nitrogen mustard resistance, lymphocytes were screened for cross-resistance to a variety of DNA damaging agents. The MTT assay was used to measure the resistance of B-CLL lymphocytes to various DNA damaging agents, including nitrogen mustards, UV light, methyl methanesulfonate, and mitomycin C. We have shown that B lymphocytes from patients with nitrogen mustard resistant chronic lymphocytic leukemia reflect their clinical status. This assay allows us to classify lymphocytes as nitrogen mustard sensitive or resistant, based on in vitro observations. The resistant population was 5.6 and 4.1 fold more resistant to the nitrogen mustard analogs, chlorambucil and melphalan, respectively. Resistant lymphocytes displayed no increased resistance to either methyl methanesulfonate or UV light, indicating that neither classical base nor nucleotide excision repair is rate-limiting in resistance. Resistant lymphocytes were 6.0 and 2.2 fold more resistant to mitomycin C and cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II), respectively, suggesting enhanced crosslink repair. Neither glutathione nor glutathione S-transferase levels correlated with resistance. The development of nitrogen mustard drug resistance in B-CLL appears to be associated with cross-resistance to other bifunctional alkylating agents which produce interstrand crosslinks. Our results indicate that resistance to nitrogen mustards in chronic lymphocytic leukemia is associated with enhanced repair of DNA crosslinks which may involve a recombination dependent system.

The nuclear activity of NF-kappa B is tightly regulated from the cytoplasmic compartment by an inhibitory subunit called I kappa B alpha. This cytoplasmic inhibitor is rapidly phosphorylated and degraded in response to a diverse set of NF-kappa B-inducing agents, including T-cell mitogens, proinflammatory cytokines, and viral transactivators such as the Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1. To explore these I kappa B alpha-dependent mechanisms for NF-kappa B induction, we identified novel mutants of I kappa B alpha that uncouple its inhibitory and signal-transducing functions in human T lymphocytes. Specifically, removal of the N-terminal 36 amino acids of I kappa B alpha failed to disrupt its ability to form latent complexes with NF-kappa B in the cytoplasm. However, this deletion mutation prevented the induced phosphorylation, degradative loss, and functional release of I kappa B alpha from NF-kappa B in Tax-expressing cells. Alanine substitutions introduced at two serine residues positioned within this N-terminal regulatory region of I kappa B alpha also yielded constitutive repressors that escaped from Tax-induced turnover and that potently inhibited immune activation pathways for NF-kappa B induction, including those initiated from antigen and cytokine receptors. In contrast, introduction of a phosphoserine mimetic at these sites rectified this functional defect, a finding consistent with a causal linkage between the phosphorylation status and proteolytic stability of this cytoplasmic inhibitor. Together, these in vivo studies define a critical signal response domain in I kappa B alpha that coordinately controls the biologic activities of I kappa B alpha and NF-kappa B in response to viral and immune stimuli.","['Brockman, J A', 'Scherer, D C', 'McKinsey, T A', 'Hall, S M', 'Qi, X', 'Lee, W Y', 'Ballard, D W']","['Brockman JA', 'Scherer DC', 'McKinsey TA', 'Hall SM', 'Qi X', 'Lee WY', 'Ballard DW']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-0295, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Serine/chemistry', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelA', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC230512,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.15.5.2809 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1995 May;15(5):2809-18. doi: 10.1128/MCB.15.5.2809.,,,,['R01 AI33839/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During this differentiation process, the levels of c-myb expression decline, suggesting that the RA receptor (RAR) may act in part by down-regulating this proto-oncogene. We have now investigated whether the RAR can also inhibit the function of Myb proteins themselves. We have found that transcriptional activation of a Myb-responsive reporter gene can be inhibited by RA in a human monocytic cell line. This inhibition could not be overcome by the expression of exogenous Myb. The RAR did not interfere with DNA binding by Myb proteins in vitro, suggesting that the functional inhibition occurs at the level of transcriptional activation. To determine the biological relevance of the inhibition of Myb proteins by the RAR, we have used v-myb-transformed monoblasts. These cells differentiate into macrophages in the presence of phorbol ester (tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate [TPA]) but are normally unresponsive to RA treatment. The introduction of an inducible, exogenous RAR alpha into v-myb-transformed monoblasts permitted an RA-dependent differentiation into macrophage-like cells similar to those induced by TPA. These results demonstrate that transformation by v-myb is recessive to RAR alpha and imply that many types of non-RA-responsive leukemia cells may become responsive following the introduction of the RAR.","['Smarda, J', 'Sugarman, J', 'Glass, C', 'Lipsick, J']","['Smarda J', 'Sugarman J', 'Glass C', 'Lipsick J']","['Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-myb)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins v-myb', '*Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Quail', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', '*Transformation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",PMC230477,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.15.5.2474 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1995 May;15(5):2474-81. doi: 10.1128/MCB.15.5.2474.,,['v-myb'],,"['R01 CA43592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 TW00291/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a means of identifying potential cis- and trans-acting elements which stabilize an individual mRNA, naturally occurring mutations that decreased stability of the normally long-lived globin mRNA were analyzed. Our previous studies demonstrated that a subset of mutations which allowed the translating ribosome to read through into the alpha 2-globin 3' nontranslated region (NTR) targeted the mutant mRNAs for accelerated turnover in erythroid cells but not in several nonerythroid cell lines (I. M. Weiss and S. A. Liebhaber, Mol. Cell. Biol. 14:8123-8132, 1994). These results suggested that translational readthrough interfered with some feature of the alpha 2-globin 3' NTR required for message stability in erythroid cells. To define the cis-acting sequences which comprise this erythroid cell-specific stability determinant, scanning mutagenesis was performed on the alpha 2-globin 3' NTR, and the stability of each mutant mRNA was examined during transient expression. Three cytidine-rich regions which are required for longevity of the alpha 2-globin mRNA were identified. However, in contrast to the readthrough mutations, base substitutions in these elements destabilize the message through a translation-independent mechanism. To account for these results, we propose that the cis-acting elements form a complex or determinant in the normal alpha 2-globin mRNA which protects the message from degradation in erythroid cells. Disruption of this determinant, by translational readthrough or because mutations in an element prevent or inhibit its formation, targets the message for accelerated turnover in these cells.","['Weiss, I M', 'Liebhaber, S A']","['Weiss IM', 'Liebhaber SA']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Drug Stability', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC230475,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.15.5.2457 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1995 May;15(5):2457-65. doi: 10.1128/MCB.15.5.2457.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The constitutive activation of the JAK2 protein kinase in these mutants confirms that signaling occurs through the truncated receptor protein. Noteworthily, in addition to a 10-kb deletion in the beta C-R subunit gene encoding the truncated receptor, several secondary and independent mutations that result in the deletion or functional inactivation of the allelic beta C-R subunit and the closely related beta IL3-R subunit genes were observed in both mutants, suggesting that such mutations are necessary for the full oncogenic penetrance of the truncated beta C-R subunit. Reversion of these mutations by the expression of the wild-type beta C-R in the two mutants resulted in a fivefold decrease in cloning efficiency of the mutants in the absence of IL3, confirming a functional interaction between the wild-type and truncated proteins. Furthermore, expression of the truncated beta C-R subunit in factor-dependent myeloid cells did not immediately render the cells autonomous but increased the spontaneous frequency to factor-independent growth by 4 orders of magnitude.

We report here the functional analyses of AML1/Evi-1. It was revealed that AML1/Evi-1 itself does not alter the transactivation level through mouse polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein 2 (PEBP2; PEA2) sites (binding site of AML1) but dominantly suppresses the transactivation by intact AML1, which is assumed to be a stimulator of myeloid cell differentiation. DNA-binding competition is a putative mechanism of such dominant negative effects of AML1/Evi-1 because it binds to PEBP2 sites with higher affinity than AML1 does. Furthermore, AML1/Evi-1 stimulated c-fos promoter transactivation and increased AP-1 activity, as Evi-1 (which is not normally expressed in hemopoietic cells) did. Experiments using deletion mutants of AML1/Evi-1 showed that these two functions are mutually independent because the dominant negative effects on intact AML1 and the stimulation of AP-1 activity are dependent on the runt domain (DNA-binding domain of AML1) and the zinc finger domain near the C terminus, respectively. Furthermore, we showed that AML1/Evi-1 blocks granulocytic differentiation, otherwise induced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, of 32Dcl3 myeloid cells. It was also suggested that both AML1-derived and Evi-1-derived portions of the fusion protein play crucial roles in this differentiation block.

A comparison of the bovine and human amino acid sequences predicts significant similarity, including the four-alpha-helical-bundle structure and the placement of disulfide bridges. As with the human protein, bovine oncostatin M binds specific receptors on human H2981 cells and inhibits the proliferation of human A375 tumor cells and mouse M1 leukemia cells. To identify activities regulated in vivo, we injected bovine oncostatin M fusion genes containing various tissue-specific promoters into mouse embryos. The frequencies of transgenic mice were reduced significantly, suggesting that overexpression of the bovine cytokine is detrimental to normal mouse development.

The nervous system as an end target organ figures prominently in the constellation of diseases associated with HTLV and HIV infection and numerous syndrome complexes have been recognized that reflect dysfunction of the brain, spinal cord, nerve roots, peripheral nerves, or muscle. HAM/TSP, associated with HTLV-I and rarely with HTLV-II infections, and encephalomyelitis, associated with HIV infection, may present with clinical, laboratory, neuroelectrophysiologic, and neuroimaging features closely resembling MS. A careful systematic search for associated disease processes and review of the medical history, however should raise the suspicion of possible retroviral infection. In the appropriate setting, because of the pleiotropy in disease expression and the high prevalence of retroviral infection in many areas of the United States, clinicians should have a low threshold for ordering diagnostic testing for HIV and HTLV when considering a retroviral cause for a neurologic disorder. The retroviruses are pervasive throughout the vertebrate subphylum and share common elements within their genome that encode for promoters and structural proteins and are distinguished from each other by sets of transactivating and regulating genes. The latter group of genes serve to regulate viral replication by the induction and post-transcriptional and post-translational modification of retrovirally encoded gene products. In addition, the transactivating gene products can activate and upregulate the expression of a variety of host cellular genes, many of which possess immune-related functions. The viral particle or specific components of certain viral structural proteins may be directly toxic to neural tissues. Also, during the replicative phase, retroviruses are recognized by host defense mechanisms, which mount considerable cellular and humoral immune responses. The spectrum of retroviral-associated neurologic diseases therefore may represent a complex interaction among viral antigen-induced immunity, the production of neurotoxic viral peptides, and the abnormal induction and expression of cellular genes with potent bioactivity.","['Greenberg, S J']",['Greenberg SJ'],"['Department of Neurology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Neurol Clin,Neurologic clinics,8219232,,IM,"['HIV Infections/complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/complications', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*etiology', 'Nervous System Diseases/*etiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*complications']",,1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neurol Clin. 1995 Feb;13(1):75-97.,,,155,['857-0495A/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This pharmacokinetic study was performed to determine if administration of ATRA on an intermittent schedule could overcome the rapid decrease in plasma drug concentration and provide repetitive periods of higher plasma drug exposure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ATRA was administered on repetitive cycles of 7 consecutive days of drug followed by 7 days without drug. On the days of pharmacokinetic monitoring, following an overnight fast, a fixed single oral dose of 40 mg/m2 was administered and frequent plasma samples were obtained over 8 hours. Patients had pharmacokinetic studies performed on the first and seventh days of the first week, and on the first day of the third and eleventh weeks. ATRA was measured in plasma with a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay. RESULTS: Plasma exposure to ATRA as measured by the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) decreased significantly during the first week of drug administration, from a mean of 145 +/- 26 mumol/L.min on day 1 to 18 +/- 4 mumol/L.min by day 7. Plasma ATRA concentrations at the start of weeks 3 and 11 of this every-other-week schedule were equivalent to those achieved on day 1 of treatment, with mean AUCs of 177 +/- 39 and 128 +/- 30 mumol/L.min, respectively. CONCLUSION: An intermittent schedule of ATRA administration results in repetitive periods of exposure to concentrations of ATRA normally only observed on the first day of treatment.

The Anticancer Drug Screen of the National Cancer Institute uses 60 cell lines to identify new agents. Expression of mdr-1/P-glycoprotein was measured by quantitative PCR. Expression was detected in 39 cell lines; the highest levels were in renal and colon carcinomas. Expression was also detected in all melanomas and central nervous system tumors, but in only one ovarian carcinoma and one leukemia cell line. Using a modified version of the COMPARE program, a high correlation was found between expression of mdr-1 and cellular resistance to a large number of compounds. Evidence that these compounds are P-glycoprotein substrates includes: (a) enhancement of cytotoxicity by verapamil; (b) demonstration of cross-resistance in a multidrug-resistant cell line, (c) ability to antagonize P-glycoprotein, increasing vinblastine accumulation by decreasing efflux; and (d) inhibition of photoaffinity labeling by azidopine. Identification of many heretofore unrecognized compounds as substrates indicates that P-glycoprotein has a broader substrate specificity than previously recognized.

Biological activities and binding to the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor/gp130 signaling complex.,10915-22,"Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) is a newly isolated cytokine that was identified based on its ability to induce cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. It is a member of the family of cytokines that includes interleukins-6 and -11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ciliary neurotrophic factor, and oncostatin M. These cytokines induce a pleiotropic set of growth and differentiation activities via receptors that use a common signaling subunit, gp130. In this work we determine the activity of CT-1 in six in vitro biological assays and examine the composition of its cell surface receptor. We find that CT-1 is inactive in stimulating the growth of the hybridoma cell line, B9 and inhibits the growth of the mouse myeloid leukemia cell line, M1. CT-1 induces a phenotypic switch in rat sympathetic neurons and promotes the survival of rat dopaminergic and chick ciliary neurons. CT-1 also inhibits the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. CT-1 and LIF cross-compete for binding to M1 cells, Kd [CT-1] approximately 0.7 nM, and this binding is inhibited by an anti-gp130 monoclonal antibody.

In addition, CT-1 binds directly to a purified, soluble form of the LIF receptor in solution (Kd approximately 2 nM).

These cases were reclassified according to Birch's classification and the survival rate of each diagnostic group was calculated by Kaplan-Meier methods. Death certificate-only cases, which amounted to 3.9% of all incidence, were excluded from the calculation. The five-year cumulative survival rate for both sexes was 46% for all cancer children. Among 12 major diagnostic groups, the most favorable survival was seen in retinoblastoma (87.5%), followed by renal tumors, epithelial neoplasms, and gonadal and germ-cell tumors. The outcome was unfavorable in leukemias, sympathetic nervous system tumors, hepatic tumors and malignant bone tumors. Comparing the survival in 1975-1979 with that in 1980-1984, the rate for all childhood cancer rose from 41% to 51%. Improvement in survival was also observed in 4 groups; acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and osteosarcoma. One attributable factor for the rise of survival was proved to be improvement of medical treatment by Cox's hazard model analysis. Comparison of survival rates in Osaka with those in England and the U.S. revealed that the prognosis for acute lymphocytic leukemia and acute non-lymphocytic leukemia was less favorable in Osaka than in England and the U.S.","['Ajiki, W', 'Hanai, A', 'Tsukuma, H', 'Hiyama, T', 'Fujimoto, I']","['Ajiki W', 'Hanai A', 'Tsukuma H', 'Hiyama T', 'Fujimoto I']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology, Center for Adult Diseases, Osaka.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England', 'Eye Neoplasms/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Registries', 'Retinoblastoma/mortality', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'United States']",PMC5920574,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['091050509592216X [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1995.tb02982.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1995 Jan;86(1):13-20. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1995.tb02982.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is normally expressed at high levels on immature thymocytes and at moderate levels on gut epithelium and activated mature T cells. A promoter/enhancer region unique among class I genes accounts for this narrow range of tissue distribution. Like most other class I molecules, TL is dependent upon endogenous beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m) for transport to the surface. However, here we show that unlike most other MHC class I molecules, TL is expressed efficiently in the absence of functional transporter associated with antigen processing subunit 2 (TAP2). A putative fourth TLa gene cloned from A.SL1 cells was expressed in RMA and RMA-S cells. In bulk transformants, TL expression is higher in TAP2-RMA-S cells than in wild-type RMA cells, and is not elevated by incubation at reduced temperatures or exposure to exogenous beta 2m. Analysis of immunoprecipitated molecules by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate indicates that TL is processed normally in RMA-S cells and is associated with beta 2m both intracellularly and at the cell surface. However, TL heavy chains expressed on the cell surface in the absence of TAP2 are cleaved to a predominant 38 kDa fragment, presumably the result of an altered conformation that renders TL more susceptible to proteolysis. These results suggest that while TL may normally acquire TAP2-dependent peptides, this class I-b molecule does not require them for efficient export to, and stable expression at the cell surface.","['Rodgers, J R', 'Mehta, V', 'Cook, R G']","['Rodgers JR', 'Mehta V', 'Cook RG']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 3)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tap2 protein, mouse)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 3', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/analysis', 'Animals', '*Antigen Presentation', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasmids', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymoma/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*metabolism/pharmacology']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830250421 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1995 Apr;25(4):1001-7. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830250421.,,,,"['AL-17897/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA-54439/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These receptors have been shown to trigger the release of serotonin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [Daeron, M., Latour, S., Huckel, C., Bonnerot, C. & Fridman, W. H.

Using a transfection model where the cDNA encoding mFc gamma RIII was stably transfected into the rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3, we found that the functional efficiency of mFc gamma RIII is correlated with its ability to increase the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and to stimulate inositol phosphate metabolism. The deletion of intracellular sequences of the alpha subunit did not alter the ability of mFc gamma RIII to trigger the Ca2+ and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2] response. After substitution of the intracellular domain of mFc gamma RIII for that of mFc gamma RIII gamma, but not that of mFc gamma RIII alpha, the chimeric receptor was also able to trigger Ca2+ and PtdIns(4.5)P2 responses. In contrast, all transfected receptors induced protein kinase C translocation. Furthermore, dimerization of the receptor was sufficient for the initiation of this protein kinase C translocation while a further crosslinking was necessary for the induction of the Ca2+ and PtdIns(4,5)P2 responses. Protein kinase C translocation therefore can be dissociated from Ca2+ mobilization, PtdIns(4,5)P2 turnover and mast cell secretory responses induced by murine Fc gamma RIII.","['Altrichter, J', 'Guse, A H', 'Resch, K', 'Brock, J', 'Daeron, M', 'Huckel, C']","['Altrichter J', 'Guse AH', 'Resch K', 'Brock J', 'Daeron M', 'Huckel C']","['Institut fur Medizinische Biochemie, Universitat Rostock, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Hydrolysis', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgG/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/03/15 00:00,1995/03/15 00:01,['1995/03/15 00:00'],"['1995/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1995.0587m.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1995 Mar 15;228(3):587-95. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1995.0587m.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The iv injection of 10(7) HSB-2 cells was associated with a universally fatal leukemia. Histopathological examination of animals revealed the spread of leukemia initially from bone marrow to involve all major organs including the meninges. An immunotoxin (HB2-Sap) was constructed by conjugating the anti-CD7 monoclonal antibody (MAb) HB2 to the ribosome inactivating protein (RIP) saporin. An in vitro protein synthesis inhibition assay revealed specific delivery of HB2-Sap immunotoxin (IT) to CD7+ HSB-2 target cells with an IC50 of 4.5 pM. In an in vivo study, the IT was shown to significantly prolong the survival of SCID mice injected with HSB-2 cells compared to untreated control animals. This therapeutic effect was seen both with a single injection of 10 micrograms of IT given 7 d after the injection of HSB-2 cells, and was even more effective when IT was administered as three daily injections of 10 micrograms on d 7, 8, and 9.

Lymphocytes from patients with nitrogen mustard resistant B-CLL displayed a fivefold increase in resistance to melphalan in vitro as compared to those from untreated patients concordant with our definition of clinical resistance. We have performed Northern analysis using a cohort consisting of 11 untreated and 12 treated-resistant patients. Increased expression of ERCC-1 was not found to be associated with nitrogen mustard resistance, nor did we find altered expression of the DNA repair enzymes: ERCC-2, DNA polymerase beta, or topoisomerase I. There was also no difference in the levels of ERCC-1 protein between melphalan sensitive and resistant B-CLL lymphocytes. Analysis of genes involved in nitrogen mustard detoxification revealed that metallothionein was weakly expressed, while transcripts encoding glutathione-S-transferase alpha were undetectable. Thus, it is unlikely either of these proteins plays a role in the resistance. The results of the cytotoxicity assay validate the use of B-CLL as a model to study nitrogen mustard resistance. This model allows us to perform in vitro studies using a tumor which develops resistance in vivo. The results of this study suggest that nucleotide excision repair, as represented by ERCC-1 and ERCC-2, is not the limiting step in B-CLL nitrogen mustard resistance.","['Bramson, J', 'McQuillan, A', 'Panasci, L C']","['Bramson J', 'McQuillan A', 'Panasci LC']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research of the Sir Mortimer B.

A Pediatric Oncology Group pilot study.,2623-31,"BACKGROUND: This trial evaluated the toxicity and preliminary efficacy of a repeated oral low dose (LD) methotrexate schedule with intravenous mercaptopurine infusions as intensification therapy for children with lower risk B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS. From December 1986 to January 1991, 96 children with newly diagnosed, lower risk ALL were enrolled. Vincristine, L-asparaginase, and prednisone were used for remission induction. Age-based methotrexate was administered intrathecally (IT) for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis. An outpatient-based intensification treatment included LD methotrexate 30 mg/M2 every 6 hours for 5 doses, followed by intravenous mercaptopurine 1000 mg/M2 for 6 hours every 2 weeks for 12 courses. Leucovorin rescue was administered 48 hours after methotrexate treatment was begun. Maintenance therapy included standard daily oral mercaptopurine, weekly intramuscular methotrexate, and IT methotrexate every 12 weeks, for 2 years. RESULTS: All patients had disease remission. Thirty-two patients relapsed; there were 17 isolated bone marrow relapses, 10 isolated CNS relapses, 2 isolated testicular relapses, 1 marrow plus CNS relapse, 1 marrow plus testicular relapse, and 1 CNS plus testicular relapse. Event free survival (EFS) at 4 years was 66% (standard error, 7%) by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Complications associated with LD methotrexate/mercaptopurine courses were few and resulted in hospital readmissions in 2.4% of courses. Two patients were unable to comply with the oral LD methotrexate schedule and received intravenous methotrexate. Three patients were unable to complete scheduled maintenance because of hepatic or hematopoietic dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Low dose methotrexate/mercaptopurine can be administered safely on an outpatient basis to children with lower risk B-lineage ALL. However, there was a higher than expected incidence of bone marrow and CNS relapse. The reasons for this outcome were not completely clear but raise the possibility that LD methotrexate therapy may be less effective in preventing relapse than are higher dose, parenteral methotrexate regimens.","['Mahoney, D H Jr', 'Camitta, B M', 'Leventhal, B G', 'Shuster, J J', 'Civin, C J', 'Ganick, D J', 'Lauer, S J', 'Steuber, C P', 'Kamen, B A']","['Mahoney DH Jr', 'Camitta BM', 'Leventhal BG', 'Shuster JJ', 'Civin CJ', 'Ganick DJ', 'Lauer SJ', 'Steuber CP', 'Kamen BA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,1995/05/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/05/15 00:00'],"['1995/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19950515)75:10<2623::aid-cncr2820751033>3.0.co;2-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1995 May 15;75(10):2623-31. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19950515)75:10<2623::aid-cncr2820751033>3.0.co;2-y.,,,,"['CA-03161/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-30969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comprehensive clinicopathologic studies including virologic and in vitro culture with inducing agents.,2474-83,"BACKGROUND: A 63-year-old male presented with fever, a subcutaneous nodule, gingival hypertrophy, lacrimal gland enlargement, and no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly, but had anemia, thrombocytopenia, and peripheral blood (PB) plus bone marrow (BM) involvement by leukemic cells. There was minimal response to multiagent chemotherapy and local radiotherapy, with a survival of 6.5 months from disease diagnosis. METHODS: The PB and/or BM leukemic cells were evaluated using electron microscopy (EM), immunohistochemistry, flow-cytometric immunophenotyping, cytochemistry, cytogenetics, Southern blot analysis for gene rearrangement and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), polymerase chain reaction for EBV and human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6), and in vitro culturing with inducing agents. RESULTS: The leukemic cells were agranular and monocytoid, with a hairy cell-like bone marrow biopsy infiltrate. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase staining was negative, and periodic acid-Schiff staining was positive by light microscopy. Electron microscopy showed MPO negativity and a lack of parallel tubular arrays. The immunophenotype was CD3-, CD56+, CD4+, CD8-, CD15+, TCR1-, and TCR2-, with germline immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes and an abnormal karyotype (44XY, 5q-, -13, 13q+, -15). No genomic material for EBV or HHV-6 was detected. Cell cultures with butyrate and N,N-hexamethylene bis-acetamide suggested the possible induction of tumor cells to express a T-cell immunophenotype. CONCLUSION: A case of clonal acute natural killer (NK) cell leukemia with an unusual morphology (agranular) and unique phenotype (CD3-, CD56+, CD4+, CD15+) is presented. Unlike as in other acute NK leukemias, EBV was negative; there was no evidence of HHV-6. The tumor cell, after culturing with differentiating agents, may have been induced to express a T-cell immunophenotype.","['Brody, J P', 'Allen, S', 'Schulman, P', 'Sun, T', 'Chan, W C', 'Friedman, H D', 'Teichberg, S', 'Koduru, P', 'Cone, R W', 'Loughran, T P Jr']","['Brody JP', 'Allen S', 'Schulman P', 'Sun T', 'Chan WC', 'Friedman HD', 'Teichberg S', 'Koduru P', 'Cone RW', 'Loughran TP Jr']","['Department of Laboratories, North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College, Manhasset, New York 11030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Chromosome Aberrations/genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/metabolism/*pathology/virology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/05/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/05/15 00:00'],"['1995/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19950515)75:10<2474::aid-cncr2820751013>3.0.co;2-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1995 May 15;75(10):2474-83. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19950515)75:10<2474::aid-cncr2820751013>3.0.co;2-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T1 weighted images showed a reduction in signal intensity in all patients. The degree of reduction in signal intensity correlated with bone marrow cellularity rather than percentage blasts or French-American-British Co-operative group (FAB) classification. T2 weighted images showed an increase in signal intensity in 10 out of 11 patients; however, reliable grading was not possible using this sequence. Both T1 and T2 weighted images indicated a homogeneous pattern of disease within the axial skeleton in MDS. We have also shown that iron deposition in multiply transfused patients is a significant factor influencing signal reduction. The results of this study suggest that MRI may have a diagnostic role in MDS but is unlikely to be of value in staging.","['Lewis, S', 'Wainscoat, J S', 'Moore, N R', 'Golding, S J']","['Lewis S', 'Wainscoat JS', 'Moore NR', 'Golding SJ']","['Haematology Department, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Radiol,The British journal of radiology,0373125,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory/*pathology', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/pathology', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*pathology', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1259/0007-1285-68-806-121 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Radiol. 1995 Feb;68(806):121-7. doi: 10.1259/0007-1285-68-806-121.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hemoglobin ranged from 40 to 67 g/l and reticulocyte number from 1 to 10 G/l. Mean corpuscular volume was normal as was Coombs' test. There was a profound erythroblastopenia in the bone marrow in five of the six patients. Parvovirus B19 infection was excluded in all. The white cell and platelet counts were normal. All patients were given an unique blood transfusion. Reticulocytosis spontaneously appeared within a few weeks in three patients. Another patient had normal number of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow 1 month after admission. CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of transient erythroblastopenia can only be made after exclusion of known causes such as drugs, virus, immune deficiency, leukemia and of Blackfan-Diamond disease.

Intracranial extension is lethal and must be prevented with early specific treatment. CASE REPORT: A 42 month-old boy was admitted suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Edema of the left eyelid developed on the sixth day of induction chemotherapy. Mucormycosis was suspected because of gradual extension of infection to nasal ala and periorbital area with fever, edema of nasal turbinates and nasal black secretions. Chemotherapy was discontinued and the patient was given intravenous amphotericin B (1.0 mg/kg/day) and heparin associated with G.CSF. Improvement was only temporary and scan examination performed on day 17 showed involvement of the orbit, eye and wall of the maxillary sinus; cultures of secretions were positive for staphylococcus and Absidia corymbifera. Remission of leukemia was obtained a few days later permitting surgical resection of involved tissues on day 30. A relapse of mucormycosis was observed six weeks later despite prolonged administration of amphotericin B requiring extended resection of necrotic areas and replacement of amphotericin B by its liposomal form (Ambisome). Bone marrow relapse of leukemia required further chemotherapy. The patient is in good condition 30 months after the initial symptoms. CONCLUSION: Our patient seems to be the first with prolonged remission of facial mucormycosis and acute leukemia despite relapse of both diseases. This favorable outcome could be due to the use of Ambisome.","['Gebhard, F', 'Chastagner, P', 'Maillot, D', 'Kures, L', 'Georges, J L', 'Schmitt, C', 'Bordigoni, P', 'Sommelet, D']","['Gebhard F', 'Chastagner P', 'Maillot D', 'Kures L', 'Georges JL', 'Schmitt C', 'Bordigoni P', 'Sommelet D']","['Service de medecine infantile II, hopital de Brabois, CHU de Nancy, Vandoeuvre, France.']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Arch Pediatr,Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,9421356,['7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)'],IM,"['Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Mucormycosis/*complications/drug therapy/surgery', 'Opportunistic Infections/*complications', 'Orbital Diseases/*complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Sinusitis/*complications']",,1995/01/01 00:00,2000/05/05 09:00,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0929693X96898095 [pii]', '10.1016/0929-693x(96)89809-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pediatr. 1995 Jan;2(1):47-51. doi: 10.1016/0929-693x(96)89809-5.,Evolution favorable d'une mucormycose orbitonasosinusienne compliquant le traitement d'induction d'une leucemie aigue lymphoblastique.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A cohort of 2170 workers employed for at least one year in two plants that produce disposable medical equipment sterilised with EtO has previously been established. The results of an update with four more years of observation are presented. The cancer incidence was assessed for the periods 1976 to 1990 and 1972 to 1990 and cause specific standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated. Individual cumulative exposure to EtO, expressed as ppm-years, was estimated and used in exposure-response analyses. RESULTS: Six lymphohaematopoietic tumours were observed (SIR 1.78, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.65-3.88), of which two were leukaemias (SIR 2.44; 95% CI 0.30-8.81). When those with cumulative exposures to EtO below the median value (0.13 ppm-years) were excluded, and a minimum of 10 years induction latency period was applied, the incidence ratio for leukaemia increased further (SIR 7.14, 95% CI 0.87-25.8), but was still not significantly enhanced. CONCLUSIONS: The risk estimate for leukaemia increased, but non-significantly, with time since start of exposure, and with cumulative exposures to EtO above the median value. The subjects with leukaemia had, however, only slightly higher cumulative exposure estimates for EtO than the average cohort member. Nevertheless, the present results may add some minor evidence for an association between EtO and an increased risk of leukaemia.","['Hagmar, L', 'Mikoczy, Z', 'Welinder, H']","['Hagmar L', 'Mikoczy Z', 'Welinder H']","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,['JJH7GNN18P (Ethylene Oxide)'],IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'Ethylene Oxide/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",PMC1128178,1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.52.3.154 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 1995 Mar;52(3):154-6. doi: 10.1136/oem.52.3.154.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although this group included 12 lymphoma type and five acute type ATLL, involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) was not observed in these 17 patients. The incidence of CNS involvement was 3/20 (15%). The prognoses of the three patients after the occurrence of CNS involvement was 1, 4, and 8 months, respectively. In these three patients, cerebral lesions became the cause of death for two patients although they continued to be in complete remission hematologically.

Among the patients with advanced disease, those with non-lymphoblastic lymphoma tended to have a better 4-year EFS than those with lymphoblastic lymphoma (52% vs. 25%). Based on these findings, we initiated a new protocol NHL890 in which patients were assigned to two different chemotherapies according to the histology. Non-lymphoblastic subtype was treated almost identically to NHL855 while asparaginase and VP-16 were newly added in the consolidation-maintenance phase in advanced-stage lymphoblastic lymphoma. Sixty-seven patients with advanced disease were assessable. The overall 4-year EFS for advanced disease improved to 69% (S.E., 6%). A significant improvement was gained in the lymphoblastic lymphoma with a 4-year EFS of 56% (S.E., 11%) as compared with 25% (S.E., 9%) in the preceding study (P < 0.05).

Here we characterize the expression and function of fibronectin receptor integrins on rat mast cells. A rat basophilic leukemia cell line (RBL-2H3) and phorbol ester-stimulated rat peritoneal mast cells adhered to fibronectin (FN), vitronectin and fibrinogen. These mast cells expressed fibronectin receptor integrins, including very late antigen (VLA)-4, VLA-5 and vitronectin receptor (VNR), as estimated by immunofluorescent staining and inhibition of FN adherence by newly established mAbs reactive with the rat alpha 4 (MR alpha 4-1), alpha 5 (HM alpha 5-1) or beta 3 (HM beta 3-1) chains of the integrin molecules. The beta-hexosaminidase release, a marker for mast cell degranulation, triggered by high affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon RI)-mediated stimulation, was enhanced by adhesion of RBL-2H3 cells to either immobilized FN, MR alpha 4-1, HM alpha 5-1 or HM beta 3-1. This FN enhancement of beta-hexosaminidase release was inhibited by soluble MR alpha 4-1, HM alpha 5-1 and HM beta 3-1 as well as by GRGDSP and DELPQLVTLPHPNHLGPEILDVPST peptides which abrogate VLA-5/VNR and VLA-4 binding to FN respectively.

The molecular alterations associated with these translocations involve one of the immunoglobulin gene (Ig) loci and a recently cloned gene, bcl-6 located at 3q27 which codes for a zinc-finger protein that may function as a transcription factor. We have identified by cytogenetic analysis 22 cases of ML with a 3q27/Ig translocation. The pathologic diagnoses of these cases include DLCL, FL, small non-cleaved non-Burkitt lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Molecular analysis confirmed a bcl-6 rearrangement in 10/12 cases tested. The karyotype in 5/22 cases revealed the t(3;14) or variant in association with another lymphoma-specific translocation, t(14;18) in three cases and t(8;14) in two cases.

The role of the chimaeric BCR/ABL gene in the malignant process is undisputed. There are, however, conflicting views as to whether the breakpoint site within the BCR gene, and the type of mRNA produced determine disease prognosis and progression. The function and clinical significance of the newly discovered ABL/BCR mRNA has not been investigated for a correlation with CML prognosis or response to therapy. We have used a two-step reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the transcripts of the chimaeric genes BCR/ABL, ABL/BCR, as well as the normal ABL and BCR genes in 24 CML patients treated with IFN. Because of the variable expression of the four transcripts at presentation, a correlation between gene expression, prognosis and clinical progression was examined. No correlation between prognosis and gene expression was seen. Also, no correlation was found between expression of BCR, ABL or BCR/ABL mRNA and response to treatment with IFN. However, 7/10 ABL/BCR mRNA positive patients achieved a major cytogenetic response to IFN; but of the 13 ABL/BCR mRNA negative patients, only two achieved a major cytogenetic response (P = 0.013).

Eight patients (9%) presented a grade > 2 haemorrhagic event, which was intracranial SDH in five of them. All these five SDH patients had hyperleucocytic AML4 or AML5 and had experienced at least one lumbar puncture (LP) before SDH diagnosis (with intrathecal chemotherapy in four cases). SDH diagnosis was assessed on a brain computed tomography scan which was performed 1-9 d after initial SDH symptoms (mainly mild headaches considered a result of prior LP). All these five patients recovered from this severe event after a specified therapy. SDH does not appear to be an uncommon complication of AML4 and AML5 therapy. Its incidence might be under-reported because of poor symptomatology. Lumbar punctures, known to cause exceptional SDH in nonleukaemic patients, might trigger these haemorrhagic events, eventually in combination with other predisposing factors such a haemostasis disorders or leukaemic CNS infiltration.","['Jourdan, E', 'Dombret, H', 'Glaisner, S', 'Miclea, J M', 'Castaigne, S', 'Degos, L']","['Jourdan E', 'Dombret H', 'Glaisner S', 'Miclea JM', 'Castaigne S', 'Degos L']","['Service Clinique des Maladies du Sang, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Brain/diagnostic imaging', 'Female', 'Hematoma, Subdural/diagnostic imaging/*etiology', 'Hemostasis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/complications', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Spinal Puncture/*adverse effects', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb08358.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1995 Mar;89(3):527-30. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb08358.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

French Haematological Cytology Group.,516-26,"The t(1;19)(q23;p13) translocation occurs commonly in B-lineage ALL. Previous reports have demonstrated a predominance of cases with expression of cytoplasmic Ig mu (C mu+), and FAB L1/L2 phenotype, a poor prognosis and expression of a fusion transcript involving the E2A and PBX1 genes in C mu+ but not in C mu- cases. Of 38 patients with karyotypically proven t(1;19) (q23;p13) leukaemias, we extensively analysed 18 patients with acute leukaemia including 16 B-lineage ALLs, one T-ALL and one AML M4. The AML was associated with a classic E2A-PBX1 fusion transcript and may represent the human counterpart of the AMLs induced by E2A-PBX1 retroviral infection of murine marrow progenitors. The T-ALL was E2A-PBX1 negative and neither the E2A nor the LYL-1 genes, both situated at chromosome 19 p13, were rearranged. Of the 16 B-lineage ALLs, four had cytological features resembling an 'L3-like' phenotype classically associated with Burkitt's lymphoma, two at diagnosis and relapse and two exclusively at relapse. E2A-PBX1 fusion transcripts were detected by RT-PCR in all 13 C mu+ patients and in 2/3 C mu- cases. The 'L3-like' phenotype did not correlate with a particular stage of maturation arrest (one sIg+, one C mu+, one C mu-) or type of E2A-PBX1 transcript, but was associated in all cases with a trisomy 8. Translocation, rearrangement, amplification or over-expression of the c-myc gene was not observed in these cases, demonstrating that the apparent association with trisomy 8 is not due to deregulation of this gene. We therefore show that the E2A-PBX1 transcript, although occurring predominantly in C mu+ pre-B ALL, also occurs in C mu- early pre-B ALL, sIg+ B-ALL and even in AML. These results suggest that the stage of maturation arrest, and indirectly the prognosis, are not solely due to the type of fusion transcript associated with the t(1;19).","['Troussard, X', 'Rimokh, R', 'Valensi, F', 'Leboeuf, D', 'Fenneteau, O', 'Guitard, A M', 'Manel, A M', 'Schillinger, F', 'Leglise, C', 'Brizard, A']","['Troussard X', 'Rimokh R', 'Valensi F', 'Leboeuf D', 'Fenneteau O', 'Guitard AM', 'Manel AM', 'Schillinger F', 'Leglise C', 'Brizard A', 'et al.']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb08357.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1995 Mar;89(3):516-26. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb08357.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were conditioned for transplant using either total body irradiation combined with chemotherapy (125 patients) or busulfan and cyclophosphamide (21 patients). 112 recipients of T-cell depleted allografts received in addition total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) for prevention of rejection. Engraftment of neutrophils (> 0.5 x 10(9)/l) and platelets (> 25 x 10(9)/l) occurred on days 15 and 18, and on days 18 and 20 in recipients of Campath 1M and Campath 1G treated marrows respectively. Rejection was documented in 6.8% of T-cell depleted transplants. Leukaemia relapse-free survival at 2 years was 83% for patients transplanted in first CR, 76% in second CR (P2 = 0.34) and 42% in advanced leukaemia (P2 = 0.009). 81 marrow recipients, 38 with Campath 1M and 43 with Campath 1G treated marrow, received post-transplant graded increments of donor's peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) to induce graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) effects. Administration of donor's PBL was associated with clinically significant GVHD and with decreased relapse rate especially in patients with ALL. Our data suggest that in patients receiving marrow allografts depleted of T cells by Campath 1 monoclonal antibodies, rejection can be reduced by adequate pregrafting immunosuppression. In patients with advanced disease, post-transplant cell-mediated immunotherapy (CMI) using donor's PBL may be beneficial; however, further studies are needed to define the optimal schedule of CMI for safe and effective prevention of relapse following TCD bone marrow transplantation in malignant haematological diseases.","['Naparstek, E', 'Or, R', 'Nagler, A', 'Cividalli, G', 'Engelhard, D', 'Aker, M', 'Gimon, Z', 'Manny, N', 'Sacks, T', 'Tochner, Z']","['Naparstek E', 'Or R', 'Nagler A', 'Cividalli G', 'Engelhard D', 'Aker M', 'Gimon Z', 'Manny N', 'Sacks T', 'Tochner Z', 'et al.']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Cd52 protein, rat)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Glycoproteins', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/*methods', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb08356.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1995 Mar;89(3):506-15. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb08356.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 59/116 cases of pulmonary FM the infection was the principal cause of death and in 12 of these patients a massive haemoptysis was responsible for death. The diagnosis of FM infection was made ante-mortem in only four out of these 12 patients. The autopsy was performed in 11/12 patients and documented a FM infection. The mycetes isolated were: Hyphomycetes spp. (three patients), Mucorales spp. (two patients), Aspergillus spp. (seven patients). At the time of the massive haemoptysis the mean neutrophil count was 7.2 x 10(9)/l, and no patient had relevant thrombocytopenia (mean 184 x 10(9)/l, range 28-350) or coagulative abnormalities. The mean time which elapsed between resolution of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (WBC < 10(9)/l) and occurrence of haemoptysis was 7 d. No signs or symptoms predictive of this fatal complication were identified. Massive haemoptysis can be the cause of death in patients with acute leukaemia and pulmonary FM which in the majority of patients was not diagnosed in vivo. This complication occurs most frequently shortly after the recovery from chemotherapy-induced aplasia. The mechanism of lesion is unknown, but it may involve the vascular tropism of FM and the release of leucocyte enzymes.

Compared with ara-C, NHAC in liposomal formulations was highly resistant to deamination, resulting in levels of formation of arabinofuranosyluracil 42 and ten times lower in plasma and liver microsomes respectively. The cytotoxicity of NHAC was independent of both the nucleoside transporter mechanism and the deoxycytidine (dCyd) kinase activity as demonstrated by co-incubating NHAC with dipyridamole and/or dCyd. In ara C-resistant HL-60 cells NHAC was still cytotoxic, requiring drug concentration only 1.6 times higher than sensitive cells. Uptake of NHAC was six times higher and was not inhibited by dipyridamole. The pharmacokinetics of NHAC revealed that its intracellular half-life is 4.8 times longer than that of ara-C. Ara-CTP formation and incorporation into DNA was up to 25-50 times lower than that of ara-C and contributed only marginally to the cytotoxic effects of NHAC. These results indicate that, because of the significantly increased stability, the transporter-independent uptake and the dCyd-kinase-independent cytotoxicity, NHAC might be active in ara-C-resistant cells.","['Horber, D H', 'Schott, H', 'Schwendener, R A']","['Horber DH', 'Schott H', 'Schwendener RA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Liposomes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '103426-87-5 (N(4)-hexadecyl-1-arabinofuranosylcytosine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Deamination', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/drug therapy', 'Liposomes', 'Mice', 'Microsomes, Liver/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",PMC2033768,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1995.185 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1995 May;71(5):957-62. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1995.185.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The kinetics of onset of apoptosis was determined and compared with that for dexamethasone-treated cells. The drugs induced 50% apoptosis at different rates: etoposide by approximately 18 h, NMF by 40 h and dexamethasone (DEX) by 52 h. In each case, the onset of apoptosis above 10% was preceded by a delay period. This was 8 h for etoposide, between 8 and 12 h for NMF and 36 h for dexamethasone. When cells were incubated for 36 h with dexamethasone and the drug washed out, addition of NMF induced apoptosis without any delay, suggesting that certain common biochemical events are required to prime the cells for apoptosis. However, cells treated for 8 h with NMF did not undergo immediate apoptosis on the addition of DEX. Analysis of the cellular content of the c-myc protein showed this to be undetectable by 2, 6 and 12 h after treatment with etoposide, NMF and DEX respectively. The rapid onset of NMF-induced cell death after a 36 h DEX pretreatment occurred 24 h after the loss of expression of c-Myc protein, suggesting that the expression of c-myc is not required for drug-induced cell death. In contrast to DEX-induced apoptosis, concomitant incubation of cells with NMF or etoposide and 200 nM of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide did not inhibit apoptotic cell death. The idea that drugs with different modes of action initiate conserved responses which engage a programmed cell death is discussed.","['Wood, A C', 'Elvin, P', 'Hickman, J A']","['Wood AC', 'Elvin P', 'Hickman JA']","['Cancer Research Campaign Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology Group, School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Formamides)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'XPE4G7Y986 (methylformamide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Formamides/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC2033809,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1995.181 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1995 May;71(5):937-41. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1995.181.,,['c-myc'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The induction of mdr1 RNA expression by three anthracyclines, (doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin), VP-16 and two vinca alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine) was semiquantitatively assessed by scanning Northern blots on a phosphorimager. The relative level of mdr1 expression was expressed as ratio of mdr1 to the internal RNA (actin). A significant increase (P < 0.02) in expression of mdr1 was noted within 4 hrs of exposure to 1.5 micrograms ml-1 daunorubicin or epirubicin. Neither vinblastine nor vincristine had any effect on mdr1 levels after an 8 h exposure. With increasing concentrations of daunorubicin or epirubicin in a fixed 24 h time period, mdr1 expression increased, although a biphasic response was seen.

Therefore, we compared the effects of LPs and MP on NDPK- and GTPase activation in HL-60 membranes. In native membranes, LPs effectively activated GTP hydrolysis and moderately activated GTP formation. In solubilized membranes, the effect of LPs on GTP formation was enhanced whereas the one on GTP hydrolysis was abolished. The NDPK substrate GDP enhanced the relative stimulatory effect of LPs and MP on GTP hydrolysis in HL-60 membranes in the absence of a NTP-regenerating system. A NTP-regenerating system abrogated the potentiating effect of GDP on MP-action, whereas the effect on LP-stimulated GTP-hydrolysis was enhanced. Our data show that LPs activate NDPK in HL-60 membranes and that this activation may account for their G-protein-stimulatory activity. Membrane solubilization may impair the transfer of GTP from NDPK to Gi-protein alpha-subunits and subsequent GTP hydrolysis, whereas GTP formation remains intact, augmenting the effect of LPs on the kinase.

To identify such cellular alterations, in particular morphologic changes associated with the exposure to antileukemic agents were investigated in the murine leukemic L1210 cell line using flow cytometry and image analysis. Cells were cultured with eight kinds of antileukemic agents in cytostatic concentrations which are clinically achievable. Living cells were observed in culture without fixation or staining. Two parameters related to cell size and shape were measured simultaneously by the image analysing computer. These parameters provided us with different criteria for characterizing the antimetabolites, DNA-strand-damage inducers and other agents tested.

Subconfluent and confluent cells possessed system y+ activity, as determined by the sodium independence of uptake and the pattern of inhibition by amino acid analogues or N-ethylmaleimide. Initial rates of arginine uptake via system y+ decreased as the cells advanced from the undifferentiated to the differentiated state following culture passaging. Furthermore, kinetic analysis of the leucine-insensitive portion of uptake indicated that the Caco-2 system y+ transport capacity decreased with cell age, dropping from a maximal velocity (Vmax) = 1,094 pmol.mg-1.min-1 [Michaelis constant (Km) = 41 microM] in undifferentiated cells 2 days postseeding to Vmax = 320 pmol.mg-1.min-1 (Km = 37 microM) in confluent cells 9 days postseeding (from cells of the same passage). Northern analysis indicated that the levels of a single 7.9-kb mCAT-1 mRNA species were relatively constant over the course of Caco-2 differentiation and therefore were unsynchronized with the system y+ relative transport activities. It is concluded that the Caco-2 capacity to transport arginine via system y+ may be downregulated by posttransitional modifications in confluent cells compared with newly passaged undifferentiated cells. These data serve as a well-defined in vitro model for further studies regarding regulation of arginine transport in epithelial cells.","['Pan, M', 'Malandro, M', 'Stevens, B R']","['Pan M', 'Malandro M', 'Stevens BR']","['Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville 32610-0274, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'O3C74ACM9V (Ethylmaleimide)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/pharmacology', 'Arginine/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Ethylmaleimide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*metabolism', 'Intestines/*cytology', 'Kinetics', 'Leucine/pharmacology', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', '*Receptors, Virus', 'Sodium/pharmacology']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/ajpgi.1995.268.4.G578 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1995 Apr;268(4 Pt 1):G578-85. doi: 10.1152/ajpgi.1995.268.4.G578.,,,,['DK-38715/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that the expression of the c-fos and c-jun genes, but not of the lyn and c-myc genes, was augmented 2- to 20-fold in histologically normal skin and muscle of these mice. The augmentation was tissue specific, suggesting the involvement of a cellular factor in the transgene action. In these mice, a three to seven times higher incidence of tumors was seen as compared with the control mice. These tumors included mesenchymal tumors, such as fibrosarcoma, neurofibroma, and lipoma, and adenocarcinomas of the mammary gland, salivary gland, and lung. The c-fos and c-jun genes were also activated in these tumors. The possible roles of elevated c-fos and c-jun gene expression in tumorigensis are discussed.","['Iwakura, Y', 'Tosu, M', 'Yoshida, E', 'Saijo, S', 'Nakayama-Yamada, J', 'Itagaki, K', 'Asano, M', 'Siomi, H', 'Hatanaka, M', 'Takeda, T']","['Iwakura Y', 'Tosu M', 'Yoshida E', 'Saijo S', 'Nakayama-Yamada J', 'Itagaki K', 'Asano M', 'Siomi H', 'Hatanaka M', 'Takeda T', 'et al.']","['Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virus Genes,Virus genes,8803967,,IM,"['Animals', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genes, env', '*Genes, fos', '*Genes, jun', '*Genes, pX', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/virology', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01702659 [doi]'],ppublish,Virus Genes. 1995 Jan;9(2):161-70. doi: 10.1007/BF01702659.,,"['c-fos', 'c-jun', 'c-myc', 'lyn', 'tax']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past two decades the probability of success has improved steadily depending on the type and stage of disease. All marrow transplant teams have observed that the results for children are better than for adults. Long-term survival and apparent cure rates range from about 90 percent for non-malignant diseases transplanted early to 15 percent for patients with advanced leukemia. Most marrow transplants have involved an HL-A matched sibling donor but, more recently, through the worldwide marrow donor registries a matched unrelated volunteer marrow donor can be found for many patients without a family donor. Current research involves new preparative regimens for elimination of malignant cells, better prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and the use of hematopoietic growth factors and cytokines. Autologous transplants, which use the patient's own marrow, are increasing. The hematopoietic stem cell, which is responsible for marrow regeneration after a transplant, has been isolated and characterized. Stem cells for transplantation can now be obtained from the peripheral blood after mobilization of these cells by chemotherapy or hematopoietic growth factors.","['Thomas, E D']",['Thomas ED'],"['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Turkey,Turk J Pediatr,The Turkish journal of pediatrics,0417505,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/methods/trends', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods/trends', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Turk J Pediatr. 1995 Jan-Mar;37(1):31-43.,,,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike most other carcinogens, benzene and its metabolites are weakly or nonmutagenic in most simple gene mutation assays. Benzene and its metabolites do, however, produce chromosomal damage in a variety of systems. Here, we have used the glycophorin A (GPA) gene loss mutation assay to evaluate the nature of DNA damage produced by benzene in 24 workers heavily exposed to benzene and 23 matched control individuals in Shanghai, China. The GPA assay identifies stem cell or precursor erythroid cell mutations expressed in peripheral erythrocytes of MN-heterozygous subjects, distinguishing the NN and N phi mutant variants. A significant increase in the NN GPA variant cell frequency (Vf) was found in benzene-exposed workers as compared with unexposed control individuals (mean +/- SEM, 13.9 +/- 1.7 per million cells vs. 7.4 +/- 1.1 per million cells in control individuals; P = 0.0002). In contrast, no significant difference existed between the two groups for the N phi Vf (9.1 +/- 0.9 vs. 8.8 +/- 1.8 per million cells; P = 0.21). Further, lifetime cumulative occupational exposure to benzene was associated with the NN Vf (P = 0.005) but not with the N phi Vf (P = 0.31), suggesting that NN mutations occur in longer-lived bone marrow stem cells. NN variants result from loss of the GPA M allele and duplication of the N allele, presumably through recombination mechanisms, whereas NO variants arise from gene inactivation, presumably due to point mutations and deletions. Thus, these results suggest that benzene produces gene-duplicating mutations but does not produce gene-inactivating mutations at the GPA locus in bone marrow cells of humans exposed to high benzene levels. This finding is consistent with data on the genetic toxicology of benzene and its metabolites and adds further weight to the hypothesis that chromosome damage and mitotic recombination are important in benzene-induced leukemia.","['Rothman, N', 'Haas, R', 'Hayes, R B', 'Li, G L', 'Wiemels, J', 'Campleman, S', 'Quintana, P J', 'Xi, L J', 'Dosemeci, M', 'Titenko-Holland, N']","['Rothman N', 'Haas R', 'Hayes RB', 'Li GL', 'Wiemels J', 'Campleman S', 'Quintana PJ', 'Xi LJ', 'Dosemeci M', 'Titenko-Holland N', 'et al.']","['Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Glycophorins)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Genetic Carrier Screening', 'Genetic Variation', 'Glycophorins/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Count/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multigene Family/*drug effects', 'Mutation', '*Occupational Exposure']",PMC42104,1995/04/25 00:00,1995/04/25 00:01,['1995/04/25 00:00'],"['1995/04/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/25 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.9.4069 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Apr 25;92(9):4069-73. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.9.4069.,,,,"['P30ES01896/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the pathogenesis of the disease is unknown, the presence of a remarkably high frequency of Tax-specific, cytotoxic CD8 T cells may suggest a role of these cells in the development of HAM/TSP. Antigen-mediated signaling in a CD8 T-cell clone specific for the Tax(11-19) peptide of HTLV-I was studied using analog peptides substituted in their T-cell receptor contact residues defined by x-ray crystallographic data of the Tax(11-19) peptide in the groove of HLA-A2. CD8 T-cell stimulation with the wild-type peptide antigen led to activation of p56lck kinase activity, interleukin 2 secretion, cytotoxicity, and clonal expansion. A Tax analog peptide with an alanine substitution of the T-cell receptor contact residue tyrosine-15 induced T-cell-mediated cytolysis without activation of interleukin 2 secretion or proliferation. Induction of p56lck kinase activity correlated with T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, whereas interleukin 2 secretion correlated with [3H]thymidine incorporation and proliferation. Moreover, Tax peptide analogs that activated the tyrosine kinase activity of p56lck could induce unresponsiveness to secondary stimulation with the wild-type peptide. These observations show that a single amino acid substitution in a T-cell receptor contact residue of Tax can differentially signal CD8 T cells and further demonstrate that primary activation has functional consequences for the secondary response of at least some Tax-specific CD8 T cells to HTLV-I-infected target cells.","['Hollsberg, P', 'Weber, W E', 'Dangond, F', 'Batra, V', 'Sette, A', 'Hafler, D A']","['Hollsberg P', 'Weber WE', 'Dangond F', 'Batra V', 'Sette A', 'Hafler DA']","[""Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Binding Sites', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*virology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Gene Products, tax/*immunology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Point Mutation', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",PMC42097,1995/04/25 00:00,1995/04/25 00:01,['1995/04/25 00:00'],"['1995/04/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/25 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.9.4036 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Apr 25;92(9):4036-40. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.9.4036.,,,,"['AI18634/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'NS24247/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure to 0.1% carbon monoxide, a procedure that causes functional anemia, resulted in a 20-fold increase of EPO mRNA in mouse brain as quantified by competitive reverse transcription-PCR, whereas the EPO-R mRNA level was not influenced by hypoxia. Binding studies on mouse brain sections revealed defined binding sites for radioiodinated EPO in distinct brain areas. The specificity of EPO binding was assessed by homologous competition with an excess of unlabeled EPO and by using two monoclonal antibodies against human EPO, one inhibitory and the other noninhibitory for binding of EPO to EPO-R.

While the expression of c-myc is extensively regulated, no major changes in max expression have been reported so far with respect to differentiation. We have studied the expression of c-Myc and Max during in vitro differentiation of the bipotent human myeloid leukemia K562 cell line. This cell model system allowed us to compare c-Myc and Max expression during differentiation along erythroid (induced by 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-cytosine) and myelomonocytic lineages (induced by 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate). We found that c-myc expression decreased as a result of both differentiating treatments. The expression level of max remained unchanged during myelomonocytic differentiation. In contrast, max mRNA and protein were dramatically down-regulated during erythroid differentiation of K562 cells, thus demonstrating that max gene is subjected to regulation during differentiation. We also studied the expression of the other two described members of the c-Myc network: mxi1 and mad. mxi1 expression increased during erythroid differentiation but was strongly down-regulated during myelomonocytic differentiation of K562. mad was constitutively expressed during K562 erythroid differentiation and slightly increased during induction of the myelomonocytic pathway. We have obtained K562 sublines stably transfected with a zinc-inducible c-myc gene. In these clones the overexpression of c-Myc did not interfere with TPA-induced myelomonocytic differentiation. In contrast, erythroid differentiation was significantly inhibited upon c-myc induction despite the down-regulation of endogenous max expression. These results suggest a differential role for c-Myc in the human myeloid cell differentiation depending on the cell lineage.","['Delgado, M D', 'Lerga, A', 'Canelles, M', 'Gomez-Casares, M T', 'Leon, J']","['Delgado MD', 'Lerga A', 'Canelles M', 'Gomez-Casares MT', 'Leon J']","['Departamento de Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAX protein, human)', '0 (MXD1 protein, human)', '0 (MXI1 protein, human)', '0 (Myc associated factor X)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', '*Repressor Proteins', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,1995/04/20 00:00,1995/04/20 00:01,['1995/04/20 00:00'],"['1995/04/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/20 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1995 Apr 20;10(8):1659-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Translocation of the ERG gene t(21;22) results in the chimeric fusion transcript seen in approximately 10% of Ewings sarcomas. In addition, recent studies have shown that a reciprocal translocation t(21;16) of ERG gives rise to two aberrant transcripts seen in some forms of acute myeloid leukaemia. In vitro studies have linked the up regulation of ERG expression with stromal cell independence in erythroleukemic clones and shown that the ERG related genes ETS1 and ETS2 have a mitogenic and transforming activity when overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells. Interestingly ERGB/FLI-1, which is also involved in Ewings sarcoma translocations and shares a very high sequence identify with ERG has been reported to be unable to transform NIH3T3 cells. In this study we investigate the effects of overexpression of ERG on cell proliferation, factor dependence, growth in soft agar and tumorigenesis in nude mice. An ERG expression construct with the human ERG2 cDNA driven by the sheep metallothionein la promoter (sMTERG) was transfected into NIH3T3 cells. Clonal cell lines overexpressing ERG were established. The cell lines became morphologically altered, grew in low serum and serum free media and gave rise to colonies in soft agar suspension. Furthermore, we demonstrate that after subcutaneous injection these clones grow as solid tumors in nude mice. These data demonstrate that c-ERG is a proto-oncogene capable of transforming NIH3T3 cells. Therefore, overexpression or inappropriate expression of ERG may contribute to oncogenesis.","['Hart, A H', 'Corrick, C M', 'Tymms, M J', 'Hertzog, P J', 'Kola, I']","['Hart AH', 'Corrick CM', 'Tymms MJ', 'Hertzog PJ', 'Kola I']","['Molecular Embryology and Birth Defects Laboratory, Monash University, Monash Medical Centre, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (ERG1 Potassium Channel)', '0 (Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels)', '0 (Kcnh2 protein, mouse)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'ERG1 Potassium Channel', 'Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', '*Mitogens', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Trans-Activators', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG']",,1995/04/06 00:00,1995/04/06 00:01,['1995/04/06 00:00'],"['1995/04/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/06 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1995 Apr 6;10(7):1423-30.,,['ERG2'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These breakpoints map to a region between 2 and 30 kb upstream of TTG-2 in chromosome 11p13. To establish the role of these translocation breakpoints in the deregulation of TTG-2 in T-ALL we have determined the complete structure of this gene. Isolation of new TTG-2 cDNA clones from fetal liver identified an alternative transcript (TTG-2a) containing two new noncoding 5' exons. Analysis of exon/intron boundaries, identified 6 exons spread over 35 kb in 11p13. The gene encodes two alternative transcripts initiating from two promoters. TTG-2a, from promoter 1 (P1) and TTG-2b, from promoter 2 (P2) differ in the length of the 5' untranslated region, but encode the same protein. A high level of TTG-2a was present in fetal liver and spleen, whereas in adult kidney a low level of TTG-2a and a high level of TTG-2b was found. The transcription start site for TTG-2a was identified by RNase protection experiments and it displayed sequence homology to an initiator element (inr). P1 lacks a TATA box, but binding sites for SP1 and GATA-1 are present. This new genomic organisation revealed that all known chromosomal translocations map upstream of P2, removing P1 and putative upstream regulatory sequences leaving P2 intact. These results show that chromosomal translocations disrupt the TTG-2 gene itself, further confirming its role in the development of T-ALL.","['Royer-Pokora, B', 'Rogers, M', 'Zhu, T H', 'Schneider, S', 'Loos, U', 'Bolitz, U']","['Royer-Pokora B', 'Rogers M', 'Zhu TH', 'Schneider S', 'Loos U', 'Bolitz U']","['Institute of Human Genetics, University of Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Metalloproteins/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,1995/04/06 00:00,1995/04/06 00:01,['1995/04/06 00:00'],"['1995/04/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/06 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1995 Apr 6;10(7):1353-60.,,"['RBTN2', 'TTG-2']",,,['GENBANK/X61118'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently shown that PML is a primary target gene of interferons. Here, it is shown that PML has growth suppressive properties and displays an altered expression pattern during human oncogenesis. PML is widely expressed in cell-lines and is cell-cycle regulated. Overexpression of the protein induces a sharp reduction in growth rates in vitro and in vivo. In contrast with cell-lines, in normal tissues (including those that rapidly proliferate) only a few cells have detectable PML levels. However, these can be upregulated by soluble factors (e.g. IFN, estrogens). Human epithelial tumors show a gradual increase of PML levels as the lesion progresses from benign dysplasia to carcinoma. A similar induction is found in the surrounding stroma and vessels, which likely results from paracrine interactions. Strikingly, when malignant cells turn invasive, they loose PML expression, while expression is conserved in the stromal compartment. These observations point to the existence of a consistent deregulation in the expression of the PML growth-suppressor during human oncogenesis.","['Koken, M H', 'Linares-Cruz, G', 'Quignon, F', 'Viron, A', 'Chelbi-Alix, M K', 'Sobczak-Thepot, J', 'Juhlin, L', 'Degos, L', 'Calvo, F', 'de The, H']","['Koken MH', 'Linares-Cruz G', 'Quignon F', 'Viron A', 'Chelbi-Alix MK', 'Sobczak-Thepot J', 'Juhlin L', 'Degos L', 'Calvo F', 'de The H']","['CNRS UPR 43, Centre Hayem, Hopital St. Louis, Paris.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Estrogens)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Cycle', 'Estrogens/physiology', 'Female', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Skin/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,1995/04/06 00:00,1995/04/06 00:01,['1995/04/06 00:00'],"['1995/04/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/06 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1995 Apr 6;10(7):1315-24.,,['PML'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present state of uncertainty led to a variety of recommendations and statements being made concerning restrictions to the exposure of people to ELF electromagnetic fields. Attempts to detect direct chromosomal damage from ELF electromagnetic fields have proven negative, while results on cancer promotion have been controversial. On the basis of several epidemiological studies on occupational exposure, an increased risk of leukemia, brain cancer and male breast cancer is apparent; the literature on residential exposure provides some evidence of an effect on childhood cancer, especially leukemia; however, when interpreting these results some major methodological concerns should be kept in mind. In conclusion, the public concern and potential public health impact of this environmental agent argue strongly for addressing further research in order to identify mechanisms of action on biological systems, to define the proper assessment of exposure and to obtain good epidemiological evidence.","['Pira, E', 'Zanetti, C', 'Saia, B']","['Pira E', 'Zanetti C', 'Saia B']",['Dipartimento di Traumatologia Ortopedia e Medicina del Lavoro Universita degli Studi di Torino.'],['ita'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Med Lav,La Medicina del lavoro,0401176,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Breast Neoplasms, Male/epidemiology/etiology', 'Child', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology', 'Occupational Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Research', 'Residential Facilities', 'Risk Factors']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Lav. 1994 Nov-Dec;85(6):447-62.,Rischio cancerogeno da campi elettromagnetici elf: stato dell'arte.,,64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this paper is to study the trend of mortality from tumors in children (under 15 years old) during the period 1975-1992. METHODS: Using data from the Department of Health and Social Security's Register of Mortality, age-group standardized (to world population) mortality rates for each sex were analyzed. Analysis was carried out on total mortality caused by childhood tumors and on main causes of death (leukemia, brain cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, bone cancer and non-specified tumors). A Poisson's regression model was used to analyze mortality trends. RESULTS: Childhood tumors caused 8.7% of all deaths in boys and 8.5% of all deaths in girls between 1990-1992. Thus, standardized mortality rates have decreased significantly, in 1975-1977 standardized mortality rates for boys and girls were 71.20 and 68.05 respectively, in 1990-1992 these rates had fallen to 55.45 and 41.30. The annual percentage decrease in cancer mortality rates for boys was 2% and for girls was 3.1%. Main causes of deaths were leukemia and brain cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Between 1975-1992 a significant downward trend in childhood tumors mortality has been observed, more prominent in main causes of death and in girls. The principal explanation for this trend is an increased survival, consequence of changes in childhood tumors therapy.","['Sanchez, V', 'Sanchez de Toledo, J', 'Mingot, M', 'Borras, J M']","['Sanchez V', 'Sanchez de Toledo J', 'Mingot M', 'Borras JM']","['Departament de Sanitat i Seguretat Social, Generalitat de Catalunya, Barcelona.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Mortality/*trends', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Regression Analysis', 'Spain/epidemiology']",,1995/02/25 00:00,1995/02/25 00:01,['1995/02/25 00:00'],"['1995/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1995 Feb 25;104(7):241-4.,Tendencias de la mortalidad infantil por tumores en Cataluna (1975-1992).,,,,,,['Med Clin (Barc). 1995 Feb 25;104(7):253-4.

F(ab')2 fragments of a CD3 epsilon-specific mAb were administered to irradiated AKR (H-2k) hosts after transplantation of BM plus spleen cells from B10.BR donors (BMS chimeras). The effects on GVH and GVL reactivity were Ab dose- and schedule-dependent. A short course of mAb (qe2d, days 0 to 8) prevented clinical evidence of GVHD and mortality. Anti-CD3 F(ab')2 mAb reversed clinical symptoms of acute GVHD when delayed up to 18 days post-transplant. Anti-host (Mls-1a)-specific V beta 6+ cells were absent from the spleens of GVH-negative control mice, but persisted in Ab-treated BMS chimeras despite the absence of GVHD. Leukemic mice given 16.7 micrograms of Ab on days 0, 2, and 4 survived leukemia-free without developing severe GVHD. A longer course of Ab completely prevented GVHD, but led to leukemia relapse in tumor-bearing hosts, despite engraftment of donor T cells. The GVL effect was quantitatively stronger when Ab was used for GVH therapy as compared with GVH prevention. Some Ab-treated, GVH-free chimeras relapsed with lymphomas in unusual sites, suggesting that occult tumor cells may persist in nonlymphoid tissues. These experiments demonstrate that T cell-specific mAb can be used successfully in vivo to avoid severe GVHD, but that excessive or ill-timed administration of Ab may eliminate GVL reactivity.","['Johnson, B D', 'McCabe, C', 'Hanke, C A', 'Truitt, R L']","['Johnson BD', 'McCabe C', 'Hanke CA', 'Truitt RL']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (antigen T cell receptor, epsilon chain)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Radiation Chimera/immunology', 'Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology']",,1995/05/15 00:00,1995/05/15 00:01,['1995/05/15 00:00'],"['1995/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1995 May 15;154(10):5542-54.,,,,['CA39854/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have indicated that the nucleoside adenosine potentiates this response by activating putative A3 adenosine receptors (AR) coupled to phospholipase C in mast cells or their cultured analogues, rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. Moreover, it has been shown that exposure of RBL-2H3 cells to dexamethasone attenuated antigen-mediated mast cell degranulation, but potentiated the response elicited by adenosine. To determine whether the A3AR is a potential site of action of dexamethasone, we have assessed the status of these receptors in RBL-2H3 cells treated with and without dexamethasone. Treatment with dexamethasone (100 nM) for 24 h resulted in an increase in the number of A3AR to 217 +/- 50% of control. The increased receptor expression was both time- and concentration-dependent, with optimal increases observed following 16 h of treatment and using 100 nM of dexamethasone. No increase in the level of the A2aAR was detectable following dexamethasone treatment. Northern blotting studies indicated a 2.7 +/- 0.3-fold increase in A3AR mRNA in RBL-2H3 cells treated with dexamethasone for 24 h. Dexamethasone also increased the expression of G protein alpha i2, alpha i3, alpha s, and beta subunits by two- to threefold. Activation of the A3AR by aminophenylethyladenosine (APNEA) following dexamethasone treatment enhanced the production of inositol phosphates and the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. From these data, it is concluded that dexamethasone increases the expression of both A3AR and G proteins in RBL-2H3 cells which contributes to the enhanced response to adenosine.","['Ramkumar, V', 'Wilson, M', 'Dhanraj, D N', 'Gettys, T W', 'Ali, H']","['Ramkumar V', 'Wilson M', 'Dhanraj DN', 'Gettys TW', 'Ali H']","['Department of Pharmacology, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield 62794, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P1)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium/analysis', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Inositol Phosphates/analysis', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Purinergic P1/*biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/metabolism']",,1995/05/15 00:00,1995/05/15 00:01,['1995/05/15 00:00'],"['1995/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1995 May 15;154(10):5436-43.,,,,['DK42486/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma is a uncommon tumour in the adult. Clinically, there is a vegetative formation but no botryoid aspect. Striated muscle cell proliferation, suggested by the morphology of the malignant cells was confirmed by immunohistochemistry which demonstrated desmine and vimentine and by the ultrastructural study which demonstrated Z lines in the cytoplasm of the malignant cells. Granulocyte sarcoma is characterized by a non-tumoural non-destructive infiltration of inflammatory-like cells. Their granulocyte nature is confirmed by histochemistry, the Leder's reaction on frozen samples, immunohistochemistry (expression of NP57). Electron microscopy can also be used. The diagnosis of lymphoma is difficult due to the non-tumoural nature of the lymphomatous infiltration which can simulate inflammatory reaction. In our case, the diagnosis was made on the tumoural aspect of the biopsy made in the deep infiltration zone of an adjacent organ (bladder). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the lymphoid nature of the tumour and identified a B phenotype.

Parameters of iron metabolism included serum iron concentrations, total iron binding capacity, serum transferrin, and ferritin concentrations and transferrin saturation values. RESULTS: Patients who developed a fungal infection had substantially increased transferrin saturation values and ferritin concentrations at diagnosis together with low serum transferrin and high serum iron concentrations. This profile was present in patients with a fungal infection regardless of the underlying haematological disorder. CONCLUSION: Increased transferrin saturation values and high ferritin concentrations may be additional risk factors for the development of systemic fungal infection in patients with haematological malignancies.","['Iglesias-Osma, C', 'Gonzalez-Villaron, L', 'San Miguel, J F', 'Caballero, M D', 'Vazquez, L', 'de Castro, S']","['Iglesias-Osma C', 'Gonzalez-Villaron L', 'San Miguel JF', 'Caballero MD', 'Vazquez L', 'de Castro S']","['Departamento de Medicina, Hospital Universitario, Universidad de Salamanca, Paseo San Vicente, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Transferrin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Ferritins/blood', 'Humans', 'Iron/*blood', 'Leukemia/*blood/complications', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood', 'Lymphoma/*blood/complications', 'Mycoses/*blood/complications', 'Opportunistic Infections/*blood/complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transferrin/metabolism']",PMC502449,1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.48.3.223 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1995 Mar;48(3):223-5. doi: 10.1136/jcp.48.3.223.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results suggest that extracellular signals involved in the differentiation induction could modulate the wt-p53-dependent apoptosis through protein kinase C-dependent and independent pathways.","['Noguchi, K', 'Nakajima, M', 'Naito, M', 'Tsuruo, T']","['Noguchi K', 'Nakajima M', 'Naito M', 'Tsuruo T']","['Laboratory of Biomedical Research, University of Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA/analysis', '*Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, p53/*physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC5920761,1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['091050509598692C [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1995.tb03042.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1995 Feb;86(2):217-23. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1995.tb03042.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neither IL-1 beta nor IL-1ra mRNA was present in monocytes just after the isolation, but they were induced simultaneously in response to various stimulants. In contrast, only IL-1 beta mRNA was expressed in monocytic leukemia cell line JOSK-1, while little or no IL-1ra mRNA was detected even after stimulation. Dominant expression of IL-1 beta over IL-1ra was also observed in fresh leukemia cells including monocytic leukemias, i.e., IL-1 beta mRNA was constitutively expressed in 26 out of 36 cases (72.2%), whereas IL-1ra mRNA was present only in 8 cases (22.2%). The signal intensity of IL-1 beta mRNA was stronger than that of IL-1ra even in IL-1ra-positive cases. Apoptotic cell death of monocytes was significantly inhibited by IL-1 beta, and it was enhanced by IL-1ra. In fresh leukemia cells, 3H-thymidine uptake was generally higher in IL-1-producing cases than in IL-1ra-producing cases, and was increased by the addition of IL-1 beta in all cases tested. Cell proliferation was inhibited by either IL-1ra or anti-IL-1 beta antibody in IL-1-producing cases, while it was enhanced by anti-IL-1ra antibody in IL-1ra-producing cases. These results suggest that the balance between IL-1 and IL-1ra is necessary for homeostasis of the mononuclear phagocytosis system. The imbalance between these two counter-acting cytokines might contribute to the altered growth and accumulation of leukemic cells.","['Furukawa, Y', 'Kikuchi, J', 'Terui, Y', 'Kitagawa, S', 'Ohta, M', 'Miura, Y', 'Saito, M']","['Furukawa Y', 'Kikuchi J', 'Terui Y', 'Kitagawa S', 'Ohta M', 'Miura Y', 'Saito M']","['Division of Hemopoiesis, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (IL1RN protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein', 'Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Monocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC5920749,1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['091050509598691B [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1995.tb03041.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1995 Feb;86(2):208-16. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1995.tb03041.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These include bias resulting from practices used to measure and record very low doses and from underestimation of dose from neutrons. They also include bias resulting because available dose estimates do not include dose from internally deposited radionuclides, occupational dose received after workers have terminated employment at the facility of interest, or dose from background or medical exposures. These biases can potentially distort dose-response analyses and lead to biased risk estimates and confidence limits. This paper uses data on workers at the Hanford site to investigate the possible effects of these biases on dose-response analyses of leukemia and of all cancer except leukemia. This is accomplished by conducting analyses based on a variety of assumptions regarding the nature and magnitude of these biases. Results were not modified greatly (as compared to those based on the dose as recorded) for any of the 40 sensitivity analyses presented, including some based on fairly extreme assumptions. However, analyses that excluded workers with potential for dose from internal depositions and from neutrons did increase both the risk estimate and upper confidence limits; it may be desirable to emphasize this approach in future presentations. It is recommended that similar sensitivity analyses be performed with data from other worker studies, addressing the specific dosimetry problems that have been identified in those populations.","['Gilbert, E S', 'Fix, J J']","['Gilbert ES', 'Fix JJ']","['Pacific Northwest Laboratory, Richland, WA 99352, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,,IM,"['Bias', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/mortality', 'Neutrons', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure', '*Power Plants', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Injuries/*mortality', 'Radiometry', 'Risk Factors', 'Washington/epidemiology']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00004032-199505000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Health Phys. 1995 May;68(5):650-60. doi: 10.1097/00004032-199505000-00004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We explored whether these altered p21ras protein sequences contain peptide sequences that can activate naive CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Several wild-type and mutated p21ras peptides were identified that carry a binding motif for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201. Two peptides were found to bind strongly to this allele. CD8+ CTL bulk cultures specifically reacting with one of these peptides could be induced, using processing-defective T2 cells loaded with peptide CLLDILDTAGL as stimulators. The peptide is derived from p21ras, position 51-61, and carries a 61 Gln-->Leu mutation. In contrast, a 9-mer peptide CLLDILDTA corresponding to amino acid sequence 51-59 of wild-type p21ras did not yield reactive CTL cultures. T-cell clones with low affinity for the 11-mer peptide were isolated from CLLDILDTAGL-reactive bulk cultures. These T cells did not lyse melanoma cells transfected with 61-Leu N-ras, although lysis was found when these transfectants were pulsed with the 11-mer peptide. Possibly, T cells of higher affinity may be required to demonstrate processed peptide on the cell surface. The combined experiments suggest that a peptide derived from mutated p21ras can be recognized by HLA class I-restricted CTL, whereas an analogous wild-type p21ras peptide may not be immunogenic.","['Van Elsas, A', 'Nijman, H W', 'Van der Minne, C E', 'Mourer, J S', 'Kast, W M', 'Melief, C J', 'Schrier, P I']","['Van Elsas A', 'Nijman HW', 'Van der Minne CE', 'Mourer JS', 'Kast WM', 'Melief CJ', 'Schrier PI']","['Department of Clinical Oncology, University Hospital, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'HLA-A Antigens/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Melanoma', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/*immunology/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*immunology/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/05/04 00:00,1995/05/04 00:01,['1995/05/04 00:00'],"['1995/05/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/04 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910610319 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1995 May 4;61(3):389-96. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910610319.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell fractions were analyzed for cdk1 mRNA and protein cellular content by Northern blot and immunoblot, respectively, as well as for H1K activity.

For comparison, elutriated fractions were also tested for the expression of cdk2 and cdk4 proteins. Both showed some variations among fractions, but they were less clear than those of cdk1. We also tested 29 samples of lymphoid neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissues for proliferative activity (percentage of S and G2/M cells estimated by flow cytometry) and expression of cdk1, cdk2 and cdk4 proteins.

We have now characterized in detail the chromosome 1q abnormalities of 4 AIDS-BL cell lines and compared them to other molecular features of the tumor clone, namely infection by Epstein Barr virus (EBV). Immunophenotypic characteristics were also assessed by conventional in situ immunocytochemical and flow cytometric procedures. The B-cell origin of all cell lines was demonstrated by the expression of B-cell-restricted markers (e.g., CD19). Analysis of Ig light chains confirmed their monoclonal nature.

We demonstrate that wild-type Pbx proteins and chimeric E2a-Pbx1 oncoproteins cooperatively bind a consensus DNA probe with HoxB4, B6, and B7 of the Antennapedia class of Hox/HOM proteins. Specificity of Hox-Pbx interactions was suggested by the inability of Pbx proteins to cooperatively bind the synthetic DNA target with HoxA10 or Drosophila even-skipped. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that the hexapeptide motif (IYPWMK) upstream of the Hox homeo domain was essential for HoxB6 and B7 to cooperatively bind DNA with Pbx proteins. Engraftment of the HoxB7 hexapeptide onto HoxA10 endowed it with robust cooperative properties, demonstrating a functional role for the highly conserved hexapeptide element as one of the molecular determinants delimiting Hox-Pbx cooperativity. The Pbx homeo domain was necessary but not sufficient for cooperativity, which required conserved amino acids carboxy-terminal of the homeo domain. These findings demonstrate that interactions between Hox and Pbx proteins modulate their DNA-binding properties, suggesting that Pbx and Hox proteins act in parallel as heterotypic complexes to regulate expression of specific subordinate genes.","['Chang, C P', 'Shen, W F', 'Rozenfeld, S', 'Lawrence, H J', 'Largman, C', 'Cleary, M L']","['Chang CP', 'Shen WF', 'Rozenfeld S', 'Lawrence HJ', 'Largman C', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical Center, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HOXB4 protein, human)', '0 (HOXB6 protein, human)', '0 (HOXB7 protein, human)', '0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxb4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hoxb6 protein, mouse)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)', '164384-16-1 (Hoxa10 protein, mouse)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Evolution', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drosophila/genetics', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",,1995/03/15 00:00,1995/03/15 00:01,['1995/03/15 00:00'],"['1995/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1101/gad.9.6.663 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Dev. 1995 Mar 15;9(6):663-74. doi: 10.1101/gad.9.6.663.,,,,['CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PML is normally a component of a nuclear multiprotein complex (termed ND10, Kr bodies, nuclear bodies, PML oncogenic domains or PODs) which is disrupted in the APL disease state. PML contains a number of characterized motifs including a Zn2+ binding domain called the RING or C3HC4 finger. Here we describe the solution structure of the PML RING finger as solved by 1H NMR methods at physiological pH with r.m.s. deviations for backbone atoms of 0.88 and 1.39 A for all atoms. Additional biophysical studies including CD and optical spectroscopy, show that the PML RING finger requires Zn2+ for autonomous folding and that cysteines are used in metal ligation. A comparison of the structure with the previously solved equine herpes virus IE110 RING finger, shows significant differences suggesting that the RING motif is structurally diverse. The role of the RING domain in PML nuclear body formation was tested in vivo, by using site-directed mutagenesis and immunofluorescence on transiently transfected NIH 3T3 cells. Independently mutating two pairs of cysteines in each of the Zn2+ binding sites prevents PML nuclear body formation, suggesting that a fully folded RING domain is necessary for this process. These results suggest that the PML RING domain is probably involved in protein-protein interactions, a feature which may be common to other RING finger domains.","['Borden, K L', 'Boddy, M N', 'Lally, J', ""O'Reilly, N J"", 'Martin, S', 'Howe, K', 'Solomon, E', 'Freemont, P S']","['Borden KL', 'Boddy MN', 'Lally J', ""O'Reilly NJ"", 'Martin S', 'Howe K', 'Solomon E', 'Freemont PS']","['Laboratory of Molecular Structure, Biochemistry, National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Solutions)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Peptide Fragments/chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', '*Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Solutions', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Zinc/metabolism']",PMC398240,1995/04/03 00:00,1995/04/03 00:01,['1995/04/03 00:00'],"['1995/04/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/03 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/03 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1995 Apr 3;14(7):1532-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study analyzes in detail the short- and long-term effects of irradiation and cyclosporin A (CsA) treatment on the growth and tumoricidal function of this T cell clone as compared to polyclonal lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell preparations from healthy donors. DNA and RNA syntheses by both TALL-104 and LAK cells were irreversibly arrested a few hours after irradiation with 40 Gy. However, 4-h 51Cr-release assays, performed on different days (day 1 to day 7) after irradiation, showed that the cytotoxic efficiency of TALL-104 cells against hematopoietic and solid tumor targets was only modestly reduced, whereas that of LAK cells was severely inhibited. Moreover, the cytotoxic responses to recombinant human IL-2 and IL-12, measured 18 h after irradiation and cytokine addition, were normal in the case of TALL-104 cells but were abolished in the case of LAK cells. Co-culture of IL-2- or IL-12-preactivated TALL-104 cells with a tumor target for 5 days in the absence of cytokines resulted in a lower efficiency of lysis, as compared to the non-irradiated effectors, especially if the initial stimulus was IL-12. These findings suggest the requirement of multiple cytokine stimulation for optimal expression of tumoricidal activity by lethally irradiated TALL-104 cells. CsA, while abrogating TALL-104 cell proliferation at the low dose of 0.5 microgram/ml, inhibited their cytotoxic function marginally only at high doses (100 micrograms/ml). By contrast, CsA reduced dose-dependently the cytotoxicity of LAK cells starting at very low doses (0.5 microgram/ml). CsA did not impair the ability of TALL-104 and LAK cells to produce interferon (IFN) gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, and granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulatory factor (GM-CSF) in response to IL-2, IL-12, or tumor targets. Irradiation reduced drastically IFN gamma production by LAK, but not TALL-104 cells; release of TNF alpha and GM-CSF by either type of effector was inhibited by 10%-50%, depending on the stimulus. The high resistance and immunosuppressive drugs renders tis immortal T cell clone a potentially safe and effective reagent for new adoptive-transfer approaches to cancer in MHC-incompatible recipients.","['Cesano, A', 'Visonneau, S', 'Cioe, L', 'Clark, S C', 'Santoli, D']","['Cesano A', 'Visonneau S', 'Cioe L', 'Clark SC', 'Santoli D']","['Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Clone Cells', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-12/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/drug effects/immunology/radiation effects', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology/*radiation effects', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01517345 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1995 Mar;40(3):139-51. doi: 10.1007/BF01517345.,,,,"['CA10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rapamycin has been shown to exert its effects on growth factor-induced cell proliferation, at least in part, by blocking the activation of the p70 S6 kinase and thus preventing the downstream signaling process, such as the activation of the members of the cdk family. To determine whether this pathway plays a role in the regulation of apoptosis, we assessed the effect of rapamycin on apoptosis induced by interleukin 2 deprivation in murine T-cell lines, by T-cell receptor ligation in a murine T-cell hybridoma, by enforced c-myc expression in murine fibroblasts, and by corticosteroids in murine T-lymphoma cell lines. Although rapamycin did not induce apoptosis on its own, rapamycin augmented apoptosis in each of the cell lines used as indicated by increased genomic DNA fragmentation, decreased cell viability, and characteristic apoptotic changes in morphology. These results suggest that a signal transduction pathway(s) inhibited by rapamycin plays an important role in the susceptibility of cells to apoptosis. Many chemotherapeutic agents kill cancer cells through the induction of apoptosis. Strikingly, rapamycin increased the ability of the alkylating agent, cisplatin, to induce apoptosis in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 and the human ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3. These data suggest that a signal transduction pathway, likely related to p70 S6 kinase, inhibited by rapamycin may be an important component of the pathway which prevents cell death in many cell lineages and also indicate that rapamycin has the potential to augment the efficacy of selected anticancer therapies.","['Shi, Y', 'Frankel, A', 'Radvanyi, L G', 'Penn, L Z', 'Miller, R G', 'Mills, G B']","['Shi Y', 'Frankel A', 'Radvanyi LG', 'Penn LZ', 'Miller RG', 'Mills GB']","['Toronto Hospital, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Polyenes)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Cricetinae', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Polyenes/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sirolimus', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 May 1;55(9):1982-8.,,['c-myc'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UTI can bind easily to its receptors on various types of tumor cells (human ovarian cancer HOC-I cells, human choriocarcinoma SMT-cc1 cells, and murine Lewis lung carcinoma 3LL cells). Our results show that the UTI receptors of some tumor cells have a possible role in modulating plasmin activity on the cell surface and prevention of tumor cell invasion and metastasis (H. Kobayashi et al., J. Biol. Chem., 269; 20642-20647, 1994). UTI interacts with tumor cells as a negative modulator of the invasive cells. We investigated whether this effect may be mediated by UTI binding to the cell surface receptors. In addition, the role of peptide sequences from each UTI domain and their interaction with tumor cells were investigated. UTI derivatized with biotin or FITC was taken up by tumor cells in a dose-dependent manner. This cell association was inhibited with a monoclonal antibody D1, which specifically recognizes NH2 terminus (domain I) of UTI. The binding was inhibited by fluid phase UTI, but not HI-8, COOH terminus (domain II) of UTI, suggesting that UTI binds to cells through a site in the UTI domain I. Furthermore, we found that UTI, HI-8 and a number of peptides containing Arg-Gly-Pro-Cys-Arg-Ala-Phe-Ile promoted the inhibition of tumor cell invasion. This site corresponds to the plasmin-inhibiting domain within HI-8. The possibility that UTI binding to tumor cells might be involved in the prevention of tumor cell invasion in vitro was excluded since HI-8, lacking domain I, promotes the inhibition of tumor cell invasion with essentially the same affinity as UTI. All these data allow us to conclude that inhibition of tumor cell invasion is mediated by domain II, which possesses anti-plasmin activity.","['Kobayashi, H', 'Gotoh, J', 'Kanayama, N', 'Hirashima, Y', 'Terao, T', 'Sugino, D']","['Kobayashi H', 'Gotoh J', 'Kanayama N', 'Hirashima Y', 'Terao T', 'Sugino D']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Handacho, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Trypsin Inhibitors)', '0 (urinary trypsin inhibitor receptor)', '119978-18-6 (matrigel)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'OR3S9IF86U (urinastatin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Antibody Specificity', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Choriocarcinoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', '*Collagen', 'Drug Combinations', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Laminin', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Peptide Fragments/*metabolism/*pharmacology', '*Proteoglycans', 'Rabbits', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Trypsin Inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 May 1;55(9):1847-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of its anti-leukemic activity, the drug VP-16 was chosen and combined with total body irradiation (TBI). The first series (trial I) consisted of patients who had advanced leukemia. This trial showed a relapse rate of 32% and a disease-free survival rate of 43%. Thereafter, this regimen was tested in a randomized trial (trial II) under the auspices of the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG study 8612). The FTBI/VP-16 regimen was compared with the combination of busulfan and cyclophosphamide (BU/CY). A recent analysis indicates a disease-free advantage for patients prepared with FTBI/VP-16; however this difference is not statistically significant. In another trial (trial III), patients in their first remission of leukemia were prepared with the FTBI/VP-16 regimen and long-term disease-free survival was found to be 60-70% with a relapse rate of approximately 10%. These results compare favorably with data obtained with alternative preparatory regimens. The FTBI/VP-16 regimen is currently being compared to the 'standard' regimen, FTBI/CY, in a prospective trial (trial IV). Since the regimen-related toxicity has been relatively low, we have added one dose of CY 60 mg/kg to the FTBI/VP-16 combination. This regimen (trial V) is currently being tested in patients with advanced leukemia.

Since there were no individual data regarding exposure to agricultural chemicals and acquiring such data was not realistic, we obtained crude and hypothetical estimates for exposure by dividing the data into time periods, year-of-birth cohorts and geographical areas. The cohort was followed-up in the Cancer Environment Register from 1 January 1971 either until death or until 31 December 1987. The relative risk was computed as the ratio of the observed and expected number of cases (SIR = standardized incidence ratio). A total of 15,040 cases were observed vs 18,918 expected, resulting in a statistically significant decreased SIR of 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.78-0.81). The SIR was significantly decreased for several cancer sites, and the lowest value was found for tongue, lung, oesophagus, liver and urinary organs, which is in agreement with other studies on cancer risks among farmers. Other major cancer sites with decreased SIRs were the colon, rectum, pancreas and kidney. Lip cancer and multiple myeloma showed statistically significant increased risks. SIRs for stomach cancer, prostate cancer, skin carcinoma, malignant melanoma, tumours in connective tissue or muscle, malignant lymphomas and leukaemia were all close to unity, which is not consistent with several other studies that have shown increased risks for these sites. For malignant lymphomas the SIR increased over time, though not significantly, and was highest among younger farmers. The SIR for non-Hodgkin lymphoma was lowest in the northernmost region. This gives some support to the hypothesis that there is an association between non-Hodgkin lymphoma and exposure to pesticides and other agricultural chemicals. It is of note that the SIR for multiple myeloma was significantly increased in those parts of Sweden where the use of pesticides has been less frequent and in lower amounts.","['Wiklund, K', 'Dich, J']","['Wiklund K', 'Dich J']","['Department of Cancer Epidemiology, Radiumhemmet, Karolinska Institute and Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer Prev,European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP),9300837,['0 (Agrochemicals)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Agriculture', 'Agrochemicals/adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lip Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",,1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00008469-199502000-00008 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Prev. 1995 Feb;4(1):81-90. doi: 10.1097/00008469-199502000-00008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Questionnaire survey of 15-16 year olds, and interviews with play materials with 9-10 year old children. SETTING: Six inner city, suburban, and rural schools. SUBJECTS: 226 children aged 15-16 years and 100 aged 9-10 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Knowledge about different types of cancer; beliefs about health; sources of information; quality of research data obtainable from young children about cancer and health. RESULTS: Both samples knew most about lung cancer, but there was also some knowledge of breast and skin cancer and leukaemia. Smoking, together with pollution and other environmental factors, were seen as the dominant causes of cancer. Environmental factors were mentioned more often by the inner city samples. Television and the media were the most important sources of information. Young people were more worried about unemployment than about ill health. More than half the young people did not describe their health as good, and most said they did not have a healthy lifestyle. Children were able to provide detailed information about their knowledge and understanding by using drawings as well as interviews. CONCLUSIONS: Children and young people possess considerable knowledge about cancer, especially about lung cancer and smoking, and show considerable awareness of predominant health education messages. Despite this knowledge, many lead less than healthy lifestyles. Health is not seen as the most important goal in life by many young people; the circumstances in which many children and young people live are not experienced as health promoting.","['Oakley, A', 'Bendelow, G', 'Barnes, J', 'Buchanan, M', 'Husain, O A']","['Oakley A', 'Bendelow G', 'Barnes J', 'Buchanan M', 'Husain OA']","['Social Science Research Unit, University of London Institute of Education.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Child', 'Female', '*Health Behavior', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/etiology/psychology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/etiology/prevention & control/*psychology', 'Psychology, Adolescent', 'Smoking/adverse effects', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",PMC2549428,1995/04/22 00:00,1995/04/22 00:01,['1995/04/22 00:00'],"['1995/04/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/22 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.310.6986.1029 [doi]'],ppublish,BMJ. 1995 Apr 22;310(6986):1029-33. doi: 10.1136/bmj.310.6986.1029.,,,,,,,,['BMJ 1995 May 13;310(6989):1231'],,,,,,,,,,,

Two areas of investigation are currently under study in both the laboratory and clinic: reversal of gluthathione-mediated resistance and of P-glycoprotein mediated resistance. Studies are directed toward determining the role of the resistance mechanism in cancer, and toward its reversal. Increased expression of gluthathione and related enzymes, such as the gluthathione S-transferases, has been shown in human tumor samples. Phase I clinical studies with buthionine sulfoxime (BSO) have shown that gluthathione can be depleted without undue normal tissue toxicity. Now, clinical studies are underway evaluating the ability of BSO to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy. Expression of P-glycoprotein has been described in human tumors, with increased levels observed after natural product chemotherapy in some malignancies. Studies with P-glycoprotein antagonists have been conducted in leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma and in a variety of advanced malignancies. These studies have employed ""first generation"" antagonists such as verapamil and cyclosporine which were toxic at concentrations needed to block P-glycoprotein. Currently, studies are underway with ""second generation"" antagonists such as the dex stereoisomer of verapamil and the cyclosporine analogue, PSC 833. These agents may help determine the role of P-glycoprotein in clinical drug resistance. Together, these studies are aimed toward improving chemotherapeutic sensitivity in human cancer.","['Bates, S E', 'Regis, J I', 'Robey, R W', 'Zhan, Z', 'Scala, S', 'Meadows, B J']","['Bates SE', 'Regis JI', 'Robey RW', 'Zhan Z', 'Scala S', 'Meadows BJ']","['Medicine Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'I9ZF7L6G2L (Nifedipine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Dipyridamole/therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Nifedipine/therapeutic use', 'Verapamil/therapeutic use']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Cancer. 1994 Dec;81 Suppl 2:55s-61s.,,,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 634 samples of BM and/or peripheral blood were obtained for PCR analysis between 3 and 192 months after BMT. A positive PCR test at 3 months post-BMT was not statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of relapse compared with PCR-negative patients. However, a positive PCR assay at 6 months and beyond was highly associated with subsequent relapse. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of relapse for patients testing PCR-positive at 6 to 12 months was 42% versus 3% for PCR-negative patients (P < .0001). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival at 4 years for the PCR-positive patients was 74% compared with 83% for the PCR-negative group (P = .002). Multivariable analysis indicated that a PCR-positive result at 6 to 12 months post-BMT, the type of BMT donor (allogeneic matched donor v mismatched or unrelated), and the presence of acute GVHD were independent risk factors for subsequent relapse. The relative risk (RR) for relapse for patients PCR-positive at 6 to 12 months post-BMT was 26.1 (95% confidence interval, 8.9 to 76.1, P < .0001). The outcome of long-term patients (> 36 months post-BMT) who tested PCR-positive was much better, as 15 of 59 (25%) tested positive for bcr-abl, but only one patient relapsed. There was a 91% concordance between PCR tests of simultaneously obtained BM and peripheral blood. These analyses show that the PCR assay of the bcr-abl fusion transcript 6 to 12 months post-BMT is an independent predictor of subsequent relapse which provides an opportunity for early therapeutic intervention.","['Radich, J P', 'Gehly, G', 'Gooley, T', 'Bryant, E', 'Clift, R A', 'Collins, S', 'Edmands, S', 'Kirk, J', 'Lee, A', 'Kessler, P']","['Radich JP', 'Gehly G', 'Gooley T', 'Bryant E', 'Clift RA', 'Collins S', 'Edmands S', 'Kirk J', 'Lee A', 'Kessler P', 'et al.']","['Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Risk', 'Single-Blind Method', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76918-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 May 1;85(9):2632-8.,,"['ABL', 'BCR']",,"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The promoters were used without enhancers, or with enhancers derived from the beta-globin locus control region and the alpha-globin HS-40 enhancer. When transfected into K562 cells, which express zeta-globin, comparable amounts of activity were obtained from the -557 and -417 zeta-luciferase constructs and the alpha-luciferase constructs when no enhancers or the alpha-globin locus enhancers were used. When the constructs were transfected into OCIM1 cells, which do not express zeta-globin, the zeta-globin promoters were at best 20% as active as the alpha-globin promoters. When sequences from -417 to -207 5' to the zeta-globin mRNA cap site were deleted, up to 95% of the zeta-globin promoter activity was lost in K562 cells. Reinsertion of these sequences into zeta-luciferase constructs missing the -417 to -207 region showed that the sequences lack classical enhancer activity. Point mutation of a GATA-1 site at -230 reduced promoter activity by 37%. Point mutation of a CCACC site at -240 had no effect. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that the -230 GATA-1 site has a relatively low affinity for GATA-1. These experiments show the presence of a strong positive-acting element, located between -417 and -207 bp 5' to the zeta-globin mRNA cap site, is necessary for high-level promoter activity in K562 cells. This element requires GATA-1 and additional unknown factors for maximal activity.","['Sabath, D E', 'Koehler, K M', 'Yang, W Q', 'Patton, K', 'Stamatoyannopoulos, G']","['Sabath DE', 'Koehler KM', 'Yang WQ', 'Patton K', 'Stamatoyannopoulos G']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Genes, Synthetic', 'Globins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76913-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 May 1;85(9):2587-97.,,,,"['DK45365/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL07312D/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL20899/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mutations of the p53 gene were found in 2 of 20 t(1;19)-ALL cases at diagnosis (10%), all of 4 cases at relapse (100%), and 4 of the 5 cell lines (80%). Four of the five patients who died had missense mutations at codons 49, 177, 179, and 248. In cases examined sequentially, one had the same point mutation at codon 179 at both diagnosis and relapse, and another had the same p53 gene mutation at codon 240 both in leukemic cells at relapse and in a cell line derived at that time. The other case had no mutation at diagnosis but had the mutation at codon 177 at relapse and cell lines derived from blast cells at diagnosis, suggesting that a small number of leukemic cells with the p53 gene mutation at diagnosis might have escaped PCR-SSCP analysis. In cell lines, SCMC-L9 had three point mutations in the p53 gene at codons 175, 248, and 358, whereas SCMC-L10 had frame shift at codons 209-211. One case had a rare polymorphism at codon 11.

This case showed no mutation of the p53 gene and has had a good course. These results suggest that in t(1;19)-ALL, mutations of the p53 and ras genes are infrequent at diagnosis and that p53 gene alterations may be associated with relapse phase or progression of t(1;19)-ALL.","['Kawamura, M', 'Kikuchi, A', 'Kobayashi, S', 'Hanada, R', 'Yamamoto, K', 'Horibe, K', 'Shikano, T', 'Ueda, K', 'Hayashi, K', 'Sekiya, T']","['Kawamura M', 'Kikuchi A', 'Kobayashi S', 'Hanada R', 'Yamamoto K', 'Horibe K', 'Shikano T', 'Ueda K', 'Hayashi K', 'Sekiya T', 'et al.']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19/*ultrastructure', 'Codon/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Genes, Immediate-Early', '*Genes, p53', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/genetics', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Failure']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76908-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 May 1;85(9):2546-52.,,"['E2A', 'H-ras', 'Ha-ras-1', 'K-ras', 'N-ras', 'PBX1', 'p53', 'ras']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similarly, IL-10 stimulated (P = .001) the proliferation of freshly-explanted myeloma cells in IL-6-deprived cultures of tumor samples from patients with active multiple myeloma (MM) and produced twice as many myeloma cells in these cultures. Again, this cytokine was unable to induce further differentiation (assessed by rate of Ig production) of fresh myeloma cells. A very sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; 1 pg/mL) only rarely detected IL-10 in the sera of MM patients (3 of 89).

Natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) were shown to lyse C1498 in vitro through the binding of leukocyte function antigen-1 (LFA-1) on effectors and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and ICAM-2 on C1498 target cells. However, the ability of nonimmunized mice to resist an in vivo challenge of a low dose (10(4)) of C1498 was NK-cell, but not T-cell dependent. The failure of T cells to participate in the immune surveillance of a low leukemia burden appeared, in part, because of a lack of expansion of leukemia reactive CTL precursors (CTLp). Leukemia reactive CTLp frequency estimations in naive and leukemia bearing mice were not significantly different (range, 1:20,600 to 1:74,000) in contrast to immunized mice (range, 1:1,400 to 1:4,400). Leukemia reactive CTLp could be expanded to a level that could apparently mediate in vivo immune surveillance of 10(5) leukemia cells by injection of irradiated leukemia cells intraperitoneally (IP) or subcutaneously (SC), but not intravenously (IV). However, IV injection of 10(5) live leukemia cells engineered to secrete interleukin-2 (IL-2) resulted in systemic immunity mediated primarily by CD8+ T cells. We conclude that NK cells can mediate immune surveillance of a low leukemia burden. CD8+ CTL-mediated immune surveillance can eliminate a higher leukemia burden than NK cells, but requires T-cell help, which can be delivered by local IL-2. Both NK and CTL-mediated immune surveillance of C1498 murine myeloid leukemia is dependent on recognition through the LFA-1:ICAM adhesion pathway.","['Boyer, M W', 'Orchard, P J', 'Gorden, K B', 'Anderson, P M', 'Mclvor, R S', 'Blazar, B R']","['Boyer MW', 'Orchard PJ', 'Gorden KB', 'Anderson PM', 'Mclvor RS', 'Blazar BR']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota Hospital and Clinic, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (ICAM2 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigen Presentation', '*Antigens, CD', 'CD8 Antigens/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*physiology', 'Female', 'H-2 Antigens/immunology', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunization/methods', 'Immunologic Surveillance/drug effects', 'Immunotherapy', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*physiology', 'Interleukin-2/*physiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*immunology/pathology/prevention & control', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/radiation effects/transplantation', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76902-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 May 1;85(9):2498-506.,,,,['P01-CA21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median age of the 31 male and 19 female patients was 9 years (range 2 to 18). Only 13 patients were serologically matched at HLA-A, B, DR, and DQ with their donors; 6 of these were reactive in mixed lymphocyte culture. The other 37 patients were mismatched for one (36 patients) or more (1 patient) HLA antigens. Pretransplant conditioning included cytosine arabinoside, cyclophosphamide, fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) (with lung, liver, and more recently, kidney shielding), and methylprednisolone. High-risk patients also received busulfan. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of T-cell depletion with IgM monoclonal antibody T10B9 plus complement and posttransplant cyclosporine-A. Forty-nine patients (98%) engrafted. Median times to greater than 500 polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN)/microL and greater than 25,000 platelets/microL were 18 and 20 days, respectively. Acute GVHD > or = grade II occurred in 16 patients (33%); 13 (81%) of these died. Chronic GVHD developed in 30 of 40 patients at risk, but was extensive in only 5. Event-free survival (EFS) for all patients was 44% +/- 7% (median follow-up was 49 months), and overall survival was 50 +/- 7%. Patients with low-risk disease (ALL or AML in first or second remission and CML in chronic phase) had a better EFS than children with high-risk disease (60% v 34%, P = .07). There was no significant difference in EFS between patients who were serologically matched with their donors (46%) and those who were partially mismatched (43%) (P = .97). These data compare favorably with published reports for children transplanted with HLA-matched sibling donors and should encourage earlier consideration of unrelated donor BMT in children with leukemia or myelodysplasia.","['Casper, J', 'Camitta, B', 'Truitt, R', 'Baxter-Lowe, L A', 'Bunin, N', 'Lawton, C', 'Murray, K', 'Hunter, J', 'Pietryga, D', 'Garbrecht, F']","['Casper J', 'Camitta B', 'Truitt R', 'Baxter-Lowe LA', 'Bunin N', 'Lawton C', 'Murray K', 'Hunter J', 'Pietryga D', 'Garbrecht F', 'et al.']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/prevention & control/therapy', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/etiology/mortality', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Infections/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Lung Diseases, Interstitial/etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', '*Tissue Donors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation', 'Wisconsin/epidemiology']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76885-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 May 1;85(9):2354-63.,,,,"['AI28034/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA01534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA39854/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This locus undergoes frequent bi-allelic deletion in human cancer cell lines, suggesting that the encoded proteins may function as tumor suppressors. However, more recent analysis of primary tumor samples has shown a much lower frequency of abnormalities affecting this region, raising doubt over the importance of these proteins in human malignancies. Hemizygous deletions and rearrangements of chromosome 9, band p21, are among the most frequent cytogenetic abnormalities detected in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), occurring in approximately 10% of cases. To determine if the p16INK4a/p15INK4b locus might be the target of these chromosomal lesions, we analyzed both genes in primary clinical samples from 43 pediatric ALL patients using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization, Southern blot analysis, and the polymerase chain reaction. Deletions of p16INK4a/p15INK4b were identified in 18 of 20 cases with cytogenetically observed abnormalities of 9p and 5 of 23 with apparently normal chromosomes 9p, with the majority containing bi-allelic deletions (16 homozygous/7 hemizygous). Although most homozygous deletions involved both genes, Southern blot analysis showed an interstitial deletion in a single case that was confined to p16INK4a, suggesting that p15INK4b was not the critical target gene in this case. Sequence analysis of both p16INK4a and p15INK4b in all seven cases with hemizygous deletions failed to show mutations within the coding regions of the retained alleles. In this select group of patients, deletion of p16INK4a/p15INK4b was associated with T-cell phenotype, nonhyperdiploid karyotype (< 50 chromosomes), and poor event-free survival. These findings indicate that deletion of the p16INK4a/p15INK4b locus is one of the most common genetic abnormalities so far detected in pediatric ALL, and that loss of one or more of these cell cycle kinase inhibitors is important in leukemogenesis.","['Okuda, T', 'Shurtleff, S A', 'Valentine, M B', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Head, D R', 'Behm, F', 'Curcio-Brint, A M', 'Liu, Q', 'Pui, C H', 'Sherr, C J']","['Okuda T', 'Shurtleff SA', 'Valentine MB', 'Raimondi SC', 'Head DR', 'Behm F', 'Curcio-Brint AM', 'Liu Q', 'Pui CH', 'Sherr CJ', 'et al.']","[""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*ultrastructure', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76881-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 May 1;85(9):2321-30.,,"['MTS1', 'MTS2', 'PCTAIRE-3', 'p15<up>INK4b</up>', 'p16<up>INK4a</up>']",,"['CA-20150/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-47064/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the absence of telomerase, the enzyme that synthesizes telomeric DNA, telomeres shorten with cell division, a process thought to contribute to cell senescence and the proliferative crisis of transformed cells. We reported telomere stabilization concomitant with detection of telomerase activity in cells immortalized in vitro and in ovarian carcinoma cells, and suggested that telomerase is essential for unlimited cell proliferation. We have now examined the temporal pattern of telomerase expression in selected hematologic malignancies. We found that, unlike other somatic tissues, peripheral, cord blood, and bone marrow leukocytes from normal donors expressed low levels of telomerase activity. In leukocytes from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients, activity was lower than in controls in early disease, and comparable with controls in late disease. Relative to bone marrow, telomerase activity was enhanced in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and more significantly so in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Regardless of telomerase levels, telomeres shortened with progression of the diseases. Our results suggest that early CLL and MDS cells lack an efficient mechanism of telomere maintenance and that telomerase is activated late in the progression of these cancers, presumably when critical telomere loss generates selective pressure for cell immortality.","['Counter, C M', 'Gupta, J', 'Harley, C B', 'Leber, B', 'Bacchetti, S']","['Counter CM', 'Gupta J', 'Harley CB', 'Leber B', 'Bacchetti S']","['Department of Pathology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics', 'DNA/analysis', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Fibroblasts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes/*enzymology', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Skin', 'Telomere/*chemistry']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76880-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 May 1;85(9):2315-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This latter transport system was inhibited by adenosine and inosine (Ki = 110 and 260 microM, respectively), whereas guanosine and thymidine were less effective (Ki = 1600 and 1200 microM, respectively). Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) caused a concentration-dependent decrease in facilitated uridine transport. This change was attributable to a decrease in the number of transporter molecules as determined by the binding of [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine to cell membranes. Moreover, the Na(+)-dependent transport of uridine was enhanced by DMSO at a concentration of the polar solvent as low as 0.4%. When HL-60 cells were exposed to 1.0% DMSO, a marked increase in Na(+)-dependent uridine transport occurred within 72 hr, a time preceding maximum granulocytic differentiation. This change was attributable to an increase in transport affinity (Km = 1.54 +/- 0.65 microM), with no change in Vmax (Vmax = 0.13 +/- 0.02 microM/s). The consequence of these changes was the generation of a 3- to 4-fold increase in the intracellular concentration of uridine relative to the medium at a physiological concentration of 5 microM uridine. Similar increases in transport affinity were observed for adenosine, inosine, guanosine and thymidine in DMSO-differentiated HL-60 cells (Km values of 2 to 5 microM).

This conclusion is based both upon the greater incidence of the disease with advancing age and the increasing distribution of elderly people in western cultures. Three questions have arisen that form the underpinnings of the evolving subspecialty of geriatric oncology. These are: Why are tumors more frequent in the elderly? Is there a difference in tumor aggressiveness with advancing age? And, should treatment be different for the older patient? Experimental data and clinical experience have indicated that tumors are not resistant to treatment by virtue of age alone. However, age is associated with slight reductions in certain organ functions, and these deficiencies might be magnified by comorbid conditions. Cancer treatments, especially chemotherapy may therefore be more toxic and therefore treatment should be tailored for the individual taking into consideration potential increased toxicities balanced by patients expectations.

Typical of the most developed mammals are the bone marrow, the lymphatic system with regional lymph nodes and consequently the pathologic development of the diversity of leukemias, malignancies without stroma. In the German literature the leukemias are considered systemic diseases because the floating cells they discharge are more or less uniformly pathologically underdeveloped. The leukemias are named according to the major abnormal cell type (e.g. monocytic acute leukemia). Acute and chronic is the distinction of the time limitation regarding the development and duration of the disease. More complicated is the discharge of motile cells from primary tumors or daughter tumors deriving from solid tumors. These motile cells enter into the circulation via the lymphatic spaces or by penetration of the endothelium of the blood vessels. They move freely in the circulatory system until settling in a more or less distant region. The process of detecting these cells is known as carcinocythemia. Other movable cells during neoplastic progression are those populating effusions in the coelomic cavities.

Novel strategies to accelerate hematopoietic reconstitution have become accepted and/or are rapidly being implemented. These include the use of PBSC's as compared to BM stem cells. PBSC's appear to accelerate hematopoietic reconstitution, have a lower likelihood of occult tumor cell contamination and contain a greater number of T cells in the product which may allow an accelerated immunologic reconstitution post transplantation. Similarly, the concept of GVT is no longer viewed as an epiphenomenon but following allotransplantation is an objectively supported and clinically important phenomena. Further, post transplantation adjunct therapy with a variety of immunoaugmenting agents may induce an autologous GVT response. Additional benefits of PBSCT beyond those associated with the accelerated hematopoietic reconstitution and concomitant tumor reduction is the reduced expense of transplantation due to a shorter stay within the hospital. The isolation of stem cells (CD-34+) with or without ex vivo expansion to reduce the amount of stem cell product required is also an exciting new clinical strategy. This approach may also reduce the tumor cell contamination of the stem cell product, result in a more rapid hematologic reconstitution and reduce costs. However, it also has a potential down side due to a reduced infusion of mature and functional T cells. The comparison of PBSC to BM for transplantation of NHL suggests that the infusion of, or rapid reconstitution of, a functional immune system may have therapeutic benefit as discussed above. Thus, in addition to strategies based on the induction of an autologous GVT there is the need to develop/initiate clinic strategies to overcome the immunosuppression-anergy associated with stem cell transplantation, as well as, augment tumor specific T cell responses to ""mop up"" the residual tumor cells post transplantation. Clearly the clinical use of cytokines, especially in conjunction with PBSCT, has as a goal not only the reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with standard therapy but also dose intensification and scheduled compression so that increasing numbers of individuals may survive their current neoplasia. However, to date the use of the ex vivo expansion of stem and progenitor cells remains a largely unexplored clinical application for use in transplantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Talmadge, J E']",['Talmadge JE'],"['Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha 68198-5660, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Fetal Blood', 'Graft vs Host Reaction', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Neoplasms/*therapy']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vivo. 1994 Nov-Dec;8(5):675-90.,,,189,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this assessment of the frequency and distribution of non-albicans Candida species among patients with cancer, 37 reports that were published between 1952 and 1992 and that described 1,591 cases of systemic candida infection were reviewed. Species other than Candida albicans accounted for 46% of all systemic candida infections in patients with cancer; specifically, Candida tropicalis accounted for 25%, Candida glabrata for 8%, Candida parapsilosis for 7%, and Candida krusei for 4%. Other species were uncommon. C. tropicalis was the predominant pathogenic Candida species in five reports, C. glabrata in two, C. krusei in two, and Candida stellatoidea in one. The perception that, over time, a greater proportion of candida infections have been caused by non-albicans species was not borne out. The wide variability in reported findings was striking and was due in part to differences in the underlying disease affecting the patients described. For example, patients with leukemia were more likely to be infected by C. albicans or C. tropicalis but less likely to be infected by C. glabrata than patients with other types of cancer. The recent increase in the rate of bone marrow transplantation may also have contributed to discrepancies among reports. Bone marrow transplant recipients were more likely to be infected by C. krusei or C. lusitaniae. The other factors partially responsible for the variability among reports included common-source contamination and the pressures imposed by antimicrobial measures.","['Wingard, J R']",['Wingard JR'],"['Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,,IM,"['Candida/classification/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Candidiasis/*complications/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Opportunistic Infections/*complications/microbiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Species Specificity']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/clinids/20.1.115 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 1995 Jan;20(1):115-25. doi: 10.1093/clinids/20.1.115.,,,116,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sub-cellular fractionation of HL-60 cells by differential centrifugation showed that both A and S forms were present in the lysosomal and post-lysosomal (soluble) fractions in approximately equal abundance. Ion-exchange chromatography showed that a fraction enriched with plasma membranes had the A form, and a form of beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase less acidic than A, but there was no S. Analysis of the alpha-subunits of beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases A and S using Western blotting and immuno-detection with antisera raised to synthetic peptides showed that mature alpha-subunits were present in both A and S isolated from the lysosomal fraction. This observation establishes that the alpha alpha-dimer of beta-N-acetyl-hexosaminidase (S) can be transported to lysosomes in HL-60 cells whereas there is good evidence that this does not take place in fibroblasts. HL-60 cells were not stimulated to secrete lysosomal enzymes by incubating them with NH4Cl and, unlike fibroblasts, are unlikely to use mannose-6-phosphate mediated transport of beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases to lysosomes. Comparison of the sequence of the beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase alpha-subunit with a 43 amino acid sequence of cathepsin D, though to function in the mannose-6-phosphate independent targeting of this enzyme to lysosomes, showed alignment in a region towards the C-terminus in which 21% of the residues were identical with the interposition of a one amino acid gap.","['Martino, S', 'Emiliani, C', 'Orlacchio, A', 'Hosseini, R', 'Stirling, J L']","['Martino S', 'Emiliani C', 'Orlacchio A', 'Hosseini R', 'Stirling JL']","[""Division of Life Sciences, King's College London, Campden Hill, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '01Q9PC255D (Ammonium Chloride)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Mannosidases)', 'EC 3.2.1.24 (alpha-Mannosidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Ammonium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*analysis/chemistry/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Lysosomes/enzymology', 'Mannosidases/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Subcellular Fractions/chemistry/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'alpha-Mannosidase', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/*analysis']",,1995/04/13 00:00,1995/04/13 00:01,['1995/04/13 00:00'],"['1995/04/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/13 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304-4165(94)00179-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-4165(94)00179-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1995 Apr 13;1243(3):489-95. doi: 10.1016/0304-4165(94)00179-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, they inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in DNA synthesis, from Escherichia coli and murine adenocarcinoma TA3 cells. They also inhibit tumor cell proliferation. Reaction of thionitrites with protein R1, the large subunit, results in the nitrosation of cysteines, as shown from the formation of a chromophore with a characteristic absorption at 340 nm. EPR spectroscopy both on whole murine R2-overexpressing L1210 cells and on the pure protein showed that the tyrosyl radical of protein R2, the small subunit, reversibly couples to the NO radical, presumably leading to nitrosotyrosine adducts. Both molecular events might be at the origin of the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase by NO, since a number of cysteines and the tyrosyl radical are essential for catalysis. These results identify NO donors as a new class of inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase with potential applications as anticancer or antiviral chemotherapy agents.","['Roy, B', 'Lepoivre, M', 'Henry, Y', 'Fontecave, M']","['Roy B', 'Lepoivre M', 'Henry Y', 'Fontecave M']","[""Laboratoire d'Etudes Dynamiques et Structurales de la Selectivite, URA CNRS DO-332, Universite Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Nitrites)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/enzymology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology', 'Free Radicals', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Nitric Oxide/*pharmacology', 'Nitrites/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/analysis']",,1995/04/25 00:00,1995/04/25 00:01,['1995/04/25 00:00'],"['1995/04/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/25 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00016a012 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1995 Apr 25;34(16):5411-8. doi: 10.1021/bi00016a012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eight additional cases, including two of the nodular lymphocyte predominant type.",479-84,"Several reports of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and of coexisting or subsequent Hodgkin's disease (HD) have raised the question how these two disorders are related. The authors have identified eight new cases of B-cell low-grade lymphoproliferative disorders (LGLPD) and HD. Six of these cases were similar to those previously reported on by others in that the HD were mixed cellularity, nodular sclerosing, and lymphocyte depleted subtypes. The morphology in these cases was typical of HD, as was the immunohistochemical profile. However, the two remaining cases were notable in that the HD was of the nodular lymphocyte predominant type (NLPHD). To our knowledge, this association has not been well documented previously. In the two cases in this study, CLL and NLPHD were found simultaneously when each patient presented with lymphadenopathy and a lymphocytosis that was comprised of small monoclonal B lymphocytes coexpressing CD5. Lymph node biopsies in each case revealed typical NLPHD, with large, indistinct nodules containing scattered lymphocytic-histiocytic (L&H) cells. Focal, but distinct areas of CLL/SLL were also present. Immunostaining of the lymph node biopsy specimens showed the L&H cells to be CD20- and CD45 positive, and to lack CD15 or evidence of light chain restriction. In one of these patients, a NLPHD-associated large cell lymphoma developed 8 months later. The large cells were CD20- and CD45 positive, with lambda light chain restriction. In contrast, the original CLL cells in this patient expressed kappa light chains. This report indicates that LGLPD can be associated with all subtypes of HD, including the NLP type. The discordant light chain restriction between the CLL and the NLPHD-associated large cell lymphoma in one of these cases indicates that the CLL and HD were probably not derived from the same clone.","['Weisenberg, E', 'Anastasi, J', 'Adeyanju, M', 'Variakojis, D', 'Vardiman, J W']","['Weisenberg E', 'Anastasi J', 'Adeyanju M', 'Variakojis D', 'Vardiman JW']","['Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms, Multiple Primary']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/103.4.479 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1995 Apr;103(4):479-84. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/103.4.479.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prevalence was 17.7% for the presence of blasts. The results showed that all samples with more than 5% blasts were detected by some WBC morphological flag: only 5 samples (2.2%) with less than 5% blasts showed no morphological flag. In most cases (86%), the flags observed were either the 'Atyp' flag or the 'Blast' flag or both simultaneously. The positive predictive value obtained by the 'Blast' flag for the true presence of blasts was 66.8%, and for the 'Atyp' flag 34.9%; it was 75.8% when both flags were present simultaneously.

The basis for the Agency action is the result of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) toxicology and carcinogenesis study of DDVP in rats and mice (NTP Technical Report No. 342, September 1989). In those experiments the NTP considered the result in the female mouse portion of the study to afford unequivocal evidence of carcinogenicity. The NTP considered the interpretations of the male and female rat and the male mouse studies to be less than clear. Despite the NTP interpretation, the EPA considers the male rat data (increased incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia) to be sufficient to warrant the regulatory change. The purpose of this report is to summarize a review of the interpretation of the NTP data and to assess the predictive validity of the results relative to potential human health impact. Critical review of experimental data indicates that the evidence for a carcinogenic effect of DDVP in animals is equivocal. Further, DDVP possess no in vivo mutagenic activity in mammalian assay systems and it bears no significant structural similarity to known carcinogens. Therefore, a weight-of-the-evidence analysis leads to the conclusion that DDVP poses neither mutagenic nor carcinogenic risks to humans exposed under normal conditions of use of foreseeable conditions of misuse.","['Mennear, J H']",['Mennear JH'],"['School of Pharmacy, Campbell University, Buies Creek, North Carolina 27506.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Regul Toxicol Pharmacol,Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,8214983,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '7U370BPS14 (Dichlorvos)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Dichlorvos/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/chemically induced/pathology', 'Rats']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0273-2300(84)71080-4 [pii]', '10.1006/rtph.1994.1080 [doi]']",ppublish,Regul Toxicol Pharmacol. 1994 Dec;20(3 Pt 1):354-61. doi: 10.1006/rtph.1994.1080.,,,38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these cell types, the radiation- and H2O2-mediated increase in c-jun mRNA levels could be prevented by pretreatment of the cells with N-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant, or H7, an inhibitor of protein kinase C and protein kinase A, but not by HA1004, a specific inhibitor of protein kinase A and G. These results suggest a role for protein kinase C and reactive oxygen intermediates in the induction of c-jun gene expression in both normal and tumor cells. We also investigated potential differences in c-jun gene expression induced by radiation or H2O2 in normal and tumor cells by examining steady-state c-jun mRNA levels in a number of human fibroblast, leukemia, melanoma, sarcoma and carcinoma cell types. We observed heterogeneity in the steady-state level of c-jun mRNA in both the untreated normal and tumor cells and in such cells exposed to ionizing radiation or to H2O2. Exposure to radiation produced a varied response which ranged from little or no induction to an increase in the steady-state level of the c-jun mRNA of more than two orders of magnitude. Exposure to H2O2 gave a pattern similar to that of ionizing radiation. The basis for the differential induction in response to these agents may be attributable to either cell lineage or genetic heterogeneity or a combination of these two parameters.","['Collart, F R', 'Horio, M', 'Huberman, E']","['Collart FR', 'Horio M', 'Huberman E']","['Center For Mechanistic Biology and Biotechnology, Argonne National Laboratory, Illinois 60439, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/*radiation effects', '*Genes, jun', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1995 May;142(2):188-96.,,['c-jun'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper presents the results of internationally combined analyses of mortality data on 95,673 workers (85.4% men) monitored for external exposure to ionizing radiation and employed for 6 months or longer in the nuclear industry of one of the three countries. These analyses were undertaken to obtain a more precise direct assessment of the carcinogenic effects of protracted low-level exposure to external, predominantly gamma, radiation. The combination of the data from the various studies increases the power to study associations between radiation and specific cancers. The combined analyses covered a total of 2,124,526 person-years (PY) at risk and 15,825 deaths, 3,976 of which were due to cancer. There was no evidence of an association between radiation dose and mortality from all causes or from all cancers. Mortality from leukemia, excluding chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)--the cause of death most strongly and consistently related to radiation dose in studies of atomic bomb survivors and other populations exposed at high dose rates--was significantly associated with cumulative external radiation dose (one-sided P value = 0.046; 119 deaths). Among the 31 other specific types of cancer studied, a significant association was observed only for multiple myeloma (one-sided P value = 0.037; 44 deaths), and this was attributable primarily to the associations reported previously between this disease and radiation dose in the Hanford (U.S.) and Sellafield (UK) cohorts. The excess relative risk (ERR) estimates for all cancers excluding leukemia, and leukemia excluding CLL, the two main groupings of causes of death for which risk estimates have been derived from studies of atomic bomb survivors, were -0.07 per Sv [90% confidence interval (CI): -0.4, 0.3] and 2.18 per Sv (90% CI: 0.1, 5.7), respectively. These values correspond to a relative risk of 0.99 for all cancers excluding leukemia and 1.22 for leukemia excluding CLL for a cumulative protracted dose of 100 mSv compared to 0 mSv. These estimates, which did not differ significantly across cohorts or between men and women, are the most comprehensive and precise direct estimates of cancer risk associated with low-dose protracted exposures obtained to date. Although they are lower than the linear estimates obtained from studies of atomic bomb survivors, they are compatible with a range of possibilities, from a reduction of risk at low doses, to risks twice those on which current radiation protection recommendations are based.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Cardis, E', 'Gilbert, E S', 'Carpenter, L', 'Howe, G', 'Kato, I', 'Armstrong, B K', 'Beral, V', 'Cowper, G', 'Douglas, A', 'Fix, J']","['Cardis E', 'Gilbert ES', 'Carpenter L', 'Howe G', 'Kato I', 'Armstrong BK', 'Beral V', 'Cowper G', 'Douglas A', 'Fix J', 'et al.']","['International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/etiology/mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/etiology/mortality', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Protection', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1995 May;142(2):117-32.,,,,['ES-88-15/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['Radiat Res. 1995 Dec;144(3):346-8.

As a step toward that goal, the current study reports the cloning of the rat ecotropic retroviral receptor (EcoR) cDNA and the study of various aspects of its expression in the intestinal tissues. The cDNA for rat EcoR was cloned by screening a size-selected rat intestinal cDNA library with mouse EcoR cDNA. A clone of approximately 7 kb, designated MP10, was obtained. Partial sequencing of MP10 from the 5' end revealed a level of similarity of 92% compared with mouse EcoR. The presence of a 5' untranslated region and a 3' poly(A) tract, together with the overall size of the cDNA, suggest that is very close to being a full-length cDNA for this large transcript. Northern blots with MP10 showed an RNA of approximately 7.9 kb present along the entire length of the small intestine and somewhat less abundant in the colon. Developmental studies showed high levels of EcoR in fetal rat intestine, a decline in the early postnatal period, then a gradual rise to adulthood. Caco-2 cells were used to assess the expression of EcoR in proliferating compared with differentiated intestinal epithelial cells. EcoR mRNA was found to be very much more abundant in nondifferentiated cells and declined to low levels as the cells underwent spontaneous differentiation. These patterns of EcoR expression indicate that ecotropic retroviruses should be suitable vectors with which to attempt gene transfer into the intestinal epithelium. In addition, since the endogenous role of EcoR is as the y+ cationic amino acid transporter, these data have significance for understanding patterns of amino acid transport in the intestinal epithelium.","['Puppi, M', 'Henning, S J']","['Puppi M', 'Henning SJ']","['Department of Cell Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030-3498, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Soc Exp Biol Med,"Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

The normal BCR protein is a multifunctional molecule with domains that suggest its participation in phosphokinase and GTP-binding pathways. Taken together with its localization to the cytoplasm of uncycled cells, it is therefore presumed to be involved in cytoplasmic signaling. By performing a double aphidicolin block for cell cycle synchronization, we currently demonstrate that the subcellular localization of BCR shifts from being largely cytoplasmic in interphase cells to being predominantly perichromosomal in mitosis. Furthermore, with the use of immunogold labeling and electron microscopy, association of BCR with DNA, in particular heterochromatin, can be demonstrated even in quiescent cells. Results were similar in cell lines of lymphoid or myeloid origin. These observations suggest a role for BCR in the phosphokinase interactions linked to condensed chromatin, a network previously implicated in cell cycle regulation.","['Wetzler, M', 'Talpaz, M', 'Yee, G', 'Stass, S A', 'Van Etten, R A', 'Andreeff, M', 'Goodacre, A M', 'Kleine, H D', 'Mahadevia, R K', 'Kurzrock, R']","['Wetzler M', 'Talpaz M', 'Yee G', 'Stass SA', 'Van Etten RA', 'Andreeff M', 'Goodacre AM', 'Kleine HD', 'Mahadevia RK', 'Kurzrock R']","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Heterochromatin)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['*Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes/*chemistry', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Heterochromatin/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Interphase/physiology', 'Leukemia', 'Mitosis/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins/*isolation & purification', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC42192,1995/04/11 00:00,1995/04/11 00:01,['1995/04/11 00:00'],"['1995/04/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/11 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.8.3488 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Apr 11;92(8):3488-92. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.8.3488.,,,,['CA-16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that in Swiss 3T3 cells with 4N DNA content, high levels of Mos lead to the production of binucleated cells. The Swiss 3T3 cells in mitosis, before binucleation occurs, are anastral and the spindle poles are juxtaposed to the cell membrane. These phenotypes may be related to the meiotic process of attachment of the spindle pole to the oocyte membrane during polar body formation. The production of binucleated somatic cells could result from attachment of the altered mitotic spindle pole to the cell membrane that interferes with cytokinesis but not karyokinesis. This can explain at least one form of genetic instability that leads to altered DNA content in tumor cells.","['Fukasawa, K', 'Vande Woude, G F']","['Fukasawa K', 'Vande Woude GF']","['Advanced BioScience Laboratories-Basic Research Program, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, MD 21702, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['0 (Oncogene Proteins v-mos)'],IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Meiosis/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/growth & development', 'Moloney murine sarcoma virus/genetics/growth & development', 'Oncogene Proteins v-mos/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Ploidies', 'Spindle Apparatus/physiology/*ultrastructure']",PMC42180,1995/04/11 00:00,1995/04/11 00:01,['1995/04/11 00:00'],"['1995/04/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/11 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.8.3430 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Apr 11;92(8):3430-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.8.3430.,,,,['N01-CO-46000/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The complex of prolactin with IgG was purified from serum by anti-human prolactin affinity chromatography and was shown to contain close to 1 mole of N epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)lysine crosslinks per mole of complex, a characteristic feature in structures crosslinked by transglutaminase. Interestingly, the complex caused a proliferation of cells from a subset of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, while it was inactive in a cell proliferation prolactin bioassay. By contrast, human prolactin stimulated the proliferation of cells in the bioassay but had no effect on the complex-responsive cells from the patients. Competition studies with prolactin and free Fc fragment of IgG demonstrated a necessity for engaging both the prolactin and the immunoglobulin receptors for proliferation. More importantly, competition for the growth response by free prolactin and IgG suggests both possible reasons for the slow growth of this neoplasm as well as avenues for control of the disease.","['Walker, A M', 'Montgomery, D W', 'Saraiya, S', 'Ho, T W', 'Garewal, H S', 'Wilson, J', 'Lorand, L']","['Walker AM', 'Montgomery DW', 'Saraiya S', 'Ho TW', 'Garewal HS', 'Wilson J', 'Lorand L']","['Division of Biomedical Sciences, University of California, Riverside 92521-0121, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '17105-15-6 (epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)-lysine)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Dipeptides/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/blood/*immunology/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/blood/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Prolactin/blood/*immunology/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Fc/metabolism']",PMC42149,1995/04/11 00:00,1995/04/11 00:01,['1995/04/11 00:00'],"['1995/04/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/11 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.8.3278 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Apr 11;92(8):3278-82. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.8.3278.,,,,"['HD00810/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD28726/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R29-DK40519/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous work has shown that intracellular antibodies targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can be used to capture specific proteins as they enter the ER, preventing their transport to the cell surface. Here we have used this technology to inhibit the cell surface expression of the alpha subunit of the high-affinity interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R alpha). A single-chain variable-region fragment of the anti-Tac monoclonal antibody was constructed with a signal peptide and a C-terminal ER retention signal. Intracellular expression of the single-chain antibody was found to completely abrogate cell surface expression of IL-2R alpha in stimulated Jurkat T cells. IL-2R alpha was detectable within the Jurkat cells as an immature 40-kDa form that was sensitive to endoglycosidase H, consistent with its retention in a pre- or early Golgi compartment. A single-chain antibody lacking the ER retention signal was also able to inhibit cell surface expression of IL-2R alpha although the mechanism appeared to involve rapid degradation of the receptor chain within the ER. These intracellular antibodies will provide a valuable tool for examining the role of IL-2R alpha in T-cell activation, IL-2 signal transduction, and the deregulated growth of leukemic cells which overexpress IL-2R alpha.","['Richardson, J H', 'Sodroski, J G', 'Waldmann, T A', 'Marasco, W A']","['Richardson JH', 'Sodroski JG', 'Waldmann TA', 'Marasco WA']","['Department of Pathology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (immunoglobulin Fv)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/therapy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis/immunology/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology']",PMC42120,1995/04/11 00:00,1995/04/11 00:01,['1995/04/11 00:00'],"['1995/04/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/11 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.8.3137 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Apr 11;92(8):3137-41. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.8.3137.,,,,"['AI28785/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI28691/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the transcriptional control of the predominant alpha form of topo II, the 5' flanking region of the human topo II alpha gene (positions -562 to +90) was subcloned into a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and transiently transfected into HL-60 human leukemia cells, a line capable of monocytic differentiation after treatment with various agents. Early in phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (30 nM)-induced differentiation (18-24 hr after treatment), an unexpected 3-5-fold activation of topo II alpha gene promoter activity was observed. Activation was observed in HL-60 cells and U-937 cells, but not in HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells. Sodium butyrate (NaB) (0.4 mM) also led to activation (4-17-fold) of the topo II alpha promoter in HL-60 and U-937 cells. Promoter sequences between position -90 and position +90 mediated the inducing effects of NaB. This NaB-dependent promoter-reporter induction was partly mirrored by a transient approximately 2-fold increase in endogenous topo II alpha enzyme. The stimulus for promoter activation could be partly attributed to a 2-fold increase in DNA synthesis at 16 hr for NaB, but not phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate. Regardless of the primary stimulus for topo II alpha promoter trans-activation, it could be bypassed by treatment of HL-60 cells with NaB for 48 hr before transfection, revealing the expected 60-70% suppression of topo II alpha promoter activity. Further study of topo II alpha promoter down-regulation later in monocytic differentiation may serve as a model for elucidating the transcriptional mechanisms that may also be exploited by tumor cells expressing intrinsic or acquired resistance to topo II-directed drugs.","['Fraser, D J', 'Brandt, T L', 'Kroll, D J']","['Fraser DJ', 'Brandt TL', 'Kroll DJ']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver 80262, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Butyrates)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*genetics', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/*physiology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1995 Apr;47(4):696-706.,,,,['DK08854/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T-cell depletion of the graft eliminates GVHD but also causes an unacceptable increase in rejections and leukaemic relapses.

There were 2 graft failures in the 33B3.1 group. The antibody did not significantly affect the cumulative frequency of acute GVHD of grade 2 or worse (19 [38%] vs 23 [46%]) but merely delayed its onset (median 36 [IQR 21-70] vs 25 [11-44] days; p < 0.01). At median follow-up of 58 (range 41-71) months, the antibody-treated group had significantly lower leukaemia-free survival (p < 0.05) mainly because of a progressive increase in the rate of late relapses (p = 0.08).

The results of recent molecular genetic studies have challenged this notion, since it was shown that both the paternal as well as the maternal BCR- and ABL-alleles may be affected by the translocation event and that both genes may be expressed from both alleles. This paper offers possible explanations for the apparent contradictory results obtained through cytogenetic and molecular genetic means.

This translocation gives rise to a 22q-, or Philadelphia (Ph), chromosome and a derivative 9q+. Based on heterochromatin polymorphisms, it was reported that the former is of maternal and the latter of paternal origin in every case of CML. This parental bias led to the hypothesis that the genes disrupted by the translocation, BCR and ABL, were themselves imprinted, and that in CML the BCR-ABL gene was formed by BCR sequences of maternal and ABL sequences of paternal origin. We have identified a BstNl restriction fragment length polymorphism in the ABL coding sequence which enabled us to investigate directly the expression and inheritance of the two ABL alleles in heterozygous CML patients. Amplification of the specific BCR-ABL and normal ABL mRNA messages by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in these patients showed that the ABL moiety of the BCR-ABL gene has an even chance of being the paternal or the maternal copy. We conclude therefore that there is no parental bias in the origin of the translocated ABL gene and no evidence for genomic imprinting of ABL in CML.","['Melo, J V', 'Yan, X H', 'Diamond, J', 'Goldman, J M']","['Melo JV', 'Yan XH', 'Diamond J', 'Goldman JM']","['LRF Leukaemia Unit, Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Parents', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Apr;9(4):734-9.,,"['ABL', 'BCR']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A strong correlation between weak bcl-2 expression and the presence of a p53 mutation detected by SSCP analysis and direct sequencing was found. Response to chemotherapy (intensive chemotherapy or low-dose Ara-C) and survival were not significantly influenced by the intensity of bcl-2 expression in blasts, although there was a trend for better response to chemotherapy and longer survival in patients with strong bcl-2 expression. This trend was no longer found, however, if patients with a p53 mutation were excluded. Our findings show that blasts from a majority of MDS cases have bcl-2 expression and that strong bcl-2 expression is not associated with a poor prognosis.

In view of the biological, clinical and prognostic relevance of the pathological fusion products, techniques permitting their detection are of paramount importance in the clinical setting. In some instances, permanent leukemic cell lines carrying the abnormality of interest are available for the establishment and standardization of molecular assays. For a number of newly discovered gene rearrangements, however, this may not be the case. It is therefore of great interest for clinical laboratories to have alternative technical possibilities for the set-up of standardized molecular tests. This problem provided the stimulus to design a simple and rapid method for in vitro generation of chimeric RNA molecules corresponding to pathological fusion transcripts typical for chromosomal translocations in leukemias. Two separate fragments are generated in a four-primer multiplex PCR. Due to a PCR-generated overlap, a chimeric fragment can be synthesized in a second round of PCR. This PCR product is then purified with the help of magnetic beads. Due to the SP6 promotor sequence incorporated during the second round of PCR, transcription into RNA is easily facilitated while the template DNA is still bound to the solid phase. Following this strategy we were able to synthesize the fusion transcripts m-BCR/ABL, CBF beta/MYH11, and MLL/AFp1 which are the molecular equivalents of t(9;22)(q34,q11), inv16(p13;q22) and t(1;11)(p32;q23), respectively. The chimeric RNA will be useful as a control template in diagnostic RT-PCR strategies. It can also be further processed in translation systems leading to the corresponding chimeric oncoprotein. This approach can be easily used to create any hybrid RNA of interest.","['Borkhardt, A', 'Mitteis, M', 'Brettreich, S', 'Schlieben, S', 'Hammermann, J', 'Repp, R', 'Kreuder, J', 'Buchen, U', 'Lampert, F']","['Borkhardt A', 'Mitteis M', 'Brettreich S', 'Schlieben S', 'Hammermann J', 'Repp R', 'Kreuder J', 'Buchen U', 'Lampert F']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, University of Giessen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Aberrations/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Genes, abl', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Myosins/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Apr;9(4):719-22.,,"['ABL', 'AF1', 'BCR', 'CBF&bgr;', 'MLL', 'MYH11']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is shown that MHSV additionally caused profound alterations of erythropoiesis, granulocytopoiesis and thrombocytopoiesis, and in the hemopoietic stem cell compartment. In the erythroid lineage, MHSV induced a normocytic peripheral anemia, which was paralleled by an unphysiologic, multifocal clonal expansion of erythroid blasts in the spleen. These cells were not transformed and appeared to have a maturation defect since blood reticulocytes did not increase above control values. Moreover, MHSV exerted cytopathic effects on neutrophilic granulocytes and megakaryocytes, since their numbers transiently decreased in the spleen, and agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia was observed in the blood. Nonetheless, regeneration was found in both lineages at later stages of the infection, which was accompanied by a terminal granulocytosis. The number of lineage-committed and multipotential colony-forming cells in the CFU-S assay increased transiently, but decreased to very low levels in the final stages of the disease. Thus, the studies demonstrate that the same etiologic agent, MHSV, had different effects on hemopoietic cells, which included malignant transformation, hyperproliferative and cytopathic effects.","['Eckmann, L', 'Pragnell, I B', 'Lohler, J']","['Eckmann L', 'Pragnell IB', 'Lohler J']","['Heinrich-Pette-Institut fur Experimentelle Virologie und Immunologie, Universitat Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Anemia/pathology', 'Animals', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Histiocytic Sarcoma/microbiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Organ Size', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/*pathogenicity', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Time Factors']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Apr;9(4):700-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preliminary results of a case-control study.,693-9,"We performed a case-control study of occupational and environmental risk factors in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) diagnosed at our institution, using the method of Siemiatycki. A control for each MDS case, matched for age, sex, and residence area was chosen. The questionnaire asked demographic data, medical history, and information on life-time environmental and occupational exposures. Occupational exposures were first assessed by job titles, then by evaluating exposure to a list of 70 chemicals, and the level and duration of exposure to those chemicals (exposure index). In the first 100 cases and controls analyzed, a significantly higher incidence of smokers or ex-smokers was seen in MDS cases (odds ratio, OR = 1.83, P = 0.03). A significant excess of MDS was found in male patients with jobs (or previous jobs) generally exposing to chemical compounds, including plant and machine operators and assemblers (odds ratio, OR = 3.73, P = 0.014) whereas, on the contrary, technicians and associate professionals were more often seen in controls (OR = 0.17, P = 0.002). In males, there was also a trend for more skilled agricultural workers and coal miners in MDS cases. In females, there was a non-significant trend for more professionals in controls. After adjusting for sex, age and smoking habits, significantly more frequent exposure to stone dusts (OR = 3.06, P = 0.011), and cereal dusts (OR = 2.27, P = 0.04) was found. There was also a trend for higher incidence of exposure to exhaust gases and nitro-organic explosives. In addition, significantly higher exposure indices to petrol and diesel derivatives (P = 0.03) and to fertilizers (P = 0.003) were seen in MDS cases, as compared to controls. No significant difference in exposure to other chemicals was seen between MDS cases and controls. These preliminary results of our study, which is accruing more cases, suggest, as two previously published case-control studies of risk factors in MDS, that exposure to some chemicals may be involved in the pathogenesis of MDS.","['Nisse, C', 'Lorthois, C', 'Dorp, V', 'Eloy, E', 'Haguenoer, J M', 'Fenaux, P']","['Nisse C', 'Lorthois C', 'Dorp V', 'Eloy E', 'Haguenoer JM', 'Fenaux P']","['Service de Medecine du Travail, Ergonomie (CERESTE), CHU Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/adverse effects', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Apr;9(4):693-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure to the myeloid growth-promoting cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) upregulates expression of ICAM-1 and LFA-3 on AML cells but does not increase their sensitivity to lysis by interleukin-2-activated natural killer cells (LAK) in 51Cr assays. However when AML cells are exposed to GM-CSF prior to incubation with LAK, their subsequent clonogenic activity is significantly reduced. If a blocking antibody to ICAM-1 is added during the incubation period of AML with LAK, the inhibitory effect is completely ablated. A less pronounced effect is observed with an antibody to LFA-3. ICAM-1 is expressed on a greater proportion of CD34+ than CD34- AML cells and exposure to GM-CSF induces a significantly greater upregulation of ICAM-1 on leukemic CD34+ cells than their CD34- counterparts. These data suggest that the inhibitory effect of IL-2-activated natural killer cells on clonogenic AML cells is mediated principally via the lymphocyte function associated molecule-1 (LFA-1)/ICAM-1 interaction. Interleukin-2 upregulates LFA-1 expression on natural killer cells.

Group B received three doses, administered subcutaneously every 24 h and receptor studies were performed 90 min after first injection and 24 h after the last. Before treatment neutrophils only displayed high-affinity receptors (KD 85 +/- 53 pM; number of receptors/cell 1318 +/- 567).

In group A patients, 48 h after a single dose of rhGM-CSF, receptors, albeit with a decreased affinity (KD = 240 +/- 131 pM; number of receptors/cell 783 +/- 494) were again expressed.

Taking advantage of clone-specific DNA sequences, generated during lymphocyte differentiation and the polymerase chain reaction, some strategies have been developed for several groups. Up to now the most specific and sensitive methodology, which consists of designing leukemia-specific oligonucleotides, requires sequencing of the complementary determining region III-DNA for each particular patient and is too laborious to be applied to each case for routine monitoring in most hospital laboratories. In an attempt to achieve an easy way to detect residual malignant cells in B lymphoproliferative diseases, we have used a new PCR-based approach, named here as PCR-nuclease protection assay, consisting of: (i) amplification of DNA segments corresponding to the complementarity determining region III of the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes from samples at disease diagnosis; (ii) isolation of the disease-specific single-stranded DNA; (iii) labeling of the single-stranded DNA to generate specific probes; (iv) hybridization to amplified DNA from samples corresponding to different disease phases; and (v) digestion with S1-nuclease.

Previous reports demonstrated mutations of this gene in both Burkitt's lymphoma and B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, dissimilar results were obtained in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). In one study, no mutation was detected in 43 NHL tissues. A second study reported p53 mutations in eight (all with advanced stage disease) out of 48 tissues obtained from Japanese NHL patients. Using both immunoblotting and radio-immunoprecipitation, we detected mutant p53 proteins in nine out of 10 B cell lines established from NHL tissues. The mutations were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-mediated single-strand conformational polymorphism (RT-PCR-SSCP) analysis in eight cell lines. The high frequency of p53 mutation in NHL B cell lines and the relatively low frequency of p53 mutations in fresh lymphoma tissue suggests that p53 gene alteration may play a role in lymphomagenesis and/or disease progression in a subset of B cell lymphomas and that the p53 mutation conveys a proliferative advantage on lymphoma cells that permits their in vitro growth.","['Li, C C', ""O'Connell, C D"", 'Beckwith, M', 'Longo, D L']","['Li CC', ""O'Connell CD"", 'Beckwith M', 'Longo DL']","['Biological Carcinogenesis and Development Program, Inc/Dyncorp, Frederick, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Apr;9(4):650-5.,,['p53'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined the third exon of bcl-2, directly adjacent to Ig sequences in the t(14;18), for point mutations. In particular, we studied the translated region of exon 3 in 45 NHLs by SSCP analysis and failed to detect a single point mutation. Further, we sequenced eleven t(14;18) breakpoints, including both bcl-2 and JH sequences, and detected only one point mutation, in a JH-derived sequence.

This progression is frequently preceded or accompanied by recurring secondary chromosomal abnormalities which are believed to play a role in the transformation. In order to investigate the relationship between the secondary change and the development of BP, we undertook a study using fluorescence in situ hybridization to determine in which cells the secondary abnormalities were present. We observed that in one case of L-BP, the secondary change (trisomy 8) appeared to be in a subclone that was different from the blast cells, as it was absent from the lymphoblasts but present in differentiating erythroid, monocytic and granulocytic cells. In two cases, the secondary change (trisomy 8, extra Ph) probably occurred prior to an acute transforming event as it was present in CP or AP predominantly in differentiated granulocytic or monocytic cells. In one case of M-BP, the secondary change (trisomy 8) probably occurred after the acute transformation, as it appeared in only a subset of the blasts. Lastly, in four cases of L-BP, the secondary change (monosomy 7, extra Ph or hyperdiploidy) was closely associated with the BP as it was present in all of the blasts. The findings indicate that some secondary abnormalities may be directly related to the development of BP and may provide clues to the identity of genes responsible for the acute phase transition. Other abnormalities occurring before, or after the acute transformation or in a different subclone from the acute phase blasts, may be more important for denoting genomic instability than for helping to understand the mechanism of blast transformation.","['Anastasi, J', 'Feng, J', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Larson, R A', 'Rowley, J D', 'Vardiman, J W']","['Anastasi J', 'Feng J', 'Le Beau MM', 'Larson RA', 'Rowley JD', 'Vardiman JW']","['Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*pathology', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Apr;9(4):628-33.,,,,['CA 42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-nine patients (38 B-lineage ALL, one T-ALL) with TCR delta rearrangements could be followed for 21 to 44 months (mean 30.9 months) excluding four patients who died. One hundred and ninety four bone marrow (BM) samples and 13 peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts were available for detection of MRD. Initially 34 cases were treated prospectively according to the CCLSG risk-stratified protocols for ALL (ALL874 or ALL911), and five cases according to the other protocols. Conventional chemotherapy was replaced by autologous PBSC transplantation (PBSCT) in five patients, by allogenic BM transplantation (BMT) in one patient, or suspended in another patient. Twenty-nine of 32 children in whom conventional chemotherapy could be continued without interruption remain in complete remission (CR). In 24 of the 29 patients MRD became undetectable within 12 months of their diagnosis. In five cases, BM samples obtained during maintenance therapy exhibited residual leukemia cells, and yet none of them relapsed (mean follow-up period 28.6 months). Our results thus indicate that intensive maintenance therapy for patients with PCR-positive results during consolidation therapy may prevent subsequent relapse. Nine events of relapse were diagnosed in eight patients (five BM, two isolated central nervous system (CNS), one combined BM and CNS, one isolated skin relapse). An increase or a re-emergence of MRD was detected in BM samples obtained from patients prior to BM relapse, but one patient remained in CR despite reappearance of leukemic cells following a PCR-negative status. Monitoring of MRD failed to predict isolated CNS or skin relapse. PBSCT allows high-dose cytoreduction therapy for patients with refractory neoplasia. In our study, leukemic cells were identified in eight of 13 PBSC grafts harvested from five patients. Three of four children who received PBSC grafts containing leukemic cells relapsed within 6 months after PBSCT.

These observations indicated that the frequency of p53 gene alterations in the acute and crisis types of ATL was markedly higher than that in chronic type, suggesting that p53 gene alteration plays a role in the disease progression of ATL.","['Nishimura, S', 'Asou, N', 'Suzushima, H', 'Okubo, T', 'Fujimoto, T', 'Osato, M', 'Yamasaki, H', 'Lisha, L', 'Takatsuki, K']","['Nishimura S', 'Asou N', 'Suzushima H', 'Okubo T', 'Fujimoto T', 'Osato M', 'Yamasaki H', 'Lisha L', 'Takatsuki K']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Frameshift Mutation', '*Genes, p53', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Apr;9(4):598-604.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The RNA quality from bone marrow cells was firstly assessed by gel electrophoresis to avoid false negativity because of the fragility of the APL cells and the PML-RARA transcripts. In 12 of 15 untreated patients, RT-PCR became negative during consolidation and intensification therapy 4-16 months after the initiation of therapy, whereas it remained positive in nine of 12 refractory patients. At the end of therapy, RT-PCR was negative in 14 patients and positive in 13 patients. The former patients remained in CR at median follow-up of 9 months after the end of therapy. In the latter, however, 10 patients relapsed at a median of 5 months after the end of therapy.

Reports of TdT-positive cells in acute myeloid leukemia have lately questioned its diagnostic value. TDT has been detected mainly by microscopy methods: immunofluorescence and immunocytochemistry. The aim of this study was to reevaluate the diagnostic importance of TdT in acute leukemia by using flow cytometry with a method that allows quantitative analysis. Fifty-eight cases of acute leukemia were studied and TdT expression was quantified using calibrated fluorescent beads. The highest TdT values were found in B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) while acute myeloid leukemia (AML) had the lowest values, even in cases with a high percentage of TdT-positive cells. Biphenotypic leukemia had intermediate values between B-lineage and T-lineage acute leukemia. The difference between these groups was statistically significant (P < 0.0001). The TdT assay by flow cytometry was more precise than immunocytochemistry because it recognizes quantitative differences between ALL and AML. It is also valuable in better defining the maturation stages in pre-B ALL and T-ALL. We conclude that quantitative flow cytometry of TdT re-establishes the diagnostic value of this enzyme and has potential applications for the study of minimal residual disease.","['Farahat, N', 'Lens, D', 'Morilla, R', 'Matutes, E', 'Catovsky, D']","['Farahat N', 'Lens D', 'Morilla R', 'Matutes E', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'B-Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*enzymology', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Apr;9(4):583-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only a few studies, however, have compared cytogenetic or molecular genetic findings to histopathology in CMPD. Diverging results on the presence of the Ph1-translocation in patients with myelofibrosis have been reported. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Cytogenetic studies and molecular analysis of the bcr gene were performed in bone marrow cells of patients with CMPD simultaneously with histopathologic examination of plastic-embedded bone marrow biopsies. RESULTS: The Ph1-chromosome was found in 120/128 (93%) cases with histopathologic diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), including a notable proportion of cases with an increase of megakaryocytes and/or myelofibrosis; the latter was associated with a significant increase of chromosome aberrations, in addition to Ph1. Among those additional changes in myelofibrosis of Ph1-positive CML were del (13q) and t(1;11) in one case each. A bcr gene rearrangement was detected in 92% (24/26) of the CML cases examined. All other groups of CMPD, comprising cases of myelofibrosis and unclassifiable cases, were Ph1-negative by both cytogenetics (n = 102) and molecular analysis (n = 18). Karyotype changes associated with myelofibrosis in various CMPD concerned mainly balanced translocations involving 1p36 and 11q11, deletions of 5q13-34, 3p, 11q23, 13(q12,q22), and 20q12 as well as gain of 1q and trisomy 3, 8, 19, or 21. In histologically unclassifiable CMPD, karyotyping provided additional information for the differential diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The correlation of cytogenetic findings and histopathologic features is helpful in confirming or supporting histopathologic diagnoses and in characterizing new marker chromosomes in CMPD.","['Werner, M', 'Nolte, M', 'Kaloutsi, V', 'Buhr, T', 'Kausche, F', 'Georgii, A']","['Werner M', 'Nolte M', 'Kaloutsi V', 'Buhr T', 'Kausche F', 'Georgii A']","['Pathologisches Institut, Medizinischen Hochschule, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Count', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chronic Disease', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', '*Karyotyping', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Molecular Biology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/*pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/pathology', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1995 Apr;72(4):405-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The source of the latter bias is different distributions of waiting times between achieving complete remission and receiving post-remission therapy. Several techniques to control these biases were evaluated; each gave qualitatively similar results. These methods can easily be applied to other clinical situations where randomized trials are not available.","['Messerer, D', 'Neiss, A', 'Horowitz, M M', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Gale, R P']","['Messerer D', 'Neiss A', 'Horowitz MM', 'Hoelzer D', 'Gale RP']","['BZT Biometric Centre for Therapeutic Studies, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Epidemiol,Journal of clinical epidemiology,8801383,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bias', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Databases, Factual', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', '*Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries', 'Remission Induction']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0895-4356(94)90098-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0895-4356(94)90098-1 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Epidemiol. 1994 Oct;47(10):1119-26. doi: 10.1016/0895-4356(94)90098-1.,,,,['P01-CA-40053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Six transgenic lines expressed the transgene and displayed a clear oncogenic phenotype. Of these, five developed an early onset, rapidly progressive erythroleukemia that resulted in death of the founder animals 30-50 d after birth. Transgenic progeny of the sixth founder, while also expressing the transgene, remained asymptomatic for more than 8 mo, whereupon members of this line began to develop late onset erythroleukemia. The primary leukemic cells were transplantable into nude mice and syngeneic hosts. Cell lines were established from five of the six leukemic animals and these lines, designated erythroleukemia/c-MYC (EMY), displayed proerythroblast morphology and expressed markers characteristic of the erythroid lineage, including the erythropoietin receptor and beta-globin. Moreover, they also manifested a limited potential to differentiate in response to erythropoietin. Studies in the surviving transgenic line indicated that, contrary to our expectations, the transgene was not expressed in the mast cell lineage. That, coupled with the exclusive occurrence of erythroleukemia in all the transgenic lines, suggests that the GATA-1 promoter construct we have used includes regulatory sequences necessary for in vivo erythroid expression only. Additional sequences would appear to be required for expression in mast cells. Further, our results show that c-MYC can efficiently transform erythroid precursors if expressed at a vulnerable stage of their development.","['Skoda, R C', 'Tsai, S F', 'Orkin, S H', 'Leder, P']","['Skoda RC', 'Tsai SF', 'Orkin SH', 'Leder P']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, myc', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/etiology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Organ Specificity', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC2191979,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.181.5.1603 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1995 May 1;181(5):1603-13. doi: 10.1084/jem.181.5.1603.,,['c-MYC'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The initial rates of G protein activation and the affinity of receptor-stimulated G proteins for GTP gamma S in HL-60 membranes stimulated by fMet-Leu-Phe, C5a, and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) differed significantly among the chemoattractants, with a rank order of fMet-Leu-Phe > C5a > LTB4. Equilibrium GTP gamma S binding showed that all three chemoattractants activated a common pool of G proteins. Stimulation of phospholipase D activation, measured as phosphatidylethanol generation, and superoxide release in intact cells also occurred with a rank order of fMet-Leu-Phe > C5a > LTB4. On the other hand, the rank order of receptor affinities for ligand and of the EC50 of chemoattractant stimulation of GTP gamma S binding was C5a > LTB4 > fMet-Leu-Phe. C5a and LTB4 receptor densities were similar but were less than formyl peptide receptor density. Graded pertussis toxin treatment proportionally reduced superoxide release and phospholipase D activation to all three chemoattractants. The results suggest that receptor-specific differences in G protein affinity for guanine nucleotides lead to different rates of guanine nucleotide exchange and, thereby, contribute to disparate effector enzyme and functional responses.","['Jacobs, A A', 'Huber, J L', 'Ward, R A', 'Klein, J B', 'McLeish, K R']","['Jacobs AA', 'Huber JL', 'Ward RA', 'Klein JB', 'McLeish KR']","['Department of Medicine, University of Louisville, KY 40292, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Chemotactic Factors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/physiology/ultrastructure', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/metabolism"", 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Phospholipase D/drug effects/*metabolism/physiology', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Peptide/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Substrate Specificity']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.57.4.679 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1995 Apr;57(4):679-86. doi: 10.1002/jlb.57.4.679.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The abilities of OCT and D3 to induce the functional differentiation of human leukemia HL-60 cells have now been investigated. OCT induced the differentiation of HL-60 cells into monocyte-like cells to a similar extent as D3. Thus, both OCT and D3 increased (1) the surface expression of CD11b, CD11c, CD14, and CD35; (2) nonspecific esterase staining; and (3) phagocytic activity toward fluorescent beads. HL-60 cells differentiated in response to OCT also supported the intracellular multiplication of L. pneumophila. Activation of both OCT- and D3-treated HL-60 cells with human recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) for 24 h before infection markedly inhibited L. pneumophila multiplication. IFN-gamma activation enhanced superoxide anion generation by D3-treated HL-60 cells but not by OCT-treated HL-60 cells, suggesting that the inhibition of L. pneumophila multiplication in IFN-gamma-activated cells is independent of superoxide generation. Finally, D3, but not OCT, markedly stimulated the formation of osteoclast-like multinucleated cells from mouse bone marrow cells, consistent with the lower hypercalcemic activity of OCT.","['Matsuzaki, M', 'Shimamoto, Y', 'Watanabe, M', 'Kukita, A', 'Yoshida, S', 'Tadano, J']","['Matsuzaki M', 'Shimamoto Y', 'Watanabe M', 'Kukita A', 'Yoshida S', 'Tadano J']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Saga Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'N2UJM5NBF6 (maxacalcitol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Fluid/microbiology', 'Legionella pneumophila/*growth & development', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*microbiology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Osteoclasts/cytology/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.57.4.574 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1995 Apr;57(4):574-80. doi: 10.1002/jlb.57.4.574.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here on characterization of PCR-amplified gp70 env genes in clone D. Relative to known gp70 sequences in parental cells and in current databases, one gp70 sequence presented four distinct nucleotide changes, two of which were apparently unique to clone D DNA and cDNA upon differential hybridization analysis. Transfection experiments with the entire gp70 gene or subgenic fragments encompassing a single putative mutation showed that products of the mutated env gene or fragments may confer immunogenicity in vivo and susceptibility in vitro to lysis by clone D-primed, H-2Kd- or H-2Ld-restricted CTL. By skin test assay of mice primed with either clone D or three mutated synthetic peptides, evidence was obtained that amino acid substitutions at the relevant positions of the gp70 protein may produce immunogenic T cell epitopes and that these epitopes are expressed in vivo by clone D.

Thus, IL-10 has been shown to prevent apoptosis of germinal center B cells, whereas IL-10 has been found to induce apoptosis of B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, suggesting the possibility that the effects of IL-10 might be different depending on the state of activation of B cells. The current studies therefore examined in detail the regulation of the survival of human peripheral blood B cells by IL-10 and its relevance to Ig production. Highly purified B cells from healthy adult individuals were cultured with Staphylococcus aureus (SA) Cowan I in the presence or absence of IL-10. When IL-10 was present during the initial activation of B cells with SA, IL-10 facilitated the apoptosis of SA-activated B cells, as determined by staining with propidium iodide, followed by analysis with flow cytometry, thus resulting in very modest IgM production. IL-2 prevented the IL-10-mediated progression of the apoptosis of SA-activated B cells during the initial activation, and thus restored the further differentiation of these B cells into Ig secreting cells. By contrast, IL-10 rather rescued SA-activated B cells from apoptosis and thus supported the differentiation of these B cells without any influences of IL-2, when it was added after 72 h of culture. Of note, cyclosporin A prevented the IL-10-mediated promotion of the apoptosis of SA-activated B cells, thus resulting in the marked enhancement of IgM production of B cells stimulated with SA + IL-10. Finally, the promotion or prevention of the IL-10-mediated apoptosis was correlated with the expression of Bcl-2 oncoprotein in SA-activated B cells. These results indicate that the effects of IL-10 are different depending on the state of activation of B cells after ligation of Ag receptors. Thus, the data have demonstrated that IL-10 during the initial activation delivers negative signals that promote the apoptosis of B cells, whereas IL-10 supports the differentiation of B cells in the complete absence of IL-2 during the subsequent responses following activation. These results therefore emphasize unique biphasic effects of IL-10 on human B cell responsiveness in determining the outcome of humoral immune responses.","['Itoh, K', 'Hirohata, S']","['Itoh K', 'Hirohata S']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Teikyo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Bacterial/immunology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Interleukin-10/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Staphylococcus aureus/immunology']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1995 May 1;154(9):4341-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After 4 days of culture in the presence of the inducer dimethyl sulfoxide, MEL cells expressed high levels of the erythroid-specific proteins, globin, and band 3. During the same interval, cellular contents (mol/cell) of E2-14K, E2-25K, and E2-35K decreased up to approximately 5-fold; as suggested by results obtained with E2-25K, this reflected a lower level of mRNA in differentiating cells. Concentrations of these E2s changed more modestly during in vitro differentiation, since cellular volume also decreased. Comparison of levels of the three E2s in undifferentiated MEL cells and reticulocytes suggests that their concentrations remain fairly constant during in vivo differentiation of proerythroblasts into reticulocytes. Thus, these components of the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway are likely to function constitutively during this interval. Two-dimensional Western blots showed a broad spectrum of ubiquitin conjugates, including free multiubiquitin chains, in undifferentiated MEL cells. As seen for several E2s, the concentration of ubiquitin conjugates (including free chains) decreased modestly during in vitro differentiation. E2-20K and E2-230K, which are abundant in reticulocytes, were low or absent in undifferentiated and differentiated MEL cells. In erythroid cells these two E2s are reticulocyte-specific; apparently MEL cells do not differentiate far enough to allow induction of their expression.","['Haldeman, M T', 'Finley, D', 'Pickart, C M']","['Haldeman MT', 'Finley D', 'Pickart CM']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, State University of New York, Buffalo 14214, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ubiquitins)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 6.- (Ligases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Ligases/analysis/physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rabbits', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes', 'Ubiquitins/*metabolism']",,1995/04/21 00:00,1995/04/21 00:01,['1995/04/21 00:00'],"['1995/04/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/21 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.16.9507 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)49164-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Apr 21;270(16):9507-16. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.16.9507.,,,,['DK43769/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transcription factor NF-E2, composed of a 45-kDa (p45) and an 18-kDa (p18) subunit, is essential for enhancer activity of the globin locus control regions (LCRs). DNA binding of NF-E2 and alpha-globin LCR enhancer activity was significantly less in HMBA-treated protein kinase A-deficient cells compared to cells containing normal protein kinase A activity; DNA binding of several other transcription factors was the same in both cell types. In parental cells, HMBA treatment and/or prolonged activation of protein kinase A increased the amount of NF-E2.DNA complexes without change in DNA binding affinity; the expression of p45 and p18 was the same under all conditions. p45 and p18 were phosphorylated by protein kinase A in vitro, but the phosphorylation did not affect NF-E2.DNA complexes, suggesting that protein kinase A regulates NF-E2.DNA complex formation indirectly, e.g. by altering expression of a regulatory factor(s). Thus, protein kinase A appears to be necessary for increased NF-E2.DNA complex formation during differentiation of MEL cells and may influence erythroid-specific gene expression through this mechanism.","['Garingo, A D', 'Suhasini, M', 'Andrews, N C', 'Pilz, R B']","['Garingo AD', 'Suhasini M', 'Andrews NC', 'Pilz RB']","['Department of Medicine, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0652, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*physiology', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/04/21 00:00,1995/04/21 00:01,['1995/04/21 00:00'],"['1995/04/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/21 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.16.9169 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)49116-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Apr 21;270(16):9169-77. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.16.9169.,,,,['K08 CA01548/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 21 patients undergoing irradiation of the brain in acute lymphoblastic leukemia or primary cerebral lymphoma, the coverage of the clinical target volume was checked with a repeat computed tomography (CT) in the treatment position (head fixation with face mask). The accuracy of field alignment was quantitatively assessed with sequential verification films. For each patient, linear and rotational discrepancies were measured between the simulation and first check film, and between five consecutive verification films. RESULTS: Coverage of clinical target volume. In 11 cases (52%), the CT examinations showed that parts of the subfrontal region and midcranial fossa were not included by the field assigned under simulation. Accuracy of field alignment. For the total group of patients, all deviations were normally distributed with mean values between -1.2 mm and 1.5 mm and standard deviations of 2.9 mm to 3.7 mm for linear discrepancies, and 0.3 degrees +/- 3.2 degrees for rotational discrepancies. For all patients, deviations were similar for the transition from simulation to the treatment machine and for subsequent treatment delivery, with 50% and 95% of absolute differences being less than 2.0 mm and 6.5 mm, respectively. Maximum linear deviations were less than 9.5 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The currently used helmet technique is inadequate to cover the clinical target volume. Repeat CT examinations are a useful method to delineate the clinical target volume on an individual patient basis. In addition, statistical fluctuations of field displacements up to 1.0 cm have to be considered when prescribing safety margins for reliable coverage of the clinical target volume during treatment planning and delivery.","['Kortmann, R D', 'Hess, C F', 'Hoffmann, W', 'Jany, R', 'Bamberg, M']","['Kortmann RD', 'Hess CF', 'Hoffmann W', 'Jany R', 'Bamberg M']","['Department of Radiotherapy, University of Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Brain Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/*radiotherapy', 'Child', 'Cranial Irradiation/*methods/standards', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/diagnostic imaging/*radiotherapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnostic imaging/*radiotherapy', '*Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,1995/04/30 00:00,1995/04/30 00:01,['1995/04/30 00:00'],"['1995/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(94)00411-D [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(94)00411-D [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1995 Apr 30;32(1):241-4. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(94)00411-D.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The potential carcinogenic effects of hormonal infertility, as well as exposure to relatively low doses of ovarian and pituitary radiation can be studied among patients receiving these treatments. METHODS: A cohort of 816 patients treated between 1925 and 1961 was identified from the medical records of a New York City radiologist. The mortality experience for 84% of these women was determined and radiation doses for individual patients were estimated. Doses were, on average, 87, 64, 54, and 29 cGy to the ovary, brain, colon, and active bone marrow, respectively. RESULTS: Compared with mortality rates in the US population, the risk of death was less than expected (standardized mortality ratio [SMR] = 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75-1.00). Deaths due to circulatory and digestive diseases were significantly below expectation. Cancer mortality was about 10% higher than that expected based on New York City mortality rates. Based on a small number of cases, no increase was found for cancers of the ovary or brain, or leukaemia, sites for which direct radiation exposure occurred, but significant excesses of colon cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were observed. A deficit in mortality from female genital cancers was surprising, since nulliparity has been a consistently reported risk factor for cancers of the endometrium and ovary. Breast cancer mortality was close to expectation. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study provided little evidence that either infertility or its treatment with radiation increased the risk of total or cancer mortality.","['Ron, E', 'Boice, J D Jr', 'Hamburger, S', 'Stovall, M']","['Ron E', 'Boice JD Jr', 'Hamburger S', 'Stovall M']","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amenorrhea/*radiotherapy', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/*radiotherapy', 'Middle Aged', '*Mortality', 'Neoplasms/mortality', 'New York City/epidemiology', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Risk Assessment']",,1994/12/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ije/23.6.1165 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 1994 Dec;23(6):1165-73. doi: 10.1093/ije/23.6.1165.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P815 (murine mastocytoma) and RAJI (human B-cell leukemia) cell lines were briefly exposed to pH 3.0 buffer which brought down the MHC class I expression on these cells by 70-80% and resulted in a 3-fold increase in their susceptibility to murine and human LAK cells, respectively. During the MHC class I regeneration phase, LAK susceptibility fell and reached normal levels at a time point when MHC class I antigens had regenerated to a level which was 60-70% of the normal. Highly significant inverse correlations were obtained between LAK susceptibility and the log of MHC class I antigen expression, for both P815 and RAJI cell lines. These results indicate that during the MHC class I regeneration phase, there is an inverse correlation between MHC class I antigen levels and LAK susceptibility. Moreover, these results also suggest that the extent of change in LAK susceptibility may depend upon the levels of basal MHC class I expression on the tumor cells.","['Haridas, V', 'Saxena, R K']","['Haridas V', 'Saxena RK']","['Immunology Laboratory, School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['016524789400179U [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2478(94)00179-u [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 1995 Jan;44(1):7-11. doi: 10.1016/0165-2478(94)00179-u.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately there is not much material published concerning the incidence of these conditions. We present epidemiologic data on MDS based on case registration of patients in a well-defined population and as a comparison similar data on acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Between the years 1978-1992 we registered 120 cases of MDS and 146 cases of AML. The median age for all the MDS cases was 74.1 years for men and 78.2 years for women. Among haematologists there is a suspicion that the incidence of MDS is rising. Our study does not support this opinion.

Retroviral mutagenesis of FDC-P1 cells led to factor-independent (FI) colonies from which cell lines could readily be established; whereas control cells exhibited at least 20 to 40-fold lower rates of factor-independence. From 44 independent experiments using either FDC-P1 or FDER cells, 205 autonomous cell lines were obtained. Sixteen colonies displayed a novel (""satellite-inducing"") appearance in agar and produced up to 4.1 x 10(5) U/mL granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (some with altered GM-CSF transcript sizes) and/or interleukin-3 (IL-3). Retroviral mutagenesis of FDER cells increased the repertoire of autocrine growth factors now responsible for stimulating autocrine proliferation: 3% of FI cell lines produced erythropoietin (Epo) (0.5 U/mL). Unexpectedly, in every autonomous FDC-P1 cell line, reverse transcriptase-PCR demonstrated expression of a growth factor normally required for proliferation. Thus, a profound selection for cells able to produce growth factors as the mechanism for achieving autonomous proliferation was documented. The ectopic expression of a receptor lacking a cognate ligand (""orphan"") followed by retroviral mutagenesis and selection for autocrine mutants may offer an effective method for identifying new ligands.","['Rasko, J E', 'Metcalf, D', 'Gough, N M', 'Begley, C G']","['Rasko JE', 'Metcalf D', 'Gough NM', 'Begley CG']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Autoreceptors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoreceptors/*physiology', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*genetics', 'Clone Cells', 'Erythropoietin/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Helper Viruses/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Interleukin-3/*biosynthesis/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/physiology', 'Mutagenesis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1995 May;23(5):453-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

U937 cells and other human myeloid leukemia cell lines (HL-60, THP-1) can be induced by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to differentiate along the monocytic pathway. In contrast, exposure to TPA had no effect on the induction of the differentiation program in TUR cells. Thus, the presence of leukocyte integrins including CD11 and CD18, which are significantly induced during TPA-induced differentiation of HL-60, U937 and THP-1 cells, remained nearly unchanged at low levels in both TUR and TPA-treated TUR cells. Furthermore, while expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens on U937 and TPA-treated U937 cells is barely detectable, there was a significantly constitutive expression of MHC class II, particularly human lymphocyte antigen (HLA-DR) on the surface of TUR and TPA-treated TUR cells. Exposure of human myeloid leukemia cells to TPA is also associated with growth arrest resulting either in a retrodifferentiation process or in programmed cell death.

It is unclear whether LIF acts directly on PGCs or indirectly via feeder cells or embryonic somatic cells. To understand the role of LIF in PGC growth, we have carried out molecular and cell culture analyses to investigate the role of both the LIF ligand and its receptor in PGC development. LIF is able to stimulate PGC growth independently of the presence of feeder cells supporting the hypothesis that LIF acts directly on PGCs to promote their growth. We show here that transcripts for the low-affinity LIF receptor (LIFR), an integral component of the functional LIF receptor complex, are expressed in the developing gonad. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis, using an anti-LIFR antiserum, demonstrates that LIFR is present on the surface of PGCs, suggesting that PGCs are likely to be a direct target of LIF action in culture. Signalling via LIFR is essential for PGC growth in culture since the anti-LIFR antiserum, which blocks LIF binding to its receptor, abolishes PGC survival in culture. Two LIF-related cytokines, namely oncostatin M and ciliary neurotrophic factor, can also promote PGC growth in culture in addition to LIF. Thus one or more of these LIFR-dependent cytokines may play an important role in PGC development in mice.","['Cheng, L', 'Gearing, D P', 'White, L S', 'Compton, D L', 'Schooley, K', 'Donovan, P J']","['Cheng L', 'Gearing DP', 'White LS', 'Compton DL', 'Schooley K', 'Donovan PJ']","['ABL-Basic Research Program, NCI-FCRDC, Frederick, Maryland 21702-1201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/physiology', 'Germ Cells/cytology/*growth & development', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', 'Interleukin-6/physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/physiology', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/physiology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Development. 1994 Nov;120(11):3145-53.,,,,['N01-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditional methods most commonly used to estimate the radiation adsorbed dose to the bone marrow of patients consider contributions from radionuclide in the blood and/or total body. Targeted therapies, such as radioimmunotherapy, add a third potential source for radiation to the bone marrow because the radiolabeled targeting molecules can accumulate specifically on malignant target cells infiltrating the bone marrow. A non-invasive method for estimating the radiation absorbed dose to the red marrow of patients who have received radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) has been developed and explored. The method depends on determining the cumulated activity in three contributing sources: 1) marrow; 2) blood; and 3) total body. The novel aspect of this method for estimating marrow radiation dose is derivation of the radiation dose for the entire red marrow from radiation dose estimates obtained by detection of cumulated activity in three lumbar vertebrae using a gamma camera. Contributions to the marrow radiation dose from marrow, blood, and total body cumulated activity were determined for patients who received an I-131 labeled MoAb, Lym-1, that reacts with malignant B-lymphocytes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and nonHodgkin's lymphoma. Six patients were selected for illustrative purposes because their vertebrae were readily visualized on lumbar images.

Determination of the time course of thallium accumulation in the absence and presence of ouabain, an inhibitor of sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), showed that the initial (at 20 min) rate of ouabain-resistant uptake was about 70% higher in the K562/Vcr30 cells than in the parental line. The maximal rate (Vmax) of ouabain-resistant uptake was 78 mmol/h for K562 cells and 115 mmol/h for K562/Vcr30 cells, and the Michaelis constant (Km) was 0.37 and 0.18 mmol, respectively. Bumetanide (50 microM), a specific inhibitor of ouabain-resistant Na-K-Cl cotransport, inhibited the elevated 201Tl uptake in K562/Vcr150 cells but had no effect on cellular vincristine accumulation. Incubation with different multidrug resistance (MDR)-reversing agents (verapamil as well as cyclosporin A and its analogue PSC833) had no significant effect on 201Tl uptake.

In particular, there is interest in developing agents active against human solid tumors. We examined several biochemical parameters that may contribute to the differential sensitivity of the cell lines used in our laboratory to the toxic effects of antitumor compounds. The tumor cell lines examined were of mouse (colon 38, L1210 leukemia, and C1498 leukemia) and human origin (CEM leukemia, CX1 colon, H116 colon, HCT8 colon and H125 lung). Quinone reductase activity was markedly different between leukemia and solid-tumor cell lines of either mouse or human origin, with increased activity being observed in the solid-tumor cell lines relative to the leukemia lines. GSH transferase activity also was generally increased in solid-tumor relative to leukemia cell lines. Superoxide dismutase activity and thiol levels were similar in leukemia and solid-tumor cell lines, except that thiol levels were very low in colon 38. Mouse cell lines from in vitro passage had somewhat higher activity of superoxide dismutase and thiol levels than did cells maintained in vivo, indicating relatively increased antioxidant defenses. The toxicity of 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, a model quinone that exerts its toxic effects via production of reactive oxygen species, was significantly lower in mouse lines maintained in vitro than in those tested in vivo, whereas the toxicity of another quinone, menadione, was just slightly lower. Quinone reductase activity, GSH transferase activity, and thiol levels were significantly higher in the human lines than in the mouse lines. Accordingly, the toxicity of both quinones tended to be lower in the human lines than in the mouse lines.","['Djuric, Z', 'Corbett, T H', 'Valeriote, F A', 'Heilbrun, L K', 'Baker, L H']","['Djuric Z', 'Corbett TH', 'Valeriote FA', 'Heilbrun LK', 'Baker LH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Quinones)', '12001-79-5 (Vitamin K)', '6956-96-3 (2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/metabolism', 'Naphthoquinones/*toxicity', 'Quinones/*toxicity', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects', 'Vitamin K/*toxicity']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00685727 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1995;36(1):20-6. doi: 10.1007/BF00685727.,,,,"['1PO1 CA46560/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22453/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Natural cytotoxicity was inhibited approximately 26% by 1 mM ATP and 21% by 1 mM ADP. 5'-Adenylyl imidodiphosphate, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, inhibited natural cytotoxicity by 41% at a concentration of 1 mM and > 97% at a concentration of 10 mM. In contrast, AMP was not inhibitory. Adenosine was a weak inhibitor of natural cytotoxicity and may represent an alternate regulatory pathway. Removal of the nucleotides resulted in the restoration of control levels of natural cytotoxicity activity. The affinity label 5'-p-(fluorosulfonyl)benzoyladenosine (5'-FSBA) is a synthetic analog of ATP or ADP containing an electrophilic fluorosulfonyl group capable of covalently modifying proteins at adenine di- and triphosphate nucleotide-binding sites. Natural cytotoxicity was irreversibly inhibited by modification of the extracellular membrane of NK3.3 cells by 5'-FSBA. This inhibition was concentration dependent with an I50 approximately 100 microM and complete inhibition at 1 mM. Modification of NK3.3 by 5'-FSBA did not affect the formation of effector-target cell conjugates; however, granule release was inhibited. This targets the site of inhibition by 5'-FSBA modification to a pathway preceding granule release. Irreversible, covalent modification of surface adenine nucleotide-binding proteins by 5'-FSBA provides a probe to study the role of specific adenine nucleotide-binding proteins in the extracellular regulation of natural killer cytolytic activity by adenine nucleotides.","['Dombrowski, K E', 'Cone, J C', 'Bjorndahl, J M', 'Phillips, C A']","['Dombrowski KE', 'Cone JC', 'Bjorndahl JM', 'Phillips CA']","['Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Amarillo, Texas 79106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '25612-73-1 (Adenylyl Imidodiphosphate)', '57KD15003I (Phenylmethylsulfonyl Fluoride)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', ""78859-42-4 (5'-(4-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl)adenosine)"", '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.78 (GZMA protein, human)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Diphosphate/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Adenylyl Imidodiphosphate/pharmacology', 'Benzoates/pharmacology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*drug effects', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Extracellular Space', 'Granzymes', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Phenylmethylsulfonyl Fluoride/pharmacology', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(95)80028-H [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(95)80028-h [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1995 Feb;160(2):199-204. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(95)80028-h.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analysis of DH- and JH-region genes revealed (i) limited or absent N nucleotide insertions (two of four cases), (ii) the presence of a DH-JH junction resulting from sequence overlap between the DH and JH genes (one of four cases), (iii) the absence of somatic mutations (two of four cases), and (iv) restricted JH gene usage of a JH6 polymorphism (three of four cases).

APL is also associated with a specific chromosomal translocation t(15;17) which fuses the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) gene with a chromosome 15q locus, PML. Recently the RAR alpha and the PML gene structural alterations in t(15;17) have been characterized. The heterogeneity of the PML rearrangements juxtaposes different PML gene portions to the same set of RAR alpha exons, producing two major PML-RAR alpha fusion mRNA isoforms. A retrotranscriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of the fusion transcripts has been developed which allows the detection of minimal residual disease during the clinical remission of APL. Molecular study showed PML-RAR alpha can form heterodimers with wild-type PML and RXR. Recently, PML has been shown to be one of the components of a nuclear body, POD. In APL, the normal organization of POD is disrupted by PML-RAR alpha, whereas ATRA treatment in vivo and in vitro can induce a reorganization of this organelle. Cytogenetic and molecular study allowed a variant translocation t(11;17) being recently discovered in a small subset of APL. This time RAR alpha is fused to a new gene, PLZF, on chromosome 11q23. It has been shown that the PLZF-RAR alpha, like PML-RAR alpha, has a ""dominant negative"" effect on the wild-type RAR-RXR. Clinical data obtained from a group of t(11;17) APL patients showed that these respond poorly to ATRA and could be grouped in a special clinical syndrome within APL. The comparison of the biological activities mediated by PML-RAR alpha and PLZF-RAR alpha may give new insights into the pathogenesis as well as the mechanisms of ATRA-induced differentiation in APL.","['Chen, S J', 'Wang, Z Y', 'Chen, Z']","['Chen SJ', 'Wang ZY', 'Chen Z']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Chromosome Aberrations/genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530130104 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1995 Jan;13(1):22-31. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530130104.,,,84,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These diseases have distinct immunologic and biologic features as well as varied responses to therapeutics. The most common lymphoid leukemia is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) which is a clonal proliferation of a subset of B cells expressing the CD5 antigen. Prolymphocytic leukemia is usually derived from B cells and shares some features with CLL but is clearly a distinct entity. Hairy-cell leukemia is a B cell malignancy that is uniquely responsive to a variety of biologic and chemotherapeutic agents. Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia is a B cell malignancy that secretes immunoglobulin M (IgM) and may present with the hyperviscosity syndrome. Other B cell malignancies that less commonly present as leukemias include non-Hodgkin's lymphomas such as follicular lymphoma or mantle zone lymphoma. Multiple myeloma may rarely present or evolve into a plasma cell leukemia, typically in far advanced disease. T cell malignancies that may present as chronic lymphoid leukemias, and in the past have often been referred to as T cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, are large granular lymphocytic leukemia, adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma, Sezary cell leukemia and rare cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that are T cell derived and may present or evolve into a leukemic phase. There is also a rare T cell counterpart of prolymphocytic leukemia.

For absolute CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell, and CD16+ NK subpopulation numbers, there were no consistent differences between the normal and B-CLL groups although some individual patient variation was seen. Immunophenotypic analyses did however reveal that CD3+ T-cells in almost half (10/21) of the B-CLL patients were Ia+ (defined as > 20% positive cells), compared to 0/13 of the elderly control group (p < 0.001), and that the proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ cells expressing membrane CD45RO were significantly increased compared to the control group. Subdivision of the B-CLL cases into those with low (< 20%) and high (> 20%) proportions of CD3+ T-cells co-expressing Ia further showed that CD45RO expression by CD4+ fractions was particularly prominent in the Ia+ subgroup, and that the relative increase of CD4+CD45RO+ cells was primarily a consequence of decreased absolute numbers of CD4+CD45RA+ lymphocytes. This study also examined extracted DNA from enriched CD3+ T-cell fractions (obtained by immunomagnetic bead selection in 9 of the B-CLL cases) by PCR analysis with two primers for the T-cell gamma gene locus. With the V gamma C (consensus) primer, 8/9 cases were polyclonal and the remaining case was oligoclonal. For comparison, 7/9 CD3+ fractions were oligoclonal with the V gamma 9 primer with the other two cases being polyclonal. No monoclonal CD3+ components were found. It is suggested that the observed increased Ia expression by CD3+ cells and the predominance of CD4+ cells expressing membrane CD45RO in patients with B-CLL may be of potential relevance to understanding the pathogenesis and patterns of disease progression.","['Frolova, E A', 'Richards, S J', 'Jones, R A', 'Rawstron, A', 'Master, P S', 'Teasdale, J', 'Short, M', 'Jack, A S', 'Scott, C S']","['Frolova EA', 'Richards SJ', 'Jones RA', 'Rawstron A', 'Master PS', 'Teasdale J', 'Short M', 'Jack AS', 'Scott CS']","['Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service, Leeds General Infirmary, England.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genotype', 'HLA-DR Antigens/genetics', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509049770 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Jan;16(3-4):307-18. doi: 10.3109/10428199509049770.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CD2 gene contained a site which was unmethylated, consistent with active transcription, in a CD2 positive AML case, and in a CD2 positive T cell line, but methylated in CD2 negative AML cells.

In a group of 50 patients the actuarial disease-free survival for the autonomous growth group was 11% at 5 years compared to greater than 50% for the non-autonomous growth group. This data suggests that AML blasts with autocrine growth characteristics may be resistant to cytotoxic drug therapy. Here we present further data demonstrating that AML blasts with autonomous growth are relatively resistant to the induction of programmed cell death (apoptosis) and that this is related to the autocrine production of GM-CSF. Also AML blasts with autonomous growths have aberrant expression of genes associated with resistance to apoptosis induced by cytotoxic drugs. These include high expression of the bcl-2 oncoprotein and abnormalities of expression of the p53 tumour suppressor gene. Furthermore bcl-2 expression was found to be unregulated by both exogenous and autocrine GM-CSF suggesting that the documented negative prognostic effect of autonomous growth on treatment outcome in AML, is in part due to the regulatory effect of autocrine GM-CSF on bcl-2 expression, thus protecting cells from apoptosis induced by cytotoxic drug therapy.","['Russell, N H', 'Hunter, A E', 'Bradbury, D', 'Zhu, Y M', 'Keith, F']","['Russell NH', 'Hunter AE', 'Bradbury D', 'Zhu YM', 'Keith F']","['Department of Haematology, City Hospital Nottingham, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Cell Division', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509049761 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Jan;16(3-4):223-9. doi: 10.3109/10428199509049761.,,,38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent molecular dissections of t(10;14) translocations support the hypothesis that these relatively gross chromosomal mutations represent key genetic steps in neoplastic transformation. The genes consistently involved are the T-cell receptor (TCR) delta-chain gene in 14q11 and a human homeobox-containing gene in 10q24, HOX11, initially identified through cloning of t(10;14) translocations. Like other homeoproteins, HOX11 binds DNA with sequence specificity and is likely to be a transcription factor, controlling the expression of developmentally important genes. The t(10;14) translocations arise as a result of aberrant physiological recombinational events that occur at early stages of T-cell development, probably during failed attempts at TCR gene rearrangement. The net result of the aberrant genetic recombinations is inappropriate expression of HOX11 in individual T-cells that acquire the mutation. Tlx-1, the murine homolog of HOX11, is expressed embryologically in the developing spleen and in structures derived from cranial neural crest cells and migratory paraxial mesoderm. Mice homozygously deleted for Tlx-1 are asplenic. Thus, HOX11 may be one of the first examples in mammals of a ""master gene"" acting as a regulatory switch controlling a downstream program of organ-specific cell growth and proliferation. Preliminary tumorigenicity assays suggest that HOX11 expression in hematopoietic cells most likely plays an immortalization role in neoplastic transformation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Lichty, B D', 'Ackland-Snow, J', 'Noble, L', 'Kamel-Reid, S', 'Dube, I D']","['Lichty BD', 'Ackland-Snow J', 'Noble L', 'Kamel-Reid S', 'Dube ID']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Pathology, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['*Genes, Homeobox', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509049759 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Jan;16(3-4):209-15. doi: 10.3109/10428199509049759.,,['HOX11'],46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B-cell malignancies are particularly attractive as targets for anti-CD3-based bsAb therapy because of their sensitivity to other forms of antibody therapy, and the extent to which B-cells and T-cells communicate at the molecular level. BsAbs that recognize CD3 and a number of antigens on malignant B-cells have been shown in vitro to be capable of retargeting T-cells. In animal models of B-cell malignancy, bsAb can eliminate tumor loads that are resistant to unmodified monoclonal antibody therapy. Ongoing early clinical trials in advanced B-cell lymphoma indicate CD3-based bsAbs have significant biologic effects, and suggest they have anti-tumor activity as well. A number of significant questions relating to bsAb therapy of B-cell malignancies remain. It is unclear what role both endogenously produced and exogenously administered cytokines are likely to play. Further exploration of whether bsAb can induce T-cells to target to tumor will also be required before the true promise of this novel form of immunotherapy can be determined.","['Weiner, G J', 'De Gast, G C']","['Weiner GJ', 'De Gast GC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City 52242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509049758 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Jan;16(3-4):199-207. doi: 10.3109/10428199509049758.,,,54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Low or absent levels of Rb protein are usually found in the leukemic cells of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who have an extremely poor prognosis. The absence of Rb protein in these AML cells could result from defects in the Rb gene or from abnormal cell cycle regulation that affects Rb expression. To test these possibilities and to examine whether a low level of Rb protein in AML cells could be up-regulated, we studied the effect that growth factors interleukin 3 (IL3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) had on the levels of Rb protein and Rb phosphorylation in AML cells from patients with low Rb or no Rb protein expression. We observed three responses to growth factor-stimulation in leukemic cells taken from patients with AML: (1) some AML cell samples entered a proliferative phase, and Rb protein levels increased with the appearance of normally phosphorylated forms of Rb protein and positive nuclear staining for Rb protein; (2) some AML cell samples became more proliferative, but the levels of Rb protein remained low or absent; and (3) some AML cell samples showed no response. These results indicate that at least two different mechanisms may be responsible for the lack of Rb protein in the leukemic cells of some patients with AML.","['Zhang, W', 'Xu, H J', 'Kornblau, S M', 'Drach, J', 'Hu, S X', 'Andreeff, M', 'Benedict, W F', 'Deisseroth, A B']","['Zhang W', 'Xu HJ', 'Kornblau SM', 'Drach J', 'Hu SX', 'Andreeff M', 'Benedict WF', 'Deisseroth AB']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Retinoblastoma/drug effects/*physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/analysis/chemistry/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509049757 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Jan;16(3-4):191-8. doi: 10.3109/10428199509049757.,,['RB'],,"['CA 57639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'EYO6195/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 120 consecutive patients were randomized to receive either 120 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide followed by total body irradiation (CY-TBI; n = 55) or 16 mg/kg of busulfan followed by 120 mg/kg of CY (BU-CY; n = 65). Two different TBI regimens were used. Thirteen patients received a 10-Gy single-dose TBI (SDTBI), and 42 received a fractionated TBI (FTBI). Median time between diagnosis and BMT was 315 days. Overall 5-year actuarial survival was 62.9% (65.8% +/- 12.5% for CY-TBI and 60.6 +/- 11.7% for BU-CY; P = .5), and overall disease-free survival was 55% (51% +/- 14% for CY-TBI and 59.1% +/- 11.8% for BU-CY; P = .75). All patients conditioned with CY-TBI experienced sustained engraftment; in contrast, 4 of 65 patients conditioned with BU-CY rejected the graft (P = .18). There was no significant statistical difference between the two groups regarding transplant-related mortality (29% for CY-TBI and 38% for BU-CY; P = .44). So far, with a median follow up of 42 months, 11 patients have relapsed; 9 relapses occurred after CY-TBI, mostly after FTBI (8 of 9) and 2 after BU-CY (P = .02). The actuarial risk of relapse was 4.4% +/- 6.7% after BU-CY, 11.1% +/- 20.8% after SDTBI, and 31.3% +/- 18.1% after FTBI (P = .039). In addition, independently of the conditioning regimen, the increase of posttransplant immunosuppression in 16 patients with an anti-interleukin-2 receptor monoclonal antibody (MoAb) in addition to a short course of methotrexate and cyclosporine was shown to increase the actuarial risk of relapse (57% +/- 30% with MoAb v 9% +/- 7.3% without MoAb; P = .001). We conclude that BU is an acceptable alternative to TBI for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in first chronic phase receiving BMT from HLA identical sibling donors. Both BU-CY and CY-TBI regimens gave similar transplant-related mortality, and the antileukemic efficiency of BU-CY regimen was either similar or even higher than that of CY-TBI.","['Devergie, A', 'Blaise, D', 'Attal, M', 'Tigaud, J D', 'Jouet, J P', 'Vernant, J P', 'Bordigoni, P', 'Ifrah, N', 'Dauriac, C', 'Cahn, J Y']","['Devergie A', 'Blaise D', 'Attal M', 'Tigaud JD', 'Jouet JP', 'Vernant JP', 'Bordigoni P', 'Ifrah N', 'Dauriac C', 'Cahn JY', 'et al.']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Units of Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",,1995/04/15 00:00,1995/04/15 00:01,['1995/04/15 00:00'],"['1995/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76958-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Apr 15;85(8):2263-8.,,,,,,,['Blood. 2001 Jun 1;97(11):3669-71.

A less well-known cellular feature that characterizes FA patients is an intrinsic cell cycle disturbance consisting of prolonged progression through, and arrest within, the G2 phase compartment of the cell cycle. In a collaborative blind study, we have evaluated 72-hour lymphocyte cultures from 66 patients with clinical suspicion of FA both for DEB sensitivity and cell cycle disturbance. A concordant result was obtained in 63 of 66 cases. Each of the 3 discordant, but only 1 of the concordant cases presented with overt leukemia. Seventeen cases were identified as classical FA because of their increased DEB sensitivity and G2 phase blockage. Five cases showed a cell cycle disturbance but only borderline DEB sensitivity. These cases might represent atypical or nonclassical forms of FA. They would have been missed by cell cycle studies without concomitant DEB testing.

In PMNs, a Triton-soluble F-actin pool (TSF) exists as short cytoplasmic filaments capped with gelsolin, while Triton-insoluble F-actin (TIF) is a three-dimensional meshwork of F-actin associated with actin-binding protein 280 (ABP-280), alpha-actinin, and tropomyosin. The unique association of gelsolin with the TSF suggests a role for gelsolin in creation or regulation of TSF. To evaluate gelsolin's role in TSF formation, the quantities of actin and gelsolin were determined by quantitative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblots in uninduced HL-60 cells (U-HL-60) and in HL-60 cells induced to myeloid differentiation with 1.25% dimethyl sulfoxide for 4 to 5 days (I-HL-60). U-HL-60 cells contain 17.76 +/- 6.01 pmol actin per 10(6) cells (TIF, 5.3 +/- 1.5; TSF, 2.17 +/- 0.37; G, 10.3 +/- 5.7; n = 5) and 0.073 pmol gelsolin per 10(6) cells (TIF, 0; TSF, 0.002 +/- 0.005; G, 0.07 +/- 0.01; n = 3), representing molar actin to gelsolin (A:G) ratios of 1,085:1 for TSF and 147:1 for G. After myeloid differentiation, the actin content increases 1.80-fold (31.94 +/- 6.14 pmol/10(6) cells) equally in each actin pool (TIF, 9.36 +/- 2.35; TSF, 3.29 +/- 0.62; G, 19.29 +/- 4.83). Gelsolin increases 2.4-fold overall (0.178 +/- 0.02 pmol/10(6) cells) but 19-fold in TSF (0.038 +/- 0.009) and only 1.9-fold in G pool (0.139 +/- 0.006), resulting in A:G ratios of 87:1 in TSF and 139:1 in G. The findings of an increase in TSF gelsolin with decreased A:G ratios (1,085:1 v 87:1) with myeloid differentiation suggest shortening of TSF filaments, while the A:G ratios of unbound gelsolin are unchanged (147:1 v 139:1). Measurement of EGTA-resistant gelsolin/actin complexes in HL-60 cells shows that 95% to 100% of complexes exist in the TSF-actin pool only. These findings are consistent with a role for gelsolin in formation and organization of Triton-soluble F-actin. Furthermore, the apparent shortening of TSF-actin filaments with myeloid cellular differentiation and maturation may represent one mechanism of conversion of the nonmotile myeloblast to the motile PMN.","['Watts, R G']",['Watts RG'],"['Department of Pediatrics, University of Alabama at Birmingham 35233, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Biopolymers)', '0 (Contractile Proteins)', '0 (FLNC protein, human)', '0 (Filamins)', '0 (Gelsolin)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '9002-93-1 (Octoxynol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Actins/*metabolism', 'Biopolymers/metabolism', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects', 'Contractile Proteins/metabolism', 'Cytoskeleton/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Filamins', 'Gelsolin/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Microfilament Proteins/metabolism', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Octoxynol', 'Respiratory Burst', 'Solubility', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/04/15 00:00,1995/04/15 00:01,['1995/04/15 00:00'],"['1995/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76951-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Apr 15;85(8):2212-21.,,,,['HL 02601/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TP53 mutations were frequently found in patients with loss of the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p-) (three of seven patients with 17p-, 43%) and complex karyotypic abnormalities (five of 14, 38%). Among the seven patients with the TP53 mutation, four patients progressed to acute leukemia within 7 months from the diagnosis of MDS, and the remaining three died within 7 months without leukemic transformation.

However, when amplification for BCR-ABL was repeated in quintuplicate, all but 1 colony from a single patient showed one or more positive results. Amplifications of the four genes in each colony showed that BCR-ABL, ABL-BCR, and the normal BCR and ABL were simultaneously expressed in the majority of CFU-GM colonies. Replicate PCR tests for BCR and for ABL in colonies initially scored as negative also uncovered previously undetected positive amplifications.

Anti-HOXA10 and C6 MoAbs DIDi not show any reactivity with the lymphoid cells tested, whereas anti-HOXD4 MoAb stained few resting peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and most phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated PBLs as early as 6 hours after stimulation. The pattern of staining of PHA-activated PBLs is reminiscent of the stages of nucleolar fragmentation in different phases of the cell cycle. The MoAb reacted also with activated or Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells, with clonal or polyclonal T and natural killer (NK) cells, with leukemic T-cell lines, and with a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line. RNAse protection experiments, per formed with probes specific for HOXD4 or for the highly homologous HOXA4, HOXB4, and HOXC4, belonging to the same paralogy group, indicated that only HOXC4 mRNA is present in resting or activated PBLs. Northern blot analysis on polyA+ RNA from activated PBLs or Raji cells showed the presence of two different HOXC4 transcripts of 2.8 and 1.9 kb. Gel retardation and Southwestern blot assays showed the presence of a 32-kD homeoprotein with DNA-binding properties typical of a HOX4 homeoprotein in nucleolar extracts of PHA-activated, but not of resting, lymphocytes. Taken together, these data indicate that the HOXC4 homeoprotein is expressed in activated and/or proliferating lymphocytes of the T-, B-, or NK-cell lineage, whereas it is weakly expressed in a minority of resting cells. The early expression and the nucleolar localization suggest an involvement of HOXC4 in the regulation of genes controlling lymphocyte activation and/or proliferation.","['Meazza, R', 'Faiella, A', 'Corsetti, M T', 'Airoldi, I', 'Ferrini, S', 'Boncinelli, E', 'Corte, G']","['Meazza R', 'Faiella A', 'Corsetti MT', 'Airoldi I', 'Ferrini S', 'Boncinelli E', 'Corte G']","['Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HOXC4 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Nucleolus/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/04/15 00:00,1995/04/15 00:01,['1995/04/15 00:00'],"['1995/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76934-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Apr 15;85(8):2084-90.,,"['HOXA10', 'HOXA4', 'HOXB4', 'HOXC4', 'HOXC6', 'HOXD4']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BM biopsy specimens and PB samples from 7 healthy individuals were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of reverse-transcribed RNA using gene-specific primer sets. Consistent gene expression in the BM of all 7 individuals was detected for macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF), stem cell factor, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-7, erythroid-potentiating factor, erythroid-differentiating factor, and insulinlike growth factor 1, all cytokines with reported direct stimulatory effects on in vitro hematopoiesis. Of these, erythroid-potentiating factor and erythroid-differentiating factor appeared to be the only stimulating factors that were also expressed in the PB. Among the cytokines with inhibitory effects on in vitro hematopoiesis IL-4, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), TNF-beta, transforming growth factor-beta, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha were expressed in the BM of the 7 individuals. Except for TNF-alpha, the latter cytokines were also expressed in the PB. Consistent expression in the BM and PB of all tested individuals was also observed for IL-1 beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and IL-1 beta converting enzyme, which are all members of the IL-1 family with a possible indirect effect on hematopoiesis. Remarkably, no expression of granulocyte CSF, granulocyte-macrophage CSF, and IL-3 was found in the BM or PB of all investigated individuals (n = 15). This was also the case for IL-1 alpha, IL-2, IL-5, IL-9, IL-12, IL-13, leukemia-inhibiting factor, interferon-gamma, and inhibin. Weak IL-8 and IL-10 expression was found in the BM and/or PB of a minority of investigated individuals. These findings provide insight into which cytokines or HGFs potentially are involved in the autocrine or paracrine regulation of in vivo steady state hematopoiesis. The absence of expression of granulocyte CSF, granulocyte-macrophage CSF, and IL-3 in the BM of healthy individuals implicates that it is highly unlikely that these HGFs are involved in the autocrine or paracrine regulation of constitutive hematopoiesis.","['Cluitmans, F H', 'Esendam, B H', 'Landegent, J E', 'Willemze, R', 'Falkenburg, J H']","['Cluitmans FH', 'Esendam BH', 'Landegent JE', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Blood Cells/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', '*Gene Expression', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/blood/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Reference Values']",,1995/04/15 00:00,1995/04/15 00:01,['1995/04/15 00:00'],"['1995/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76928-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Apr 15;85(8):2038-44.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One hundred ninety-seven eligible and evaluable patients (16 to 80 years of age; median, 32 years of age) received cyclophosphamide, daunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and L-asparaginase; 167 patients (85%) achieved a complete remission (CR), 13 (7%) had refractory disease, and 17 (9%) died during induction. A higher CR rate was observed in younger patients (94% for those < 30 years old, 85% for those 30 to 59 years old, and 39% for those > or = 60 years old, P < .001) and in those who had a mediastinal mass (100%) or blasts with a T-cell immunophenotype. Eighty percent of B-lineage and 97% of T-cell ALL patients achieved a CR (P = .01). The coexpression of myeloid antigens did not affect the response rate or duration. Seventy percent of those with cytogenetic or molecular evidence of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and 84% of those without such evidence achieved a CR (P = .11). Patients in remission received multiagent consolidation treatment, central nervous system prophylaxis, late intensification, and maintenance chemotherapy for a total of 24 months. After a median follow-up time of 43 months, the median survival for all 197 patients is 36 months; the median remission duration for the 167 CR patients is 29 months. Favorable pretreatment characteristics relative to remission duration or survival are younger age, the presence of a mediastinal mass or lymphadenopathy, a white blood cell count (WBC) less than 30,000/microL, L1 morphology, T or TMy immunophenotype, and the absence of the Ph chromosome. The estimates of the proportion surviving at 3 years are 69% for patients less than 30 years old, 39% for those 30 to 59 years old, 89% for those who had a mediastinal mass, 59% with WBC less than 30,000/microL, 63% with L1 morphology, 69% for T or TMy antigen expression, and 62% for those who lack the Ph chromosome. Fifteen patients (8%) had no unfavorable prognostic factors and have an estimated probability of survival at 5 years of 100% (95% confidence interval, 77% to 100%).

The MLL gene involved in other 11q23 abnormalities was also rearranged by this translocation. Screening of cDNA libraries of the t(11;19)(q23;p13.1)-carrying leukemic cells resulted in the isolation of several species of fusion cDNAs between the MLL gene and an unknown gene on 19p13.1, named MEN (myeloid eleven-nineteen translocation), which is ubiquitously expressed. Although the MLL gene was alternatively spliced, the fusion protein should contain an N-terminal half of the MLL, including AT hook motifs, that is fused to the MEN protein with a lysine-rich sequence, suggesting that the MLL/MEN fusion protein could be a chimeric transcription factor. The MLL/MEN fusion transcripts of 8.0 kb were detected in leukemic cells of two cases with the translocation. The MLL/MEN fusion was consistent in all three cases of the t(11;19)(q23;p13.1)-carrying leukemia examined by RNA-based polymerase chain reaction.

In the cytotoxicity assay using PHA-blasts, the addition of PHA increased the IL-4-induced killer cell cytotoxicity by 131%, but had no effect on IL-2-induced killer cell cytotoxicity. This implies that IL-4 mainly induces CTL-like activity, while IL-2 mainly induces NK-like activity.

The anti-tumor activity of rhuIL-4 was evaluated by injection of human LAK cells induced from PHA-blasts by rhuIL-2+rhuIL-4 and human cytokines into tumor-bearing nude mice.

The cell death evoked by TGF-beta 1 was both necrotic and apoptotic, quantified by the trypan blue exclusion method and apoptotic index, respectively. The induction of programmed cell death by TGF-beta 1 was confirmed by gel electrophoresis of DNA, where the characteristic 'DNA ladder' resulting from the internucleosomal DNA cleavage was visualized. The enhancement of cell mortality by TGF-beta 1 was associated with the inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) expression (measured by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method) and impaired activity of this key enzyme in polyamine synthesis. Orotic acid (OA)--a known tumor promoter--stimulated proliferation of L1210 leukemic cells and diminished the necrotic effect of TGF-beta 1, but it did not change the extent of apoptosis evoked by TGF-beta 1. OA increased the expression of ODC and diminished depressional influence of TGF-beta 1 on transcription and activity of ODC in leukemic cells. IN CONCLUSION: OA is a bioactive compound stimulating the growth of leukemic cells and diminishing the growth-inhibitory effect of TGF-beta 1.

As an important mechanism for the pathophysiology of eradication of residual myelocytic blast populations, activation of cytotoxic effector lymphocytes has frequently been discussed. However, the associated immunological research has been complicated to some extent, because in conventional chromium 51-release assays, blast cells frequently fail to incorporate sufficient amounts of 51Cr and/or spontaneously release high amounts of 51Cr. Recently, we established a culture system which promotes the outgrowth of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells cultured in IL-2. To study cytotoxicity and the responsible mechanisms of the obtained T-cell lines and clones, we modified a previously described cytotoxicity assay, based on the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-release assay) for use in cryopreserved blasts obtained from the bone marrow of patients with acute myelocytic leukemia. Using this assay, we were able to detect cytotoxicity of IL-2-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes from three healthy controls against a number of blast samples obtained from the bone marrow of patients with AML (up to more than 40% lysis at an effector target cell ratio of 20:1). However, a minority of AML blasts seem to be resistant to lysis by IL-2-activated lymphocytes. In bone marrow-derived T-cell lines from patients with AML we detected lytic activity against autologous blasts in three of seven cases tested by LDH release, ranging from 29 to 63% at an effector target ratio of 10:1. Additionally, T-cell clones with different phenotypes were established which were able to mediate cytotoxicity against autologous blast cells. Thus, cytotoxicity against freshly isolated blasts from patients with acute myelocytic leukemia can be analyzed reliably, reproducibly, and without the use of isotopes by the LDH-release assay.","['Weidmann, E', 'Brieger, J', 'Jahn, B', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Bergmann, L', 'Mitrou, P S']","['Weidmann E', 'Brieger J', 'Jahn B', 'Hoelzer D', 'Bergmann L', 'Mitrou PS']","['Department of Internal Medicine, J.

IFN alpha treatment induces hematologic and cytogenetic remissions in patients with chronic phase CML. In addition, the duration of the chronic phase is prolonged by IFN alpha resulting in a significant survival benefit. In two randomized clinical trials this survival benefit was demonstrated in all chronic phase CML patients independent of their risk scores. Moreover, IFN treatment also delays the onset of clinical relapse after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The critical mechanisms of IFN action have not yet been identified. Both direct and indirect antiproliferative mechanisms have been described. In particular, differential regulation of growth promoting and growth inhibiting cytokines represents an attractive hypothetical mechanism of IFN action. Nevertheless, no leukemia specific IFN activities explaining cytogenetic remissions and/or delay of disease progression have been identified. Further research on that field are required to further improve biological CML therapies.","['Aulitzky, W E', 'Peschel, C', 'Schneller, F', 'Huber, C']","['Aulitzky WE', 'Peschel C', 'Schneller F', 'Huber C']","['Division of Hematology, Universitatsklinik Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],IM,"['Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy']",,1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01682030 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1995 Mar;70(3):113-20. doi: 10.1007/BF01682030.,,,80,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) have been extensively described as modulators of MDR. These same agents are also known to (1) inhibit lysosomal acid sphingomyelinase (ASmase), a phospholipid degrading enzyme, and/or (2) induce phospholipidosis in animal tissues or cultured cell lines. In this report, we randomly selected 17 CADs and evaluated their potency in modulating MDR in the murine MDR P388/ADR leukemia cell line. We compared these results with their ability to inhibit ASmase and observed a significant dose-dependent linear relationship (95% central confidence interval), between ASmase inhibition and MDR reversal. This approach permitted us to identify three new modestly potent chemosensitizers: trimipramine, desipramine, and mianserine. Modulation of MDR was not cell line specific, since CADs at 10 microM increased doxorubicin (DOX) and vinblastine (VBL) (but not methotrexate, MTX) cytotoxicity in both P388/ADR and the human MDR cell lines MES-SA/Dx5 and K562/R7, but not in the parental drug-sensitive cells. Although all chemosensitizing CADs at 10 microM significantly increased Rhodamine-123 (Rho-123) accumulation in the human leukemia MDR cell line K562/R7 and most presented significant displacement of the photoaffinity labelling probe iodoarylazidoprazosin, no correlation between these observations and the ability of CADs to sensitize MDR cells to DOX and VBL was found. In conclusion, our study strongly suggests that the chemosensitizing potency of agents such as CADs may be due to a dual mechanism of action: direct antagonism of P-gp activity and indirect modulation of P-gp activity through the disruption of cellular lipid metabolism.","['Jaffrezou, J P', 'Chen, Kevin Gang', 'Duran, G E', 'Muller, C', 'Bordier, C', 'Laurent, G', 'Sikic, B I', 'Levade, T']","['Jaffrezou JP', 'Chen KG', 'Duran GE', 'Muller C', 'Bordier C', 'Laurent G', 'Sikic BI', 'Levade T']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford University Medical Center, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Indolizines)', '0 (Phenethylamines)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '0 (Vasodilator Agents)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '250PJI13LM (Mianserin)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '6S082C9NDT (Trimipramine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)', 'KU213XYO69 (fantofarone)', 'TG537D343B (Desipramine)']",IM,"['Affinity Labels', 'Animals', 'Desipramine/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Indolizines/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Lysosomes/*enzymology', 'Mianserin/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Phenethylamines/*pharmacology', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines/metabolism', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Trimipramine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vasodilator Agents/pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",,1995/04/06 00:00,1995/04/06 00:01,['1995/04/06 00:00'],"['1995/04/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/06 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(94)00219-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(94)00219-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1995 Apr 6;1266(1):1-8. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(94)00219-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report that AAbs binding a peptide determinant corresponding to the CDR1 of the V beta domain are elevated in C57BL/6 mice following infection with the LP-BM5 murine leukemia retrovirus mixture, a treatment used to induce murine AIDS. The elevation of the level of these AAbs is an early event following retroviral infection which corresponds in part to the general polyclonal activation of the B cells, but a selectivity for particular V beta sequences is apparent later. This suggests that the appearance of these antibodies may play a part in the subsequent development of immunodeficiency.

It has been suggested that the immunodeficiency associated with MAIDS is caused by a conversion of immune responses normally characterized by Th1 development towards a Th2-dominated response. Mice of the same strain, infected with Leishmania major, mount a protective Th1 response with the induction of high levels of IFN-gamma and undetectable IL-4. We therefore infected mice with L. major at differing time points before and after virus infection and assessed the effects on T cell responsiveness, cytokine production and survival to L. major, as well as the effect on MAIDS-associated pathology. We have also immunized C57BL/6 mice with trinitrophenol-keyhole limpet haemocyanin (TNP-KLH), which leads to a predominantly Th2 response, and compared the effects of MAIDS on the response to TNP-KLH with the effect of MAIDS on L. major infection. Our results show that significant immunodeficiency with regard to infection by L. major is only apparent after 8 weeks of LP-BM5 MuLV infection, by which time T and B cell defects are well advanced. Further, we have found that the strongly polarized Th1 response stimulated by L. major infection can modulate the effect of MAIDS on T cells, leading to the survival of antigen-specific T cells. Our results suggest that the impairment of immune responses to either TNP-KLH or L. major is due not to an alteration of the balance of Th1/Th2 subsets but to a general loss of reactivity in antigen-specific CD4+ cells. However, prior activation of Th1 but not Th2 cells can inhibit the development of lymphoproliferation and immunodeficiency caused by MAIDS.","['Doherty, T M', 'Morse, H C 3rd', 'Coffman, R L']","['Doherty TM', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'Coffman RL']","['Department of Immunology, DNAX Research Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,['82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Leishmania major', 'Leishmaniasis, Cutaneous/complications/*immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Th1 Cells/*immunology', 'Th2 Cells/*immunology', 'Time Factors']",,1995/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/intimm/7.1.131 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Immunol. 1995 Jan;7(1):131-8. doi: 10.1093/intimm/7.1.131.,,,,['N01-AI-72622/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several stable clones were established by transfection of the expression vector pc53SN3. Expression of p53 protein was characterized by biosynthetic labeling and immunoprecipitation with the monoclonal antibodies pAb 1801 (reacting with wild-type and mutant human p53), pAb 240 (reacting with mutant human p53) and pAb 1620 (reacting with wild-type human p53). All clones which were 1801+, 240-, 1620- or 1801+, 240-, 1620+ were defined as ""wild-type-like p53-expressing"" clones. Our results show that expression of p53 protein is compatible with continuous proliferation of K562 cells. The growth characteristics of wild-type-like p53-expressing clones did not differ from that of control clones. However, the former were more sensitive than p53-negative control clones to growth inhibition by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a cytokine with a potential role in growth and differentiation of myeloid leukemic cells. In addition, a 2- to 4-fold increase of the amount of hemoglobin, a marker of erythroid differentiation, was observed when wild-type-like p53 protein-expressing clones were incubated with TNF. This suggests that differentiation is the mechanism responsible for the increased TNF sensitivity of these clones. Our results support a role for p53 in mediating growth inhibitory and differentiation inducing signals by TNF.","['Ehinger, M', 'Nilsson, E', 'Persson, A M', 'Olsson, I', 'Gullberg, U']","['Ehinger M', 'Nilsson E', 'Persson AM', 'Olsson I', 'Gullberg U']","['Department of Medicine, University of Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Transfection/genetics', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis/genetics']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1995 Jan;6(1):9-17.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The distribution of dCK in cells and tissues has previously been determined by activity measurements, which may be unreliable because of the presence of other enzymes with overlapping substrate specificities. Therefore we have measured dCK polypeptide levels in extracts of normal and malignant human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, gastrointestinal tissues and sarcomas, using a specific immunoblotting technique, as well as the phosphorylation of CdA in the same extracts. High levels of dCK were found in all major subpopulations of normal mononuclear leucocytes (120 +/- 19 ng dCK/mg protein) and in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (81 +/- 30 ng/mg, n = 23). Hairy-cell leukaemia contained lower levels (28 +/- 23 ng/mg, n = 7), as did three samples of T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (18 +/- 14 ng/mg). Phytohaemagglutinin stimulation of normal lymphocytes did not lead to any substantial increase in either dCK activity or protein expression (less than 2.5-fold). The human CEM wt T-lymphoblastoid cell line contained 56 +/- 1 ng/dCK/mg protein, while in the CEM ddC50 and AraC8D mutants that lack dCK activity, no dCK polypeptide could be detected. In colon adenocarcinomas, the dCK content was significantly higher (20 +/- 9 ng/mg, n = 20) than in normal colon mucosa (8 +/- 3.5 ng/mg, n = 19, P < 0.05). A similar pattern of dCK expression was found in gastric adenocarcinomas (21 +/- 13 ng/mg, n = 5) and normal stomach mucosa (6 +/- 5 ng/mg, n = 5, P < 0.15). One leiomyosarcoma and one extra-skeletal osteosarcoma showed dCK levels comparable with those found in normal lymphocytes (84 +/- 6 and 109 +/- 4 ng/mg, respectively), while other sarcoma samples contained lower levels, comparable to the gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas (20 +/- 7 ng/mg, n = 12). Thus, dCK is expressed constitutively and predominantly in lymphoid cells, but it is also found in solid non-lymphoid tissues, with increased levels in malignant cells. The phosphorylation of CdA in crude extracts showed a close correlation to the dCK polypeptide level.","['Spasokoukotskaja, T', 'Arner, E S', 'Brosjo, O', 'Gunven, P', 'Juliusson, G', 'Liliemark, J', 'Eriksson, S']","['Spasokoukotskaja T', 'Arner ES', 'Brosjo O', 'Gunven P', 'Juliusson G', 'Liliemark J', 'Eriksson S']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cladribine/*metabolism', 'Colonic Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Sarcoma/enzymology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0959-8049(94)00435-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0959-8049(94)00435-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1995;31A(2):202-8. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(94)00435-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has become a standard, curative treatment in haematological diseases such as leukaemia and lymphomas. However, serious physical and psychological side effects are experienced by some patients. A review of the literature on QOL in adult BMT patients shows that the development in post-BMT research on psychosocial factors is slowly progressing. Most studies are retrospective with small sample sizes, and only five of 48 studies fulfilled our preset quality criteria. Identification of factors that are predictive for poor post-BMT outcome might provide a basis for targeted support programmes.

Based on IC90 values, this subline was approximately 20-fold resistant to 4HC. Furthermore, it was significantly cross-resistant to phosphorodiamidic mustard (PM), whose cytotoxicity is independent of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ADH). Using alkaline elution we found that the resistant line had decreased initial levels of DNA interstrand cross-links (ISCs) following 4HC but not PM treatment. The resistant cells also appeared to remove ISCs from their DNA more rapidly than the parental cells. Our data therefore suggest that 4HC resistance in the B5-180(3) subline is multifactorial; ADH is an important mediator of its resistance to ISC induction by 4HC, while a second process, which may involve an increased ability to tolerate drug-induced DNA damage, appears to be important for its resistance to both 4HC and PM. The B5-180(3) cells were also cross-resistant to gamma-radiation (approximately 1.7-fold at a surviving fraction of 0.1); if generally applicable, such effects could have important clinical implications, since pretransplant total body irradiation is a major component of the eradication of leukemic cells.","['Andersson, B S', 'Mroue, M', 'Britten, R A', 'Farquhar, D', 'Murray, D']","['Andersson BS', 'Mroue M', 'Britten RA', 'Farquhar D', 'Murray D']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,"['0 (Phosphoramide Mustards)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",IM,"['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Phosphoramide Mustards/*pharmacology', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/radiation effects']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/02841869509093963 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 1995;34(2):247-51. doi: 10.3109/02841869509093963.,,,,"['P01-CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-49477/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a tritiated analog, biodistribution studies revealed relatively high uptake levels in kidney, lung, heart, and spleen with moderate levels in all other organs. Antitumor activity was apparent, with significant tumor regression observed in athymic nude mice with established M21 melanomas.

To determine which amino acid in KDEL was responsible for the increase in activity, we tested eight C-terminal mutants of AT-PE38REDLK. Using IL2R-bearing MT-1 cells, we found that the glutamate residue of KDEL was required for high activity, as the cytotoxicity of AT-PE38 ending in KDEL, RDEL, KEEL or REEL was much greater than that of AT-PE38 ending in REDL, KEDL, RDDL or KDDL. Using freshly isolated lymphocytic leukaemia cells, AT-PE38 ending in KDEL, REEL or RDEL was more than 100-fold more cytotoxic than AT-PE38 ending in KEDL, REDL, RDDL or the native sequence REDLK. The RDEL sequence also improved the cytotoxic activity of an interleukin 4-PE38 toxin fusion protein. Improved cytotoxic activity correlated with improved binding of the C-termini to the KDEL receptor on rat Golgi membranes. These data indicate that the glutamate residue of KDEL improves the cytotoxicity of PE by increasing binding to a sorting receptor which transports the toxin from the transreticular Golgi apparatus to the ER, where it is translocated to the cytosol and inhibits protein synthesis.","['Kreitman, R J', 'Pastan, I']","['Kreitman RJ', 'Pastan I']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (KDEL receptor)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Protein Sorting Signals)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Virulence Factors)', '113516-56-6 (lysyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-leucine)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (ADP Ribose Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (toxA protein, Pseudomonas aeruginosa)']",IM,"['*ADP Ribose Transferases', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Bacterial Toxins', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/pathology', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Exotoxins/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Glutamic Acid/*chemistry', 'Golgi Apparatus/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligopeptides/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/chemical synthesis/toxicity', '*Protein Sorting Signals', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Peptide/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', '*Virulence Factors']",PMC1136741,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3070029 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1995 Apr 1;307 ( Pt 1):29-37. doi: 10.1042/bj3070029.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the studies reported here was to determine whether the observed depression of bone marrow (BM) cellularity in mice administered benzene was reflected in a suppression of development of all of the hematopoietic lineages and to confirm the ability of interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) to prevent BZ-induced BM cell depression. We report that BZ, administered twice per day for 2 days to C57B1/6J mice at a dose of 600 mg/kg body weight, caused a significant depression of the total number of nucleated BM cells per femur when measured on day 3. The observed depression reflects a complex situation that represents the net effect of a decrease in the total number of cells of the lymphocytic and erythroid lineages, along with an increase in the number of intermediate and terminally differentiated cells of the granulocytic lineage. An experiment to monitor the effects of BZ over a 7-day period showed a progressive depressive effect on the lymphocytes and an initial depression of the erythroid cells at day 3 that remained constant until day 7. Conversely, the numbers of intermediate and terminally differentiated granulocytes progressively increased over the 7 days. The BM appeared to recover from the depressive effects of BZ immediately upon cessation of exposure, as the number of nucleated BM cells began to rise by day 5 and was equal to that of the control group by day 7. The results expand our earlier finding (Renz and Kalf 1991) that the overall depression of BM cellularity occurs because of an inability of the stromal fibroblast to produce colony-stimulating factors essential for stem and progenitor cell survival. This results from inhibition by the BZ metabolite, hydroquinone (HQ), of the processing of pre-IL-1 alpha to the mature cytokine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Niculescu, R', 'Kalf, G F']","['Niculescu R', 'Kalf GF']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/*antagonists & inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002040050150 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 1995;69(3):141-8. doi: 10.1007/s002040050150.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, one type of leukemia, called ""transient leukemia"" (TL), occurs almost exclusively in DS infants. The basis of the association between DS and leukemia is unknown, but we and others have hypothesized that it may be influenced by the mechanism of origin of the extra chromosome. Therefore, we initiated a cytogenetic and molecular study of nondisjunction in leukemia DS individuals. To date, we have obtained blood and/or tissue samples from 55 individuals consisting of 17 cases with TL, 7 cases of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia subtype M7 (ANLL-M7, or acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, postulated to be related to TL), and 31 cases of other forms of leukemia. Analysis of these cases suggests differences between DS children with TL and those with other types of leukemia or DS individuals with no history of leukemia. Specifically, the TL and ANLL-M7 cases have a highly significant increase in the frequency of ""atypical"" constitutional karyotypes (i.e., mosaic trisomies, rings, and/or isochromosomes) and are almost always male. Additionally, genetic mapping studies suggest an increase in the frequency of disomic homozygosity, especially in proximal 21q, in DS individuals with TL and ANLL-M7.","['Shen, J J', 'Williams, B J', 'Zipursky, A', 'Doyle, J', 'Sherman, S L', 'Jacobs, P A', 'Shugar, A L', 'Soukup, S W', 'Hassold, T J']","['Shen JJ', 'Williams BJ', 'Zipursky A', 'Doyle J', 'Sherman SL', 'Jacobs PA', 'Shugar AL', 'Soukup SW', 'Hassold TJ']","['Department of Human Genetics, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hum Genet,American journal of human genetics,0370475,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Down Syndrome/complications/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/complications/*genetics', 'Male', 'Nondisjunction, Genetic']",PMC1801215,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Hum Genet. 1995 Apr;56(4):915-25.,,,,"['HD 21341/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD92709/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'MO1 RR00080/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A decision board was constructed containing detailed scenarios associated with the treatment alternatives, together with estimates of survival probabilities at various periods of followup. The instrument was tested on 42 healthy hospital personnel and validated by measuring the extent to which systematic alterations in the scenarios with respect to toxicities and survival probabilities produced predicted shifts in treatment preferences. A subgroup of respondents was randomized to receive information through the decision board alone or a shorter and less informative version of the instrument, followed by the decision board. The direction and strength of stated preferences were compared, together with satisfaction for these preferences. The direction and strength of preferences between bone marrow transplantation or conservative chemotherapy were influenced in a predictable way by changes in the toxicity and survival descriptions in the scenarios. Using the test-retest method in 16 subjects, the stated preferences were found to be highly reliable (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.87). The mean level of satisfaction with the stated preference, on a scale from not at all satisfied = 1 to very satisfied = 5, was higher for those exposed to the decision board (3.7, SD 1.06) compared with those presented with the short version (2.95, SD 0.67) (P < 0.01). The results demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of the instrument in healthy individuals. The preferences elicited by the instrument appear to be reliable and valid according to prespecified constructs of the relation between the information provided and the preferences predicted. These results support further testing of this approach in actual patients.","['Sebban, C', 'Browman, G', 'Gafni, A', 'Norman, G', 'Levine, M', 'Assouline, D', 'Fiere, D']","['Sebban C', 'Browman G', 'Gafni A', 'Norman G', 'Levine M', 'Assouline D', 'Fiere D']","[""Service d'Hematologie Pavillon E, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*psychology', '*Decision Making', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Drug Therapy/psychology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*psychology/therapy', 'Patient Education as Topic']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830480403 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1995 Apr;48(4):221-7. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830480403.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gastrointestinal (GI) involvement with CLL is unusual, and GI complications generally occur after malignant transformation to diffuse large cell lymphoma (Richter's syndrome). We present a case of CLL directly infiltrating the gastro-esophageal junction resulting in upper GI hemorrhage. This is only the second such case in the literature. We emphasize the consideration of direct leukemic infiltration in addition to Richter's syndrome in the differential diagnosis of GI bleeding in patients with CLL.

Experience of the Santa Maria Hospital, Medical School of Lisbon].",717-24,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a rare subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia that is usually associated with a fatal hemorrhagic diathesis. All trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) is an active metabolite of vitamin A that differentiates the malignant cell clone, corrects the coagulopathy, and induces complete remission in the vast majority of patients with APL. Between June 1992 and September 1993, 8 patients with APL (4 previously untreated, 3 in first relapse and 1 in second relapse) received ATRA. Complete remission was achieved in 7 patients; in 5 with ATRA alone and in 2 with ATRA followed by cytotoxic chemotherapy due to the development of asymptomatic hyperleukocytosis. The earliest signs of response were the correction of the coagulopathy and an increase in the white blood cell count. Sequential morphological and immunophenotypical analyses of the bone marrow revealed differentiation of the malignant cell clone, in the absence of bone marrow hypoplasia. 4 of 5 patients treated only with ATRA until complete remission had late leukopenia. The most frequent adverse effects were dryness of skin and mucosae, hypertrigliceridemia and hypercholesterolemia, and a moderate increase in liver transaminases. An increase in the white blood cell count was common, and in two cases exceeded 35.0 x 10(9)/l. One of these patients developed multiple thrombosis of the extremities after cytotoxic chemotherapy. We frequently observed an increase in lactic dehydrogenase levels that was concomitant with the peak in the white blood cell count. The only patient on whom complete remission was not achieved was 60 years old, had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and died in the third week of therapy with a pulmonary distress syndrome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['De Lacerda, J F', 'Do Carmo, J A', 'De Moura, M C', 'Guerra, M L', 'Lopes, C', 'Raposo, J', 'Melo, A', 'De Oliveira, J J', 'De Lacerda, J M']","['De Lacerda JF', 'Do Carmo JA', 'De Moura MC', 'Guerra ML', 'Lopes C', 'Raposo J', 'Melo A', 'De Oliveira JJ', 'De Lacerda JM']","['Unidade de Hematologia, Universidad de Lisboa, Hospital de Santa Maria, Faculdade de Medicina de Lisboa.']",['por'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Portugal,Acta Med Port,Acta medica portuguesa,7906803,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Med Port. 1994 Dec;7(12):717-24.,"Terapeutica da Leucemia promielocitica aguda com acido Trans-Retinoico.

Drug sensitivities of cells were assessed with MTT assay, in which doxorubicin, epirubicin, daunorubicin, or the 3-drug mixture was applied with concentrations ranging from 1 to 3125 ng.ml-1. The IC50 of K562r cells were 1.0, 1.0, 0.1, and 0.2 microgram.ml-1, respectively, about 22, 16, 10, and 20 times higher than those of K562 cells. After cells were exposed to doxorubicin (2-32 micrograms.ml-1) for 1 h, the drug concentrations in K562r cells were all higher than those in K562 cells. Similar results were obtained for epirubicin or daunorubicin. After 1-h incubation of cells with the 3-drug mixture (3 to 192 micrograms.ml-1), there were no considerable differences of drug accumulation between K562r and K562 cells with only 3 exceptions in 21 groups.

Twenty-two patients with APL were studied. Of them, 17 were at the onset and 5 had achieved already complete haematological remission (CR). Evolutive post-remission studies were performed in 8 cases. The cytogenetic analysis was carried out at diagnosis by means of the G-band technique in 14 patients. The molecular study of RAR-alpha and pml genes was made with the Southern method. The common anomaly, t(15;17) was present in 7 of the 9 cases with evaluable metaphases (78%), in one case a 17q+ was the only cytogenetic alteration and another patient had normal karyotype.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with MDS-AL and 29 patients with ""de novo""-AML were studied. Morphocytochemical and flow cytometric studies were done in each case. RESULTS: All the MDS-AL studied displayed a myeloid phenotype (MDS-AML). The main difference between MDS-AML and ""de novo""-AML was a significantly higher frequency of CD34 expression in the first group. Differences concerning the expression of other non-lineage related or myeloid-associated markers were not statistically significant, although the percentage of cases CD15(+) was lower in MDS-AML. The overall frequency of expression of lymphoid-associated markers was similar in both groups, T-cell markers being more frequently detected. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the usefulness of immunophenotyping studies to characterize MDS-AL and suggest some immunophenotyping differences between MDS-AML and ""de novo""-AML which might have biological and prognostic significance.","['Lima, M', 'Teixeira, M dos A', 'Morais, S', 'Cunha, M', 'Coutinho, J', 'Pinho, L', 'Ribeiro, P', 'Justica, B']","['Lima M', 'Teixeira Mdos A', 'Morais S', 'Cunha M', 'Coutinho J', 'Pinho L', 'Ribeiro P', 'Justica B']","[""Service of Clinical Hematology, S.

In patients with normal and stimulated megakaryocytopoises percentage of ""small"" megakaryocytes was generally low (10.6% and 14%, respect.); so, megakaryocyte number was similar in immunohistochemically and conventionally stained sections.

Our study shows that T lymphocytes of the Jurkat cell line express binding sites for [125I]YLFQPQRFamide, an iodinated analogue of NPFF. This binding is time and dose dependent, reversible, saturable, and may be resolved in two distinct components of high and low affinity. The opiate receptor agonists mu, delta, and kappa, as well the antagonist naloxone, were unable to affect binding.

However, the combined CP plus 3-AB treatment did not increase the survival of either EAT BALB/c- or P388 BDF1-tumor bearing mice compared with the effect on survival by CP alone. Therefore the in vivo differential antitumor effect, by CP in conjunction with 3-AB, appears to correlate well with the in vivo differential effect on cytogenetic damage caused by the combined CP plus 3-AB treatment. In the Salmonella typhimurium/mammalian microsome test CP appears to have a dose dependent ability to induce base-pair substitutions in strains TA 100 and TA 1535 and frameshift mutations in strains TA 98 and TA 1537.

The CD3-CD56+ and CD16+ cell counts of ALL patients (n = 14) were below the mean -1 SD values of controls at cessation but normalized within one month due to a rapid 2.1 and 4.5 fold increase, respectively. The CD8-CD57+ cell count of ALL patients was normal compared to controls at cessation. In solid tumor patients (n = 11), the counts of all NK cell phenotypes studied were of normal amount compared to controls at cessation and no vigorous increase occurred after the therapy. NK cell function was determined by killing K 562 target cells in five patients. In the two standard risk ALL patients tested, the activity was still low at 5 months after therapy. In contrast, the function was normal at 1 month (Wilms' tumor), 3 months (Mb Hodgkin's) and 6 months (Burkitt lymphoma). In conclusion, NK cell counts were decreased compared to controls during therapy for ALL, but recovered rapidly afterwards. In spite of normal counts, NK cell function may be impaired for several months. The number and function of NK cells is less affected in solid tumor patients. These differences may reflect the milder immunosuppressive effect of interval cytostatic medication in solid tumor patients when compared to the more intensive continuous therapy in ALL patients.","['Alanko, S', 'Salmi, T T', 'Pelliniemi, T T']","['Alanko S', 'Salmi TT', 'Pelliniemi TT']","['Department of Pediatrics, Turku University Hospital, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/blood/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Count/drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology']",,1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950240607 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1995 Jun;24(6):373-8. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950240607.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The positivity of the chimeric transcription bcr-abl was studied in 18 long surviving BMT patients. The complementary DNA (cDNA) corresponding to this transcription was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Double internal PCR (PCR nested) was performed to increase the sensitivity of the determination. RESULTS: The first determination was performed in different post BMT stages with a median of 27 months (4-97). Fourteen out the 18 patients were positive for the bcr-abl transcription. On the second determination carried out in 11 cases with a sample obtained 24 months after the first 7 out of the 10 positive cases evaluated presented an identical pattern while the patient who originally was negative, remained so. The original transcription became negative in three patients. Only one of the positive cases developed hematologic relapse during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive chemo-radiotherapy does not eradicate the leukemic clone in all patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. The persistence of positive results in a high number of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in remission for over 6 months after bone marrow transplantation is not predictive of imminent relapse.","['Garcia, A', 'Roman, J', 'Brunet, S', 'Andres, P', 'Baiget, M', 'Torres, A']","['Garcia A', 'Roman J', 'Brunet S', 'Andres P', 'Baiget M', 'Torres A']","['Unitat de Genetica Molecular, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona.']",['spa'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Female', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,1995/03/25 00:00,1995/03/25 00:01,['1995/03/25 00:00'],"['1995/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1995 Mar 25;104(11):401-6.,Enfermedad minima residual en la leucemia mieloide cronica en pacientes con larga supervivencia despues de un trasplante de medula osea alogenico.,['bcr'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lactose malabsorption, the functional consequence of a small intestinal enzymatic derangement, has been shown to play an important role in causing gastrointestinal symptoms in subjects receiving chemotherapy. To establish a rational basis for the exclusion of lactose from the diet and to reduce the risk of developing gastrointestinal symptoms, we conducted a study of lactose absorption in 20 children during cancer chemotherapy. Because lactose is an important nutritional sugar, the tolerance of lactose provided by yogurt was examined. Lactose absorption was investigated by a hydrogen breath test (BT) after oral ingestion of milk (250 ml) containing physiological doses of lactose (12 g). The effect of yogurt supplementation was also tested by BT after meals of yogurt (450 g) also containing physiological doses of lactose (12.1 g). In 11 children, lactose malabsorption was detected by BT during the study before any gastrointestinal symptom revealed this status. Of these 11 children, no gastrointestinal discomfort developed in five receiving a lactose-excluded diet. In contrast, in the six children not restricted in lactose intake, gastrointestinal symptoms were observed 4 to 13 weeks after lactose malabsorption was detected by BT. The findings of our study suggested the usefulness of dietary supplementation with yogurt, a lactose-containing food, in children who developed lactose malabsorption.

In addition, many patients infected by HCV also present with hypergammaglobulinemia in the early stage of chronic infection. These observations raise a possible viral superantigen effect induced by HCV, because viral superantigen found in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or in replication of defective murine leukemia virus (MuLV) is associated with T-cell dysfunction and polyclonal activation of B cells. The possibility was investigated of whether HCV encodes any superantigen by analyzing the usage of T-cell receptor (TCR) from the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of patients with chronic hepatitis C. Two groups, one with hypergammaglobulinemia and the other without hypergammaglobulinemia, were studied for the usage of TCR beta chain by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. It was found that all genes of V beta variable chain were used in the PBL of these patients. Furthermore, there was no significant difference of the TCR expression pattern between these two groups, nor a complete deletion of a particular T-cell subset in either group. These results do not provide evidence for HCV superantigen, but indicate that the TCR usage in the patients was neither defective nor biased.","['Wang, C C', 'Hwang, L H', 'Yang, P M', 'Chiang, B L', 'Chen, P J', 'Chen, D S']","['Wang CC', 'Hwang LH', 'Yang PM', 'Chiang BL', 'Chen PJ', 'Chen DS']","['Hepatitis Research Center, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Superantigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Autoantibodies/blood', 'Base Sequence', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Hepatitis C/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Hypergammaglobulinemia/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Viral/blood', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'Superantigens/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jmv.1890450105 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Virol. 1995 Jan;45(1):24-8. doi: 10.1002/jmv.1890450105.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using DNase I footprinting, transactivation studies, DNA mobility shift assays, and mutational analysis, three sites within the VIP CyRE were identified as C/EBP-related binding sites and shown to be important to CNTF/LIF-mediated transcriptional activation. The CyRE C/EBP-related sites interact with nuclear proteins from the human neuroblastoma cell line, NBFL, including a novel, protein synthesis-dependent, nuclear protein complex, induced by CNTF treatment.

Therefore, other nuclear proteins regulated by independent pathways act in concert with the JAK-STAT pathway to mediate CNTF/LIF regulation of VIP gene expression through the CyRE.","['Symes, A J', 'Rajan, P', 'Corpus, L', 'Fink, J S']","['Symes AJ', 'Rajan P', 'Corpus L', 'Fink JS']","['Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/*genetics/metabolism']",,1995/04/07 00:00,1995/04/07 00:01,['1995/04/07 00:00'],"['1995/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.14.8068 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)94658-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Apr 7;270(14):8068-75. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.14.8068.,,,,['NS27514/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This laboratory previously described an L1210 leukemia cell line, MTXrA, with acquired resistance to methotrexate (MTX) due to the loss of mobility of the reduced folate carrier. We now report on the transfection of MTXrA with a cDNA encoding the murine homolog of the human folate receptor isoform of KB cells to produce MTXrA-TF1, which constitutively expresses high levels of FR-alpha. MTXrA-TF1 and L1210 cells were utilized to compare transport of methotrexate mediated by FR-alpha and the reduced folate carrier, respectively. Methotrexate influx in the two lines was similar when the extracellular level was 0.1 microM, but as the methotrexate concentration increased, influx via the reduced folate carrier increased in comparison to influx mediated by FR-alpha. Transport kinetics indicated both a approximately 20-fold lower influx Kb and Vmax for MTXrA-TF1 as compared to L1210 cells. The two cell lines exhibited distinct influx properties. Methotrexate influx in MTXrA-TF1 was markedly inhibited by 50 nM folic acid and metabolic poisons. In L1210 cells, 1.0 microM folic acid did not affect MTX influx, and metabolic poisons either had no effect on or increased methotrexate influx. Removal of extracellular chloride markedly inhibited transport in MTXrA-TF1 but stimulated influx in L1210 cells. When the pH was decreased to 6.2, methotrexate influx was not altered in MTXrA-TF1 but was reduced in L1210 cells. Probenecid and sulfobromophthalein inhibit methotrexate influx in both L1210 and MTXrA-TF1 cell lines; however, inhibition in MTXrA-TF1 could be accounted for on the basis of inhibition of methotrexate binding to FR-alpha. The data indicate that the reduced folate carrier and FR-alpha function independently and exhibit distinct properties. FR-alpha expressed at sufficient levels can mediate influx of MTX and folates into cells at rates comparable to the reduced folate carrier and hence has pharmacologic and physiologic importance.","['Spinella, M J', 'Brigle, K E', 'Sierra, E E', 'Goldman, I D']","['Spinella MJ', 'Brigle KE', 'Sierra EE', 'Goldman ID']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Alkenes)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Ions)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Polyenes)', '0 (Pyrones)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', '0 (SLC19A2 protein, human)', '0 (Slc19a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Slc19a2 protein, mouse)', '0C2P5QKL36 (Sulfobromophthalein)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'PO572Z7917 (Probenecid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZO1648L551 (fostriecin)']",IM,"['Alkenes/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/*physiology', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Ions', 'Leukemia L1210', '*Membrane Proteins', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Mice', 'Polyenes', 'Probenecid/pharmacology', 'Pyrones', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*physiology', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Sulfobromophthalein/pharmacology', 'Temperature', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/04/07 00:00,1995/04/07 00:01,['1995/04/07 00:00'],"['1995/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.14.7842 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)94623-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Apr 7;270(14):7842-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.14.7842.,,,,"['F32 CA009349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-09340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-09349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Review of medical records and pathologic material of patients diagnosed with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure after bone marrow transplantation. SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) of a teaching hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of a consecutive cohort of children, with a history of bone marrow transplantation admitted to the pediatric ICU during a 7-yr study period, and who met a published definition of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. For each admission, the pediatric ICU course and outcome were reviewed. Pathologic material that was obtained from the patients was reexamined and assigned to one of the following categories: acute or organizing diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary hemorrhage, nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis, or infectious pneumonia. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty-three patients satisfied criteria for inclusion in the study group. Indications for bone marrow transplantation were: solid tumor (30%), leukemia (44%), congenital immunodeficiency (19%), and aplastic anemia (7%). Patients were admitted to the pediatric ICU a median of 1 month (range 0 to 126) after bone marrow transplantation. Thirty-eight (88%) patients died in the pediatric ICU. Tissue histologic material was available from 21 (49%) patients. Six (29%) of 21 patients had acute diffuse alveolar damage; one (5%) had organizing diffuse alveolar damage; three (14%) had nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis; and two (10%) had pulmonary hemorrhage. Infectious pneumonia occurred in nine (43%) cases (five fungal; four viral). CONCLUSIONS: The acute mortality rate (88%) for children with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure after bone marrow transplantation is similar to that reported for adults with this combination of conditions. Diffuse alveolar damage, the histologic hallmark of adult respiratory distress syndrome, was present in a minority (33%) of patients. Infectious pneumonia was the most frequent cause of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in patients who had pathologic tissue available, emphasizing the need for aggressive diagnostic studies and early institution of antifungal and antiviral therapy.","['Bojko, T', 'Notterman, D A', 'Greenwald, B M', 'De Bruin, W J', 'Magid, M S', 'Godwin, T']","['Bojko T', 'Notterman DA', 'Greenwald BM', 'De Bruin WJ', 'Magid MS', 'Godwin T']","['Department of Pediatrics, New York Hospital and Cornell University Medical College, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Crit Care Med,Critical care medicine,0355501,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/*etiology', 'Infant', 'Lung/*pathology', 'Lung Diseases/etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/*etiology/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00003246-199504000-00026 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Care Med. 1995 Apr;23(4):755-9. doi: 10.1097/00003246-199504000-00026.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The topo II catalytic activity is reduced 2-fold in the drug-resistant cell line in association with the absence of the M(r) 180,000 isoform of topo II and the finding of novel M(r) 160,000 topo II alpha-related immunoreactive protein in these cells by immunoblot. The topo II alpha (M(r) 170,000) protein levels in nuclear extracts from the HL-60/MX2 cells were noted on average to be approximately 40% lower than in comparable HL-60 nuclei. Studies of the subcellular localization of topo II by immunohistochemical and fractional extraction techniques demonstrated that the M(r) 160,000 topo II alpha-related protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm. Levels of the 6.3-kilobase topo II alpha mRNA were noted to be reduced 2-fold in the HL-60/MX2 cells in association with the finding of a novel 4.8-kilobase topo II alpha-related mRNA transcript that was present in HL-60/MX2 but not HL-60 cells. The absence of topo II beta protein in nuclear and whole cell extracts from the HL-60/MX2 cells was associated with the virtual absence of detectable topo II beta mRNA in those cells by Northern blot analysis. Using a reverse transcription-PCR assay we were able to demonstrate the presence of very low levels of topo II beta mRNA in HL-60/MX2 cells, representing < 1% of that found in the HL-60 cells. In contrast, the nuclear catalytic activity and cellular mRNA levels of the related nuclear enzyme DNA topoisomerase I were nearly identical in the two cell types. Southern blot analysis of DNA extracted from the drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells revealed a structural alteration in one topo II alpha allele in the HL-60/MX2 cells, but there was no evidence of rearrangement or hypermethylation of the topo II beta locus. These results indicate that the reduced levels of topo II alpha and beta isoenzymes observed in mitoxantrone-resistant HL-60/MX2 cells are related to changes in the levels of their respective mRNA transcripts. The identification of structural changes in one topo II alpha allele in the HL-60/MX2 cell line suggests that the altered allele may serve as the source of the unique 4.8-kilobase topo II alpha-related mRNA transcript and the M(r) 160,000 protein discovered in those cells.","['Harker, W G', 'Slade, D L', 'Parr, R L', 'Feldhoff, P W', 'Sullivan, D M', 'Holguin, M H']","['Harker WG', 'Slade DL', 'Parr RL', 'Feldhoff PW', 'Sullivan DM', 'Holguin MH']","['Medicine Service, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Salt Lake City, Utah 84148, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/analysis/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/analysis/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Methylation', 'Mitoxantrone/*toxicity', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Subcellular Fractions/enzymology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/04/15 00:00,1995/04/15 00:01,['1995/04/15 00:00'],"['1995/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 Apr 15;55(8):1707-16.,,,,"['5P30-CA42014-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29-33044/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following p.o. administration, this prodrug undergoes extensive biotransformation, resulting in the generation of a plethora of metabolites including 2'-deoxy-6-thioguanosine triphosphate. Incorporation of 6-thioguanine (6-TG) bases into DNA is generally considered to be central to thiopurine-mediated cytotoxicity. We have developed a novel precolumn derivatization HPLC technique for quantifying 6-TG base accumulation into leukocyte DNA obtained from acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients receiving 6-mercaptopurine maintenance therapy. The method is based on enzymatic degradation of DNA to 2'-deoxyribonucleosides and the derivatization of released 2'-deoxy-6-thioguanosine with a thiol-reactive reagent containing a 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid fluorophore. The 2'-deoxy-6-thioguanosine-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid adduct is resolved by reversed-phase HPLC and quantified fluorometrically. Assay response is linear from 15 pmol to 60 fmol 6-TG bases/microgram DNA with a limit of quantitation corresponding to the incorporation of 1 6-TG residue per 50,000 bases. In a small cohort of acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients receiving p.o. 6-mercaptopurine-based maintenance therapy, significant interindividual variation in the accumulation of 6-TG bases into leukocyte DNA was revealed. The determined levels of drug base incorporation ranged from 95 to 710 fmol 6-TG bases/microgram DNA (6-TG base:nucleotide ratio 1:32,000 to 1:4,000).

ALL-1 gene rearrangements were detected in 17 of the 74 cases with M4-M5 (myelomonocytic and monocytic) AML and in 2 of the 52 cases with other leukemic subtypes (P < 0.01). Within the series of 74 M4-M5 patients, ALL-1 rearrangements were significantly associated with French-American-British Classification M5 (P = 0.009), high WBC (P = 0.002), and young age. In particular, all 5 infant (< 1.5 years) AML cases, 6 of the 19 (31%) patients between 1.5 and 18 years of age, and 6 of the 50 (12%) patients > 18 years old showed an altered ALL-1 genomic configuration (P < 0.001). Immunophenotypic characterization revealed coexpression of lymphoid and myeloid markers in 6 of 17 ALL-1 rearranged M4-M5 cases. The IgH gene configuration was studied in 77 of 126 AMLs. Five patients (6%) showed IgH clonal rearrangements and all were in the ALL-1 rearranged group (P < 0.0001). Our findings indicate that ALL-1 rearrangement is the commonest genetic alteration presently detectable in M4-M5 AML, particularly in childhood where it is found in up to one-third of all cases. The association of IgH rearrangements with ALL-1 alterations in AML, coupled to the frequent detection in this subset of lymphoid associated markers, further supports the origin of these tumors from a common multipotent precursor with bipotential lymphoid and monocytic differentiation capability.","['Cimino, G', 'Rapanotti, M C', 'Elia, L', 'Biondi, A', 'Fizzotti, M', 'Testi, A M', 'Tosti, S', 'Croce, C M', 'Canaani, E', 'Mandelli, F']","['Cimino G', 'Rapanotti MC', 'Elia L', 'Biondi A', 'Fizzotti M', 'Testi AM', 'Tosti S', 'Croce CM', 'Canaani E', 'Mandelli F', 'et al.']","['Dipartimento di Biopatologia Umana, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'France', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/classification/*genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/classification/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Transcription Factors', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Zinc Fingers']",,1995/04/15 00:00,1995/04/15 00:01,['1995/04/15 00:00'],"['1995/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 Apr 15;55(8):1625-8.,,"['ALL-1', 'HRX', 'Hrts 1', 'MLL']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This deficiency results in the accumulation of ornithine in the body fluids and leads to hyperornithinemia. Although the clinical phenotype is largely confined to the eye, OAT deficiency is a systemic disorder. With the final goal of applying gene therapy to this human genetic disease, we have established an in vitro model to test the correction of OAT enzymatic deficiency in mammalian cells, using OAT recombinant retroviruses. We report the construction of several Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based recombinant retrovirus vectors, in which the human OAT cDNA was placed under the transcriptional control of the mouse phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter or under the enhancer-promoter regulatory element derived from the MoMLV long terminal repeat (LTR). The retrovirus constructs were packaged in the PG13-GALV cell line and used to transduce C9, an OAT deficient cell line derived from Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1). We show that the recombinant retrovirus transfers the human OAT (hOAT) gene into C9. Expression of the hOAT gene in the transduced C9 deficient cell line exceeded the OAT mRNA level and enzymatic activity of endogenous human fibroblasts.","['Lacorazza, H D', 'Jendoubi, M']","['Lacorazza HD', 'Jendoubi M']","['Genetics and Molecular Immunology Section, National Eye Institue, National Institues of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', 'EC 2.6.1.13 (Ornithine-Oxo-Acid Transaminase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'CHO Cells', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA, Recombinant/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Gyrate Atrophy/therapy', 'Humans', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Ornithine-Oxo-Acid Transaminase/*deficiency/*genetics', '*Transfection']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gene Ther. 1995 Jan;2(1):22-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) inhibited growth and decreased energy intake in seven experimentally infected weanling cats compared with age- and sex-matched controls. Remarkably, changes in energy intake, energy expenditure, and weight gain occurred in the acute phase of infection prior to the systemic/productive bone marrow phase of FeLV infection. In other words, growth inhibition developed before FeLV infection was clinically detectable with use of standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or fixed-cell immunofluorescence assays of circulating neutrophils and platelets. Acutely infected, previremic cats consumed 25% less energy [Day 4 postinoculation to Day 16 postinoculation (p < 0.05)] and expended 20% less energy [Day 8 postinoculation to Day 18 postinoculation (p < 0.05)] compared with control cats. Growth stunting of inoculated cats began by Day 11 postinoculation (p < 0.05) and was not corrected during the remaining 4 months of the study. Thus, experimental FeLV infection causes perturbations of metabolism and energy balance resulting in permanent growth impairment. Secondly, detrimental metabolic effects begin in the acute phase of retroviral infection, prior to the clinically detectable phase of FeLV infection.","['Hartke, J R', 'Hayes, K A', 'Buffington, C A', 'Mathes, L E', 'Rojko, J L']","['Hartke JR', 'Hayes KA', 'Buffington CA', 'Mathes LE', 'Rojko JL']","['Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210-1093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes and human retrovirology : official publication of the International Retrovirology Association,9501482,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Cachexia/etiology/*veterinary', 'Calorimetry, Indirect/veterinary', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cat Diseases/*etiology', 'Cats', 'Energy Intake', '*Energy Metabolism', 'Female', 'Growth Disorders/etiology/*veterinary', 'Leukemia, Feline/complications/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Random Allocation', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Viremia/complications/metabolism/veterinary']",,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol. 1995 May 1;9(1):11-9.,,,,"['R01DK40640/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DK41066/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this study was to compare the rescue effects of the four known neurotrophins [nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4)] and two of the cytokines [ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF)] in one particular experimental model of spinal motoneuron degeneration at two different survival times. The sciatic nerve was cut in neonatal rats and the factors were applied onto the nerve stump; bovine serum albumin was used in controls. Simultaneous application of the retrograde tracer fluoro-gold made it possible to count motoneurons specifically in the sciatic pool. One week after lesion, the neurotrophins BDNF, NT-3 and NT-4, but not NGF, equally enhanced motoneuron survival compared to controls; their effects were significantly better than those of the cytokines. However, the rescue from cell death was only transitory because a great number of the motoneurons died during the second week after nerve lesion. Additional BDNF and/or CNTF supplied by repeated subcutaneous injections (1 mg/ml) over 2 weeks could not prevent this delayed motoneuron loss. These results suggest that still other factors or alternative routes of administration may be required for permanent rescue of the lesioned immature motoneurons.","['Vejsada, R', 'Sagot, Y', 'Kato, A C']","['Vejsada R', 'Sagot Y', 'Kato AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Centre Medical Universitaire, Geneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur J Neurosci,The European journal of neuroscience,8918110,"['0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Axons', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Motor Neurons/*physiology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sciatic Nerve', 'Spinal Cord/ultrastructure']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1460-9568.1995.tb01025.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Neurosci. 1995 Jan 1;7(1):108-15. doi: 10.1111/j.1460-9568.1995.tb01025.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has generally been established that allogeneic BMT, compared with autologous BMT, gives rise to a graft-versus-leukemia reaction (GVLR), usually associated with GVHD. To explore a possible role for post-BMT immunotherapy, recombinant human IL-2 therapy has been studied in the Brown Norway acute myelocytic leukemia (BNML), a rat leukemia model relevant for human AML. The antileukemic efficacy of rhIL-2 therapy is studied applying different doses of rhIL-2 after syngeneic or allogeneic BMT. rhIL-2 treatment post-syngeneic BMT showed a small, borderline significant GVLR. Repeated rhIL-2 treatment after allogeneic BMT resulted either in no significant antileukemic effect or in lethal GVHD when 'low' or 'high' doses were administered, respectively. An intermediate dose, however, induced a significant GVLR without the induction of (lethal) GVHD. Transplantation of allogeneic rat BM, which contains only a few lymphocytes, does not result in a significant GVLR or GVHD and thus resembles human HLA-matched allogeneic T cell-depleted (TCD) BMT. In conclusion, from the rat studies presented it appears that the GVLR lost by TCD of the allogeneic graft, may be more than fully compensated by IL-2 treatment post-allogeneic TCD BMT.","['Kloosterman, T C', 'Martens, A C', 'Osterwalder, B', 'Hagenbeek, A']","['Kloosterman TC', 'Martens AC', 'Osterwalder B', 'Hagenbeek A']","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Interleukin-2/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/therapy', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1994 Dec;14(6):965-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A longitudinal follow-up.,871-6,"Patients receiving bone marrow transplantation (BMT) are prone to a variety of bacterial, viral and fungal infections in their oral cavity. We have therefore followed alterations in salivary Ig levels associated with BMT. Most of the patients were transplanted with allogeneic, MHC-matched BM after T cells were depleted by ex vivo treatment with an anti-lymphocytic monoclonal antibody (Campath-1) and autologous complement. Parotid saliva was collected at various time intervals before and after BMT, and IgM, IgG and IgA concentrations were determined by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A gradual fall in Ig levels was detected following patient's conditioning with a combination of chemo- and radiation therapy beginning 10 days prior to BMT. A rise in the titer of salivary Ig could be detected as early as 4 days post-BMT, which increased continuously and reached plateau levels within 2-3 weeks. However, about 3 weeks later the Ig titers decreased again and persisted at low levels for variable periods of time. A second increase in salivary Ig was detected approximately 2 months post-BMT, which persisted for prolonged periods of time. These results suggest that Ig secreted by donor B-lymphocytes and plasma cells passively transferred with the BM can rapidly reconstitute the salivary IgM, IgG and IgA of the immunocompromised recipient. However, when these cells cease to produce Ig the patients are still immunoincompetent and therefore enter a second phase of salivary Ig deficiency which may render them highly susceptible to opportunistic oral infections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Chaushu, S', 'Chaushu, G', 'Garfunkel, A A', 'Slavin, S', 'Or, R', 'Yefenof, E']","['Chaushu S', 'Chaushu G', 'Garfunkel AA', 'Slavin S', 'Or R', 'Yefenof E']","['Lautenberg Center of General and Tumor Immunology, Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Dental Medicine, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Salivary Proteins and Peptides)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/*metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin G/*metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin M/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Saliva/*immunology', 'Salivary Proteins and Peptides/immunology']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1994 Dec;14(6):871-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: A study of the incidence of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma among children living near large construction projects in Britain since 1945, situated more than 20 km from a population centre, involving a workforce of more than 1000, and built over three or more calendar years. For periods before 1962 mortality was studied. SETTING: Areas within 10 km of relevant sites, and the highland counties of Scotland with many hydroelectric schemes. SUBJECTS: Children aged under 15. RESULTS: A 37% excess of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at 0-14 years of age was recorded during construction and the following calendar year. The excesses were greater at times when construction workers and operating staff overlapped (72%), particularly in areas of relatively high social class. For several sites the excesses were similar to or greater than that near the nuclear site of Sellafield (67%), which is distinctive in its large workforce with many construction workers. Seascale, near Sellafield, with a ninefold increase had an unusually high proportion of residents in social class I. The only study parish of comparable social class also showed a significant excess, with a confidence interval that included the Seascale excess. CONCLUSION: The findings support the infection hypothesis and reinforce the view that the excess of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma near Sellafield has a similar explanation.","['Kinlen, L J', 'Dickson, M', 'Stiller, C A']","['Kinlen LJ', 'Dickson M', 'Stiller CA']","['Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Infirmary.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology', 'Facility Design and Construction', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Nuclear Reactors', 'Paternal Exposure', 'Population', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Rural Health', 'Social Class', 'Wales/epidemiology']",PMC2549162,1995/03/25 00:00,1995/03/25 00:01,['1995/03/25 00:00'],"['1995/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.310.6982.763 [doi]'],ppublish,BMJ. 1995 Mar 25;310(6982):763-8. doi: 10.1136/bmj.310.6982.763.,,,,,,,,['BMJ 1995 Apr 8;310(6984):911'],,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Patients were surveyed during repeated treatments of maintenance chemotherapy, given with or without ondansetron, using a repeated measures pretest/posttest design. SETTING: Outpatient pediatric oncology clinic. PATIENT POPULATION: Sixteen pediatric patients (aged 2-15 years, mean 6.2) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: Surveys to assess nausea and vomiting and the extent of interference with daily activities were administered following emetogenic chemotherapy with or without ondansetron. RESULTS: A total of 255 surveys following emetogenic chemotherapy with daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide, carmustine, and etoposide and cytarabine combined, as well as intrathecal therapy with methotrexate, hydrocortisone, and cytarabine, were analyzed. Analysis was performed on surveys of 149 courses without antiemetic therapy and 106 courses after 2 doses of ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg iv. The most emetogenic chemotherapy treatment was the etoposide/cytarabine combination (p < 0.05). Ondansetron completely protected patients (defined as no nausea or no vomiting) during most (> 50%) of the chemotherapy treatments, except for those in which cyclophosphamide was used. Ondansetron provided greater control of nausea and vomiting, a higher percentage of complete protection, and decreased the daily activity interference rating for carmustine and etoposide/cytarabine compared with courses of chemotherapy without antiemetics (p < 0.05). Two intravenous doses of ondansetron also provided durable antiemetic efficacy over time for the most emetogenic chemotherapy treatment (etoposide/cytarabine). CONCLUSIONS: Etoposide/cytarabine proved to be the most emetogenic of the chemotherapy treatments studied.

These constructs were expressed heterologously in both Xenopus oocytes and a mouse cytotoxic T cell line. Our results show that a truncated mutant Kv1.3 must contain both the amino terminus and the first transmembrane-spanning segment, S1, to suppress full-length Kv1.3 currents. Amino-terminal-truncated DNA sequences from one subfamily suppress K+ channel expression of members of only the same subfamily. The first 141 amino acids of the amino-terminal of Kv1.3 are not necessary for channel formation. Deletion of these amino acids yields a current identical to that of full-length Kv1.3, except that it cannot be suppressed by a truncated Kv1.3 containing the amino terminus and S1. To test the ability of truncated Kv1.3 to suppress endogenous K+ currents, we constructed a plasmid that contained both truncated Kv1.3 and a selection marker gene (mouse CD4). Although constitutively expressed K+ currents in Jurkat (a human T cell leukemia line) and GH3 (an anterior pituitary cell line) cells cannot be suppressed by this double-gene plasmid, stimulated (up-regulated) Shaker-like K+ currents in GH3 cells can be suppressed.","['Tu, L', 'Santarelli, V', 'Deutsch, C']","['Tu L', 'Santarelli V', 'Deutsch C']","['Department of Physiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104-6085.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,"['0 (KCNA3 protein, human)', '0 (Kcna3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kv1.3 Potassium Channel)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '0 (Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated)', '0 (RNA, Complementary)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biophysical Phenomena', 'Biophysics', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/*genetics', 'Electrophysiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kv1.3 Potassium Channel', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oocytes/metabolism', 'Potassium Channels/*genetics/metabolism', '*Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated', 'RNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Suppression, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Xenopus laevis']",PMC1281671,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-3495(95)80169-4 [pii]', '10.1016/S0006-3495(95)80169-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 1995 Jan;68(1):147-56. doi: 10.1016/S0006-3495(95)80169-4.,,,,['GM 41467/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The TAR element is present on the 5' and 3' ends of all HIV-1 transcripts and is relatively conserved among different HIV-1 isolates. These properties make it an attractive target for anti-HIV-1 gene therapy strategies. We have constructed a Moloney murine leukemia-based retroviral vector that expresses a chimeric tRNA(iMet)-antisense TAR fusion transcript complementary to the HIV-1 TAR region. The potential of this anti-TAR retroviral vector to inhibit HIV-1 was initially tested by transient transfections with an HIV-1-LTR-Tat expression plasmid into HeLa-CAT cells. Anti-TAR inhibited Tat-mediated HIV-1 LTR-driven CAT reporter gene expression in a dose-dependent fashion. The antisense-TAR vector was then used to transduce the human SupT1 T cell line. Cotransfection of these SupT1 cells with a Tat expression plasmid plus an HIV-1 LTR-CAT reporter plasmid resulted in decreased CAT gene expression in comparison to control transduced SupT1 cells. The antisense-TAR engineered SupT1 cell line was then challenged with HIV-1MN.HIV-1 viral production was inhibited in SupT1 cells transduced with the antisense-TAR retroviral vector. Greater inhibition of HIV-1 was observed with antisense-TAR as compared to antisense-Tat expressing retroviral vector. These observations suggest that antisense-TAR retroviral vectors are potentially useful for clinical anti-HIV-1 gene therapy.,"['Chuah, M K', 'VandenDriessche, T', 'Chang, H K', 'Ensoli, B', 'Morgan, R A']","['Chuah MK', 'VandenDriessche T', 'Chang HK', 'Ensoli B', 'Morgan RA']","['Clinical Gene Therapy Branch, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (RNA, Antisense)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Genes, tat', '*Genetic Vectors', '*HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'HIV-1/*drug effects/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Antisense/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transfection']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1994.5.12-1467 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1994 Dec;5(12):1467-75. doi: 10.1089/hum.1994.5.12-1467.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oncogenic mutants of this receptor tyrosine kinase cause erythroid leukemia, fibrosarcoma, angiosarcoma, glioblastoma, and melanoma. Mutations in the avian protooncogene occur by retroviral mechanisms. Deletion of the ligand-binding domain results in erythroblastosis, while additional mutations in cytoplasmic structures broaden the disease potential to other cell types. A carboxyl-terminal structure of erbB oncogenes modulates growth responses in a complex, cell-specific manner; this tissue-specificity region appears to promote growth in erythroblasts and to produce trans-dominant inhibition in fibroblasts. Human glioblastoma multiforme frequently contains receptor mutations that are reminiscent of avian oncogenes. In hereditary melanoma of Xiphophorus, aberrant regulation of transcription by a recombinant promoter determines tissue-specific tumorigenesis. The diversity of oncogenic mutations raises important questions concerning the roles of several receptor structures. The extracellular domain inhibits the receptor when unoccupied by ligand, for example, through a mechanism that is unknown. The auto-phosphorylation sites are dispensable for transformation, so their function in neoplastic growth is unclear. The carboxyl-terminal region promotes or blocks transformation in different tissues, suggesting complex regulation by unknown cellular factors. These issues are critical to understanding of the mechanisms of receptor activation and tissue tropism for this family of oncogenes.","['Carter, T H', 'Kung, H J']","['Carter TH', 'Kung HJ']","['William K.

This shift results in silencing of erythroid genes and in additional activation of megakaryocytic genes. It was shown that destabilization of the most abundant erythroid mRNA of K562 cells coding for fetal globin (gamma-globin,) is partially responsible for its silencing in phorbol ester-induced K562 cells. In this work the mechanism of the gamma-globin mRNA destabilization is further investigated. The results show that this process is accompanied by the progressive shortening of the gamma-globin mRNA poly(A) tail. Also, degradation intermediates of gamma-globin mRNA observed during the course of PMA treatment are shown to contain an intact 5' end, but lack the sequences at the 3' end. Based on these findings, a model for the selective destabilization of the erythroid mRNAs during the course of megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells is proposed.","['Lumelsky, N L']",['Lumelsky NL'],"['University of Wisconsin Department of Medicine, Madison 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Globins/*chemistry/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Poly A/*chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/*chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,1995/04/04 00:00,1995/04/04 00:01,['1995/04/04 00:00'],"['1995/04/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/04 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4781(94)00249-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4781(94)00249-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1995 Apr 4;1261(2):265-71. doi: 10.1016/0167-4781(94)00249-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cardiovascular toxicity was monitored by ECG and 2 hourly blood pressure and pulse recordings. Verapamil and norverapamil plasma concentrations were measured daily. Disease response was assessed after two courses. A total of 29/35 treatment courses were given at the desired verapamil dose; five courses required a dose reduction owing to cardiovascular toxicity. No patient required intensive monitoring. All patients who developed cardiovascular toxicity were over 14 years old. There was no correlation between plasma verapamil or norverapamil concentrations and toxicity. There were six partial responses (three rhabdomyosarcoma, three neuroblastoma) after two courses, but because of variation in the dose and schedule of etoposide these cannot be unequivocally contributed to MDR reversal.

Such a patient presented with basophilia, headaches, and diffuse engorgement of superficial blood vessels, attributable to hyperhistaminemia. Karyotype analysis showed a clonal rearrangement of chromosome 12p13 in addition to the t(15;17). During treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid (TRA), the absolute basophil count rose steadily during the first week, then declined. By one month, the basophilia resolved, an abrupt rise occurred in both the platelet and absolute neutrophil count, and the bone core biopsy showed complete maturation of all cell lines. Abnormalities of chromosome 12p13 in acute myelogenous leukemia have been associated with basophilia. Since every cell in our patient with t(12p13;?) also had the t(15;17), we speculate that the basophilia was due to clonal evolution with acquisition of the t(12p13;?). In two out of five other reported cases, abnormalities of chromosomes known to be associated with basophilia were present in addition to t(15;17). It is possible that the basophilia in this variant is reactive; however, since TRA induces differentiation of leukemic promyelocytes into mature neutrophils, we speculate that the leukemic promyelocytes in our patient differentiated into basophils. Future studies employing either fluorescent in situ hybridization or polymerase chain reaction using a probe to the breakpoint on t(15;17) may establish whether or not the basophils derive from the leukemic clone.","['Tallman, M S', 'Hakimian, D', 'Snower, D', 'Rubin, C M', 'Reisel, H', 'Variakojis, D']","['Tallman MS', 'Hakimian D', 'Snower D', 'Rubin CM', 'Reisel H', 'Variakojis D']","['Northwestern University Medical School, Department of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 60611.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Basophils/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology']",,1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Apr;7(4):521-6.,,,42,,,,['Leukemia. 1995 Jan;9(1):225-6.

Natural transduction involves two nonhomologous recombinations and is thus extremely rare. Since transduction has never been reproduced experimentally, its mechanism has been studied in terms of two hypotheses: (i) the DNA model, which postulates two DNA recombinations, and (ii) the RNA model, which postulates a 5' DNA recombination and a 3' RNA recombination occurring during reverse transcription of viral and protooncogene RNA. Here we use two viral DNA constructs to test the prediction of the DNA model that the 3' DNA recombination is achieved by conventional integration of a retroviral DNA 3' of the chromosomal protooncogene coding region. For the DNA model to be viable, such recombinant viruses must be infectious without the purportedly essential polypurine tract (ppt) that precedes the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR) of all retroviruses. Our constructs consist of a ras coding region from Harvey sarcoma virus which is naturally linked at the 5' end to a retroviral LTR and artificially linked at the 3' end either directly (construct NdN) or by a cellular sequence (construct SU) to the 5' LTR of a retrovirus. Both constructs lack the ppt, and the LTR of NdN even lacks 30 nucleotides at the 5' end. Both constructs proved to be infectious, producing viruses at titers of 10(5) focus-forming units per ml. Sequence analysis proved that both viruses were colinear with input DNAs and that NdN virus lacked a ppt and the 5' 30 nucleotides of the LTR.

DNA recombination explains the following observations by others that cannot be reconciled with the RNA model: (i) experimental transduction is independent of the packaging efficiency of viral RNA, and (ii) experimental transduction may invert sequences with respect to others, as expected for DNA recombination during transfection.","['Schwartz, J R', 'Duesberg, S', 'Duesberg, P H']","['Schwartz JR', 'Duesberg S', 'Duesberg PH']","['Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley 94720-3206, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/*genetics/physiology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/*metabolism', '*Genes, ras', 'Harvey murine sarcoma virus/*genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Proviruses/*genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Virus Replication']",PMC42237,1995/03/28 00:00,1995/03/28 00:01,['1995/03/28 00:00'],"['1995/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.7.2460 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Mar 28;92(7):2460-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.7.2460.,,"['env', 'gag', 'pol', 'ras']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cultured sympathetic neurons, CNTF and LIF induce transcription of the VIP and other neuropeptide genes as part of a program of differentiation. To gain insight into the nuclear events involved in cytokine-mediated activation of the neuropeptide genes involved in neuronal differentiation, we have investigated the mechanisms of transcriptional activation of the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) gene by the CNTF family of cytokines. In the neuroblastoma cell line NBFL, CNTF, LIF, and a related cytokine, oncostatin-M, activate VIP gene transcription through a 180-base pair cytokine response element (CyRE). Deletion analysis of the VIP CyRE showed that multiple regions within the 180 base-pairs are important for cytokine-mediated transcriptional activation of the VIP gene. To one of these regions within the CyRE, cytokine treatment induces binding of a protein complex composed of members of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) transcription factor family. Mutation of this STAT-binding site attenuates cytokine-mediated transcriptional activation. LIF treatment of primary sympathetic neurons also induced binding of a STAT-containing protein complex to the VIP CyRE. Thus, activation of STAT transcription factors contributes to the induction of the VIp gene by the CNTF family of cytokines and may be involved in cytokine-mediated differentiation of sympathetic neurons.","['Symes, A', 'Lewis, S', 'Corpus, L', 'Rajan, P', 'Hyman, S E', 'Fink, J S']","['Symes A', 'Lewis S', 'Corpus L', 'Rajan P', 'Hyman SE', 'Fink JS']","['Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston 02114.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'DNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Neuroblastoma/metabolism', 'Neurons/metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/*genetics']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/mend.8.12.7708062 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 1994 Dec;8(12):1750-63. doi: 10.1210/mend.8.12.7708062.,,,,"['MH-00892/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-27514/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-29767/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five cases (4 males, 1 female; age range 22-77 years) diagnosed with GS in one center over a period of nine years (1984-1993) are described. The GS were located in the lymph nodes, the jaw, paravertebral region, gallbladder and retroperitoneum, respectively. Two patients had refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB). Three patients had ANLL; in one GS constituted the form of relapse, in another GS presented at the time of diagnosis and in the remaining patient GS preceded the diagnosis of ANLL.

Although the interaction of Rex/Rev with a cellular cofactor(s) has been thought to be required for Rex/Rev action, there is no suitable system to search for the cofactor(s) in mammalian cells. We found that a Rex mutant, TAgRex, which contains a simian virus 40 nuclear localization signal in place of the N-terminal 19 amino acids of Rex, could dominantly inhibit wild-type Rex/Rev functions. The inhibition did not require either Rev response element/Rex response element binding or the oligomerization ability of the mutant, but it did require a region around amino acid 90 of the Rex protein, suggesting that TAgRex sequestered the cellular cofactor. Complementation with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) in this system could restore the impaired Rex function. These results indicate that eIF-5A is the cofactor indispensable for Rex function. Additionally, by using a two-hybrid system, the homo-oligomer formation of Rex was found to be mediated by the region around amino acid 90 in addition to Tyr-64 and Trp-65 of Rex protein. Thus, eIF-5A may play a part in the formation of the Rex homo-oligomer.","['Katahira, J', 'Ishizaki, T', 'Sakai, H', 'Adachi, A', 'Yamamoto, K', 'Shida, H']","['Katahira J', 'Ishizaki T', 'Sakai H', 'Adachi A', 'Yamamoto K', 'Shida H']","['Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, rev)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Peptide Initiation Factors)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A)', '0 (rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Gene Products, rev/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, rex/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, Dominant', 'HIV-1/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Peptide Initiation Factors/*metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', '*RNA-Binding Proteins', 'rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",PMC189014,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.5.3125-3133.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 May;69(5):3125-33. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.5.3125-3133.1995.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The core elements of the SL3 virus are important genetic determinants of the ability of this virus to induce T-cell lymphomas and the transcriptional activity of the viral long terminal repeat in T lymphocytes. CBF consists of two subunits, a DNA binding subunit, CBF alpha, and a second subunit, CBF beta, that stimulates the DNA binding activity of CBF alpha. One of the genes that encodes a CBF alpha subunit is AML1, also called Cbf alpha 2. This locus is rearranged by chromosomal translocations in human myeloproliferative disorders and leukemias. An exogenously expressed Cbf alpha 2-encoded subunit (CBF alpha 2-451) stimulated transcription from the SL3 enhancer in P19 and HeLa cells. Activity was mediated through the core elements. Three different isoforms of CBF beta were also tested for transcriptional activity on the SL3 enhancer. The longest form, CBF beta-187, increased the transcriptional stimulation by CBF alpha 2-451 twofold in HeLa cells, although it had no effect in P19 cells. Transcriptional activation by CBF beta required binding to the CBF alpha subunit, as a form of CBF beta that lacked binding ability, CBF beta-148, failed to increase activity. These results indicated that at least in certain cell types, the maximum activity of CBF required both subunits. They also provided support for the hypothesis that CBF is a factor in T lymphocytes that is responsible for recognition of the SL3 cores. We also examined whether CBF could distinguish a 1-bp difference between the enhancer core of SL3 and the core of the nonleukemogenic virus, Akv. This difference strongly affects transcription in T cells and leukemogenicity of SL3. However, no combination of CBF alpha and CBF beta subunits that we tested was able to distinguish the 1-bp difference in transcription assays. Thus, a complete understanding of how T cells recognize the SL3 core remains to be elucidated.","['Zaiman, A L', 'Lewis, A F', 'Crute, B E', 'Speck, N A', 'Lenz, J']","['Zaiman AL', 'Lewis AF', 'Crute BE', 'Speck NA', 'Lenz J']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factors', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Genes, Viral', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/virology', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",PMC188987,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.5.2898-2906.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 May;69(5):2898-906. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.5.2898-2906.1995.,,['AML1'],,"['CA44822/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51065/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57337/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutagenesis has shown that the virion association of Vpr requires sequences near the C terminus of the HIV-1 Gag polyprotein Pr55gag. To investigate whether Vpr incorporation is mediated by a specific domain of Pr55gag, we examined the ability of chimeric HIV-1/Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) Gag polyproteins to direct the incorporation of Vpr. Vpr expressed in trans did not associate with particles formed by the authentic MLV Gag polyprotein or with particles formed by chimeric Gag polyproteins that had the matrix (MA) or capsid (CA) domain of MLV precisely replaced by the corresponding domain of HIV-1HXB2. By contrast, Vpr was efficiently incorporated upon replacement of the C-terminal nucleocapsid (NC) domain of the MLV Gag polyprotein with HIV-1 p15 sequences. Vpr was also efficiently incorporated into particles formed by a MLV Gag polyprotein that had the HIV-1 p6 domain fused to its C terminus. Furthermore, a deletion analysis revealed that a conserved region near the C terminus of the p6 domain is essential for Vpr incorporation, whereas sequences downstream of the conserved region are dispensable. These results show that a virion association motif for Vpr is located within residues 1 to 46 of p6.","['Kondo, E', 'Mammano, F', 'Cohen, E A', 'Gottlinger, H G']","['Kondo E', 'Mammano F', 'Cohen EA', 'Gottlinger HG']","['Division of Human Retrovirology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Gene Products, vpr)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (p6 gag protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)', '0 (vpr Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Gene Products, gag/*genetics/physiology', 'Gene Products, vpr/*genetics/physiology', 'Genes, gag', 'Genes, vpr', 'HIV-1/*genetics/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Virus Replication/genetics/physiology', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus', 'vpr Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",PMC188969,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.5.2759-2764.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 May;69(5):2759-64. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.5.2759-2764.1995.,,,,"['AI28691/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI29873/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI34267/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PURPOSE: We identify the cancers accounting for the rising incidence, quantify the changes that have occurred from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s, and contrast incidence and mortality trends to provide clues to the determinants of the temporal patterns. METHODS: Sex-, race-, and age-specific and age-adjusted incidence rates for the 5-year periods 1987-1991 versus 1975-1979 were calculated for 28 cancers among men and 30 cancers among women using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of cancer registration covering about 10% of the U.S. population. Similar rates were computed using national mortality data. Cancers were ranked according to the change in incidence rates over the two periods. RESULTS: Age-adjusted incidence rates for all cancers combined increased by 18.6% among males and 12.4% among females from 1975-1979 to 1987-1991, due largely to rising rates for prostate cancer among men and for breast and lung cancers among women. National mortality rates for all cancers combined rose less steeply, 3% and 6% among men and women, respectively, driven mostly by continuing increases in lung cancer mortality, while death rates for the majority of the cancers were steady or declining. Total cancer incidence rose at all ages, but with different tumors responsible for the increases at different ages: leukemia and brain/nervous system cancer among children; testicular cancer, nonmelanoma skin cancer (largely Kaposi's sarcoma), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and melanoma among young and middle-aged adults; and prostate, breast, and lung cancers among older individuals. In contrast, mortality rates for all cancers combined declined among both males and females under age 55 years, increasing only among older persons. CONCLUSIONS: Trends in cancer incidence and mortality differ. For most cancers, incidence rates are rising, while mortality rates are generally stable or declining. IMPLICATIONS: Much of the recent increase in cancer incidence can be explained by known factors. Improved detection appears to account for most of the increases in breast cancer among women and prostate cancer among men. On the other hand, cigarette smoking is the major determinant of the rise in lung cancer among women, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome has led to increases in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma among young and middle-aged men, and sunlight exposure patterns have affected the trends in melanoma. Some trends remain unexplained, however, and may reflect changing exposures to carcinogens yet to be identified and clarified.","['Devesa, S S', 'Blot, W J', 'Stone, B J', 'Miller, B A', 'Tarone, R E', 'Fraumeni, J F Jr']","['Devesa SS', 'Blot WJ', 'Stone BJ', 'Miller BA', 'Tarone RE', 'Fraumeni JF Jr']","['Division of Cancer Etiology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-7368, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Age Distribution', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Racial Groups', 'SEER Program', 'Sex Distribution', 'United States/epidemiology']",,1995/02/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/87.3.175 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1995 Feb 1;87(3):175-82. doi: 10.1093/jnci/87.3.175.,,,,,,,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1995 Feb 1;87(3):159-60.

A major obstacle in the chemotherapy of this neoplasm is the emergence of multidrug resistance that is frequently associated with the expression of P-glycoprotein (p170) encoded by MDR1 (also known as PGY1) genes. Previously, we demonstrated that liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin is more cytotoxic than free doxorubicin in human promyelocytic leukemia and human breast cancer cells with the multidrug-resistant phenotype. PURPOSE: Our purpose was to investigate modulation of multidrug resistance by liposome-encapsulated vincristine (VCR) in a drug-resistant human colon cancer cell line HT-29mdr1 and the potentiation of this modulation in combination with monoclonal antibody MRK-16 or verapamil. METHODS: HT-29 parental cells and HT-29mdr1 cells were exposed to free VCR or liposome-encapsulated VCR alone or in combination with MRK-16 or verapamil. Cytotoxicity of cells after various treatments was determined by neutral red staining, and cellular content of VCR was measured by using radiolabeled VCR; p170 expression of cells was assessed by azidopine. RESULTS: HT-29mdr1 cells express a high amount of p170, thus conferring sixfold to sevenfold resistance to VCR compared with the parent cell line. Liposome-encapsulated VCR lowers drug resistance in HT-29mdr1 cells fourfold; IC50 values (concentration that causes 50% reduction in cell number) were 12.5 +/- 2.5 ng/mL compared with 42.5 +/- 5.0 ng/mL with free VCR. IC50 values for free VCR with empty liposomes were 25 +/- 1.25 ng/mL. The combination of MRK-16 and free VCR produced a twofold increase in cytotoxicity over free VCR in p170-expressing cells; the combination of MRK-16 and liposome-encapsulated VCR produced a 10-fold potentiation of cytotoxicity. toxicity. Nonspecific monoclonal antibody NR-LU-10 had no effect on cytotoxicity of HT-29mdr1 cells with free VCR or liposome-encapsulated VCR. The combination of 1.5 microM verapamil potentiated the cytotoxicity of free VCR ninefold to 10-fold, IC50 values reduced to 5.0 +/- 1.5 ng/mL, and in combination with liposome-encapsulated VCR, IC50 values reduced to 2.5 +/- 1.0 ng/mL, demonstrating a 15- to 17-fold potentiation of cytotoxicity. There were no significant differences in drug accumulation in HT-29mdr1 cells when treated with liposome-encapsulated VCR or free VCR. Liposomes inhibited the photoaffinity labeling of azidopine to p170 HT-29mdr1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Liposome encapsulation of VCR effectively modulates multidrug resistance in human colon cancer cells and may become an important modality in treatment for colon cancers.","['Sela, S', 'Husain, S R', 'Pearson, J W', 'Longo, D L', 'Rahman, A']","['Sela S', 'Husain SR', 'Pearson JW', 'Longo DL', 'Rahman A']","['Department of Medicine, Georgetown University, Washington, D.C. 20007, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Drug Carriers', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Liposomes', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/*therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage']",,1995/01/18 00:00,1995/01/18 00:01,['1995/01/18 00:00'],"['1995/01/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/18 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/87.2.123 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1995 Jan 18;87(2):123-8. doi: 10.1093/jnci/87.2.123.,,['MDR1'],,,,,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1995 Jan 18;87(2):73-5.

The Cl- channel was not seen at negative membrane potentials in excised patches until the membrane potential was depolarized to greater than +40 mV. The channel was also activated by addition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) catalytic subunit at physiological membrane potential (-40 mV). Biophysical studies of the Cl- channel revealed that the current-voltage (I-V) relationship of the Cl- channel was outwardly rectifying in symmetrical 142 mM Cl- solutions. Single channel conductances were 48 pS for the outward current measured at +60 mV and 27 pS for the inward current at -60 mV. The open time constant of the channel was dependent on the membrane potential and was significantly prolonged at positive membrane potentials. Channels activated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase spent a significantly longer time in the open state compared to those channels activated by depolarization pulses. Pharmacological properties of the Cl- channel were also studied. Two anion transport inhibitors, anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (9-AC) and 4,4-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2-disulfonic acid (DIDS) caused a flickering block of the channel. Half-inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for 9-AC and DIDS were 174 +/- 20 and 70 +/- 16 microM, respectively. Blockade of the Cl- channel by 9-AC or DIDS was completely reversible. Our findings suggest that outwardly rectifying Cl- channels (ORCC) are present in human hematopoietic myeloblasts. The function of ORCC may be involved in hormone-regulated cell growth, cell volume regulation and immune responses.","['Xu, B', 'Lu, L']","['Xu B', 'Lu L']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Wright State University School of Medicine, Dayton, Ohio 45435.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Membr Biol,The Journal of membrane biology,0211301,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Chloride Channels)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '723-62-6 (9-anthroic acid)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', ""Q1O6DSW23R (4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid)""]",IM,"[""4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid/pharmacology"", 'Anthracenes/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chloride Channels/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cyclic AMP/physiology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Ion Channel Gating/drug effects/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00233384 [doi]'],ppublish,J Membr Biol. 1994 Oct;142(1):65-75. doi: 10.1007/BF00233384.,,,,['GM46834/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-three patients were given CdA as a subcutaneous injection once daily for 7 days. Complete remission (CR) required normalized blood counts and the absence of B-ly 7-positive bone marrow cells by flow cytometry. CdA concentrations in plasma following the first injection were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients (81%) achieved a durable CR after one (n = 55) or two courses, and 10 had a partial remission (PR). With a median follow-up duration of 20 months, no patient had a clinical relapse. Neutropenic fever that required intravenous antibiotics occurred in 28 patients (38%). No toxicity at injection sites was observed. Incomplete response was predicted by an elevated lymphocyte count and serum beta 2-microglobulin level, and by a high percentage of hairy cells in the bone marrow.

No nausea, emesis, alopecia, or renal, hepatic, or cardiac toxicity was observed. CONCLUSION: 2-CdA has activity in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. However, patients who have received multiple prior regimens that included fludarabine are less likely to respond, and there can be significant morbidity. Treatment of patients with less prior therapy earlier in the natural history of the disease may lead to improved and more durable responses.","['Tallman, M S', 'Hakimian, D', 'Zanzig, C', 'Hogan, D K', 'Rademaker, A', 'Rose, E', 'Variakojis, D']","['Tallman MS', 'Hakimian D', 'Zanzig C', 'Hogan DK', 'Rademaker A', 'Rose E', 'Variakojis D']","['Department of Medicine, Robert H.

Interferon alfa-2a and pentostatin are active agents. The National Cancer Institute organized an intergroup trial to compare these agents prospectively in untreated patients. METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive either interferon alfa-2a (3 x 10(6) U subcutaneously three times per week) or pentostatin (4 mg/m2 intravenously every 2 weeks). Patients who did not respond to initial treatment were crossed over. RESULTS: Of 356 patients on study, 313 were eligible. Among interferon patients, 17 of 159 (11%) achieved a confirmed complete remission and 60 of 159 (38%) had a confirmed complete or partial remission. Among pentostatin patients, 117 of 154 (76%) achieved a confirmed complete remission and 121 of 154 (79%) had a confirmed complete or partial remission. Additional patients achieved criteria for complete remission, but lacked confirmatory follow-up evaluation. Response rates were significantly higher (P < .0001) and relapse-free survival was significantly longer with pentostatin than interferon (P < .0001). The median follow-up duration is 57 months (range, 19 to 82). Myelosuppression was more frequent with pentostatin (P = .013). A multivariate logistic regression analysis of the confirmed complete remissions on pentostatin showed the following factors to be important for achieving a complete remission: high hemoglobin level (two-tailed P = .024), young age (P = .0085), and no or little splenomegaly (P = .0029). CONCLUSION: Both agents were well tolerated. Pentostatin produced higher response rates, and the responses were durable. Patient age and clinical status had an impact on outcome with pentostatin. Pentostatin is effective therapy for hairy cell leukemia.","['Grever, M', 'Kopecky, K', 'Foucar, M K', 'Head, D', 'Bennett, J M', 'Hutchison, R E', 'Corbett, W E', 'Cassileth, P A', 'Habermann, T', 'Golomb, H']","['Grever M', 'Kopecky K', 'Foucar MK', 'Head D', 'Bennett JM', 'Hutchison RE', 'Corbett WE', 'Cassileth PA', 'Habermann T', 'Golomb H', 'et al.']","['National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Pentostatin/*therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Splenomegaly/pathology', 'United States']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.4.974 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Apr;13(4):974-82. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.4.974.,,,,"['CA-04920/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-20319/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-38926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,['J Clin Oncol. 1995 Oct;13(10):2677-9.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with newly diagnosed BL or L3 ALL, most of whom were treated with very intensive regimens, including early CNS disease treatment, were studied. Detection of p53 mutations was made by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of exons 5 to 8 of the gene, and mutations were determined by direct sequencing of exons with abnormal SSCP findings. Comparison of outcome between mutated and nonmutated cases was made in all patients and also after excluding five patients who received therapeutic regimens considered as suboptimal and one patient who died of AIDS while in complete remission (CR), as those six patients had no p53 mutations. RESULTS: A point mutation was found in nine patients (19%), and consisted of a missense mutation in seven and a chain-terminating mutation in two. SSCP, sequence, and cytogenetic analysis strongly suggested that eight of nine patients with mutations had retained the normal p53 allele, which had been lost in the remaining patient. These findings were confirmed by fluorescence-in-situ hybridization (FISH) with a p53-specific probe in two patients, including the one who had lost the normal p53 allele. Unexpectedly, mutations were significantly less frequent in patients with disseminated disease, ie, L3 ALL or stage IV BL (four of 35, 11%), than in more localized forms, ie, BL stage I, II, or III (five of 13, 38%) (P = .03). CR rates were similar in mutated (78%) and nonmutated cases (78%). The actuarial disease-free interval (DFI) after 12 months and actuarial survival rates after 24 months were 49% and 66%, respectively, in patients with mutations, and 73% and 48%, respectively, those without mutations. The differences were not significant. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that, contrary to what is seen in most other neoplasias, p53 mutations in newly diagnosed BL and L3 ALL are not associated with extensive tumor mass or poor response to intensive therapeutic regimens. It is hypothesized that this difference with most tumors could be due to the fact that p53 mutations in BL and L3 ALL are generally associated with persistence of a normal residual p53 allele, contrary to what is observed in the majority of tumors.","['Preudhomme, C', 'Dervite, I', 'Wattel, E', 'Vanrumbeke, M', 'Flactif, M', 'Lai, J L', 'Hecquet, B', 'Coppin, M C', 'Nelken, B', 'Gosselin, B']","['Preudhomme C', 'Dervite I', 'Wattel E', 'Vanrumbeke M', 'Flactif M', 'Lai JL', 'Hecquet B', 'Coppin MC', 'Nelken B', 'Gosselin B', 'et al.']","[""Inserm U124, Laboratoire d'Hematologie A, Centre Oscar Lambret, Lille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Survival Rate']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.4.812 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Apr;13(4):812-20. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.4.812.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present studies have examined the effects of TNF-alpha on the induction of EGR-1 expression in human myeloid leukemia cells and the potential cytoplasmic signaling cascades that transduce TNF-induced signals to the nucleus. The results demonstrate that treatment of HL-60 cells with TNF is associated with the transient induction of the EGR-1 gene. The results also demonstrate that TNF treatment is associated with activation of the serine/threonine kinase, pp90rsk, which acts upstream to EGR-1 gene induction. Partial purification of pp90rsk by affinity chromatography demonstrated an increase in S6 peptide phosphorylation in response to TNF treatment. Because TNF activates sphingomyelin hydrolysis, we also studied the effects of sphingomyelinase (SMase) on induction of EGR-1 and pp90rsk. The results demonstrate that SMase also activates pp90rsk and induces EGR-1 gene expression. Previous work has demonstrated that mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activates pp90rsk. The present studies further show that treatment with TNF or SMase is associated with induction of both the pp42/44 MAP and the related Jun kinases. Induction of pp42/44 MAP kinase activity is temporally related to activation of pp90rsk and the EGR-1 gene. These findings support the involvement of an MAP kinase/pp90rsk/EGR-1 cascade in the response of myeloid leukemia cells to TNF.","['Saleem, A', 'Yuan, Z M', 'Taneja, N', 'Rubin, E', 'Kufe, D W', 'Kharbanda, S M']","['Saleem A', 'Yuan ZM', 'Taneja N', 'Rubin E', 'Kufe DW', 'Kharbanda SM']","['Division of Cancer Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genes, Immediate-Early', 'Humans', '*Immediate-Early Proteins', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",,1995/04/15 00:00,1995/04/15 00:01,['1995/04/15 00:00'],"['1995/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1995 Apr 15;154(8):4150-6.,,"['EGR-1', 'rsk']",,['CA-42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We addressed these issues by identifying cell surface proteins with which P-ODN specifically interact, studying P-ODN internalization mechanisms, and by tracking internalized P-ODN through the cell using immunochemical and ultrastructural techniques. Chemical cross-linking studies with a biotin-labeled P-ODN (bP-ODN), revealed the existence of five major cell surface P-ODN binding protein groups ranging in size from approximately 20-143 kD. Binding to these proteins was competitively inhibited with unlabeled P-ODN, but not free biotin, suggesting specificity of the interactions. Additional experiments suggested that binding proteins likely exist as single chain structures, and that carbohydrate moieties may play a role in P-ODN binding. Uptake studies with 35S-labeled P-ODN revealed that endocytosis, mediated by a receptor-like mechanism, predominated at P-ODN concentrations < 1 microM, whereas fluid-phase endocytosis prevailed at higher concentrations. Cell fractionation and ultrastructural analysis demonstrated the presence of ODN in clathrin coated pits, and in vesicular structures consistent with endosomes and lysosomes. Labeled ODN were also found in significant amounts in the nucleus, while none was associated with ribosomes, or ribosomes associated with rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Since nuclear uptake was not blocked by wheat germ agglutinin or concanavalin A, a nucleoporin independent, perhaps diffusion driven, import process is suggested. These data imply that antisense DNA may exert their effect in the nucleus. They also suggest rational ways to design ODN which might increase their efficiency.","['Beltinger, C', 'Saragovi, H U', 'Smith, R M', 'LeSauteur, L', 'Shah, N', 'DeDionisio, L', 'Christensen, L', 'Raible, A', 'Jarett, L', 'Gewirtz, A M']","['Beltinger C', 'Saragovi HU', 'Smith RM', 'LeSauteur L', 'Shah N', 'DeDionisio L', 'Christensen L', 'Raible A', 'Jarett L', 'Gewirtz AM']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Thionucleotides)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Melanoma/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Thionucleotides/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC295714,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI117860 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1995 Apr;95(4):1814-23. doi: 10.1172/JCI117860.,,,,"['CA-51083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-54384/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They therefore represent attractive targets for leukemia immunotherapy mediated by adoptive transfer of T cells. The main objective of this work was to determine whether MiHAs expressed by normal hematopoietic cells were present on leukemic cells and whether they could trigger lysis by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). CTL assays showed that mouse leukemic cells of both lymphoid and myeloid lineages were sensitive to CTLs targeted toward some but not all MiHAs. In four out of four strain combinations in which we primed CTLs against immunodominant MiHAs, effectors killed leukemic blasts, whereas no cytotoxicity was observed when CTLs were targeted toward four immunorecessive MiHAs. Testing of HPLC fractions obtained from normal and leukemic cells provided molecular evidence that leukemic blasts expressed only some of the MiHAs found on normal mouse hematopoietic cells. Decreased density of H-2 class I molecules at the surface of leukemic cells suggests that down-regulation of genes encoding either class I molecules or proteins involved in antigen processing played a role in the aberrant expression of MiHAs. In vivo resistance to the leukemic cells by various strains of mice correlated with in vitro CTL activity. These results show that leukemic cells express only some (immunodominant) MiHAs and suggest that this subset of MiHAs represent prime targets for adoptive immunotherapy.","['Pion, S', 'Fontaine, P', 'Baron, C', 'Gyger, M', 'Perreault, C']","['Pion S', 'Fontaine P', 'Baron C', 'Gyger M', 'Perreault C']","['Research Center, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/immunology', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Down-Regulation', 'H-2 Antigens/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/*immunology', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC295646,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI117829 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1995 Apr;95(4):1561-8. doi: 10.1172/JCI117829.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Calyculin A at higher concentrations (> 50 nM) induced a non-apoptotic death type with high ATP and pronounced micromitochondriosis. This suggests that protein phosphorylation pathways are involved in the triggering of several death pathways. Activation of the cAMP kinase induced yet another apoptotic death type, preferentially affecting cells in S-phase. In fact, cAMP acted in two ways to stop IPC promyelocyte proliferation: (1) block in late G1 (preventing new cells from entering DNA replication); and (2) induction of apoptosis in S-phase. cAMP and phosphatase inhibitors acted via distinct pathways. The inhibitors suppressed cAMP-induced death, but only at concentrations high enough to commit the cells to alternative, less conspicuous death types. The tumor-promoting activity of okadaic acid and calyculin A may therefore not be by protection against apoptosis.

To elucidate the mechanisms by which the gamma chain is expressed, we have analyzed the promoter region of the gamma chain gene. The 633-base pair fragment upstream of the initiation codon showed the promoter activity in human hematopoietic cell lines, Jurkat and THP-1, when linked to the luciferase gene. With a series of 5'-deletion mutants, the basal promoter activity was found in a fragment from nucleotide 80 to 58 upstream from the RNA start site, including an Ets binding sequence. Treatment of cells with either 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or phytohemagglutinin but not forskolin induced transcription from the gamma chain gene promoter. A viral trans-acting transcriptional activator, Tax, of human T-cell leukemia virus type I elevated expression of the gamma chain gene. In contrast, IL-2 decreased transcription from the IL-2 receptor gamma chain promoter. These results suggest that expression of the gamma chain is regulated at the transcription level by extracellular stimuli and may be implicated in immune response.","['Ohbo, K', 'Takasawa, N', 'Ishii, N', 'Tanaka, N', 'Nakamura, M', 'Sugamura, K']","['Ohbo K', 'Takasawa N', 'Ishii N', 'Tanaka N', 'Nakamura M', 'Sugamura K']","['Department of Microbiology, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasmids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase/biosynthesis']",,1995/03/31 00:00,1995/03/31 00:01,['1995/03/31 00:00'],"['1995/03/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/31 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/31 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.13.7479 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)71788-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Mar 31;270(13):7479-86. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.13.7479.,,,,,['GENBANK/D16358'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a potential target for immunosuppressive therapy. Recently, the human enzyme was purified to homogeneity (Hirst, M., Haliday, E., Nakamura, J., and Lou, L. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 23830-23837). We now report the characterization of this enzyme in terms of its biochemical and kinetic properties. We found that there are distinct features of the human enzyme that has not been reported for GMP synthetase from other sources. There are two variant forms of human GMP synthetase. Their catalytic properties are very similar, although their isoelectric points are different. They most likely represent post-translational modification variants. Magnesium ion is required for enzyme activity, and the requirement is beyond levels needed for ATP chelation. Magnesium appears to be an essential activator and there may be more than one binding site. Interaction of GMP synthetase with xanthosine 5'-monophosphate (XMP), a substrate, exhibits sigmoidal kinetics with a Hill coefficient of 1.48 +/- 0.07. This positive cooperativity is not due to ligand-induced oligomerization, since GMP synthetase remains a monomer in the presence of XMP and other substrates. Decoyinine, a selective inhibitor of GMP synthetase, inhibits the human enzyme reversibly with uncompetitive inhibition kinetics toward glutamine and XMP and non-competitive kinetics toward ATP.","['Nakamura, J', 'Lou, L']","['Nakamura J', 'Lou L']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Syntex Discovery Research, Palo Alto, California 94304, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '1AVZ07U9S7 (Xanthine)', '523-98-8 (xanthosine monophosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 6.- (Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.- (Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.5.2 (GMP synthase (glutamine-hydrolyzing))', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', '*Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Ligases/*metabolism', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Mathematics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Protein Binding', 'Ribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xanthine']",,1995/03/31 00:00,1995/03/31 00:01,['1995/03/31 00:00'],"['1995/03/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/31 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/31 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.13.7347 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)71769-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Mar 31;270(13):7347-53. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.13.7347.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined mRNA levels of various V-ATPase subunits during differentiation of both native monocytes and the cell line THP-1, and found that transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms could account for increases in cell V-ATPase content. From nuclear runoff experiments, we found that one subunit in particular, the B2 isoform (Mr = 56,000), was amplified primarily by transcriptional means. We have begun to examine the structure of the B2 subunit promoter region. Isolation and sequencing of the first exon and 5'-flanking region of this gene reveal a TATA-less promoter with a high G + C content. Primer extension and ribonuclease protection analyses indicate a single major transcriptional start site. We transfected promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids into THP-1 cells to define sequences that mediate transcriptional control during monocyte differentiation. We found that sequences downstream from the transcriptional start site were sufficient to confer increased expression during THP-1 differentiation.

Here we have examined whether similar regulation of the single low molecular weight hsp (hsp 28) of humans exhibits differences in either its expression and/or phosphorylation during the course of in vitro differentiation of hematopoietic cells. In the promyelocytic leukemic cell line, HL-60, we show that early after commitment of the cells to a macrophage-like phenotype (via exposure to phorbol ester myristate, PMA) there occurs an accompanying increased phosphorylation of hsp 28. Over time and as the cells become terminally differentiated the levels of hsp 28 increase significantly. In contrast, cells stimulated to adopt a granulocyte-like phenotype (e.g. exposed to either dimethyl sulfoxide or retinoic acid) show no changes in either the phosphorylation or expression of hsp 28. Moreover, once differentiated the granulocyte-like cells no longer appear capable of phosphorylating hsp 28. Human K562 cells, in response to hemin, rapidly increase their expression and phosphorylation of hsp 28 during the course of their differentiation into erythroid-like cells. Addition of PMA to the K562 cells induces differentiation into a megakaryocyte-like phenotype but is not accompanied by changes in hsp 28 phosphorylation/expression. In the case of the HL-60 cells, differentiation toward the macrophage like lineage is accompanied by an increased adherence of the cells to their substratum and an apparent association of hsp 28 with the actin cytoskeleton.","['Minowada, G', 'Welch, W']","['Minowada G', 'Welch W']","['Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco 94143, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Arsenites)', '0 (HSP30 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Sodium Compounds)', '48OVY2OC72 (sodium arsenite)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Arsenites/pharmacology', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Drosophila', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', '*Gene Expression', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'HSP30 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphates/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Sodium Compounds/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/03/31 00:00,1995/03/31 00:01,['1995/03/31 00:00'],"['1995/03/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/31 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/31 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.13.7047 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)71729-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Mar 31;270(13):7047-54. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.13.7047.,,,,"['F32 GM 15526/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM33551/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Very recently we found that the pineal gland hormone melatonin is a natural ligand of RZR alpha and RZR beta. Ligand-induced transcriptional control is therefore proposed to mediate physiological functions of melatonin in the brain where RZR beta is expressed, but also in peripheral tissues, where RZR alpha was found. However, no natural RZR responding genes have been identified yet. Here, we report that a response element in the promoter of 5-lipoxygenase binds specifically RZR alpha and ROR alpha 1, but not ROR alpha 2 and alpha 3. 5-Lipoxygenase is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes, which are known to be allergic and inflammatory mediators. We could show that the activity of the whole 5-lipoxygenase promoter as well as of the RZR response element fused to the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter could be repressed by melatonin. The hormone down-regulated the expression of 5-lipoxygenase about 5-fold in B lymphocytes, which express RZR alpha. In contrast, 5-lipoxygenase mRNA levels were not affected in differentiated monocytic and granulocytic cell lines, which do not express RZR alpha. This indicates that 5-lipoxygenase is the first natural RZR alpha responding gene. Furthermore, our results open up a new perspective in understanding the involvement of melatonin in inflammatory and immunological reactions.","['Steinhilber, D', 'Brungs, M', 'Werz, O', 'Wiesenberg, I', 'Danielsson, C', 'Kahlen, J P', 'Nayeri, S', 'Schrader, M', 'Carlberg, C']","['Steinhilber D', 'Brungs M', 'Werz O', 'Wiesenberg I', 'Danielsson C', 'Kahlen JP', 'Nayeri S', 'Schrader M', 'Carlberg C']","['Pharmazeutisches Institut, Universitat Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 1)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 2)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Melatonin)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)']",IM,"['Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/*biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Enzyme Repression/drug effects', '*Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Melatonin/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 1', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 2', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects/*physiology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear', 'Receptors, Melatonin', '*Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Trans-Activators', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/03/31 00:00,1995/03/31 00:01,['1995/03/31 00:00'],"['1995/03/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/31 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/31 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.13.7037 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)71726-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Mar 31;270(13):7037-40. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.13.7037.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oligonucleotides corresponding to ELP and/or retinoic acid receptor binding elements were placed upstream of the SV40 promoter and their effect on gene expression was analyzed by CAT assay. Elements which have affinity to both ELP and retinoic acid receptor were activated by retinoic acid receptor and these activations were repressed by ELP. An ELP binding element without affinity to retinoic acid receptor was insensitive to both activation by retinoic acid receptor and repression by ELP.

The results were compared with data of healthy controls (n = 11) and cord blood samples (n = 6). Common variable immunodeficiency patients demonstrated a mean LAK-cell activity of about 65% of normal controls and cord blood samples. The moderately reduced LAK-cell activity was not affected by T alpha 1. In the immunodeficient other patients, low levels of LAK-cell activity with a mean value of 10% of normal controls were seen. The mean LAK-cell activity could be improved by T alpha 1: three patients showed an improvement of their LAK-cell activity up to 25-30% after T alpha 1 administration in vitro, but in one case T alpha 1 was without any effect. Analysis of the expression of the surface markers CD8, CD16, CD57 and CD8/CD57 revealed that only CD16 positive lymphocytes were significantly less in immunodeficient patients. We found a linear correlation between LAK-cell activity and CD8/CD57 double positive lymphocytes in all patients.

The 2 lines were maintained and serially transplanted i.p. in SCID mice. AML-PS and AML-CL produced ascitogenous gross tumors after approximately 4 and 6 weeks, respectively, and all mice died within 6-8 weeks. Microscopic evaluation of different organs at autopsy showed massive involvement of bone marrow, liver and spleen, though with differences in the tumor burdens for the 2 lines (AML-CL > AML-PS). Flow cytometric analysis documented the spread of leukemic cells to bone marrow, peripheral blood and spleen. AML-PS and AML-CL cells show an immunophenotypic profile (CD13+, CD33+) and cytogenetic findings similar to freshly isolated blasts. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) gene expression was observed by Northern blot analysis in leukemic cells from AML-CL and AML-PS SCID mice. After 24 hr of culture both lines released IL-1 beta in culture supernatants. High levels of circulating IL-1 beta were secreted in plasma of tumor-bearing mice.

Three of the tumours were classed as B-cell lymphomas on the basis of morphology, immunocytochemistry, rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes and lack of rearrangement of T-cell receptor (TCR) beta-chain genes. Two of these B-cell tumours arose in specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats experimentally infected with FIV. One case of multi-centric lymphosarcoma came from a cat naturally infected with both FIV and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV). This tumour contained integrated FeLV proviral sequences and was judged to be of T-cell origin on the basis of TCR gene rearrangement. The fifth case was a mast cell tumour. Rearrangement of the c-myc locus was not found in any of the FIV-associated tumours but was shown to be present in a rare immunoblastic B-cell lymphoma which arose in an uninfected SPF cat. None of the FIV-associated tumours showed evidence of integrated FIV sequences by Southern blot hybridisation, despite isolation of infectious virus from in vitro cultures of tumour cells in I case. These results confirm that FIV-associated tumours can occur in the absence of FeLV and suggest that the role of FIV in lymphomagenesis is generally indirect.","['Terry, A', 'Callanan, J J', 'Fulton, R', 'Jarrett, O', 'Neil, J C']","['Terry A', 'Callanan JJ', 'Fulton R', 'Jarrett O', 'Neil JC']","['Department of Veterinary Pathology, University of Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genes, myc', 'Genome, Viral', 'Genotype', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'Lentivirus Infections/*genetics/*virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/physiology', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/*virology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/virology', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/genetics/*virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics/virology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/virology', 'Virus Integration']",,1995/04/10 00:00,1995/04/10 00:01,['1995/04/10 00:00'],"['1995/04/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/10 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910610215 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1995 Apr 10;61(2):227-32. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910610215.,,['c-myc'],,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['GENBANK/X03690', 'GENBANK/X57331']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To define the molecular defect in two EPP-affected siblings and their parents in a Swiss family, ferrochelatase cDNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subjected to sequence analysis. A 5-bp deletion (T580-G584) was identified on one allele of the ferrochelatase gene in both patients and their mother. Screening of the mutation among family members of RsaI digestion of PCR-amplified genomic DNA revealed autosomal dominant inheritance associated with abnormal protoporphyrin concentration and enzyme activity. We also isolated ferrochelatase cDNAs containing a 18-bp insertion (part of the intron 2 sequence) between exons 2 and 3; this corresponded to six extra amino acids (YESNIR) inserted between Arg-65 and Lys-66 of the known ferrochelatase. This isoform was identified initially in mRNAs derived from both alleles of the ferrochelatase gene in one patient. Its existence was confirmed in six additional EPP patients, in five out of seven controls, and in four different cell lines (fibroblast, muscle, hepatoma and myelogenous leukaemia). This isoform, roughly 20% of the total ferrochelatase mRNA, was generated through splicing at a second donor site in intron 2 and its presence was not linked to EPP.","['Schneider-Yin, X', 'Schafer, B W', 'Tonz, O', 'Minder, E I']","['Schneider-Yin X', 'Schafer BW', 'Tonz O', 'Minder EI']","['Zentrallabor, Stadtspital Triemli, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Hum Genet,Human genetics,7613873,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 4.99.1.1 (Ferrochelatase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alternative Splicing/*genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Ferrochelatase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Pedigree', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Porphyria, Hepatoerythropoietic/*enzymology/genetics']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00208962 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Genet. 1995 Apr;95(4):391-6. doi: 10.1007/BF00208962.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here ultrastructural findings of the affected spinal cords and the peripheral nerves of perfusion-fixed HAM rats. They were infected at the age of 4 to 6 months old and showed gait disturbance and hind leg paraparesis 15 months after infection. Pathological alterations of HAM rat disease were mainly confined to marginal areas of white matter of the spinal cord. The affected lesion was rather symmetrical and distributed in the anterior and the lateral columns. A prominent ultrastructural change in the spinal cord was separation of myelin lamellae at the intraperiod line and vacuolation of myelin sheath. Many myelin-debris-filled macrophages and a marked astrogliosis were also observed. In the gliotic areas, lots of demyelinated and remyelinated axons were intermingled. Axons were relatively preserved, however, some of them had tubulo-reticular inclusions. Astrocytes appeared ultrastructurally normal. Lymphocytic infiltration was virtually absent. Ultrastructural alterations of the peripheral nerve were basically similar to those of the spinal cord. Separation of myelin lamellae, macrophages infiltration, demyelination, and remyelination were observed. Schwann cells had also alterations. We observed some apoptotic cell death of the oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells with condensed nucleus and phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies by macrophages. Collective evidence suggests that a series of demyelinating process described above may be caused by apoptosis. No virus particles were seen in the spinal cord and peripheral nerve. Although the precise mechanism of apoptosis is not known at present, possible pathogenetic pathway involving apoptosis in HAM rat disease may contribute greatly to a better understanding of mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP in humans.","['Abe, M']",['Abe M'],"['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi,[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science,17410290R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*pathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Sciatic Nerve/*ultrastructure', 'Spinal Cord/*ultrastructure']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi. 1994 Nov;69(6):1399-408.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent reports have demonstrated the existence of a histamine H2 receptor on HL-60 and HGT-1 cells with a pharmacological profile distinct from the commonly described histamine H2 receptor. U937 cells, however, seem to express classical histamine H2 receptors. Histamine and dimaprit dose dependently induce the formation of cAMP, whereas dimaprit's inactive analogues, nordimaprit and homodimaprit, show reduced potencies. Histamine H1 and H3 receptor agonists do not show histamine H2 receptor activity. Various histamine H2 receptor antagonists are able to block the histamine induced production of cAMP with an antagonistic profile comparable to that observed in the guinea-pig right atrium. Furthermore, endogenous histamine H2 receptors in U937 cells are found to be susceptible to receptor desensitization, a mechanism which may become apparent under pathophysiological conditions or during drug therapy. A 30-min pre-exposure of U937 cells to histamine (100 microM) results in a 50% attenuation of the production of cAMP to a subsequent application of an agonist. Desensitization of the histamine H2 receptor in U937 cells is found to be homologous as the beta-adrenoceptor mediated response remained unaffected.","['Smit, M J', 'Leurs, R', 'Shukrula, S R', 'Bast, A', 'Timmerman, H']","['Smit MJ', 'Leurs R', 'Shukrula SR', 'Bast A', 'Timmerman H']","['Leiden/Amsterdam Center for Drug Research, Department of Pharmacochemistry, Vrije Universiteit, Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Histamine Agonists)', '0 (Histamine Antagonists)', '0 (Receptors, Histamine H2)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'ZZQ699148P (Dimaprit)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Dimaprit/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Histamine/pharmacology', 'Histamine Agonists/*pharmacology', 'Histamine Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Receptors, Histamine H2/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/12/15 00:00,1994/12/15 00:01,['1994/12/15 00:00'],"['1994/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0922-4106(94)90005-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 1994 Dec 15;288(1):17-25. doi: 10.1016/0922-4106(94)90005-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serum samples obtained from 24 HCMV-seropositive healthy volunteers were used as controls. The HCMV DNA was detected in serum a mean of 14 days before the onset of HCMV pneumonia, which suggests that DNAemia exists prior to the development of HCMV pneumonia. The amount of viral DNA in serum increased with disease progression and decreased with disease improvement. Thus, the detection of HCMV DNA in serum by nested PCR is useful for monitoring and the early diagnosis of HCMV pneumonia in patients with ATL.

A recent study also reported a disturbed periodicity of GH secretion during puberty. We have focused on the different stages of puberty in studying these two parameters of GH secretion and have also compared the effects of 18 vs 24 Gy radiation dose. PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Thirty-four children previously treated for ALL were compared with a control group of 208 healthy normally growing children. GH secretion was measured as 24-hour profiles. RESULTS: In children treated for ALL, GH secretion rate and GH peak amplitude were below the median values for controls, both before puberty and during all stages of puberty. The difference between patients and controls was most pronounced in late puberty. Radiation with 18 or 24 Gy gave similar results. However, time sequence analysis showed a similar periodicity of GH secretion in both patient and control groups before, as well as during, puberty. Thus, before puberty a broad range of cycles per 24 hours was seen. These synchronized during puberty to a predominant GH peak frequency of one every 3-4 hours. CONCLUSIONS: After low dose cranial irradiation with 18 or 24 Gy, the total amount of GH secreted is reduced both before and during puberty. We could not confirm previous findings of impaired periodicity of GH secretion in these children.","['Lannering, B', 'Rosberg, S', 'Marky, I', 'Moell, C', 'Albertsson-Wikland, K']","['Lannering B', 'Rosberg S', 'Marky I', 'Moell C', 'Albertsson-Wikland K']","['Department of Paediatrics, University of Goteborg, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,['9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Height', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Growth Hormone/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Periodicity', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/radiotherapy', 'Puberty/physiology', 'Secretory Rate']",,1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2265.1995.tb01856.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 1995 Feb;42(2):153-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2265.1995.tb01856.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these pro-inflammatory mediators also have significant overlap and redundancy in their biological effects. This suggests that there is significant diversity in second messenger signal transduction systems induced by these stimuli to explain the diversity in biological responses, as well as significant redundancy. Here we show that one such second messenger common to several proinflammatory stimuli may be phosphatidic acid (PA). Intracellular PA species, which may have intracellular signaling functions, are rapidly induced in P388 monocytic leukemia cells by TNF alpha, IL-1 beta, or LPS. These PA species vary according to the bond type (i.e., sn-1 ester vs. ether vs. vinyl ether), acyl chain length, and the degree of saturation in the sn-1 and sn-2 positions. Although PA itself may have direct second messenger activities, many of the PA species induced are converted to diacylglycerol species (DG), which are structurally distinct from the DGs generated by phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC). Lisofylline [(R)-1-(5-hydroxyhexyl)-3,7-dimethylxanthine; LSF] selectively inhibits generation of selected species of PA in P388 cells induced by TNF alpha, IL-1 beta or LPS. TNF alpha-induced sphingomyelin hydrolysis, PLC-mediated PC hydrolysis, and DG kinase-mediated PA formation or TNF alpha-induced NF-kappa B activation and apoptosis are not inhibited by LSF. LSF has a marked protective effect in a variety of acute inflammatory animal models that may be due to inhibition of this shared second messenger pathway involving PA.","['Bursten, S', 'Weeks, R', 'West, J', 'Le, T', 'Wilson, T', 'Porubek, D', 'Bianco, J A', 'Singer, J W', 'Rice, G C']","['Bursten S', 'Weeks R', 'West J', 'Le T', 'Wilson T', 'Porubek D', 'Bianco JA', 'Singer JW', 'Rice GC']","['Cell Therapeutics Inc., Division of Lipid Biochemistry/Second Messenger Chemistry, Seattle, Washington 98119, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Circ Shock,Circulatory shock,0414112,"['0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Phosphatidic Acids)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'L1F2Q2X956 (lisofylline)', 'SD6QCT3TSU (Pentoxifylline)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Diglycerides/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Inflammation/*etiology', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Pentoxifylline/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidic Acids/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Shock, Septic/chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Sphingomyelins/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",,1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Circ Shock. 1994 Sep;44(1):14-29.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hospitalization was also shorter for the GM-CSF group (22.5 vs. 26.5 days) and no patient in the GM-CSF group had to be readmitted after initial discharge. The incidence of documented infections was similar among both patient groups and no difference was noted in terms of antimicrobial usage. Some side effects occurred with the continuous infusion of GM-CSF, particularly fluid retention, dyspnea, fever, diarrhea, and bone pain leading to early discontinuation of GM-CSF in 2 patients.

Aclarubicine and doxorubicin have dose-dependent effects, except for the differentiation induction by aclarubicine, which had a maximum effect and then decreased; this probably means that the inductions of differentiation and apoptosis could be independent. Different kinetic studies indicated that differentiation increased quickly after 24 to 48 hours and reached a plateau toward 72 hours, where approximately 80% of the cells were differentiated.

Posttransplant DNA from the recipient is amplified with fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers for polymorphic markers that distinguish donor alleles from recipient alleles. The fluorescent PCR products are then separated on agarose or acrylamide gels on the Applied Biosystems 373A Sequencer (Foster City, CA). Using GeneScan 672 software (Applied Biosystems) to analyze the separated alleles, we can correlate allele peak areas to the percentage of donor or recipient DNA. We quantitate engraftment in a mixed chimeric sample by mixing pretransplant recipient and donor DNAs in a range of percentages and amplifying the mixtures to produce a standard curve. By amplifying and analyzing the posttransplant sample DNA(s), we can determine the extent of engraftment by interpolating the percent peak area of the informative allele(s) from this standard curve. This approach provides a precision of measurement ranging, depending on the marker, from 3.5% to 8.0% (percent coefficient of variation) and an accuracy of engraftment determination ranging from 97% to 99%, with a sensitivity of detection of 1% donor or recipient DNA. We retrospectively analyzed a panel of 32 patients and found seven to be informative for some degree of mixed chimerism, indicative of either residual normal host cells or leukemic relapse. An analysis of different cell lineages obtained posttransplant showed different degrees of engraftment in myeloid and T-cell populations. In summary, this method can provide an accurate, quantitative assessment of mixed chimerism in patients posttransplant. Such information may be useful in the future in guiding early implementation of additional treatment designed to circumvent graft failure or suppress relapse.","['Scharf, S J', 'Smith, A G', 'Hansen, J A', 'McFarland, C', 'Erlich, H A']","['Scharf SJ', 'Smith AG', 'Hansen JA', 'McFarland C', 'Erlich HA']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Roche Molecular Systems, Inc, Alameda, CA 94501, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers/*analysis', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chimera', 'Color', 'DNA/*genetics', 'Female', '*Fluorescent Dyes', '*Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/therapy', 'Male', '*Minisatellite Repeats', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79774-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Apr 1;85(7):1954-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with TPMT deficiency accumulate excessive concentrations of 6-thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs) and develop severe toxicity when treated with standard dosages of mercaptopurine. High TPMT activity has been associated with lower concentrations of TGNs, yielding a higher risk of treatment failure in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). As the biochemical basis of these pharmacodynamic relationships has not been fully elucidated, we investigated the variability and relationship of TPMT activity in erythrocytes and lymphoblasts from children with ALL. A 58-fold range of erythrocyte TPMT activity was found among 119 patients receiving ALL chemotherapy (0.6 to 34.9 U/mL packed erythrocytes), but relatively low intrapatient variability (coefficient of variation, 13.5%) was observed over 1 year.

To investigate the possibility that higher expression of the viral activator Tax induces preferential proliferation of infected nonmalignant T cells in HAM/TSP patients, the expression of Tax mRNA in fresh PBMCs was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction. Total amount of Tax mRNA was higher in HAM/TSP patients than in carriers, but the expression level was almost the same as that in asymptomatic carriers when compared per infected cell. The expression levels in adult T-cell leukemia patients were significantly lower than those in HAM/TSP patients and asymptomatic carriers.

Expression of G alpha 16 was observed in human cell lines of myelomonocytic and T-lymphocytic origin, but not in human B-cell lines Raji and IM9. We studied the expression of G alpha 16 in human B cells corresponding to different stages of B-cell differentiation by means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting. The human Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines Raji, Ramos, BJAB, the lymphoblastoid cell line SKW6.4, and the plasmocytoma cell line U266 were devoid of G alpha 16. In contrast, G alpha 16 was detected in the human progenitor B cell lines Reh and Nalm-6. Using the mu+, k- cell line BLIN-1 (pre-B cell phenotype) and its derived subclone 1E8 (surface mu+, k+; B-cell phenotype) G alpha 16 expression was found to disappear on transition from pre-B to B-cell differentiation stage. The analysis of a broad panel of human neoplastic B lymphocytes ranging from progenitor B-acute lymphatic leukemia (pre-pre-B-ALL), common acute leukemias (cALL), pre-B-ALL, mature B-ALL to low grade B-cell lymphoma (chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B-cell type, leukemic centrocytic non-Hodgkins lymphoma [NHL], hairy cell leukemia) showed that G alpha 16 expression is limited to progenitor and pre-B-ALL cells. Therefore, we conclude that within B-cell differentiation, G alpha 16 is expressed solely during early B cell ontogeny and downregulated during differentiation. Thus, G alpha 16 might be an important regulator involved in signaling processes in progenitor B cells.","['Mapara, M Y', 'Bommert, K', 'Bargou, R C', 'Leng, C', 'Beck, C', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Gierschik, P', 'Dorken, B']","['Mapara MY', 'Bommert K', 'Bargou RC', 'Leng C', 'Beck C', 'Ludwig WD', 'Gierschik P', 'Dorken B']","['Free University of Berlin, University Medical Center Rudolf Virchow, Robert Rossle Klinik, Department of Internal Medicine, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Plasmacytoma/genetics/pathology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79759-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Apr 1;85(7):1836-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic analysis was performed in 63 cases and clonal abnormalities were detected in 55%; the most common chromosome involved was number 7. Modification of the FAB system to incorporate additional diagnostic features such as pretreatment fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) and cytogenetics allowed incorporation of the categories of juvenile chronic myeloid leukemia (JCML) and infantile monosomy 7 syndrome (IMo7).

The overall 5-year survival for the patients was 31.9% (95% CI 21.7 to 44.1) and factors influencing prognosis included: modified FAB type, platelet count, Hb F level, and cytogenetic complexity. We developed a scoring system (""FPC"") where each of the following findings at diagnosis scored one point: HbF greater than 10%, platelets < or = 40 x 10(9)/L, and complex karyotypic changes (two or more clonal structural/numerical abnormalities), which produced groups with highly significant differences, patients with a score of 0 having a 5-year survival of 61.6% (CI 33% to 84%), whereas those with a score of two or three all died within 4 years of diagnosis.

The possibility that DDATHF protection might be due to competition for cell entry is not likely since CB3717 and FdURD but not ICI D1694 enter the cell by independent transport processes. Exogenous hypoxanthine (HX) had no effect on the toxicity of TS inhibitors. However, HX increased the protective effect of DDATHF from ICI D1694 toxicity, had no effect on the CB3717-DDATHF interaction, and reduced the protective effect of DDATHF on FdUrd toxicity. HX prevented the fall in dATP levels caused by DDATHF addition to cells treated with TS inhibitors. HX had different effects on dTTP levels in cells treated with DDATHF and quinazoline TS inhibitors compared to FdUrd. Together these results support the hypothesis that imbalance in dTTP and dATP pools is an important determinant of cytotoxicity in antifolate-treated cells. In addition, these findings suggests that intracellular reduced folates interconvert to catalyse reactions in metabolically perturbed cells.","['Chong, L K', 'Tattersall, M H']","['Chong LK', 'Tattersall MH']","['Department of Cancer Medicine, University of Sydney, NSW Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Deoxyadenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Hypoxanthines)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', '6P3AVY8A7Q (lometrexol)', '76849-19-9 (CB 3717)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'FCB9EGG971 (raltitrexed)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Deoxyadenine Nucleotides/*metabolism', 'Drug Interactions', 'Floxuridine/pharmacology', 'Folic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Hypoxanthine', 'Hypoxanthines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/pathology', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*pharmacology', 'Thiophenes/pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/03/15 00:00,1995/03/15 00:01,['1995/03/15 00:00'],"['1995/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['000629529400458X [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(94)00458-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1995 Mar 15;49(6):819-27. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(94)00458-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When due to increased energy-dependent drug efflux, this transport change is often associated with increased expression of an efflux pump for various lipophilic compounds, for example the P-glycoprotein which is the product of the MDR-1 gene. However, previously described HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cell lines resistant to the cytotoxic effect of anthracyclines have been reported not to express P-glycoprotein. We have isolated, by drug selection, an anthracycline-resistant HL-60 cell line that, in comparison to parental drug sensitive cells, exhibits a multidrug resistant phenotype including diminished intracellular drug retention, cross-resistance to multiple cytotoxic drugs, increased expression of a monoclonal antibody C219-reactive 180 kDa P-glycoprotein detected by Western blot analysis as well as increased expression of MDR-1 mRNA as determined by Northern blot and solution hybridization/RNAse protection analyses.

The 42 and 44 kDa proteins were identified as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases with immunoblotting of anti-MAP kinase antibody. The effects of an antiallergic drug, pemirolast potassium (TBX) on Ag-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation and MAP kinase activation were investigated. When RBL-2H3 cells were stimulated with Ag in the presence of TBX, tyrosine phosphorylation of three proteins (33, 42 and 44 kDa) was inhibited concentration-dependently (0.1-10 micrograms/ml). Inhibition of Ag-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of 33 kDa protein, which could be a beta subunit of Fc epsilon RI, suggests that TBX may prevent the activation of Fc epsilon RI. TBX suppressed activation of MAP kinases (42 and 44 kDa) in response to Ag as well as phorbol myristate acetate (100 nM) or calcium ionophore A23187 (500 nM), implying that the drug acts on signal transduction component(s) between the second messengers and MAP kinases. However, TBX had no effects on protein tyrosine phosphorylation and MAP kinase activation in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. These results indicate that TBX may affect Fc epsilon RI and also may act as a step distal of Ca2+ mobilization and protein kinase C activation leading to MAP kinase activation in RBL-2H3 cells.","['Nakamura, Y', 'Nakashima, S', 'Fujimiya, H', 'Kumada, T', 'Kato, Y', 'Miyata, H', 'Nozawa, Y']","['Nakamura Y', 'Nakashima S', 'Fujimiya H', 'Kumada T', 'Kato Y', 'Miyata H', 'Nozawa Y']","['Department of Otolaryngology, Gifu University School of Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Arerugi,Arerugi = [Allergy],0241212,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Histamine Antagonists)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '2C09NV773M (pemirolast)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/immunology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Histamine Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidinones/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arerugi. 1995 Jan;44(1):34-44.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Passive smokers are confronted with a higher risk of lung cancer, and the risk of developing childhood cancer (e.g. Wilms tumor, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) has been widely considered to be correlated with smoking by the mother during pregnancy. Many investigators are now trying to identify risk groups of smokers to decrease the rate of cancer cases and deaths. Although this research is of great interest, it would be of course much more effective to prevent the risks by not smoking.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Clinical and blood bank charts were reviewed for 65 consecutive ANLL patients between 1985 and 1993 who achieved complete remission after a course of daunomycin and cytarabine (cytarabine: 200 mg/m2/day x 7 days in continuous infusion; daunomycin: 60 mg/m2/day for the first 3 days of the 7, as a bolus). RESULTS: Only 43 percent of patients who developed hepatitis completed the scheduled therapy. Hepatitis did not decrease the probability of relapse (66 +/- 9% vs. 66 +/- 11%), but patients with changes in planned treatment, due to hepatitis or other causes, tended to have a higher relapse rate than patients without changes in consolidation therapy (56.5% vs. 40.4%; p = 0.10). This did not result in a decrease in disease-free survival, however, because of the higher number of treatment-related deaths in the patients without hepatitis (who completed the therapy). Over the period from 1985 through 1989, the 6-month actuarial probability of developing hepatitis was 42 percent. However, since 1989, when hepatitis C screening of blood donors was implemented, the incidence was reduced to 12.5 percent (p < 0.05), in spite of greater transfusion support (172 +/- 46 vs. 89 +/- 53, p < 0.01). No new cases of hepatitis were observed after the introduction of second-generation hepatitis C virus assays. CONCLUSION: Hepatitis precludes the use of consolidation therapy in about half of ANLL patients, resulting, in the experience described here, in a trend toward a higher rate of relapse. Hepatitis C virus screening of blood components reduces the incidence of hepatitis in ANLL patients.","['Lopez-Jimenez, J', 'Cancelas, J A', 'Garcia-Larana, J', 'Sastre, J L', 'Cervero, C', 'Zamora, C', 'Megido, M', 'Hernandez-Jodra, M', 'Lasa, E', 'Perez-Oteyza, J']","['Lopez-Jimenez J', 'Cancelas JA', 'Garcia-Larana J', 'Sastre JL', 'Cervero C', 'Zamora C', 'Megido M', 'Hernandez-Jodra M', 'Lasa E', 'Perez-Oteyza J', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Ramon y Cajal, Universidad de Alcala de Henares, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hepatitis/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', '*Transfusion Reaction', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1995.35495216080.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 1995 Apr;35(4):313-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1995.35495216080.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand whether the involved endocrine glands in this system were damaged by FeLV, the hypothalamus, pituitary, and testes were tested for hormonal responsiveness in vivo and in vitro. The infected cats were administered with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Their response to the treatment was studied, and they were then compared with untreated control cats. Normal response to LHRH for the synthesis of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and testosterone were found in the infected cats prior to 10 weeks of infection. After 10 weeks, the response was reduced by 25%, 38%, and 42%, respectively. Twelve weeks after infection, the response to hCG for testosterone synthesis was drastically reduced. The control cats, however, demonstrated normal prolonged biphasic patterns of response to hCG. The in vivo administration of the tropic hormones had no effect on the titer of FeLV gs antigen in the blood of the infected cats. The medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) from the control cats and cats in their 13th week of infection were cultured in vitro, with the presence of high K+ ion (60 mM). The control MBH responded to K+ ion stimulation for LHRH release. The K(+)-stimulated release of LHRH in the control MBH was 99% higher than that of the infected MBH. In contrast, the amount of unreleased LHRH in the infected MBH was 74% higher than that of the control MBH. In in vitro culture, the control pituitary gland responded markedly higher to LHRH stimulation for the release of gonadotropins (FHS and LH) than that of the infected one (140% compared with 56% for FSH, and 70% compared with 28% for LH, respectively). Whereas, the amount of unreleased FSH and LH in the infected pituitary gland were 59% and 31%, higher than that of the control gland. These results suggest that (i) the progressive development of neuroendocrine glands' dysfunction is related to viral replication time; (ii) the in vivo and in vitro responses to tropic hormones in the infected endocrine glands are drastically reduced; and (iii) this reduction in hormonal response may be caused by defective regulation of peptide hormonal secretion.","['Wang, S W', 'Teng, C S']","['Wang SW', 'Teng CS']","['Department of Anatomy, Physiological Sciences, and Radiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, Raleigh 27606.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Soc Exp Biol Med,"Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

Previous studies with a temperature sensitive mutant in ets (ts1.1 E26) have suggested that the Ets part of the Myb-Ets fusion protein blocks multilineage differentiation of transformed MEPs, by regulating specific target genes. Using this system in a differential screening approach we have now identified a new gene, called rem-1, as a target for the E26 virus. Following shift of ts1.1 mutant transformed cells to the nonpermissive temperature a decreased expression of rem-1 was observed which increased upon downshift. The finding that this reexpression did not require new protein synthesis suggests that the Ets component of the fusion protein directly regulates rem-1 transcription. Rem-1 is related to a family of EF-hand-containing calcium-binding proteins that are predominantly expressed in the brain and in retinal cells.

The scattered irradiation of 0.72-1.44 Gy to the dental arches during central nervous system (CNS) irradiation caused an increased number of developmental defects both in enamel and root.

On bone marrow relapse in 1973, he was treated with cranial irradiation (20 Gy) in addition to chemotherapy. He continues in complete remission 19 years after his relapse. At age 25 years, he presented with headaches and left hemiparesis. Computerised tomograph demonstrated a large, enhancing right-sided intracranial tumour. Angiography was performed and showed the right internal carotid artery was occluded. Most of the right hemisphere was supplied from the external carotid via the middle meningeal artery. The left posterior cerebral artery and the left anterior cerebral artery were absent presumably as a result of radiation-induced arteritis. A resection of an anaplastic meningioma arising from the right sphenoidal ridge was achieved. There was a rapid improvement in function and he returned to work. Vasculopathy of the large intracranial arteries has been described after high dose radiation. It may occur as in this case after moderate dose radiation. There is a correlation with meningioma. There is a possibility that large artery vasculopathy will be present in a proportion of patients irradiated for ALL.

Therefore, we conducted a pharmacokinetic study of VCR in 17 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) receiving the first dose of VCR. A new high-performance liquid chromatographic assay was used for the measurement of VCR in plasma. A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model was fit to the data by nonlinear least-squares regression. Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters were highly variable; mean (S.D.) volume of distribution at steady-state was 360 (176) L.m-2; total body clearance was 431 (238) ml.min-1.m-2, and elimination half-life was 823 (390) min. These results were compared to data from eight adults with lung cancer. Mean volume of distribution in adults and children were similar, but VCR clearance was significantly larger in children (P = 0.01), resulting in a significantly longer elimination half-life in the adults (P < 0.01). We conclude that administration of a standard dosage of VCR to children with ALL results in a highly variable systemic drug exposure, which may have implications for the oncolytic effect and/or toxicity in individual patients. Comparison of data from children and adults suggests that VCR elimination rate is a function of age; this could account for more severe neurotoxicity in older patients. However, it cannot be excluded that differences between the children and adults may be due to other variables than age. Future studies should focus on the possible influence of multidrug resistance modulating agents on VCR pharmacokinetics and on pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships in individual patients.","['de Graaf, S S', 'Bloemhof, H', 'Vendrig, D E', 'Uges, D R']","['de Graaf SS', 'Bloemhof H', 'Vendrig DE', 'Uges DR']","[""Groningen Institute for Drug Studies (GIDS), Beatrix Children's Hospital, Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)'],IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Vincristine/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950240405 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1995 Apr;24(4):235-40. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950240405.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is little information on the effects of intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy used in the treatment of these conditions on lung function and exercise capacity in the long term. Severity survivors of acute leukaemia from one centre in the UK were studied. Measurements of lung volumes, spirometry and transfer factor were made. Each child also performed a standard, symptom-limited maximal exercise test on a cycle ergometer. Predictive equations for indices of lung function and exercise tolerance were calculated from 146 age- and sex-matched control subjects. The results of the survivors of leukaemia were compared to these. There was a significant reduction of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), total lung capacity (TLC), and transfer for carbon monoxide (DLCO; P < 0.05 for each measurement), in the survivors of leukemia when compared to the control subjects. In addition, there was a mild but significant reduction of both maximal and submaximal indices of exercise capacity in the leukaemic group. A multivariate analysis was carried out to identify those variables acting independently to reduce lung volumes. For FEV1, FVC and TLC, these were craniospinal irradiation, cyclophosphamide and chest complications during treatment. For a reduction in DLCO, the significant factors were administration of anthracyclines, craniospinal irradiation and bone marrow transplantation. Survivors of acute leukemia have impaired pulmonary function and exercise capacity. Long-term cardiopulmonary follow-up may be necessary and new regimens devised which reduce long-term toxicity without compromising survival rates.","['Jenney, M E', 'Faragher, E B', 'Jones, P H', 'Woodcock, A']","['Jenney ME', 'Faragher EB', 'Jones PH', 'Woodcock A']","[""Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Oncology Unit, Pendlebury, England.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Echocardiography', 'Exercise/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology', 'Lung/diagnostic imaging/*physiology', 'Lung Volume Measurements', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Survivors']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950240403 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1995 Apr;24(4):222-30. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950240403.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prognostic factors for survival were different from those in Western reports, i.e., variables representing quantitative abnormalities (hemoglobin levels, granulocyte, and platelet counts) were not major prognostic factors, while variables representing qualitative abnormalities (morphological abnormalities in granulocytic and megakaryocytic series cells) were highly significant. Two scoring systems for overall survival and for leukemic transformation were developed, based on multivariate prognostic factor analysis. Neither system included variables representing the degree of cytopenia. Whatever the reason for the different prognostic factors in JPN and Western MDS patients, the use of a scoring system based on Western patients for clinical decision-making in a JPN patient could be misleading, and vice versa.","['Oguma, S', 'Yoshida, Y', 'Uchino, H', 'Maekawa, T', 'Nomura, T', 'Mizoguchi, H']","['Oguma S', 'Yoshida Y', 'Uchino H', 'Maekawa T', 'Nomura T', 'Mizoguchi H']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",,1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['014521269400135W [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(94)00135-w [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1995 Mar;19(3):219-25. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)00135-w.,,,,,,,['Leuk Res. 1996 Apr;20(4):367.

All patients that achieved CR relapsed, with a median CR duration of 6 months (range 2-28 months); median survival of the whole group was 8.5 months, while median survival of responders was 9 months. No prognostic factor revealed a statistical significance in the outcome, due to the small number of patients in each subgroup.

Ara-C-induced differentiation served as a basis for comparison. Cell numbers, viability, benzidine staining, thymidine incorporation, and cell-cycle distribution by means of flow cytometry were determined. The Fenton reagents reduced the growth rate and thymidine incorporation of leukemic cells in a dose-dependent manner as regards the added H2O2 (from 0.01 to 1.0 mM), accompanied by an accumulation of hemoglobin in them. Differentiation of the cells was accompanied by considerable changes in total SOD and catalase activities. Ara-C caused an increase of SOD to 366%, and of catalase to 235%, while the complete Fenton reaction resulted in SOD increase to 705% and catalase decrease to 38% of the untreated control cultures. These shifts in enzyme inductions suggest the existence of a higher H2O2 flux in the differentiating cells. The results are consistent with the assumption that products of the Fenton reaction, among them OH. radicals deriving from H2O2 by heterolysis, may play a causal role in cell differentiation, whereas an overproduction of these radicals causes aging or death of the cells.","['Nagy, K', 'Pasti, G', 'Bene, L', 'Nagy, I']","['Nagy K', 'Pasti G', 'Bene L', 'Nagy I']","['Verzar International Laboratory for Experimental Gerontology (VILEG), Hungarian Section, Debrecen.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Benzidines)', ""0 (Fenton's reagent)"", '0 (Ferrous Compounds)', '2X02101HVF (benzidine)', '3352-57-6 (Hydroxyl Radical)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate/*toxicity', 'Benzidines/chemistry', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Ferrous Compounds/*toxicity', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*toxicity', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Iron/*toxicity', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['014521269400138Z [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(94)00138-z [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1995 Mar;19(3):203-12. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)00138-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drug-resistant cell lines showed increased activities of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/ZnSOD) and catalase compared with their parental drug-sensitive cell lines. However, the greater susceptibility of drug-resistant cells to TNF alpha cytotoxicity was, in part, related to their decreased activities of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Persistence of this differential sensitivity when MnSOD is inhibited by sodium nitroprusside (SNP) suggests that the greater susceptibility of drug-resistant cells to TNF alpha was not entirely due to their decreased level of MnSOD activity. K562 cl.6 and K/DAU600, which were more resistant to TNF alpha, both expressed greater levels of endogenous plasma membrane-bound TNF alpha than the CCRF-CEM cell line. All cell lines examined were (more or less) equal in susceptibility to the cytolytic effect of exogenous O2-. generated by xanthine/xanthine oxidase. These results demonstrate that both MnSOD and endogenous TNF alpha play a role in protecting leukaemic cells against TNF alpha cytotoxicity, but there is an unknown mechanism that causes drug-resistant cells to be more susceptible to TNF alpha cytotoxicity.","['Jia, L', 'Jiang, X R', 'Razak, K', 'Wu, Y L', 'Newland, A C', 'Kelsey, S M']","['Jia L', 'Jiang XR', 'Razak K', 'Wu YL', 'Newland AC', 'Kelsey SM']","['Department of Haematology, London Hospital Medical College, U.K.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Catalase/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Superoxide Dismutase/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Vinblastine']",,1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(94)00149-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(94)00149-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1995 Mar;19(3):187-94. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)00149-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this purpose, we studied three drug combinations, each at 8-12 concentrations, with the MTT assay in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) samples from 34 children obtained at initial diagnosis. This resulted in a total of 518 comparisons between expected and observed leukemic cell survivals. The combinations prednisolone (PRD) with vincristine (VCR), PRD with mafosfamide (MAF), and PRD with daunorubicin (DNR) were tested without technical difficulties, and without an increased assay variation as compared to single drugs. We observed a marked heterogeneity in drug interactions between patients, between combinations, and between different concentrations within one specific combination. Between PRD+VCR, synergism was found in 46%, antagonism in 18%, and additivity in 36% of the 228 observations. Between PRD+MAF, synergism was found in 51%, antagonism in 20%, and additivity in 29% of the 140 observations. Between PRD+DNR, synergism was found in 35%, antagonism in 31%, and additivity in 34% of the 150 observations. PRD+VCR and PRD+MAF showed more often synergism than PRD+DNR, while antagonism was observed more frequently between PRD+DNR (p < 0.05). However, the magnitude of antagonism was not much different between the three drug combinations, nor was there a significant antagonistic interaction in any of the drug combinations tested, if all samples were considered together. We conclude that the MTT assay can be used to study drug interactions in vitro in ALL samples. The type of interaction was different between patients, and depends on the drug combination and concentrations. The combinations PRD+VCR and PRD+MAF generally showed additive and even synergistic interactions. The cytotoxicity of PRD+DNR was generally not markedly higher than that of the most active single drug.","['Kaspers, G J', 'Veerman, A J', 'Pieters, R', 'Van Zantwijk, I', 'Hahlen, K', 'Van Wering, E R']","['Kaspers GJ', 'Veerman AJ', 'Pieters R', 'Van Zantwijk I', 'Hahlen K', 'Van Wering ER']","['Department of Pediatrics, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Daunorubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/*administration & dosage', 'Tetrazolium Salts/metabolism', 'Thiazoles', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage']",,1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(94)00126-U [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(94)00126-u [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1995 Mar;19(3):175-81. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)00126-u.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this reason, the use of 67Ga as a therapeutic agent is appealing. In the present we study, we report data about the radiotoxicity of 67Ga on peripheral blast cells of 23 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in vitro. Isolated blast cells were incubated for 4 days with 0.74 MBq/ml (20 microCi/ml), 1.48 MBq/ml (40 microCi/ml) or 2.96 MBq/ml (80 microCi/ml) 67Ga. Compared with non-irradiated control cells proliferation during incubation was almost abolished. Clonogenic survival was measured by a colony forming unit assay (CFU-assay). In 13 of the 23 patients (56%) sufficient colony growth was observed for evaluation. The mean clonogenic survival of blasts after incubation with 0.74 MBq/ml and 2.96 MBq/ml 67Ga was 22.5, 11.3 and 3.5%, respectively. In some cases colony growth was completely abolished after incubation with only 0.74 MBq/ml 67Ga. No correlation was found between cellular 67Ga-uptake, (micro)dosimetry and transferrin receptor density (CD-71) via which 67Ga enters the cell. In vitro the blasts received a dose of > 10 Gy in 9 of the 2.96 MBq/ml, in 3 of the 1.48 MBq/ml and in 2 of the 0.74 MBq/ml incubations. In one patient, even a radiation dose > 40 Gy was reached. Low dose rate irradiation is known to arrest cells in G2/M-phase of the cell cycle, but no such arrest was observed during incubation with 67Ga. Thus, 67Ga induces clonogenic cell death in leukemic blasts. Cellular uptake of 67Ga in vitro varies between patients and can be very high in some patients. The easy availability, low costs and absence of immunological problems warrant further investigation of the therapeutic potential of 67Ga in refractory or relapsed AML patients.","['Jonkhoff, A R', 'Huijgens, P C', 'Versteegh, R T', 'van Lingen, A', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'Drager, A M', 'Teule, G J']","['Jonkhoff AR', 'Huijgens PC', 'Versteegh RT', 'van Lingen A', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Drager AM', 'Teule GJ']","['Department of Hematology, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Gallium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/radiation effects', 'Gallium Radioisotopes/metabolism/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Receptors, Transferrin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*radiation effects']",,1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(94)00130-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(94)00130-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1995 Mar;19(3):169-74. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)00130-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of these analogues were prepared by coupling of tert-butyl-4-(prop-2-ynylamino)benzoate (37) with 6-(bromomethyl)-3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxoquinazoline (34) followed by deprotection of the tert-butyl ester to the acid and azide-mediated coupling to the appropriate amino acid or amino acid ester. In cases where the amino acid ester was unreactive with the acid azide, a modification was used in which the quinazolinone moiety was protected as its 3-(pivaloyloxy)methyl derivative. This permitted the generation of the more reactive acid chloride of the p-aminobenzoate unit. In general these modifications result in compounds that have equivalent potency to 1 as inhibitors of isolated TS except where the amino acid lacks a lipophilic alpha-substituent. These compounds appear to require the reduced folate carrier (RFC) for transport into cells, but since they are not converted intracellularly into polyglutamated forms, they have a lower level of cytotoxicity compared to 1. The removal of the alpha-carboxylic acid has given a second set of analogues of 1 which contain simple alkyl amide, benzyl, substituted benzyl, and heterocyclic benzyl amide derivatives. These are considerably less potent than 1 as TS inhibitors but display 1-10 microM cytotoxicities due to the fact that they do not require RFC transport and can presumably readily enter cells by passive diffusion through the cell membrane. Molecular modeling and NMR studies indicated that the incorporation of, respectively, 7-methyl and 2'-fluoro substituents would favor the optimum conformation of these molecules for interaction with the TS enzyme. Accordingly, these substituents were incorporated into selected examples to give the series of analogues 47-55. These all show enhanced (approximately 10-fold) inhibition of TS compared to their unsubstituted counterparts. In the substituted benzylamides (51, 52) and heterocyclic benzyl amides (53-55) the ability to enter cells by passive diffusion results in highly potent (< 1 microM) cytotoxic agents.","['Marsham, P R', 'Jackman, A L', 'Barker, A J', 'Boyle, F T', 'Pegg, S J', 'Wardleworth, J M', 'Kimbell, R', ""O'Connor, B M"", 'Calvert, A H', 'Hughes, L R']","['Marsham PR', 'Jackman AL', 'Barker AJ', 'Boyle FT', 'Pegg SJ', 'Wardleworth JM', 'Kimbell R', ""O'Connor BM"", 'Calvert AH', 'Hughes LR']","['Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Alderley Park, Macclesfield, Cheshire, England.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'N8VP1Y24AU (ICI 198583)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Folic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Glutamic Acid/*chemistry', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Quinazolines/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/03/17 00:00,1995/03/17 00:01,['1995/03/17 00:00'],"['1995/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00006a019 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1995 Mar 17;38(6):994-1004. doi: 10.1021/jm00006a019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective analysis of the bone and mineral status in 40 consecutive children with ALL seen in a pediatric tertiary-care referral center. METHODS: Biochemical indicators of mineral, endocrine, and vitamin D status were measured before initiation of therapy. Bone mass was determined radiographically and by dual-photon absorptiometry of the lumbar region of the spine (L2-L4). Correlations between clinical observations, leukemia variables, bone mass, and biochemical assessment were determined. RESULTS: At the time of diagnosis musculoskeletal pain was present in 36% of patients and was more common in children with CD10-positive leukemia and leukocyte counts less than 20 x 10(9) cells/L. Radiographic evidence of osteopenia and fractures was observed in 13% and 10% of children, respectively. The mean bone mineral content was normal. Bone mass measurement z scores correlated with plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 concentrations (r = 0.43, p < 0.05). Plasma calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels were normal. Low plasma osteocalcin (mean +/- SD, 1.6 +/- 1.6 nmol/L) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (33.4 +/- 26.4 pmol/L) values were observed. Parathyroid hormone levels were low in 14% of children. Hypercalciuria was detected in 64% of children. Urinary deoxypyridinoline was lower (p < 0.01) than in age-matched control subjects. Histomorphometric measurements of iliac bone showed abnormalities in mineralization in the biopsy specimens from three of nine children. CONCLUSION: Most children with ALL have alterations in bone metabolism and bone mass when first examined. These data suggest defective mineralization as the mechanism for decreased bone mass and implicate the leukemic process as causative.","['Halton, J M', 'Atkinson, S A', 'Fraher, L', 'Webber, C E', 'Cockshott, W P', 'Tam, C', 'Barr, R D']","['Halton JM', 'Atkinson SA', 'Fraher L', 'Webber CE', 'Cockshott WP', 'Tam C', 'Barr RD']","['Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,['0 (Minerals)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biopsy', '*Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic/complications/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fractures, Bone/complications/metabolism', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Ilium/pathology', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Matched-Pair Analysis', 'Minerals/*metabolism', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases/*complications/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Prospective Studies']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3476(95)70349-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3476(95)70349-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 1995 Apr;126(4):557-64. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3476(95)70349-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, most HTLV-1-infected individuals remain asymptomatic. How HTLV-1 infection leads to disparate consequences remains a mystery, despite extensive investigation of HTLV-1 isolates from infected individuals. As in human infection, experimental HTLV-1 infection in rabbits is generally benign, although HTLV-1-infected rabbit T cell lines that mediate lethal leukemia-like disease have been reported. We report here that thymuses from mature outbred rabbits inoculated with a lethal leukemia-like disease have been reported. We report here that thymuses from mature outbred rabbits inoculated with a lethal HTLV-1 T cell line (RH/K34) showed morphological and biochemical evidence of apoptosis, whereas thymuses from rabbits inoculated with nonlethal HTLV-1 T cell lines showed no signs of apoptosis. Exposure of rabbit or human lymphocytes to purified virus from RH/K34 caused rapid induction of apoptosis, providing an in vitro correlate to the pathogenic effects. By contrast, virus isolated from a nonlethal cell line mediated dose-dependent lymphocyte proliferation. These data implicate lymphocyte apoptosis as a potential mechanism by which the lethal HTLV-1 cell line causes fulminant disease and provide a means to identify factors contributing to HTLV-1 disease. Results from this HTLV-1 infection model can provide insight into variations in HTLV-1 pathogenicity in human infection.","['Leno, M', 'Simpson, R M', 'Bowers, F S', 'Kindt, T J']","['Leno M', 'Simpson RM', 'Bowers FS', 'Kindt TJ']","['Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Rockville, Maryland 20852, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology/*virology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/pathology/*virology', 'Rabbits', 'Thymus Gland/*pathology/virology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/virology', 'Virulence']",PMC2191945,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.181.4.1575 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1995 Apr 1;181(4):1575-80. doi: 10.1084/jem.181.4.1575.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present data demonstrating that expression of the TL antigen, unlike other class I molecules, is completely independent of the function of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). The TL antigen is expressed by transfected TAP-2-deficient RMA-S cells when these cells are grown at 37 degrees C. In transfected RMA cells, the kinetics of arrival of TL antigen on the cell surface are similar to those of a classical class I molecule. The kinetics are not altered in TAP-deficient RMA-S cells, demonstrating that surface TL expression in TAP-deficient cells is not due to the stable expression of a few molecules that leak out by a TAP-independent pathway. Soluble TL molecules produced by Drosophila melanogaster cells are highly resistant to thermal denaturation, unlike peptide-free classical class I molecules synthesized by these insect cells. In addition, these soluble TL molecules are devoid of detectable bound peptides. The results demonstrate that the TL antigen is capable of reaching the surface without bound peptide, although acquisition of peptide or some other ligand through a TAP-independent pathway cannot be formally excluded. We speculate that the ability of the TL antigen to reach the cell surface, under conditions in which other class I molecules do not, may be related to a specialized function of the TL molecule in the mucosal immune system, and possibly in the stimulation of intestinal gamma delta T cells.","['Holcombe, H R', 'Castano, A R', 'Cheroutre, H', 'Teitell, M', 'Maher, J K', 'Peterson, P A', 'Kronenberg, M']","['Holcombe HR', 'Castano AR', 'Cheroutre H', 'Teitell M', 'Maher JK', 'Peterson PA', 'Kronenberg M']","['Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of California, Los Angeles School of Medicine 90024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 3)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Actins)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tap2 protein, mouse)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)', '145892-13-3 (TAP2 protein, human)', '9038-94-2 (Metallothionein)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 3', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/physiology', 'Actins/genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Drosophila melanogaster/genetics', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, MHC Class I', 'Genes, Synthetic', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Golgi Apparatus/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Metallothionein/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/biosynthesis/genetics']",PMC2191972,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.181.4.1433 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1995 Apr 1;181(4):1433-43. doi: 10.1084/jem.181.4.1433.,,"['TAP-1', 'TAP-2']",,"['CA-07126/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-07463/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-52511/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transcription is quantified by scintillation counting of [3H]uridine incorporated into nuclear RNA that is protected from S1 nuclease digestion by hybridization with cold gene probes. This assay was dependent upon partial degradation of nuclear RNA and optimization of hybridization and nuclease digestion conditions. To validate this assay, transcription of beta-actin and c-myc genes was measured in two different human cell lines using the incorporation assay in parallel with the nuclear run-off assay. Transcription kinetics of the beta-actin and c-myc genes in serum-stimulated fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells determined by [3H]uridine incorporation were comparable to that determined by the nuclear run-off method. For beta-actin, there was an approximate 2-fold increase in transcription rate within two hours of stimulation that declined to basal levels by 20 h. The c-myc gene response followed a similar kinetics as for the beta-actin gene except that maximal enhancement was greater at 6-9-fold. The relative transcriptional activities of the beta-actin gene to that of the c-myc gene were virtually identical using the two assay methods.

Data were analyzed, using Student's t-test for continuous data, chi 2 test for categoric data, and log-rank test for survival estimates. Comparing results for cats with vaccination-site (VS) tumors and nonvaccination-site (NVS) tumors, we determined that VS tumors developed in younger cats and were larger than NVS tumors. Although VS sarcomas were biologically aggressive and redeveloped more often than NVS sarcomas, metastasis was not detected, and cats with VS tumors survived longer than cats with NVS tumors. Vaccination-site sarcomas developed in cats after injection of many types of vaccines, administered singularly or in combination. Of the cats in the VS group administered a single vaccine, 37% were given rabies, 33% were given feline viral rhinotracheitis/calicivirus/panleukopenia virus, and 30% were given FeLV vaccines. Cats with VS tumors were more likely to have received FeLV vaccine and less likely to have received rabies vaccine than those with NVS tumors.

Three mammalian Notch homologs have recently been identified: Notch 1, 2, and 3. All three homologs are very highly conserved relative to the Drosophila Notch gene, which suggests that they are important for cell differentiation in mammals. This notion is supported by the previous finding of a truncated, translocated form of the human NOTCH1 gene (formerly TAN1) in three cases of leukemia. Given this genetic link between NOTCH1 and tumor formation, it is of interest to establish the chromosomal positions of the other two homologs. We report the identification of cosmid clones for the human NOTCH1, 2, and 3 genes. These clones were used as probes in fluorescence in situ hybridization to human metaphase chromosomes, and the results, combined with data from somatic cell hybrid panels, show that the NOTCH2 and 3 genes are located at positions 1p13-p11 and 19p13.2-p13.1, respectively, which are regions of neoplasia-associated translocation.","['Larsson, C', 'Lardelli, M', 'White, I', 'Lendahl, U']","['Larsson C', 'Lardelli M', 'White I', 'Lendahl U']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH2 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH4 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptor, Notch2)', '0 (Receptor, Notch4)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Cosmids', 'Cricetinae', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1', 'Receptor, Notch2', 'Receptor, Notch4', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics', 'Receptors, Notch', 'Sequence Alignment', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,1994/11/15 00:00,1994/11/15 00:01,['1994/11/15 00:00'],"['1994/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0888-7543(84)71613-2 [pii]', '10.1006/geno.1994.1613 [doi]']",ppublish,Genomics. 1994 Nov 15;24(2):253-8. doi: 10.1006/geno.1994.1613.,,"['NOTCH1', 'NOTCH2', 'NOTCH3']",,,"['GENBANK/X79439', 'GENBANK/X80115']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, posttransplant CD4+ and CD8+ TCR alpha beta+ clonogenic T-cells are capable of LIF secretion, and LIF secretion may be a T-cell effector mechanism in graft versus host disease, graft versus leukaemia effects or posttransplant haematopoietic reconstitution.","['Bruserud, O', 'Hamann, W', 'Pawelec, G']","['Bruserud O', 'Hamann W', 'Pawelec G']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Tubingen University Medical Clinic, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia/blood/*metabolism/pathology/surgery', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1995.tb01776.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1995 Feb;54(2):106-10. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1995.tb01776.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The NH2-terminal sequence was determined as Ala1687-Val-Thr-Thr-Ile-Pro-Ala-Pro. By mass spectrometry the molecular weight was determined to be 30,241.9 with standard deviation of 3.9 amu. Therefore, we defined the C-terminal sequence of the 29-kDa fragment as Arg1957-Lys-Lys-Thr-Gly-Gln-Glu. This indicates that the fragment is composed of 277 amino acids. 125I-fibronectin and the 125I-labeled 29-kDa fragment bound to HL-60 (human acute promyelocytic leukemia) cells in a time-dependent, saturable, and reversible manner. Approximately 120 min was required to reach maximal binding. There were no differences in quantity or rate of binding of labeled fibronectin and 29-kDa fragment at temperatures of 4 degrees, 22 degrees, and 37 degrees C. The number of binding sites per HL-60 cell of fibronectin and the 29-kDa fragment were 140,000 with a Kd of 133 nM and 108,000 with a Kd of 250 nM, respectively. The binding of fibronectin to HL-60 cells was completely inhibited by this fragment, and by the peptides of RGDS and CS1 with IC50s of 3.6, 840, and 670 microM, respectively. Native fibronectin inhibited the direct binding of the 29-kDa fragment to HL-60 cells; however, RGDS peptide, peptide CS1, or two melanoma cell adhesion-promoting domain peptides in this 29-kDa fragment (peptide I; Tyr1906-Val1924, peptide II; Asp1946-Thr1960) did not block this binding. Neither heparitinase nor chondroitinase treatment of cells had any effect on these bindings. These results indicate that the C-terminal cell- and heparin-binding domain of fibronectin mediates HL-60 cell binding by direct interaction independently of RGD, CS1, and melanoma cell adhesion domains in this fragment.","['Fujita, H', 'Mohri, H', 'Kanamori, H', 'Iwamatsu, A', 'Okubo, T']","['Fujita H', 'Mohri H', 'Kanamori H', 'Iwamatsu A', 'Okubo T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Yokohama City University School of Medicine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '107978-77-8 (CS1 peptide)', '78VO7F77PN (arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', '93674-97-6 (RGES peptide)', 'AC6UDA2MFC (arginyl-glycyl-aspartyl-serine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Fibronectins/blood/*metabolism', 'Heparin/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligopeptides/chemical synthesis/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteoglycans/metabolism', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(85)71113-5 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1995.1113 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1995 Apr;217(2):484-9. doi: 10.1006/excr.1995.1113.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To provide better definition of gene order and relationships in this region where MLLT2 resides, we used pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to investigate 13 genes (including MLLT2) with physical locations in bands 4q11-->q25. Somatic cell hybrids derived from RS4;11, a leukemic cell line carrying the t(4;11)(q21;q23), were also used to localize genes in relation to MLLT2. Linkage of the interleukin 8 (IL8), albumin (ALB), and platelet factor 4 (PF4) genes was confirmed by NotI, SalI and SacII digests. The maximum distance between PF4 and ALB is 210 kb and between ALB and IL8 is 420 kb. The alcohol dehydrogenase, class I (ADH2, ADH3) gene cluster can be linked to the alcohol dehydrogenase, class III gene (ADH5) by SacII, NruI, and EagI digests. The maximum distance between them is 590 kb. Our study indicated that ALB, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), PF4, beta-thromboglobulin (PPBP), GRO1 (encoding a cytokine also called melanoma growth-stimulatory activity), and IL8 genes can be physically linked. In this study the gamma-interferon induced protein 10 (INP10), bone morphogenetic protein 3 (BMP3), annexin III (ANX3), KIT, amphiregulin (AREG), immunoglobulin J polypeptide (IGJ), deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) and MLLT2 genes were not linked to one another or to the above two groups of genes. Our analysis using somatic cell hybrids combined with previous reports demonstrated that the ADH gene cluster is telomeric to MLLT2 and KIT, ALB, AFP, PF4, beta TG, GRO1, IL8, ANX3, AREG and DCK are centromeric to MLLT2.","['Chen, C S', 'Bejcek, B E', 'Kersey, J H']","['Chen CS', 'Bejcek BE', 'Kersey JH']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine/Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Cytogenet Cell Genet,Cytogenetics and cell genetics,0367735,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Cricetinae', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000133976 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytogenet Cell Genet. 1995;69(3-4):260-5. doi: 10.1159/000133976.,,,,['R35 CA49721/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
