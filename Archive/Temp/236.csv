METHODS--An immunohistochemical study of paraffin wax embedded sections was done on surgically resected specimens of spleens with MBC clusters from patients with gastric cancer (14 cases), tonsils (five cases), and lymph node (two cases) showing lymphoid follicular hyperplasia (LFH), submandibular lymph nodes containing MBC in Sjogren's syndrome (one case). Extranodal organs affected by MCL (three cases) and monocytoid B cell lymphoma (MBCL) (seven cases), and spleens from HCL (four cases) were also studied. These specimens were fixed in 10% formalin and routinely processed for paraffin wax embedding. Fresh spleen specimens from patients with liver cirrhosis (one case) and gastric cancer (seven cases) were snap frozen. RESULTS--Mantle zone lymphocytes were DBA.44, CD74 positive and showed a weaker reaction for CDw75 than marginal zone lymphocytes and MBC, which were almost DBA negative. In neoplastic diseases tumour cells in MCL were DBA.44, CD74, and CDw75 positive. MBCL showed a positive reaction for CD74 and CDw75, but positivity for DBA.44 was observed in only one of seven cases. The HCL specimens, all positive for DBA.44, showed a weaker reaction for CD74 and a stronger reaction for CDw75 than either MCL and MBCL specimens. CONCLUSION--These results show that mantle zone lymphocytes and MCL more closely matched HCL for reactivity to DBA.44 than MBC and MBCL. Reactivities for DBA.44 and CDw75 were greater in MBCL compared with its non-neoplastic counterpart, MBC.","['Ohsawa, M', 'Kanno, H', 'Machii, T', 'Aozasa, K']","['Ohsawa M', 'Kanno H', 'Machii T', 'Aozasa K']","['Department of Pathology, Osaka University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (invariant chain)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.1 (ST6GAL1 protein, human)']",IM,['J Clin Pathol 1994 Nov;47(11):1058'],"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Castleman Disease/*immunology', 'Female', 'Histiocytes/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sialyltransferases', ""Sjogren's Syndrome/immunology"", 'Spleen/*immunology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/immunology', 'Tonsillar Neoplasms/immunology']",PMC502178,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.47.10.928 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1994 Oct;47(10):928-32. doi: 10.1136/jcp.47.10.928.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cell-surface expression of the recombinant viral envelope is stable and does not lead to syncytium formation among a substantial number of cells expressing envelope glycoprotein, suggesting that these cells are suitable as targets to monitor HIV-specific ADCC activities with the stage or the progression of HIV-1 disease. By using these cells, the ability of sera from HIV-1 seropositive individuals to mediate ADCC against HIV-1 gp120/160 transfected cells in an antigen-specific manner was established. Approximately 63% of the HIV-infected individuals representing all stages of infection have virus-specific ADCC antibodies. Moreover, sera from healthy seropositive (CDC class II) subjects mediated substantially higher levels of ADCC activity (25.7 +/- 11.5%) than did sera from individuals in CDC class III (10.3 +/- 8.9%) or IVC1 (6.4 +/- 8.1%). The mean ADCC activity for the sera from the seronegative volunteers was 2 +/- 1.3%. The correlation between the ADCC level and CD4 cell depletion remains uncertain. Therefore, the established transfected cell line may be used to probe the role of gp120/160-specific ADCC activity in the development of AIDS and may also prove useful in screening human and murine monoclonal antibodies with potential ADCC activity.

The precise mechanism by which transformed cells are selectively killed by the activation of these receptors is yet unknown, but several intracellular signaling pathways are known to be involved. Phospholipase A2 activation by TNF-alpha has been shown to be important in the transduction of signals leading to cell death. We have used monitoring of extracellular acidification rate as a measure of cellular metabolism to follow the early time course of TNF effects on a human leukemic T cell line (CEM-SS cells). CEM-SS cells were relatively resistant to TNF cell killing but TNF caused an early stimulation of metabolism within 2-4 hr, followed by a suppression of metabolic activity occurring over 20 hr. In contrast, a TNF sensitive subclone of CEM cells (C1Ca) showed a rapid and dramatic decrease in metabolic activity corresponding to cytotoxicity within 18 hr. It was discovered that cupric o-phenanthroline markedly potentiated the effects of TNF on the resistant CEM-SS cells leading to cell death. This observation was specific for copper because ferric o-phenanthroline was without effect at the same concentration. The copper cytotoxic effect was shown to be mediated through the TNF-R1 receptor and independent of phospholipase A2 signaling.","['Wada, H G', 'Fok, K S', 'Fendly, B M', 'Chiang, N Y', 'Sussman, H H']","['Wada HG', 'Fok KS', 'Fendly BM', 'Chiang NY', 'Sussman HH']","['Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, California 94089.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Metals)', '0 (Phenanthrolines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', 'H0C805XYDE (Quinacrine)', 'W4X6ZO7939 (1,10-phenanthroline)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Copper/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Metals/pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phenanthrolines/pharmacology', 'Quinacrine/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Receptor Aggregation', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*administration & dosage/toxicity']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041610324 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1994 Dec;161(3):597-605. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041610324.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells, a tumor mast cell line, stimulation by immunoglobulin E receptor crosslinking induces these responses. In order to determine whether redistribution or aggregation of cell surface proteins is sufficient to induce a response in these cells without extrinsic crosslinking, we have redistributed cell surface proteins by electroosmotic segregation and looked for second messenger [Ca2+]i responses. Video imaging of calcium ion activity using the fluorescent calcium sensitive dye fura-2 revealed the effects of receptor motion and aggregation induced by application of small (10 V/cm) electric fields. A synchronous, monotonic rise in [Ca2+]i generally occurs within a few minutes after a steady field has been applied, while the redistribution of surface proteins is still in progress. The oscillations in [Ca2+]i characteristic of antigen-stimulated cells are not seen, nor are any effects observed in weak alternating fields (0.02, 60 Hz).

(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 20116-20125). The present study provides evidence that the GS-X pump is functionally overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 (HL-60/R-CP) cells, in which the cellular GSH level was substantially enhanced. Indeed, the rate of ATP-dependent transport of the GS.Pt complex, measured with plasma membrane vesicles, was about 4-fold greater in HL-60/R-CP cells than in HL-60 cells. Three membrane proteins with apparent molecular masses of 200, 110, and 70 kDa were overexpressed in HL-60/R-CP cells, whereas P-glycoprotein (MDR1) was not immunologically detected in the membrane preparations from resistant and sensitive cells. Unlike in HL-60 cells, increased numbers of intracellular vesicles were observed in the cytoplasm of HL-60/R-CP cells. Fluorescence microscopy with syn-(CICH2,CH3)-1,5-diazabicyclo-[3.3.0]-octa-3,6-dione-2,8-dione (monochlorobimane) revealed that the fluorescent glutathione S-conjugate accumulated in intracellular vesicles of the cisplatin-resistant cells in an energy-dependent manner. The GS-X pump is suggested to contribute to vesicle-mediated excretion of GSH-drug conjugates from cells. In addition, both HL-60 and HL-60/R-CP cells underwent cell differentiation in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, retinoic acid, and dimethyl sulfoxide, resulting in proliferation arrest as well as a remarkable decrease in the c-myc mRNA levels. After cell differentiation, a significant decrease was observed in the activity of ATP-dependent transport of the GS.Pt complex in membrane vesicles prepared from both HL-60/R-CP and HL-60 cells. These results suggest that the expression of the GS-X pump in both cisplatin-resistant and -sensitive cells is related to cell proliferation.","['Ishikawa, T', 'Wright, C D', 'Ishizuka, H']","['Ishikawa T', 'Wright CD', 'Ishizuka H']","['Department of Experimental Pediatrics, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (glutathione transporter)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/11/18 00:00,1994/11/18 00:01,['1994/11/18 00:00'],"['1994/11/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/18 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)62016-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Nov 18;269(46):29085-93.,,['R01 CA60486/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The anti-oncogenic effect of the alpha subunit is mediated by a pathway that does not involve two tumor suppressor genes induced by type I IFNs, the transcriptional regulator IFN response factor-1 and the RNA-dependent protein kinase, or the p135tyk2 tyrosine kinase that directly associates and phosphorylates the alpha subunit.","['Colamonici, O R', 'Porterfield, B', 'Domanski, P', 'Handa, R K', 'Flex, S', 'Samuel, C E', 'Pine, R', 'Diaz, M O']","['Colamonici OR', 'Porterfield B', 'Domanski P', 'Handa RK', 'Flex S', 'Samuel CE', 'Pine R', 'Diaz MO']","['Department of Pathology, University of Tennessee, Memphis 38163.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Irf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Tyk2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Erythropoiesis', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Phosphoproteins/physiology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteins/physiology', 'Receptors, Interferon/chemistry/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'TYK2 Kinase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'eIF-2 Kinase']",,1994/11/04 00:00,1994/11/04 00:01,['1994/11/04 00:00'],"['1994/11/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/04 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)46980-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Nov 4;269(44):27275-9.,,"['CA49133/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55079/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These choriocarcinoma and leukemia cell lines with abundant AP-N activity showed much higher sensitivity to bestatin (IC50 = 0.5, 2.1 and 1.0 micrograms/ml, respectively) than the other cell lines. By immunoblotting and immunocytochemical staining, AP-N was detected as an approximately 165-kDa protein and localized on the cell membrane in choriocarcinoma cells.

Cell growth was markedly suppressed by the AP-N inhibitor actinonin as well as bestatin, but not by the AP-B inhibitor arphamenine. Of the three MAbs, only WM15, which is able to inhibit AP-N activity, suppressed cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that AP-N inhibitors show a growth-suppressive effect, presumably through inhibition of the enzymatic activity of AP-N on tumor cells, and suggest that AP-N may play important roles in the growth of certain tumors, such as choriocarcinoma and leukemia.","['Ino, K', 'Goto, S', 'Okamoto, T', 'Nomura, S', 'Nawa, A', 'Isobe, K', 'Mizutani, S', 'Tomoda, Y']","['Ino K', 'Goto S', 'Okamoto T', 'Nomura S', 'Nawa A', 'Isobe K', 'Mizutani S', 'Tomoda Y']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nagoya University School of Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'I0J33N5627 (ubenimex)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'CD13 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Choriocarcinoma/*enzymology/pathology', 'Growth Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leucine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology']",PMC5919595,1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1994.tb02970.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1994 Sep;85(9):927-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1994.tb02970.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methylcellulose selects for terminal-dividing cells and suspension cultures have been developed because they allow self-renewal to occur: The exponential growth of the progenitors of AML cultured in suspension is due to self-renewal. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Cells were harvested from previously untreated leukemic human bone marrows. The myeloblastic lineage of the colonies was assessed by morphological, cytochemical, and immunophenotypic analysis, and by the use of growth factors that did not stimulate the growth of T-lymphocytes. The cell-cycle distribution of the blasts was analyzed by flow cytometry and was comparable for all samples. The irradiation was performed with gamma-photons at a dose-rate of 0.05 Gy/min, similar to the clinical conditions used in our institution for total body irradiation (TBI). RESULTS: The culture methods selected aggressive leukemias. There were large variations of the individual radiosensitivity whatever culture method was used. The progenitor cells capable of self-renewal were more radiosensitive than terminal dividing cells. In two cases, a shoulder was found in the initial part of the cell-survival curves of cells capable of self-renewal. In these two cases, the best fit for the data was the linear quadratic model (survival = e-alpha D-beta D2) with alpha/beta values of 1.49 Gy and 3.12 Gy, respectively. CONCLUSION: The very low values of alpha/beta suggest a reduced antileukemic effect in case of fractionated TBI, and may lead to more reliable screening methods to determine the most appropriate technique for radiation ablation of bone marrow prior to bone marrow transplantation (BMT).","['Cowen, D', 'Richaud, P', 'Landriau, S', 'Lagarde, P', 'Mahon, F X', 'Baudet, J J', 'Belloc, F', 'Gualde, N', 'Reiffers, J']","['Cowen D', 'Richaud P', 'Landriau S', 'Lagarde P', 'Mahon FX', 'Baudet JJ', 'Belloc F', 'Gualde N', 'Reiffers J']","['Department of Radiotherapy, Institut Paoli-Calmettes Cancer Center, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,['9004-67-5 (Methylcellulose)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology/*radiation effects', 'Cell Cycle/radiation effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Culture Techniques/methods', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gamma Rays', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Methylcellulose', 'Middle Aged', 'Photons', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(94)90320-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(94)90320-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1994 Dec 1;30(5):1133-40. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(94)90320-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two double strand breaks may interact and rejoin in three different ways. (a) To form a dicentric, which is a lethal event, and will lead to the death of the cell. (b) To form a symmetrical translocation, which may activate an oncogene, and result in, for example, a leukemia or lymphoma. (c) To result in a deletion, which may remove or inactivate a suppressor gene and result in, for example, a solid tumor. Genes identified in mammalian cells may be conveniently grouped into four families. Genes involved in the repair of radiation damage can greatly influence radiosensitivity. Molecular checkpoint genes hold damaged cells in G2 to check for the integrity of their chromosomes before allowing them to proceed into mitosis; consequently, an inactivated checkpoint gene can also result in increased radiosensitivity. Activated oncogenes are associated with only a small proportion of human cancers, and tend to be found more commonly in leukemias and lymphomas and less frequently with solid tumors. A reciprocal translocation is the most likely mechanism by which radiation may activate an oncogene. An inactivated or deleted suppressor gene is commonly associated with a wide range of human cancers. It is becoming increasingly evident that many common cancers do not arise randomly in the population, but that subgroups of individuals are particularly susceptible. The challenge of recombinant technology is that in the near future it may well be possible to determine at birth the susceptibilities of a given individual by identifying mutations in key genes. This is the revolution and challenge we face in the treatment of cancer.","['Hall, E J']",['Hall EJ'],"['Center for Radiological Research, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, NY 10032.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'DNA/radiation effects', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'Gamma Rays', 'Genes, Suppressor', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Genetic Techniques', 'Humans', '*Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced', 'Oncogenes', 'Radiotherapy/*trends', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(94)90305-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(94)90305-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1994 Dec 1;30(5):1019-28. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(94)90305-0.,,['CA-12536/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],29,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Seventy-nine patients with acute leukemia (AML or ALL) in first complete remission or chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase, five patients with high grade lymphoma, and one with chronic lymphocytic leukemia were entered in the study. They were given a single dose of total body irradiation (10 Gy over 4 h) with two different doses to the lungs (6 Gy or 8 Gy) prior to bone marrow transplantation. The median dose rate was 0.04 Gy/min. The median follow-up for both groups of patients was 24 months. RESULTS: The actuarial 5-year overall survival rate was similar in both groups, 59% and 43% for patients given 8 Gy and 6 Gy to the lungs, respectively. The lung complication rate was similar in the two groups (28% vs. 22% for the 8 Gy and 6 Gy group, respectively). The actuarial leukemia recurrence rate was significantly higher in the group of patients given 6 Gy to the lungs (25%) vs. 0% in the 8 Gy group. Interestingly, all recurrences occurred in the group of patients who were given 6 Gy to the lungs, who had acute leukemia, and no chronic graft vs. host disease (GVHD). CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of patients was not very large and the follow-up relatively short, these findings suggest that a lower dose to the lungs could lead to an increased incidence of leukemia recurrences due to a lower dose to the thoracic wall or to lower incidence of chronic GVHD.","['Girinsky, T', 'Socie, G', 'Ammarguellat, H', 'Cosset, J M', 'Briot, E', 'Bridier, A', 'Gluckman, E']","['Girinsky T', 'Socie G', 'Ammarguellat H', 'Cosset JM', 'Briot E', 'Bridier A', 'Gluckman E']","['Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/etiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*radiotherapy/therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/complications/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Lung/microbiology/*radiation effects', 'Lung Diseases, Interstitial/etiology/microbiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",,1994/11/15 00:00,1994/11/15 00:01,['1994/11/15 00:00'],"['1994/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(94)90355-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(94)90355-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1994 Nov 15;30(4):821-4. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(94)90355-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure to such infections is likely to differ considerably between areas depending on rates of population mixing. It is therefore possible that the geography of SIDS will reflect that of population migration. METHODS: For 403 local authority districts in England and Wales the number of SIDS deaths in the first year of life and the number of livebirths during the period 1979-1983 were abstracted from published sources. Districts were classified by levels of in-migration using data from the 1981 Census and observed and expected numbers of SIDS deaths were compared for areas experiencing different rates of in-migration. RESULTS: A significant association (P < 0.001) was found between SIDS deaths and rates of long distance migration into districts. In the group with the highest rate of long distance in-migration the ratio of observed to expected SIDS deaths was 62% greater than in the group with the lowest rate of in-migration. This association was strengthened after adjustment for social class and illegitimacy. A weaker, but statistically significant, association was found for shorter distance in-migration. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that geographical variations in SIDS deaths in England and Wales are strongly associated with differences in rates of population mixing as measured by migration.

METHODS: Age-specific and age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated from data in the study, 'International Incidence of Childhood Cancer', co-ordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. RESULTS: The highest age-adjusted incidence, 31.4 per million, was observed in the Nordic countries, and rates between 24 and 27 per million were found in most other predominantly white Caucasian populations. In the US, black children had a significantly lower incidence (21.7) than whites (26.4). Lower rates were seen in South America, Africa and Asia, the lowest being those for Chinese populations, and for blacks in Africa, both below 15 per million. Among white populations, astrocytomas were the commonest histological type, often with an incidence of at least 10 per million, followed by medulloblastomas, 5-6 per million, and ependymomas, 2-4 per million. In other regions with lower incidence rates, these three types accounted for similar proportions of the total. Black children in the US had a higher incidence of craniopharyngiomas than whites and there was an unusually high incidence of pineal tumours in Japan, 0.9 per million compared with 0.3-0.4 in many other countries. CONCLUSIONS: The low recorded total incidence in developing countries may be partly due to underascertainment. Differences in total incidence or in relative frequencies of particular histological types between Western countries and Japan and between ethnic groups in the US suggest a substantial contribution of genetic predisposition in their aetiology.","['Stiller, C A', 'Nectoux, J']","['Stiller CA', 'Nectoux J']","['Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,,IM,,"['Age Distribution', 'Brain Neoplasms/*epidemiology/genetics/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Global Health', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Population Surveillance', 'Spinal Cord Neoplasms/*epidemiology/genetics/pathology']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ije/23.3.458 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 1994 Jun;23(3):458-64. doi: 10.1093/ije/23.3.458.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a total of 3,310 study subjects, 27 SMTs have been registered. The Cumulative Risk (CR) of SMT was 2.9% 15 years after the end of treatment and the Standard Incidence Ratio (SIR) was 10.8. The ALL sub-cohort had the highest risk of SMT (SIR 13.6) and 9 cases of CNS tumor occurred in this group (SIR 58.9). All 9 had received prophylactic cranial radiotherapy (CRT) and 5 had been treated on one protocol, characterized by low-dose intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX) given monthly for 2 years after CRT. The Off-Therapy Registry has unique criteria for inclusion; direct comparisons with similar studies are therefore somewhat problematic. However, our data suggest that the risk of SMT in childhood ALL cancer survivors may be greater than previously reported, and that CNS tumors are the most common SMT in this group.

And the biosynthesis of both proteins is regulated post-transcriptionally by the interaction of specific cytoplasmic protein, termed iron responsive elements-binding protein (IRE-BP) with specific sequences, termed iron responsive elements (IRE), located in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the ferritin mRNA or 3'UTR of TfR mRNA. In spite of the important role of IRE/IRE-BP interaction for cellular iron metabolism, the role of it for erythroid differentiation is not yet well known. In this study, the author investigated the time sequential change of IRE-BP, ferritin and TfR mRNA expression and the binding activity of IRE-BP with IRE during erythroid differentiation of human erythroleukemic cells (K 562). During erythroid differentiation of K 562 cells by Na-butyrate, analysis using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction indicated that TfR mRNA expression was little changed. The addition of excess iron (as 100 micrograms/ml holo transferrin) caused reduction of the level of TfR mRNA, however, the iron chelator defferoxamine caused its increase. IRE-BP mRNA was slightly increased at the early period of erythroid differentiation and unaffected by iron or iron chelator treatment. Affinity binding signal of IRE and IRE-BP detected by gel retardation assay was also increased at the early period of erythroid differentiation. The addition of iron or iron chelator both caused marked increase in the binding activity of IRE-BP at 48 hr after Na-butyrate treatment. These results suggest that IRE/IRE-BP inter-action may play a possible role in the erythroid differentiation of K562 cells.","['Ogawa, T']",['Ogawa T'],"['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi,[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science,17410290R,"['0 (Iron-Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Erythroblasts/*cytology', 'Ferritins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Iron-Regulatory Proteins', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Receptors, Transferrin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi. 1994 Jul;69(4):781-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twofold increase of platelet counts was observed in DSG-treated BM chimeras compared with phosphate buffered saline (PBS)-treated BM chimeras. By using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), several cytokine mRNA expressions were analyzed in order to clarify which cytokines are involved in thrombopoiesis. So far, interleukin-6 (IL-6), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), stem cell factor (SCF), and IL-11 have been reported to have potent thrombopoietic activity in vivo. Although some other cytokines such as IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) possess the capacity of thrombopoiesis, megakaryocytopoiesis is more marked in these cytokines. IL-6 mRNA expression was increased in spleen cells from DSG-treated BM chimeras from day 25 to day 32 and in bone marrow cells from day 19 to day 28. LIF mRNA expression was not significantly increased compared with PBS control. Although SCF mRNA expression was increased, the kinetics of increased SCF mRNA expression did not fit the kinetics of increased platelet counts. Increased mRNA expression in other hematopoietic cytokines, such as IL-3, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and GM-CSF were also observed, thus suggesting that these cytokines may synergistically support thrombopoiesis in concert with IL-6.

A monoclonal antibody (2H2 mAb) which recognizes the unique N-terminal domain of the murine c-fgr gene product (Fgr) has been established. Immune complex kinase assay with a monocytic leukemia cell line demonstrated that 2H2 precipitated a 59 kilodalton (kDa) protein, which corresponds to the molecular weight of murine Fgr. Fgr was expressed highly in lymph nodes, slightly in spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes and barely in thymus. The Fgr was hardly detectable in bone marrow. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the expression of Fgr was restricted to cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage located in the marginal zone of the spleen and in the paracortical zone and medulla of lymph nodes. However, various haematopoietic or lymphoid tumor cell lines different from a lineage of monocyte/macrophage were shown to express Fgr molecule by immune complex kinase assay. Although normal resting haematopoietic or lymphoid cells did not express Fgr protein, activated T and B cells expressed Fgr. In the presence of a mild detergent, the Fgr was co-immunoprecipitated with a 75 kDa protein (p75) and several other molecules expressed on the cell surface membrane. Furthermore, the molecule co-immunoprecipitated with Ly6C molecule from a macrophage cell line showed protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity.

In normal subjects, serum levels of H subunit were significantly lower than those of L subunit, as previously reported by Cazzola and coworkers. Although the serum levels of L subunit were elevated and the values of H/L ratios were decreased in inflammatory diseases, serum levels of H subunit were remarkably high in patients with infectious mononucleosis. In liver disease, elevation of mean values of L subunit was observed. However, in liver cirrhosis and severe acute hepatitis, the serum levels of H subunit were often elevated as well as those of L subunit, and so it was suggested that the elevation of H subunit was related to the degree of hepatocellular injury. In hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer, since the levels of H/L ratio were higher than controls and no correlation was observed between H and L subunits, it was suggested that the production of H subunit was increased in these cancers. However, the result of H/L ratio determination in serum ferritin did not appear enough to be important for tumor marker, because of a few instances demonstrated over the cut off limit of H/L ratio in neoplastic diseases. The rate of the patients whose H or L subunit levels were over the cut off point was higher in leukemia than in solid cancer, and so it was likely that the measurement of H and L subunit at the same time was clinically useful in leukemic patients. In acute myeloblastic leukemia, relatively high levels of serum L subunits and low H/L ratio were shown. It was suggested that the measurement of H and L subunits in patients with neoplastic diseases would also be useful for monitoring the effect of the therapy.","['Takahashi, K']",['Takahashi K'],"['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi,[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science,17410290R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Ferritins/*blood', 'Humans', 'Infections/diagnosis', 'Liver Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi. 1994 Jul;69(4):1010-23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Isolated single cells that show an all-or-none contractile response to acetylcholine were desensitized by treatment with 0.1 mM acetylcholine for 10 min, resulting in an increase in the threshold concentration of acetylcholine for contraction, but without changing any of the binding characteristics. Permeabilized cells showed that the desensitization is via uncoupling between the receptor and G-protein. Secretory cells (rat basophil leukemia-2H3 cells) transfected with human m3-receptor showed desensitization when treated with 0.1 mM carbachol for 30 min. The coupling between the receptor and G-protein was not impaired, but some unknown Ca(2+)-independent mechanism may be involved. Smooth muscle tissue was tested for its time-course of desensitization, and a novel transient resensitization was found at 1 min of incubation with 0.1 mM carbachol. This resensitization, and the desensitization prior to it, were accompanied with changes in binding affinity. However, the affinity was not changed, in parallel with desensitization afterwards, but the positive feedback loop of Ca(2+)-influx caused by alkalization via receptor-stimulation was suppressed. After a 30-min treatment, a Ca(2+)-independent mechanism caused the uncoupling and affinity decrease. Treatment for 3 hr increased the number of binding sites without recovery of the response. The desensitizing process is very diverse to achieve selectivity, but its purpose is in unity.","['Uchida, M K', 'Mita, M', 'Oishi, K', 'Hishinuma, S']","['Uchida MK', 'Mita M', 'Oishi K', 'Hishinuma S']","['Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Meiji College of Pharmacy, Tokyo, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Nihon Yakurigaku Zasshi,Nihon yakurigaku zasshi.

Many cellular oncogenes have been shown to regulate such behavior and the participation of various growth factors has been implicated in the same process. The etiology of the proliferative stimulus is examined here and it is found that the cause of accelerated growth is mainly due to cellular interactions via surface contact. In order to reproduce the in vivo situation, that is the genesis and maturation of cells in the bone marrow compartment, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells in the form of cell lines as well as primary APML cells were seeded on top of normal bone marrow feeder layers used as the supporting cellular surface. First, it is shown that direct contact between the two different populations results in increased proliferation of the seeded population as feeders, inactivated by irradiation, still stimulate cellular and do not promote differentiation. Second, it is demonstrated that there is no granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), CSF-1, interleukin-3 (IL-3) and possibly stem cell factor (SCF) production by the marrow cells during the contact. Third, when cell-to-cell contact is hindered by mechanically separating the cellular surfaces, allowing, however, the free transport of possibly produced growth factors (GF), the proliferative rate is reduced. Thus, the results demonstrate that cell contact and not growth factor production is responsible for the increased growth rate of these cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Vassiliadis, S']",['Vassiliadis S'],"['Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB), Crete, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Haematologia (Budap),Haematologia,0130266,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '9004-67-5 (Methylcellulose)']",IM,,"['Adipose Tissue/cytology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/metabolism/radiation effects', '*Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cell Communication', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Diffusion', 'Endothelium/cytology', 'Growth Substances/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Methylcellulose', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologia (Budap). 1994;26(1):29-37.,['c-kit'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we investigated the effect of taxotere on lymphocyte function and found that a suppression of MHC-NR cytotoxicity of naive lymphocytes is only seen at higher doses of taxotere (50 micrograms/ml). At the concentrations of 10 and 50 micrograms/ml, taxotere did not have any effect on the cytotoxic function of IL-2-preactivated lymphocytes. On the contrary, both taxol and taxotere caused a significant suppression of lymphocyte growth and activation with IL-2 at 10 and 50 micrograms/ml. Both drugs (at the concentration of 10 micrograms/ml) were potent inhibitors of the growth of the tumor cell lines OV-2774 and K-562.

Recent reports suggest that p53 causes growth arrest through transcriptional activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-inhibitor Cip1. Here, we characterize the p53-dependent G1 arrest in several normal human diploid fibroblast (NDF) strains and p53-deficient cell lines treated with 0.1-6 Gy gamma radiation. DNA damage and cell cycle progression analyses showed that NDF entered a prolonged arrest state resembling senescence, even at low doses of radiation. This contrasts with the view that p53 ensures genetic stability by inducing a transient arrest to enable repair of DNA damage, as reported for some myeloid leukemia lines. Gamma radiation administered in early to mid-, but not late, G1 induced the arrest, suggesting that the p53 checkpoint is only active in G1 until cells commit to enter S phase at the G1 restriction point. A log-linear plot of the fraction of irradiated G0 cells able to enter S phase as a function of dose is consistent with single-hit kinetics. Cytogenetic analyses combined with radiation dosage data indicate that only one or a small number of unrepaired DNA breaks may be sufficient to cause arrest. The arrest also correlated with long-term elevations of p53 protein, Cip1 mRNA, and Cip1 protein. We propose that p53 helps maintain genetic stability in NDF by mediating a permanent cell cycle arrest through long-term induction of Cip1 when low amounts of unrepaired DNA damage are present in G1 before the restriction point.","['Di Leonardo, A', 'Linke, S P', 'Clarkin, K', 'Wahl, G M']","['Di Leonardo A', 'Linke SP', 'Clarkin K', 'Wahl GM']","['Gene Expression Lab, Salk Institute, La Jolla, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*biosynthesis', '*DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase/physiology/radiation effects', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Metaphase', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Skin', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1101/gad.8.21.2540 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Dev. 1994 Nov 1;8(21):2540-51. doi: 10.1101/gad.8.21.2540.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to understand the role of Oct-4 in early murine embryogenesis, we carried out an analysis of the temporal and spatial pattern of protein expression. We report the presence of Oct-4 protein in cultured cells and murine embryos as determined by immunohistochemistry using confocal microscopy. Oct-4 protein is present in both embryonic stem cells and embryonal carcinoma cells, but is down-regulated following differentiation of these cells by culture in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor or in the presence of retinoic acid, respectively. In embryos, the protein is found at low levels in unfertilized eggs and is localized predominantly to the pro-nuclei upon their formation following fertilization. The protein is present in the nuclei in all cleavage stages, but following differentiation of the trophectoderm at the blastocyst stage, Oct-4 protein is only expressed in the inner cell mass. The pattern of protein expression to this stage correlates well with previously reported in situ hybridization results; however, a striking difference was seen in primitive endoderm cells which had begun to differentiate and migrate along the inner surface of the trophectoderm. In direct contrast to RNA localization studies which demonstrate that there are only low levels of Oct-4 transcripts in primitive endoderm cells, protein expression in these early migrating cells is higher than in the inner cell mass.","['Palmieri, S L', 'Peter, W', 'Hess, H', 'Scholer, H R']","['Palmieri SL', 'Peter W', 'Hess H', 'Scholer HR']","['European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Gene Expression Program, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Blastocyst/cytology/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Embryo Implantation', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0012-1606(84)71312-1 [pii]', '10.1006/dbio.1994.1312 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 1994 Nov;166(1):259-67. doi: 10.1006/dbio.1994.1312.,['Oct-4'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Counts of surviving cells will therefore include both lethally-hit cells (apparent survivors), and real survivors which have not been lethally hit. Death rates of irradiated leukaemic and normal cells show great variation between individuals, so that comparisons of radiosensitivity between different cell populations based on surviving cell counts at a single time-point are invalid. In this study the supposed radioresistance of prolymphocytic leukaemia lymphocytes was examined in 6 patients with B-cell disease. Survival curves were plotted from serial observations made over several days after graded X-irradiation (0-1000 cGy). We attempted to interpret these radiation responses in terms of their dose dependence (intrinsic radiosensitivity) and time dependence (cell death rate) characteristics using the best-fitting of four mathematical models, all based on classical ""single-hit"" target theory. The apparent radioresistance shown in 4 cases could be explained by very slow death rates (T1/2 values 55-205 h) of cells proving otherwise radiosensitive (D37 values 38-123 cGy). Genuine radioresistance was found in only 1 case (actual D37 value above 2000 cGy). By ignoring delayed cell death in clinical assessments, pathological lymphocytes could be mistakenly categorised as resistant to elimination by radiotherapy.","['Thomson, A E', ""O'Connor, T W"", 'Peel, W E', 'Slater, N G']","['Thomson AE', ""O'Connor TW"", 'Peel WE', 'Slater NG']","[""Division of Haematology, United Medical School, Guy's Hospital, London, U.K.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,,"['B-Lymphocytes/radiation effects', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Death/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count/radiation effects', 'Lymphocytes/*radiation effects', 'Models, Biological', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1994.tb00194.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1994 Oct;53(4):223-31. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1994.tb00194.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis was demonstrated by electron microscopy and agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified by flow cytometry. Culturing AML blasts in the presence of a bone marrow fibroblast (BMF) monolayer reduced the percentage of AML blasts undergoing apoptosis in the majority of cases studied. The effect was more pronounced when AML cells were cultured in the presence of an adherent long-term bone marrow (LTBM) stroma rather than BMF. Overall, the mean percentage of AML cells with fragmented DNA fell from 85 +/- 8% in control cultures to 20 +/- 9% in cultures with adherent stroma (p = 0.0004, n = 7). Supplementation of serum-free medium with recombinant cytokines, including stem cell factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or with human placenta-conditioned medium (HPCM) matched the degree of inhibition of apoptosis induced by BMF in only 50% of cases. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and IL-6 were completely ineffective. Consistent with this observation, direct contact between leukemic cells and adherent layers was essential for maximum inhibition of leukemic-cell DNA fragmentation. Separation by a porous membrane allowing passage of soluble growth factors, but interrupting direct cell contact, was associated with significantly greater DNA fragmentation and cell death. Inhibition of leukemic-cell apoptosis correlated with improved survival and growth of malignant clonogenic cells. Colonies grown in cultures were identified as leukemic by morphology and by fluorescence in in situ hybridization to demonstrate numerical chromosomal abnormalities identified at diagnosis. Close contact between leukemic cells and bone marrow inhibits blast cell apoptosis and directly promotes survival of clonogenic AML cells.","['Bendall, L J', 'Daniel, A', 'Kortlepel, K', 'Gottlieb, D J']","['Bendall LJ', 'Daniel A', 'Kortlepel K', 'Gottlieb DJ']","['Department of Haematology, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['0 (Growth Substances)'],IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Apoptosis', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Clone Cells', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA Damage', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1994 Dec;22(13):1252-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The contrasting and specific effects of glycosaminoglycans (depending on their structures and properties) on a leukemia cell line could help explain the regulation of proliferative and/or differentiative processes of hematopoietic cells in order to clarify the control of development and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells by bone marrow extracellular matrix. Heparin from beef intestinal mucosa, heparan sulfate from beef spleen, dermatan sulfate from beef intestinal mucosa, and chondroitin sulfate from bovine trachea were extracted and purified, and their purity, structures, and physicochemical properties were evaluated. Fast-moving heparin was obtained by its selective precipitation as barium salt, and partially desulfated and re-N-sulfated heparin was produced by chemical modifications. Different glycosaminoglycans were tested to evaluate their effects on proliferation and differentiation processes of a monoblastic leukemia cell line (U-937). Heparin and derivatives (from 0.1 to 100 micrograms/ml) inhibit cell proliferation; heparan sulfate does not produce modifications, while chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate (from 0.01 to 100 micrograms/ml) significantly stimulate cell growth. Cell differentiation was evaluated by cytoenzymatic determination of alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase and by fluorescein-labeled anti-HLA-DR, anti-CD11b, and anti-CD14 antibodies. Nitro blue tetrazolium reduction and phagocytosis were also evaluated. Heparin and derivatives significantly increase U-937 differentiation. Heparin sulfate has no effect, while chondroitin sulfate and, to a lesser extent, dermatan sulfate, induce a strong decrease of differentiative markers. The regulation of U-937 cell properties appears to be related to charge density and to the amount of N-sulfate and N-acetyl groups. In particular, glycosaminoglycans with lower sulfate-to-carboxyl ratios and N-sulfate group percentages (chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate) stimulate proliferation and produce a decrease of differentiative markers; on the contrary, polysaccharides with high charge density and N-sulfate group amounts (heparin and derivatives) inhibit U-937 proliferation and induce terminal differentiation. A previous paper (N. Volpi, L. Bolognani, A. Conte, and M. Petrini, (1993) Leukemia Res. 17, 789-798) demonstrates dissimilar effects on U-937 cells by chondroitin sulfates with different structures and physicochemical properties.

The receptor for human C5a is a member of the rhodopsin superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors and contains an aspartate residue (Asp82) within the putative second transmembrane domain conserved in all other G protein-linked receptors. We investigated the role of this residue and also the carboxy-terminal 23 residues of the C5a receptor in ligand binding and signal transduction by expressing wild-type and mutant receptors in the rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3. Wild-type and truncated receptors coupled efficiently to effector systems, resulting in the C5a-dependent discharge of granule contents. In contrast RBL cells transfected with receptors in which Asp82 had been mutated to asparagine did not respond to human C5a by secretion despite binding human C5a with high affinity. We conclude therefore that Asp82 is not involved in the interaction with ligand but is essential for the proper transduction of the ligand binding signal.","['Monk, P N', 'Pease, J E', 'Marland, G', 'Barker, M D']","['Monk PN', 'Pease JE', 'Marland G', 'Barker MD']","['Krebs Institute for Biomolecular Research, Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, University of Sheffield.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Complement C5a/*pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a', 'Receptors, Complement/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Serotonin/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830241152 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1994 Nov;24(11):2922-5. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830241152.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, the unregulated growth of promyelocytic leukaemia cells is correlated with disruption of the normal state of ND10. In this paper we show that: (i) Vmw110 affects the distribution of PML in the cell; (ii) Vmw110 proteins lacking a functional RING finger zinc-binding domain cause the production of striking abnormal cytoplasmic and nuclear structures, some of which contain PML and other ND10 antigens; (iii) a mutant form of Vmw110 which is confined to the cytoplasm appears to result in cytoplasmic PML in some cells; (iv) normal interaction with the nuclear structures requires the C-terminal portion of Vmw110; (v) the C-terminal portion of Vmw110, when linked to a heterologous protein, disrupts the normal distribution of PML.

We have found that RBTN1 and RBTN2 have the ability to interact with each of the leukemogenic bHLH proteins (TAL1, TAL2 and LYL1). These interactions occur in vivo and appear to be mediated by sequences within the LIM and bHLH domains. The LIM-bHLH interactions are highly specific in that RBTN1 and RBTN2 will associate with TAL1, TAL2 and LYL1, but not with other bHLH proteins, including E12, E47, Id1, NHLH1, AP4, MAX, MYC and MyoD1. Moreover, RBTN1 and RBTN2 can interact with TAL1 polypeptides that exist in assembled bHLH heterodimers (e.g. TAL1-E47), suggesting that the RBTN proteins can influence the functional properties of TAL1. Finally, we have identified a subset of leukemia patients that harbor tumor-specific rearrangements of both their RBTN2 and TAL1 genes.

The expression of both NR1 and gp130 was also necessary for Ba/F3 cells to proliferate and M1 cells to undergo macrophage differentiation in response to IL-11.","['Hilton, D J', 'Hilton, A A', 'Raicevic, A', 'Rakar, S', 'Harrison-Smith, M', 'Gough, N M', 'Begley, C G', 'Metcalf, D', 'Nicola, N A', 'Willson, T A']","['Hilton DJ', 'Hilton AA', 'Raicevic A', 'Rakar S', 'Harrison-Smith M', 'Gough NM', 'Begley CG', 'Metcalf D', 'Nicola NA', 'Willson TA']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Il11ra1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Il11ra2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-11)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Antigens, CD', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin/chemistry/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-11', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Signal Transduction']",PMC395415,1994/10/17 00:00,1994/10/17 00:01,['1994/10/17 00:00'],"['1994/10/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/17 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/17 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1994 Oct 17;13(20):4765-75.,,['CA-22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/U14412'],,,,

To positively show that this is mediated via the the catalytic subunit, C alpha, of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, stably transfected Reh cell lines overexpressing C alpha were established. This was achieved by transfection with a construct confering hygromycin resistance together with a zinc-inducible expression of C alpha from the human metallothionine promoter. C alpha transfected clones were shown to confer a 2- to 2.5-fold zinc-dependent increase in C alpha messenger RNA, immunoreactive C, and phosphotransferase activity. The growth rate of clones transfected with C alpha was retarded, and a zinc-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation was demonstrated in the presence of a small trigger dose of forskolin. In contrast, overexpression of the regulatory subunit I alpha had no effect on cAMP-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation. Furthermore, expression of mutant regulatory subunit I alpha AB, which renders cAMP-dependent protein kinase unresponsive to cAMP, clearly protected against that inhibitory effect of cAMP. These data provides evidence that activation of the C subunit (C alpha) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase mediates the inhibitory action of cAMP on cell proliferation in Reh cells.","['Tasken, K', 'Andersson, K B', 'Erikstein, B K', 'Hansson, V', 'Jahnsen, T', 'Blomhoff, H K']","['Tasken K', 'Andersson KB', 'Erikstein BK', 'Hansson V', 'Jahnsen T', 'Blomhoff HK']","['Institute of Medical Biochemistry, University of Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,,"['B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*pathology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/*physiology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*genetics/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc/pharmacology']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.135.5.7956934 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1994 Nov;135(5):2109-19. doi: 10.1210/endo.135.5.7956934.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Operative vs. nonoperative management.,1095-9,"PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate the spectrum, clinical presentation, management, and outcome of anorectal disease in neutropenic leukemic patients and to compare operative and nonoperative management in neutropenic leukemic patients. METHODS: A retrospective review of hospital records was performed. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-one of 2,618 (5.8 percent) patients hospitalized with leukemia had concomitant symptomatic anorectal disease. Data from 81 patients were available for analysis. Fifty-two (64 percent) were treated nonoperatively and 29 (36 percent) underwent operative treatment. Fifty-seven (70.4 percent) had absolute neutrophil counts < 1,000/mm3, and 54 (66.7 percent) were severely neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count < 500/mm3). Management and outcomes of 54 severely neutropenic patients were analyzed. In 20 patients who underwent surgery there were 4 deaths (20 percent) and 4 recurrences (20 percent), whereas in 34 patients managed nonoperatively there were 6 deaths (18 percent) and 4 recurrences (12 percent) (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic anorectal disease afflicted 5.8 percent of hospitalized leukemic patients. In these patients, anorectal sepsis was a major source of mortality. Our data suggest that anorectal abscesses in neutropenic leukemic patients may be safely drained. Because we did not observe excessive morbidity or mortality (20 percent vs. 18 percent) in the operated neutropenic leukemics as compared with the nonoperated patients, selected neutropenic leukemic patients should not be denied anorectal surgery when otherwise indicated.","['Grewal, H', 'Guillem, J G', 'Quan, S H', 'Enker, W E', 'Cohen, A M']","['Grewal H', 'Guillem JG', 'Quan SH', 'Enker WE', 'Cohen AM']","['Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dis Colon Rectum,Diseases of the colon and rectum,0372764,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/blood/*complications', '*Neutrophils', 'Rectal Diseases/classification/epidemiology/etiology/*surgery', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02049810 [doi]'],ppublish,Dis Colon Rectum. 1994 Nov;37(11):1095-9. doi: 10.1007/BF02049810.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The only significant change in parasite burdens when mice were first infected by T. gondii and then by LP-BM5, compared with T. gondii controls, was an increase in lung counts in mice challenged with LP-BM5 20 days after T. gondii inoculation. Whatever the schedule of co-infection, the kinetics of lymphocyte subsets in co-infected mice differed from those in T. gondii- or LP-BM5-infected mice; in dually infected mice CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts were intermediate between values in mice singly infected by the parasite or the virus. Enlargement of spleen and lymph nodes, which is a major criterion of MAIDS progression, was significantly less marked in co-infected mice than in mice infected with LP-BM5 alone.

We have investigated the effect of the two non-promoting phorbol esters, 12-deoxyphorbol-13-O-phenylacetate (Dopp) and 12-deoxyphorbol-13-O-phenylacetate-20-acetate (Doppa) on HL-60 cultures, and compared them with the tumour promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). All phorbol esters tested were found to be able to stop HL-60 proliferation and induce cell adherence and morphological changes characteristic of differentiation. TPA, fully differentiating at 1 nM, was more potent than Dopp and Doppa, which required 100 nM for full differentiation effects within the 4 day study. Doppa initially appeared weaker than Dopp at inhibiting incorporation of thymidine, the earliest effect studied, but we were able to detect rapid C-20 deacylation of Doppa, converting it to Dopp, using an HPLC protocol presented here. A detailed study of this thymidine incorporation inhibition showed that both TPA (10 nM or greater) and Dopp (500 nM or greater) have very similar time courses, with 50% inhibition occurring at approximately 12 h, in contrast to Doppa which had a significantly delayed time course at all doses tested. Exposure tests indicated that Dopp and Doppa could be washed from the cells much more easily than TPA. The data presented here strongly support the notion that the metabolic conversion of Doppa to Dopp by HL-60 cells was necessary to mediate its differentiating effects. Since protein kinase C (PKC)-beta 1, present in HL-60 cells, has been found to be the only PKC isotype activated so far in vitro by Doppa, our results suggest that activation of this isotype is not sufficient to drive HL-60 differentiation in vivo.","['Ryves, W J', 'Dimitrijevic, S', 'Gordge, P C', 'Evans, F J']","['Ryves WJ', 'Dimitrijevic S', 'Gordge PC', 'Evans FJ']","['School of Pharmacy, University of London, Department of Pharmacognosy, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Phorbol Esters)', '58821-98-0 (12-deoxyphorbolphenylacetate)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/15.11.2501 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1994 Nov;15(11):2501-6. doi: 10.1093/carcin/15.11.2501.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This ARG antimetabolite is active against L1210 murine leukemia and a solid colonic tumor in the rat. Our initial studies using a microtiter assay show that CAV exhibits a 50% inhibitory concentration of approximately 2 mM against the human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line, MIA PaCa-2, when these cells are grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.4 mM ARG. When the ARG concentration is reduced to 0.4 microM, the 50% inhibitory concentration for CAV falls precipitously to 0.01 mM. The pronounced increase in the ability of CAV to inhibit MIA PaCa-2 cell growth at the lower ARG concentration may result from enhanced CAV competition with ARG for incorporation into newly synthesized cellular proteins. At 0.4 microM ARG, 30 mM CAV almost completely inhibits cell growth by 6 h. In contrast, with 0.4 mM ARG, complete inhibition does not occur until after 48 h. A dramatic reversal of growth inhibition caused by a very high concentration of CAV was observed when cells treated with CAV were replenished with a high concentration of ARG.

Fifty-two chemicals were classified as highly positive compounds when examined for their ability to inhibit TPA-induced ODC activity. These agents showed a dose-dependent inhibition or inhibition at all doses. Retinoids, in general, exhibited strong inhibition of ODC activity. A category of compounds showing dose-dependent inhibition were the sulfur compounds, especially the thiols and thiones. Among the natural products, terpenes were strong inhibitors of ODC. Forty-seven compounds were classified as strong inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase. In the carcinogen-DNA binding inhibition assay, 21 compounds were identified as strong inhibitors, which include phenolic compounds as well as sulfur compounds. Vitamins and their analogues were also good inhibitors. Testing for induced glutathione yielded 19 compounds that were good inducers. Sulfur-containing compounds and most of the phenolic compounds were also inducers of glutathione. Twenty compounds were highly positive for inhibition of TPA-induced free radical formation. A significant number of phenolic and sulfur compounds were again strong oxygen radical scavengers. Some antiinflammatory agents were also identified as free radical inhibitors. In general, retinoids were quite active in all the assays. Eight compounds were positive in all of the six assays; these were vitamin C (ascorbic acid), bismuththiol, esculetin, etoperidone, folic acid, hydrocortisone, indole-3-carbinol, and tocopherol succinate. Agents that were positive in these assays may inhibit the carcinogenesis process by similar mechanisms in humans and are identified as candidates for development as chemopreventive agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Sharma, S', 'Stutzman, J D', 'Kelloff, G J', 'Steele, V E']","['Sharma S', 'Stutzman JD', 'Kelloff GJ', 'Steele VE']","['ManTech Environmental Technology, Inc., Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '3417WMA06D (Benzo(a)pyrene)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'L6NTK7VJX9 (1,3-propane sultone)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzo(a)pyrene/pharmacology', 'Biological Assay', 'DNA Adducts/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*methods', 'Epithelium/enzymology/pathology', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Free Radicals/metabolism', 'Glutathione/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/pathology', 'Liver/enzymology', '*Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors', '*Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BUF', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Thiophenes/pharmacology', 'Trachea/enzymology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/11/15 00:00,1994/11/15 00:01,['1994/11/15 00:00'],"['1994/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Nov 15;54(22):5848-55.,,['N01-CN-95172-03/CN/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

DMSO-HL60 generated O2- upon stimulation with a tumor promoter, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). O2- generation, determined as O2- release from the PMA-stimulated cells by the reduction of cytochrome c, was dependent on the dose of PMA and reached almost maximal with 2.0 nM PMA. PMA dose-dependently increased 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8OHdG) in DMSO-HL60, typical of mutagenic oxidative DNA damage. The 8OHdG level, determined by electrochemical detection with high performance liquid chromatography, also became almost maximal with 2.0 nM PMA. The amount of O2- generation and that of the 8OHdG induction by PMA in human neutrophils were similar to those in DMSO-HL60. Superoxide dismutase inhibited the 8OHdG induction by about 60%, whereas catalase, deferoxamine, or thiols inhibited it almost completely. Dilution of PMA-stimulated DMSO-HL60 decreased the concentration of ROS releasing to the media from the cells. However, it did not decrease the ROS generation per cell or the 8OHdG induction. The addition of H2O2 to unstimulated DMSO-HL60 did not increase the 8OHdG level. These findings indicate that DMSO-HL60 could be used as a substitute for human neutrophils, that the concentration of ROS is not the only determinant for the 8OHdG induction, but that it requires both acquisition of susceptibility to ROS by reduction of iron by O2- and formation of H2O2, and that ROS increase 8OHdG by attacking the ROS-generating cell.","['Takeuchi, T', 'Nakajima, M', 'Morimoto, K']","['Takeuchi T', 'Nakajima M', 'Morimoto K']","['Department of Hygiene and Preventive Medicine, Osaka University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', ""88847-89-6 (8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine)"", 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"", 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Deoxyguanosine/*analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Superoxides/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/11/15 00:00,1994/11/15 00:01,['1994/11/15 00:00'],"['1994/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Nov 15;54(22):5837-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) served as standard. Thereby, we generally found high mdr1- and mrp-, but low topoisomerase II alpha-mRNA levels. While mdr1 levels of the CLL samples were mostly found to be in the range of values measured in the T-lymphoblastoid, P-glycoprotein MDR cell line CCRF VCR 100, mrp levels were usually found to be 2-4-fold higher compared therewith. This might represent a multifactorial MDR in CLL. In contrast to the low or even absent topoisomerase II alpha gene expression, however, the expression of the topoisomerase II beta gene was generally high in the CLL lymphocytes exceeding the value observed in the cell line CCRF VCR 100 up to 5-fold. mdr1 gene expression correlated significantly with mrp gene expression in samples from patients having received chemotherapy (rs = 0.5833, P < 0.05, n = 10).

However, randomized Phase III studies are no better than or are critically dependent on Phase I and Phase II studies for positive therapeutic leads that are compelling enough to test in the Phase III arena. The variables involved in the series of randomized trials that led to the curative treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia also resulted in an understanding of the principles of cancer therapy in therapeutic research. These principles, when applied to Hodgkin's disease in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, testis cancer, childhood solid tumors, and others, resulted in a substantial cure rate for those diseases. However, for the adult epithelial common solid tumors, a second strategy, adjuvant chemotherapy, was required This has resulted in a 20% reduction in mortality in patients with node positive and node negative breast cancer. Tamoxifen has been similarly effective in patients with postmenopausal breast cancer. In colon cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy with fluorouracil plus levamisole has decreased mortality to a comparable degree. New agents, modulations, combination chemotherapy, and biotherapeutics are being addressed to the adjuvant situation which has proven effective in a variety of neoplastic diseases. A third strategy is neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This involves the use of chemotherapy first for patients with solid tumors, designed to down-stage the primary tumor thus making it more susceptible to less radical surgery and to organ- or limb-sparing procedures in osteogenetic sarcoma and in head and neck cancer. For example, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has not resulted in an increased survival as compared with the appropriate control but has allowed for important quality-of-life contributions, such as limb-sparing and radical surgery-sparing procedures. In addition to new agents and combination chemotherapy, dose is a critical variable. This is most evident clinically in the transplantation arena. Comparative studies recently completed, for example, in patients with adjuvant breast cancer and with acute leukemia indicate that dose is a significant factor in tumor control.","['Frei, E 3rd']",['Frei E 3rd'],"['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,,"['Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', '*Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Research Design']",,1994/11/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19941101)74:9+<2610::aid-cncr2820741804>3.0.co;2-c [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1994 Nov 1;74(9 Suppl):2610-3. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19941101)74:9+<2610::aid-cncr2820741804>3.0.co;2-c.,,,8,,,,,,,,,,,,

An extensive histopathologic and immunohistochemical study of 12 cases.,3042-50,"BACKGROUND: Multiple lymphomatous polyposis (LP) is a rare entity, characterized by multiple polypoid tumors involving several segments of the gastrointestinal tract. METHODS: In this large retrospective series of 12 patients with LP, histologic and immunohistochemical features were investigated from patients with multiple biopsy samples from each site (500 gastrointestinal biopsies). Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin embedded biopsies from 12 patients and on frozen tissue biopsies from 8 patients, for each of whom at least two different anatomic sites were studied. RESULTS: Histologic features always were characterized by nodules located in mucosa and submucosa composed of lymphomatous, small cleaved cells. B-cell phenotype of the neoplastic cells was the same phenotype as adult mantle-zone cells or fetal follicle cells (frequent coexpression of surface IgM and surface IgD, and weak expression of CD5, CD35+, CDw32+, and CD23-). Tested cases expressed bcl-2. Five to 20% of LP cells were positive for the monoclonal antibody Ki-67. Five patients died within 5-32 months after diagnosis. Frequent extradigestive sites were also identified. There were two unique findings: five cases with digestive tract lymphoepithelial lesions (LEL), and one secondary transformation to large B-cell malignant lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, this is the largest series so far of LP studied with immunohistochemistry on frozen sections.

Twenty-three cases of myelopathy that occurred in patients who received intensive CNS-directed therapy were evaluated to identify the determinants of this severe CNS toxicity. METHODS: Nine cases treated by the authors and 14 collected from the literature are discussed. Twelve had Burkitt's leukemia/lymphoma. Patient ages ranged from 3 to 30 years (median, 15 years). The dose intensity of CNS-directed therapies, including intrathecal cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), intrathecal methotrexate (MTX), systemic high dose (HD) MTX, systemic HD ara-C, systemic thiotepa, and CNS radiation, was evaluated by the determination of single drug doses and cumulative total drug or irradiation doses over elapsed treatment durations. RESULTS: Central nervous system treatment was prophylactic in 10 cases; active CNS disease was being treated in 13 cases. One patient received only intrathecal ara-C before toxicity occurred; other received intrathecal ara-C and varying combinations of intrathecal MTX, HD ara-C, HD MTX, CNS radiation, and systemic thiotepa. Eight patients died of toxicity, of whom 6 had autopsy-proven cord necrosis; 3 were ventilator-dependent; 10 had persistent paraplegia or paraparesis; and 2 recovered completely. CONCLUSION: Both highly intensive, short CNS treatment sequences and lower intensity, long term cumulative treatments may result in this rare but severe myelopathy. The cause is multifactorial, with systemic chemotherapy, intrathecal chemotherapy, and radiation therapy contributing to toxicity. Multiple intrathecal ara-C and/or MTX doses given at frequent (daily) intervals should be avoided. Concurrent intrathecal ara-C and systemic HD ara-C also appear to be especially toxic. Intrathecal hydrocortisone given with intrathecal ara-C does not protect against myelopathy. Multiple, frequently spaced courses of CNS-directed therapies must be avoided, especially in patients who have received prior CNS radiation.","['Watterson, J', 'Toogood, I', 'Nieder, M', 'Morse, M', 'Frierdich, S', 'Lee, Y', 'Moertel, C L', 'Priest, J R']","['Watterson J', 'Toogood I', 'Nieder M', 'Morse M', 'Frierdich S', 'Lee Y', 'Moertel CL', 'Priest JR']","[""Children's Hospital, St. Paul, MN 55105.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Spinal Cord/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Spinal Cord Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Spinal Diseases/chemically induced/etiology', 'Thiotepa/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19941201)74:11<3034::aid-cncr2820741122>3.0.co;2-o [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1994 Dec 1;74(11):3034-41. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19941201)74:11<3034::aid-cncr2820741122>3.0.co;2-o.,,,34,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clonal proliferation has not been confirmed in the majority of reported cases. In this woman, age 58 years, who had been diagnosed as having high grade immunoblastic lymphoma after excision of a single cervical lymph node, the remaining bilateral cervical, inguinal, and axillary adenopathy regressed completely without any cytotoxic treatments 22 days after biopsy. At the time of this writing, the patient has been free of disease for 24 months. METHODS: Clonality of the lymphoproliferation in the case was examined by immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using paraffin embedded biopsy material. Possible implications of Epstein-Barr virus in the pathogenesis of this process was examined also by PCR amplification and in situ hybridization. RESULTS: The proliferating lymphoid cells showed restricted expression of immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain and amplification of clonally rearranged V-D-J regions of Ig heavy chain gene. Epstein-Barr virus did not appear to be involved in the process. CONCLUSION: The present study shows that spontaneous complete regression of clonal lymphoproliferation that is morphologically a high grade lymphoma can occur.","['Kumamoto, M', 'Nakamine, H', 'Hara, T', 'Yokoya, Y', 'Kawai, J', 'Ito, H', 'Nishioka, S', 'Takenaka, T', 'Wickert, R S', 'Mitchell, D W']","['Kumamoto M', 'Nakamine H', 'Hara T', 'Yokoya Y', 'Kawai J', 'Ito H', 'Nishioka S', 'Takenaka T', 'Wickert RS', 'Mitchell DW']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Wakayama Medical University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin J-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,,"['Biopsy', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/analysis/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin J-Chains/analysis/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/analysis/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/analysis/genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitosis', '*Neoplasm Regression, Spontaneous', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'RNA, Viral/analysis/genetics']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19941201)74:11<3023::aid-cncr2820741120>3.0.co;2-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1994 Dec 1;74(11):3023-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19941201)74:11<3023::aid-cncr2820741120>3.0.co;2-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the effect of 2',5'-di (tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone (BHQ) and thapsigargin, inhibitors of the intracellular Ca(2+)-ATPase, on ionic currents in rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL-2H3) cells under whole cell voltage clamp. 2. The whole cell current was inwardly rectifying and reversed at -35 +/- 6 mV (n = 16). The conductance of the inward current increased as the concentration of extracellular K+ was raised from 2.7 to 5.4, 10.8 and 21.6 mM. BaCl2 (100 microM) reduced the current to a small linear component and shifted the reversal potential to -4 +/- 3 mV (n = 6). A concentration of 50 microM BaCl2 produced 45 +/- 10% (n = 4) blockade of the inward current. 3. BHQ and thapsigargin were examined for their effects on the inwardly rectifying current. A maximal blockade of inward current was obtained within 6 min after perfusion with 10 microM BHQ. The small current remaining after blockade with BHQ had a linear voltage-dependence and reversed direction at -6 +/- 9 mV (n = 6). Thapsigargin (up to 3 microM) was without effect on the inward rectifier. 4. In contrast to the blockade of the inward rectifier produced by BaCl2 which was predominantly on the steady state current, particularly at the very hyperpolarized holding potentials (-120 mV), blockade by BHQ was equally strong on the instantaneous as well as the steady state current. 5. Blockade of the inward rectifier by BHQ may cause depolarization of the cell which will affect Ca2+ influx during investigations with BHQ. Thapsigargin does not block the inward rectifier and will not inhibit Ca2+ influx in this way.","['Hassessian, H', 'Vaca, L', 'Kunze, D L']","['Hassessian H', 'Vaca L', 'Kunze DL']","['Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '26XK13B61B (2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone)', 'EC 7.2.2.10 (Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium-Transporting ATPases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Hydroquinones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/metabolism', 'Potassium Channels/*drug effects', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC1910265,1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1476-5381.1994.tb13199.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 1994 Aug;112(4):1118-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1476-5381.1994.tb13199.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is not feasible to monitor L-asparagine plasma levels in patients under L-asparaginase treatment using the usual analytical procedures as the enzyme continues the hydrolysis of L-asparagine after blood sampling and during plasma extraction. A method was therefore developed for the determination of L-asparagine in patients receiving L-asparaginase. Sulphosalicylic acid is added to blood samples to deproteinize and inactivate L-asparaginase rapidly. The samples are then analysed by HPLC using a Novapack C18 column and fluorescence detection. With the same method L-asparagine is determined in blood cells and, by difference, plasma levels are calculated.

The calibration graph is linear over a wide range and the limit of detection is approximately 10 ng/ml, using 0.5 ml of human plasma. The method is selective for RA, accurate and robust and thus suitable for the routine analysis of plasma samples from patients undergoing RA therapy.

It has become clear that a graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR) is accompanied by a graft-versus-leukemia reaction (GVLR) which may prevent leukemia relapse. In two non-immunogenic rat leukemia models, the Brown Norway acute myelocytic leukemia (BNML) and the WAG/Rij acute lymphocytic leukemia L4415, total body irradiation (TBI) was given to induce 'minimal residual disease' (MRD). Subsequently, it was attempted to evoke a GVLR by using syngeneic or allogeneic BMT, with or without addition of graded numbers of lymphocytes. In both leukemia models the addition of high numbers of syngeneic lymphocytes to the syngeneic graft had no antileukemic effect. Allogeneic marrow grafts, which contain at the most 8% lymphocytes, only resulted in a GVLR when splenocytes were added. The therapeutic window was found to be narrow, i.e. in fully mismatched BMT the number of allogeneic splenocytes resulting in a significant GVLR (2-3 log leukemic cell kill) without inducing (lethal) acute GVHD was critical. Increasing the number of allogeneic spleen cells added to the allogeneic BM graft induced lethal acute GVHD.

The donor-derived CTL exclusively recognized a class I HLA difference associated with HLA-B44. Nucleotide sequencing of donor and recipient cells revealed that the patient possessed the HLA-B*4402 allele recognized by IEF as B44.2 while the donor possessed HLA-B*4403 (IEF variant B44.1). These alleles differ at one amino acid residue located at position 156 in the alpha 2 domain. The donor-derived CTL were shown to be specific for B44.2 by blocking studies and by the lysis of five different B44.2+ unrelated cell lines, two of which were confirmed by sequencing to be homozygous for B*4402. A host-specific difference involving a HLA-DRB1 allele was not recognized by the CTL, neither did HLA differences unique to the donor HLA-B*4403 and HLA-DQ8 elicit a host response.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), an MyD gene induced by Interleukin 6 (IL-6) or Leukemia Inhibitory factor (LIF), plays a role in growth inhibition associated with terminal differentiation. Leucine zipper transcription factors of the fos/jun family, also identified as MyD genes, function as positive regulators of hematopoietic cell differentiation, increasing the propensity of myeloblastic leukemia cells to be induced for differentiation in vitro, and reducing the aggressiveness of their leukemic phenotype in vivo. The zinc finger transcription factor EGR-1, an MyD gene specifically induced upon macrophage differentiation, was shown to be essential for and to restrict differentiation along the macrophage lineage. Finally, evidence has been accumulating to indicate that the novel MyD genes--MyD116, MyD118 and gadd45 (a member in the MyD118 gene family)--play a role in growth arrest and apoptosis of hematopoietic cells, as well as other cell types. The proto-oncogenes c-myc and c-myb, known to regulate cellular growth, were shown to function as negative regulators of terminal differentiation. Both c-myc and c-myb are normally expressed in proliferating myeloblasts and suppressed following induction of differentiation. Deregulated and continuous expression of c-myc was shown to block terminal myeloid differentiation at an intermediate stage in the progression from immature blasts to mature macrophages, whereas deregulated and continuous expression of c-myb blocked the terminal differentiation program at the immature myeloblast stage. By manipulating myc function in conditional (differentiation inducible) mutant myeloblastic leukemia cell lines, expressing a chimeric mycer transgene, it was shown that there is a window during myeloid differentiation, after the addition of the differentiation inducer, when the terminal differentiation program switches from being dependent on c-myc suppression to becoming c-myc suppression independent, and where activation of c-myc has no apparent effect on mature macrophages. These myeloblastic leukemia cell lines provide a powerful tool to increase our understanding of the role of c-myc in normal hematopoiesis and in leukemogenesis, while also providing a strategy to clone myc target genes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Liebermann, D A', 'Hoffman, B']","['Liebermann DA', 'Hoffman B']","['Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19140.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Egr1 protein, mouse)', '0 (GADD45 protein)', '0 (GADD45B protein, human)', '0 (Gadd45b protein, mouse)', '0 (IRF1 protein, human)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Irf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MYD88 protein, human)', '0 (Myd116 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myd88 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPP1R15A protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Ppp1r15a protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)']",IM,,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Antigens, Differentiation', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Immediate-Early', 'Genes, myc', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leucine Zippers/physiology', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Oncogenes', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/physiology', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'Proteins/genetics/physiology', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Receptors, Immunologic', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530120402 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1994 Jul;12(4):352-69. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530120402.,"['MyD', 'MyD116', 'MyD118', 'c-fos', 'c-jun', 'c-myb', 'c-myc', 'fos', 'fun', 'gadd45', 'junD', 'myc']",,117,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phenotypic markers were positive for cells of the myeloid lineage, but negative for monocyte/macrophage, megakaryocyte, and T-cell lineages. The occasional blast was positive for CALLA. All blasts carried the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+), with 20% also harbouring a monosomy 7 (a cytogenetic marker for AML). Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed the presence of two BCR/Abl mRNA transcripts; b2a2, the CML-type and E1a2, the ALL-type. Immunoglobulin (Ig) gene analysis demonstrated the presence of a small population of cells containing rearranged Ig genes. After a short remission, the patient relapsed. At relapse the leukaemia had undergone a major phenotypic switch from AML to ALL, with blasts bearing B-cell markers. Ig gene analysis confirmed a monoclonal population of B-cells. The Ph+ persisted, but the monosomy 7 had disappeared. The same two BCR/Abl mRNA transcripts were found at relapse as at presentation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an AML simultaneously expressing BCR/Abl transcripts from both the minor and major BCR.

Absence of molecular rearrangement of 11q23 identifies a group of infants with a good prognosis.","['Hilden, J M', 'Kersey, J H']","['Hilden JM', 'Kersey JH']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199409049668 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Jul;14(3-4):189-95. doi: 10.3109/10428199409049668.,"['AF-4', 'MLL']",['CA49721/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],62,,,,,,,,,,,,

The commonest cytogenetic abnormalities are trisomy 12 and deletions or translocations of the long arm of chromosome 13 usually involving band q14. The genetic consequences of trisomy 12 are unknown but structural abnormalities of chromosome 13q14 frequently involve hetero or homozygous loss of a region distal to the retinoblastoma gene which may be the site of a tumour suppressor gene. Trisomy 12 or loss of one copy of the retinoblastoma gene have been detected by fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) in interphase cells of patients with a normal karyotype. By combining FISH with immunophenotyping, it has been found that trisomy 12 occurs in only 30 to 40% of the malignant clone, suggesting that it is a secondary event in leukaemogenesis. Trisomy 12 is strongly associated with atypical lymphocyte morphology in patients with otherwise typical CLL. Complex karyotypic abnormalities, a high percentage of abnormal metaphases and trisomy 12 but not structural abnormalities of chromosome 13 are associated with a poor prognosis at all stages of the disease. Mutations or deletions of the P53 gene are found in 10 to 15% of patients with advanced CLL and correlate with resistance to treatment and poor survival.","['Oscier, D G']",['Oscier DG'],"['Department of Haematology, Royal Bournemouth Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,['0 (Mitogens)'],IM,,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Metaphase/genetics', 'Mitogens/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0268-960X(05)80013-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0268-960x(05)80013-x [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 1994 Jun;8(2):88-97. doi: 10.1016/s0268-960x(05)80013-x.,,,72,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early experience suggested that autografting in blastic transformation could prolong survival and, as with allogeneic transplantation, the use of autografting was then gradually extended to the chronic phase of the disease. Autografting techniques have been modified in recent years to exploit the presence of putative normal residual haemopoietic cells in the marrow of patients with CML. These include in vitro manipulations of marrow cells such as 10 day culture, purging with chemotherapeutic and other agents, and in vivo approaches such as collecting peripheral blood progenitor cells for autografting in the early recovery phase following high dose chemotherapy. Despite these advances, no large clinical trials have been carried out to address the question of whether autografting in CML extends the duration of chronic phase or prolongs survival. Therefore for the present autografting for CML must still be regarded as experimental, but interest in this approach continues since for the majority of patients allogeneic transplantation is not currently possible.","[""O'Brien, S G"", 'Goldman, J M']","[""O'Brien SG"", 'Goldman JM']","['Haematology Department, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,,IM,,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0268-960X(05)80009-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0268-960x(05)80009-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 1994 Jun;8(2):63-9. doi: 10.1016/s0268-960x(05)80009-8.,,,54,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten pairs each consisting of one patient with thrombocytopenia following chemotherapy and one healthy platelet apheresis donor were examined. The platelet concentrates stored in the LE-2 bag were collected with a Fresenius AS 104 cell separator and those stored in the PL 732 with a Fenwal CS 3000. RESULTS: The separation efficiency of both cell separators was similar; the mean yields were 3.37 +/- 0.83 x 10(11) platelets in 274 +/- 26 ml for the AS 104 and 3.87 +/- 1.31 x 10(11) platelets in 318 +/- 22 ml for the CS 3000 (mean +/- SD). Storage for 5 days did not influence the platelet count significantly. The platelet loss due to filtration was 16 and 13%, respectively. The mean platelet volume obtained with both systems was reduced from a mean of 8.4 fl immediately after harvesting to 7.6 fl after storage (p < 0.0001) and to 7.3 fl after filtration (p = 0.001). The established corrected count increments (CCI) and the pre- and posttransfusion platelet counts were satisfactory and comparable for the 2 systems tested. The mean CCI of the AS 104-LE-2 system was 14.5 1 h and 7.4 x 10(9) platelets 24 h after transfusion, the mean CCI of the CS 3000-PL 732 system was 12.5 and 5.2 x 10(9) platelets, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Single-donor apheresis concentrates with a large platelet content may be stored in the new LE-2 polyolefin container for up to 5 days and used in clinical transfusion.","['Arseniev, L', 'Weisswange, T', 'Neumann, H J', 'Stangel, W']","['Arseniev L', 'Weisswange T', 'Neumann HJ', 'Stangel W']","['Blutbank, Immunhamatologie, Transfusionsmedizin, Medizinische Hochschule, Hannover.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Infusionsther Transfusionsmed,Infusionstherapie und Transfusionsmedizin,9209406,"['0 (Polyenes)', '83136-87-2 (PL 732)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Blood Preservation/*instrumentation', 'Blood Volume', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/*therapy', 'Platelet Count', 'Platelet Transfusion/*instrumentation', 'Plateletpheresis/*instrumentation', '*Polyenes', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood/chemically induced/*therapy']",,1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000222987 [doi]'],ppublish,Infusionsther Transfusionsmed. 1994 Aug;21(4):274-7. doi: 10.1159/000222987.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The distribution of three fucosylated antigens [Lewis X (Le(x)), sialyl Lewis X (sLex) and VIM2] was investigated among nine human leukaemia cell lines by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. As expected, all myeloid cell lines were positively stained by antibodies against these three fucosylated antigens. Unexpectedly, two T-lymphocytic cell lines (CCRF-CEM and MOLT4) were found to express Le(x) and VIM2, and the plasma, B-cell line, RPMI 8226, expressed all three fucosylated antigens. Enzymatic and RNA analyses [Northern blot and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)] were used to evaluate possible control points in the biosynthetic pathway for Le(x) and sLex. beta 1,4 Galactosyltransferase (beta 1,4GalT, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the core oligosaccharide of the three fucosylated antigens) activity and the corresponding mRNA were found in all of the leukaemia cell lines, regardless of whether or not they expressed the fucosylated antigens. In contrast, alpha 1,3 fucosyltransferase (GDP-fucose:beta-D-N-acetylglucosaminide 3-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase; alpha 1,3FT) activity and the corresponding mRNA were found only in those cell lines expressing fucosylated antigens. Based on RNA analysis, acceptor specificity and N-ethylmaleimide inhibition studies, it was concluded that all of the cell lines expressing fucosylated antigens contained alpha 1,3FTIV (myeloid alpha 1,3FT). This appeared to be the major alpha 1,3FT in the myeloid and T-lymphocytic cell lines. Interestingly, even though both types of cell lines expressed the same alpha 1,3FT, only the myeloid cell lines expressed sLex, whereas all of the myeloid and T-lymphocytic cell lines expressed a structural analogue of sLex (i.e. VIM2). In contrast to the myeloid and T-cell lines, RPMI 8226 cells contained more than one fucosyltransferase activity. Acceptor specificity analysis demonstrated that this cell line contains alpha 1,3 and alpha 1,4FTs. Among the fucosyltransferases expressed by RPMI 8226, alpha 1,3FTIV accounted for only a small amount of the total activity. The results of this study demonstrate that fucosylated antigens, which are generally considered to be myeloid specific antigens, are also expressed by lymphocytic leukaemia cell lines, and that the types of fucosylated antigens and fucosyltransferases expressed in these cell lines vary.","['Robinson, N E', 'de Vries, T', 'Davis, R E', 'Stults, C L', 'Watson, S R', 'van den Eijnden, D H', 'Macher, B A']","['Robinson NE', 'de Vries T', 'Davis RE', 'Stults CL', 'Watson SR', 'van den Eijnden DH', 'Macher BA']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, San Francisco State University, CA 94132.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Glycobiology,Glycobiology,9104124,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sialyl Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (VIM-2 determinant)', '28RYY2IV3F (Fucose)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Fucosyltransferases)']",IM,,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fucose/*metabolism', 'Fucosyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lewis X Antigen/analysis/chemistry/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligosaccharides/analysis/chemistry/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Sialyl Lewis X Antigen', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/glycob/4.3.317 [doi]'],ppublish,Glycobiology. 1994 Jun;4(3):317-26. doi: 10.1093/glycob/4.3.317.,,['CA32826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In general, only the products of the latter enzyme have been isolated from tissues and structurally characterized. Among the GlcNAc beta 1-3-R glycosphingolipids, only lactotrioasylceramide (Lc3Cer, the initial product in the biosynthesis of neolacto glycosphingolipids) has been isolated and structurally characterized. Longer-chain glycosphingolipids with a terminal GlcNAc-beta 1-3-R structure are considered to be intermediates in the synthesis of complex neolacto glycosphingolipids. We have detected a series of GlcNAc beta 1-3-R glycosphingolipids in extracts obtained from human leukocytes isolated from patients with leukaemia using a monoclonal antibody (TE5) which specifically recognizes these compounds. The structures of three of these compounds purified from chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML) cells have been determined using a combination of enzymatic, immunostaining and chemical methods.

The inhibition was more prominent when LC were cocultured directly with KM-101 cells than when LC were cultured separate from the KM-101 cell layer via membrane filtration, or when LC-CM was added to KM-101 cells or LTBMC. LC-CM also exerted an inhibitory effect on the ability of LTBMC adherent cells to bind CFU-C. Furthermore, LC-CM inhibited the growth and survival of early and late CFU-C, but not the growth of LC.

DESIGN: Two-phase, open sequential study involving prospective patient monitoring and retrospective health record review. SETTING: Tertiary care teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Fifty-seven patients (35 preprotocol, 22 postprotocol) who received acyclovir for HSV prophylaxis during an 18-month study period. INTERVENTIONS: An acyclovir HSV prophylaxis protocol was developed and implemented. Under this protocol, all HSV immunoglobulin G-seropositive hematology patients received an acyclovir regimen of 125 mg/m2 i.v. q6h or 600 mg p.o. q6h (if tolerated) from day -5 to day 30. Regimens not matching protocol were modified by pharmacists in conjunction with the prescriber. All treatment courses were followed daily by pharmacists to modify dosage according to renal function and assess appropriateness of the i.v. route. Tablets, capsules, or suspensions were promoted if the patient was considered tolerant of the oral route. MAIN OUTCOME PARAMETERS: Outcome parameters included (1) incidence of parenteral, oral, or combined therapy; (2) total prophylactic acyclovir dose per patient; (3) mean prophylactic acyclovir daily dose; (4) mean duration of acyclovir prophylaxis; and (5) HSV reactivation rate. RESULTS: Following implementation of the protocol, the mean total i.v. acyclovir dose per patient decreased from 20.1 g (range 3.6-109.5) to 11.7 g (range 1.0-43.0; p = 0.1162). The mean cumulative oral dose increased from 12.1 g (range 0.4-70.0) to 33.1 g (range 2.4-93.6; p = 0.0007). Mean duration of therapy increased from 27.6 to 33.5 days (p = 0.23). The mean duration of oral therapy increased from 10.5 days (+/- SD 10.9) to 17.2 days (+/- SD 12.1) (p = 0.034). The appropriateness of use of the i.v. dosage form increased from 53 to 88 percent of treatment days (p = 0.013). No difference in HSV reactivation rate was observed when comparing patients prior to and following protocol implementation. A drug acquisition savings of $1112.00 (CDN) per patient was realized. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a standardized HSV acyclovir prophylaxis protocol has resulted in significant drug acquisition cost savings without an apparent negative impact on patient outcome.","['Rayani, S A', 'Nimmo, C J', 'Frighetto, L', 'Martinusen, S M', 'Nickoloff, D M', 'Reece, D E', 'Jewesson, P J']","['Rayani SA', 'Nimmo CJ', 'Frighetto L', 'Martinusen SM', 'Nickoloff DM', 'Reece DE', 'Jewesson PJ']","['Department of Pharmacy, Vancouver General Hospital, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,['X4HES1O11F (Acyclovir)'],IM,,"['Acyclovir/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'British Columbia', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Drug Costs', 'Female', 'Herpes Simplex/*prevention & control', 'Hospitals, Teaching', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/106002809402800705 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 1994 Jul-Aug;28(7-8):852-6. doi: 10.1177/106002809402800705.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More than 40 cases have been reported, mainly in Japan, although information concerning the disorder was limited to individual case reports. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: To clarify the clinicopathological and laboratory features, we reviewed 41 cases. RESULTS: All patients were Japanese and the male-to-female ratio was 1:0.6. The onset ages ranged from 20 to 62 years, with a mean and median of 37 and 37 years. A superficial lymphadenopathy was detected in 58% (22/38), and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia was found in 93% (38/41). No cases were associated with any apparent underlying diseases. The course was chronic without spontaneous remission. Four patients died, 3 of whom succumbed to leukemia, respiratory failure or renal failure, respectively.

Staurosporine, a highly potent, nonspecific inhibitor of PKC (20-50 nM), uniquely potentiated ara-C-related degradation of DNA to oligonucleosomal fragments in both cell lines (i.e., 2- to 3-fold), but was ineffective when given alone at these concentrations. In contrast, co-administration of the nonspecific PKC inhibitor H7 and two highly selective PKC inhibitors, calphostin C and chelerythrine, also increased the extent of DNA fragmentation observed in ara-C-treated cells, but these effects were evident only at inhibitor concentrations that were by themselves sufficient to induce DNA damage. Agarose gel electrophoresis demonstrated that cells co-exposed to staurosporine and ara-C exhibited considerably more pronounced internucleosomal DNA cleavage than did cells exposed to ara-C alone; moreover, this effect was suppressed by Zn2+ (1 mM) and the permeant Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (50 microM). Potentiation of ara-C-related DNA fragmentation by subeffective concentrations of staurosporine was accompanied by a pronounced increase in the morphological features characteristic of apoptosis. A synergistic interaction between staurosporine and ara-C with respect to inhibition of clonogenicity in both HL-60 and U937 cells was demonstrated by median dose-effect analysis. The actions of staurosporine did not result from enhanced ara-C metabolism, as preincubation of cells with concentrations of this agent that potentiated ara-C actions (e.g., 20-50 nM) did not increase intracellular levels of the lethal metabolite ara-CTP. Lastly, preexposure of HL-60 and U937 cells to staurosporine did not block ara-C-mediated upregulation of c-jun, an oncogene whose increased expression has been temporally associated with ara-C-induced apoptosis. Together, these findings indicate that staurosporine exhibits a unique pattern of potentiation of ara-C-related apoptosis in human myeloid leukemias, and provide a rationale for exploring the antileukemic potential of this combination regimen.","['Grant, S', 'Turner, A J', 'Bartimole, T M', 'Nelms, P A', 'Joe, V C', 'Jarvis, W D']","['Grant S', 'Turner AJ', 'Bartimole TM', 'Nelms PA', 'Joe VC', 'Jarvis WD']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298-0230.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genes, jun/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Staurosporine', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1994;6(2):87-99.,['c-jun'],"['CA-09564-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-63753-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

ANC1 was previously identified in a screen for mutations that enhance the defect caused by a mutation in the actin gene. Here, we show that anc1-1 and anc1 delta 1::HIS3 (gene deletion) mutants exhibit a novel combination of defects in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and the localization of Spa2p, a protein implicated in polarity development and cytokinesis. Morphological abnormalities exhibited by anc1 mutants include failure to form a mating projection in response to alpha-factor and development of swollen or elongated cell shapes during proliferation. These morphological aberrations correlate with cytoskeletal defects that were also observed. These phenotypes demonstrate that Anc1p is important for actin function and for the functions of other proteins involved in morphogenesis. In further support of these roles for Anc1p, the anc1 delta 1::HIS3 mutation was found to be synthetically lethal in combination with a null mutation in SLA1, a gene that is important for membrane cytoskeleton function. Surprisingly, Anc1p was found to be a nuclear protein and to have sequence similarity to the human proteins ENL and AF-9. These human proteins are implicated in the development of a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemias, acute myeloid leukemias, and lymphomas. Our findings suggest that changes in the functions or organization of actin filaments might contribute to the establishment of the neoplastic state for these leukemias and lymphomas.","['Welch, M D', 'Drubin, D G']","['Welch MD', 'Drubin DG']","['Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California at Berkeley 94720.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Pheromones)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (TAF14 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Transcription Factor TFIID)', '61194-02-3 (Mating Factor)']",IM,,"['Actins/genetics/physiology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Polarity/genetics/physiology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cytoskeleton/physiology', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Fungal Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Genes, Fungal', 'Genes, Lethal', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Mating Factor', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Pheromones/pharmacology', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/growth & development/*physiology', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Transcription Factor TFIID']",PMC301078,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1091/mbc.5.6.617 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 1994 Jun;5(6):617-32. doi: 10.1091/mbc.5.6.617.,['ANC1'],['GM-42759/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/Z26040'],,,,

The combination of drug uptake in malignant tissues and selective delivery of laser-generated light provides effective therapy, with efficient tumor cytotoxicity and minimal normal tissue damage. There have been few studies of the effects of photoactivated photosensitizers on the host immune response. Since immunity is important in the control of tumor growth and spread, we have examined, in our laboratory, the effects of photoactivated phthalocyanines on the antitumor immune response. Immunosuppressed and normal mice bearing the MS-2 fibrosarcoma treated with 5 mg/kg of aluminum disulfonated phthalocyanine (AIS2Pc) and then the tumor mass exposed to laser light (100 mW/cm2 x 10 min) or treated with surgical excision of the tumor survived indefinitely, with no difference between the different groups. The survivors, tumor-free 100 days after the treatment modalities described above, were rechallenged with the parental MS-2. Some groups of surviving animals were immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide before the injection of the tumor. Resistance to rechallenge was evidenced only in normal surviving animals cured by PDT, while the immunodepressed surviving animals and animals cured by surgery died of tumor. Finally, mice, cured by PDT and tumor-free, rechallenged with L1210 and P388 murine leukemias did not survive.

Therefore, we transduced the mouse ESb T lymphoma with the bacterial lacZ gene, which allowed us to follow metastasis at the single cell level. Intradermal primary tumor growth of lacZ transduced ESbL cells (L-CI.5s) comprised three phases: an initial expansion phase (day 0 to 9, increase from 0 to 8 mm, tumor diameter), a plateau phase (day 9 to 20, constant diameter of 8 mm and necrosis), and a second expansion phase (day 20 to 30, increase from 8 to 15 mm). Liver metastasis could already be detected at day 3 and maintained at that level until day 23, where exponential expansion started. A distinct mosaic-like metastasis pattern developed, with preferential localization of tumor cells to the periportal areas of the liver in immunocompetent animals. In contrast, in immunocompromised mice, primary tumor growth and metastasis were progressive and metastasis appeared as diffuse or focal/clustered. Healthy animals surviving a tumor cell inoculum of a variant cell ESbL-CI.5) with a reduced metastatic potential carried low levels of possibly dormant tumor cells in the bone marrow. Thus, this study showed that host immunocompetence determines to a large extent kinetics and load of spontaneous liver metastases and even influences the pattern and localization of disseminated lymphoma cells.","['Kruger, A', 'Umansky, V', 'Rocha, M', 'Hacker, H J', 'Schirrmacher, V', 'von Hoegen, P']","['Kruger A', 'Umansky V', 'Rocha M', 'Hacker HJ', 'Schirrmacher V', 'von Hoegen P']","['Tumor Immunology Program, German Cancer Research Centre, Heidelberg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Liver Neoplasms/*secondary', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Nude', '*Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Survival Analysis', 'beta-Galactosidase']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71336-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Nov 1;84(9):3166-74.,['lacZ'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Northern blot analysis showed that the level of MDM2 gene expression was low in normal human B-cells, whereas 17 of the patients (28.3%) with B-CLL or NHL had more than 10-fold higher levels of MDM2 gene expression than that observed in normal B cells. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed MDM2 overexpression at the cellular protein level.

Moreover, MDM2 overexpression was found significantly more frequently in patients at advanced clinical stages. Simultaneous analysis of p53 gene mutation showed that three patients had both MDM2 gene overexpression and p53 gene mutation.

Mutations were detected by single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of exons 4 to 10 of the P53 gene, and confirmed by direct sequencing. A p53 mutation was found in 16 of 107 (15%) AML, 20 of 182 (11%) MDS, and 9 of 81 (11%) CLL tested. In AML, three of nine (33%) mutated cases and 66 of 81 (81%) nonmutated cases treated with intensive chemotherapy achieved complete remission (CR) (P = .005) and none of five mutated cases and three of six nonmutated cases treated by low-dose Ara C achieved CR or partial remission (PR) (P = .06). Median actuarial survival was 2.5 months in mutated cases, and 15 months in nonmutated cases (P < 10(-5)). In the MDS patients who received chemotherapy (intensive chemotherapy or low-dose Ara C), 1 of 13 (8%) mutated cases and 23 of 38 (60%) nonmutated cases achieved CR or PR (P = .004), and median actuarial survival was 2.5 and 13.5 months, respectively (P < 10(-5)). In all MDS cases (treated and untreated), the survival difference between mutated cases and nonmutated cases was also highly significant. In CLL, 1 of 8 (12.5%) mutated cases treated by chemotherapy (chlorambucil and/or CHOP and/or fludarabine) responded, as compared with 29 of 36 (80%) nonmutated cases (P = .02). In all CLL cases, survival from p53 analysis was significantly shorter in mutated cases (median 7 months) than in nonmutated cases (median not reached) (P < 10(-5)). In 35 of the 45 mutated cases of AML, MDS, and CLL, cytogenetic analysis or SSCP and sequence findings showed loss of the nonmutated P53 allele. Our findings show that p53 mutations are a strong prognostic indicator of response to chemotherapy and survival in AML, MDS, and CLL. The usual association of p53 mutations to loss of the nonmutated P53 allele, in those disorders, ie, to absence of normal p53 in tumor cells, suggests that p53 mutations could induce drug resistance, at least in part, by interfering with normal apoptotic pathways in tumor cells.","['Wattel, E', 'Preudhomme, C', 'Hecquet, B', 'Vanrumbeke, M', 'Quesnel, B', 'Dervite, I', 'Morel, P', 'Fenaux, P']","['Wattel E', 'Preudhomme C', 'Hecquet B', 'Vanrumbeke M', 'Quesnel B', 'Dervite I', 'Morel P', 'Fenaux P']","['Service des Maladies du Sang, CHU.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71334-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Nov 1;84(9):3148-57.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further assess the clinical implications of increased IL-1 beta expression in CML, we analyzed IL-1 beta and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) levels in leukocyte lysates from a series of CML patients and from normal volunteers. Both IL-1 beta and IL-1RA were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), with the lower limits of sensitivity of the assays being 20 pg/mL and 6.5 pg/mL, respectively. The median IL-1 beta level in the 81 CML patients tested was higher (115.8 pg/2.4 x 10(7) cells; range, 0 to 2,000 pg/2.4 x 10(7) cells) than the median level in 25 control samples (10.8 pg/2.4 x 10(7) cells; range, 0 to 95.5 pg/2.4 x 10(7) cells) (P < .01). IL-1 beta was bioactive, as demonstrated with a bioassay based on cytotoxicity to a melanoma cell line (A375). For survival analysis, elevated IL-1 beta levels were defined as those exceeding the mean + 2 SD of normal levels (83 pg/2.4 x 10(7) cells). The survival of the 44 patients with elevated IL-1 beta levels was significantly shorter than that of those who had low IL-1 beta levels (median, 44 v 58 months; P = .049 by Wilcoxon-Gehan method). An association between IL-1 beta and CML prognostic criteria shows that IL-1 beta levels were significantly higher in patients in accelerated/blastic crisis phases of the disease (364.0 pg/2.4 x 10(7) cells) compared with patients in chronic phase (102.0 pg/2.4 x 10(7) cells) (P < .01), and that high IL-1 beta levels correlated with increased blasts in the marrow and peripheral blood (P < .01). In contrast, while IL-1RA levels did not differ between chronic-phase CML patients (median, 471.7 pg/2.4 x 10(5)) and healthy volunteers (median, 454.4 pg/2.4 x 10(5)), patients with accelerated/blast crisis disease had significantly lower levels of IL-1RA (median, 218.7 pg/2.4 x 10(5); P = .03).

Results and conclusions of the multicenter trial ALL-BFM 86.,3122-33,"In trial ALL-BFM 86, the largest multicenter trial of the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) study group for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), treatment response was used as an overriding stratification factor for the first time. In the previous trial ALL-BFM 83, the in vivo response to initial prednisone treatment was evaluated prospectively. A blast cell count of > or = 1,000/microL peripheral blood after a 7-day exposure to prednisone and one intrathecal dose of methotrexate (MTX) identified 10% of the patients as having a significantly worse prognosis. In trial ALL-BFM 86 patients with > or = 1,000/microL blood blasts on day 8 were included in an experimental branch EG. Patients with < 1,000/microL blood blasts on day 8 were stratified by their leukemic cell burden into two branches, Standard Risk Group (SRG) and Risk Group (RG). SRG patients received an eight-drug induction followed by consolidation protocol M (6-mercaptopurine, high-dose [HD] MTX 4 x 5 g/m2) and maintenance. RG patients were treated with an additional eight-drug reinduction element. For EG patients protocol M was replaced by protocol E (prednisone, HD-MTX, HD-cytarabine, ifosfamide, mitoxantrone). All patients received intrathecal MTX therapy; only those of branches RG and EG received cranial irradiation. In branch RG, patients were randomized to receive or not to receive late intensification (prednisone, vindesine, teniposide, ifosfamide, HD-cytarabine) in the 13th month. During the trial reinduction therapy was introduced in branch SRG, because in the follow-up of trial ALL-BFM 83 the randomized low-risk patients receiving reinduction did significantly better. Nine hundred ninety-eight evaluable patients were enrolled, 28.6% in SRG, 61.1% in RG, 10.3% in EG. At a median follow-up of 5.0 (range 3.4 to 6.9) years, the estimated 6-year event-free survival was 72% +/- 2% for the study population, 58% +/- 5% in branch SRG for the first 110 patients without reinduction therapy, 87% +/- 3% for the next 175 patients with reinduction therapy, 75% +/- 2% in branch RG, and 48% +/- 5% in branch EG. Late intensification did not significantly affect treatment outcome of RG patients; however, only 23% of the eligible patients were randomized. Prednisone poor response remained a negative prognostic parameter despite intensified therapy. The results confirmed the benefit of intensive reinduction therapy even for low-risk patients. The strategy of induction, consolidation, and intensive reinduction may offer roughly 75% of unselected childhood ALL patients the chance for an event-free survival.","['Reiter, A', 'Schrappe, M', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Sauter, S', 'Henze, G', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Lampert, F', 'Havers, W', 'Niethammer, D']","['Reiter A', 'Schrappe M', 'Ludwig WD', 'Hiddemann W', 'Sauter S', 'Henze G', 'Zimmermann M', 'Lampert F', 'Havers W', 'Niethammer D', 'et al.']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71331-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Nov 1;84(9):3122-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The U-A40 and U-A200 cells, derived by selection of U-A10 cells, showed high levels of both MRP and MDR1 expression. None of the drug-resistant cell lines showed MRP or MDR1 gene amplification as judged by Southern blot analysis. U-A10 cells exhibited minimal decreased net accumulation of anthracycline, whereas U-A40 and U-A200 cells showed more significantly decreased drug accumulation as compared with U-937 cells. Subcellular anthracycline accumulation in U-937 cells as determined by fluorescence microscopy showed daunorubicin fluorescence predominately in the nucleus. However, the drug-resistant cell lines showed minimal nuclear drug accumulation with marked redistribution of drug into a vesicular compartment. Treatment with sodium azide/2-deoxyglucose, 2,4-dinitrophenol, or monensin, but not verapamil, abolished the vesicular accumulation. These studies in doxorubicin-selected U-937 cells indicate that induction of MRP overexpression occurs before that for the MDR1 gene. In addition, the drug-resistant cells possess an energy-dependent redistribution of anthracyclines into a nonnuclear vesicular compartment.","['Slapak, C A', 'Mizunuma, N', 'Kufe, D W']","['Slapak CA', 'Mizunuma N', 'Kufe DW']","['Division of Cancer Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71330-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Nov 1;84(9):3113-21.,"['MDR1', 'MRP']","['CA-01613/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31483/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

No further p53 mutations were identified in 18 unpaired diagnosis T-ALL samples. This is the first report of a p53 mutation in T-ALL at diagnosis. p53 mutations in relapsed T-ALL were clinically relevant. Patients with p53 mutations experience a shorter duration of survival than those patients without p53 mutations. Additionally, patients with p53 mutations were significantly less likely to have achieved a complete second remission from reinduction therapy than those patients without p53 mutations and experience a shorter duration of survival from relapse even when a second reinduction is obtained. Though primarily identified only at relapse, p53 mutations were also associated with a decreased duration of first remission and overall decrease in survival from diagnosis. Patients with p53 mutations had a 3.8-fold increase in risk of death than those patients without p53 mutations. These findings suggest that p53 mutation is associated with poor clinical outcome that is characterized by (1) a shortened duration of survival after first relapse; (2) a reduced response to reinduction therapy; (3) a shortened duration of first remission; and, hence, (4) an overall decreased duration of survival and increased risk of death.","['Diccianni, M B', 'Yu, J', 'Hsiao, M', 'Mukherjee, S', 'Shao, L E', 'Yu, A L']","['Diccianni MB', 'Yu J', 'Hsiao M', 'Mukherjee S', 'Shao LE', 'Yu AL']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Diego.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71329-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Nov 1;84(9):3105-12.,['p53'],"['FDR000377/FD/FDA HHS/United States', 'MO1 RR00827/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U10CA28439/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequent ligation of CD23 by specific monoclonal antibody (MoAb) induces substantial morphologic and functional modifications in these cells. In the present study, we investigated the role of CD23 in the proliferation and the maturation of leukemic cells from AML patients or the U937 cell line. CD23+ cell treatment with CD23 MoAb inhibited the proliferation of leukemic cells. This correlated with their terminal differentiation after 7 to 9 days incubation because they (1) definitively lost their growth capacity; (2) adhered to culture flasks and became monocyte/macrophage-like; and (3) expressed mature monocyte markers including nonspecific esterases. Intracellular mechanism of this antitumoral effect was then analyzed in U937 cells. Induction of high-density surface CD23 expression by IL-4 or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor coincided with a transient decrease of U937 cell proliferation. CD23 ligation during this low-proliferative phase induced a rapid activation of L-arginine-dependent pathway and the intracellular accumulation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Induction of these early messengers was followed by the activation of nuclear factor-kB transcription factor and the modulation of proto-oncogene expression by U937 cells. Whereas U937 cell treatment with IL-4 decreased c-fos/c-jun expression, CD23 MoAb reinduced c-fos/c-jun and promoted the expression of cell maturation-associated proto-oncogenes junB and c-fms, during the first 24 hours. Both IL-4 and CD23 MoAb downregulated the expression of c-myb. CD23 ligation also induced the production of TNF alpha by U937 cells. Inhibitors of cAMP and nitric oxide reversed CD23-mediated modification in U937 cells. These data evidence the ability of CD23 surface antigen to mediate terminal differentiation of early leukemic myelomonocytic cells.","['Ouaaz, F', 'Sola, B', 'Issaly, F', 'Kolb, J P', 'Davi, F', 'Mentz, F', 'Arock, M', 'Paul-Eugene, N', 'Korner, M', 'Dugas, B']","['Ouaaz F', 'Sola B', 'Issaly F', 'Kolb JP', 'Davi F', 'Mentz F', 'Arock M', 'Paul-Eugene N', 'Korner M', 'Dugas B', 'et al.']","['Molecular Immuno-Hematology Group, Pitie-Salpe-triere Hospital, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Genes, fos', 'Genes, jun', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Receptors, IgE/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71328-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Nov 1;84(9):3095-104.,"['CSF-1', 'Egr-1', 'Egr-2', 'c-fms', 'c-fos', 'c-jun', 'c-myb', 'c-myc', 'junB']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because HTLV-I integrates its provirus randomly into host chromosomal DNA, monoclonal integration of HTLV-I provirus indicates the clonal proliferation of HTLV-I-infected cells. Therefore, demonstration of clonality of HTLV-I proviral DNA is essential to diagnosis of ATL. Southern blot analysis was used for this purpose. We developed the novel method using inverse polymerase chain reaction (IPCR) to detect the clonality of HTLV-I proviral DNA. This method identified the clonality in all ATL cases. Diagnosis could be made within 3 days using this method. It enabled us to detect specifically the presence of minimal numbers of ATL cells with high sensitivity. It also identified the monoclonal or oligoclonal proliferations of HTLV-I-infected cells in HTLV-I carriers and the intermediate state, in which no clonality could be shown by conventional Southern blot analyses. This finding indicated that even HTLV-I carriers had monoclonal proliferation of HTLV-I-infected cells without any symptoms. This novel method is shown to be useful for the diagnosis of ATL and provides information on the natural course of HTLV-I infection.","['Takemoto, S', 'Matsuoka, M', 'Yamaguchi, K', 'Takatsuki, K']","['Takemoto S', 'Matsuoka M', 'Yamaguchi K', 'Takatsuki K']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*diagnosis/microbiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Proviruses', 'Virus Integration']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71326-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Nov 1;84(9):3080-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to examine relative levels of WT1 gene expression (defined in K562 cells as 1.00) in 45 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 22 with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 6 with acute mixed lineage leukemia (AMLL), 23 with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and 24 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Significant levels of WT1 gene were expressed in all leukemia patients and for CML the levels increased as the clinical phase progressed. In striking contrast with acute leukemia, the levels of WT1 gene expression for NHL were significantly lower or even undetectable. Clear correlation was observed between the relative levels of WT1 gene expression (< 0.6 v > or = 0.6) and the prognosis for acute leukemia (AML, ALL, and AMLL). Patients with less than 0.6 levels had significantly higher rates of complete remission (CR), disease-free survival, and overall survival than those with > or = 0.6 levels, whereas CR could not be induced in any of the 7 patients with acute leukemia having greater than 1.0 levels of WT1 gene expression. The quantitation of the WT1 gene expression made it possible to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute leukemia regardless of the presence or absence of tumor-specific DNA markers. Continuous monitoring of the WT1 mRNA was performed for 9 patients with acute leukemia. In 4 patients, MRD was detected 2 to 8 months before clinical relapse became apparent. In 2 other patients, the WT1 mRNA gradually increased after discontinuation of chemotherapy. No MRD was detected in the remaining 3 patients with AML who received intensive induction and consolidation therapy. Simultaneous monitoring of MRD by RT-PCR using primers for specific DNA markers in 3 patients (2 AML-M3 with PML/RAR alpha, and 1 AML-M2 with AML1/ETO) among these 9 patients detected MRD comparable with that obtained from quantitation of WT1 gene expression. In a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia, the limits of leukemic cell detection by RT-PCR using either WT1 or promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor-alpha gene primers were 10(-3) to 10(-4) and 10(-4) for bone marrow, and 10(-5) and 10(-4) for peripheral blood, respectively.

In contrast with normal DC development, further advancement of mono-DC-CFU and terminal DC maturation from the leukemic cells were dependent on the addition of interleukin-6. Functional and phenotypic analysis showed that the capacity to differentiate was maintained fully in the DC compartment, but only partially in the monocyte compartment, as judged by the lack of CD14 surface expression. Cells found at intermediate stages of DC development were potent stimulators of a mixed leukocyte reaction, a function usually attributed to mature DCs. As previously shown for normal DC development, antibodies to TNF alpha and GM-CSF blocked proliferative responses and DC growth.

Although no measurable (L929 bioassay) levels of TNF alpha were found in serum of mice who had received TNF alpha transduced marrow, the supernatant of 10(6) unstimulated BM cells obtained 12 days after marrow infusion was found to have 7 pg of TNF alpha compared with 1.8 pg in nontransduced marrow. Mice that had received TNF alpha transduced marrow showed no side effects suggestive of systemic TNF alpha release, and cellularity of the TNF alpha-transduced marrow was not different from control mice that had received unmanipulated marrow or cells transduced with the neomycin resistance gene only. The studies suggest that gene transfer of immune-activating cytokines into hematopoietic cells could be used as a means to achieve their temporary local production early after transplantation by cells located in the BM.","['Kuhr, T', 'Dougherty, G J', 'Klingemann, H G']","['Kuhr T', 'Dougherty GJ', 'Klingemann HG']","['Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of British Columbia, Terry Fox Laboratory, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Biological Availability', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*administration & dosage/genetics']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71311-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Nov 1;84(9):2966-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the origin (donor v recipient genotype) of human mast cells (MCs) was analyzed in a patient who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The patient presented with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (French-American-British classification, M2) arising from refractory anemia with excess of blast cells and bone marrow (BM) mastocytosis. Transplantation was performed in chemotherapy-induced complete remission. On days 88, 126, 198, and 494 after BMT, mast cells were enriched to homogeneity from bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM MNCs) by cell sorting for CD117+/CD34- cells. Purified mast cell populations were CD117(c-kit)+ (> 95%), CD34- (< 1%), CD3- (< 1%), CD14- (< 1%), and virtually free of contaminating cells as assessed by Giemsa staining. The genotype of MCs was analyzed after amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) region within intron 40 of the von Willebrand factor (vWF) gene. Unexpectedly, on days 88 and 126 after BMT, sorted MCs displayed recipient genotype as shown by vWF.VNTR-PCR. However, on days 198 and 494, PCR analysis showed a switch to donor genotype in isolated mast cells. Peripheral blood (PB) and BM MNC as well as highly enriched (sorted) CD3+ T cells (PB, BM), CD4+ helper T cells (PB), CD8+ T cells (PB), CD19+ B cells (PB), CD14+ monocytes (PB, BM), and CD34+ precursor cells (BM) showed donor genotype throughout the observation period. Together, these results provide evidence that human MCs developed in vivo from transplanted hematopoietic stem cells. Engraftment and in vivo differentiation of MCs from early hematopoietic progenitor cells may be a prolonged process.","['Fodinger, M', 'Fritsch, G', 'Winkler, K', 'Emminger, W', 'Mitterbauer, G', 'Gadner, H', 'Valent, P', 'Mannhalter, C']","['Fodinger M', 'Fritsch G', 'Winkler K', 'Emminger W', 'Mitterbauer G', 'Gadner H', 'Valent P', 'Mannhalter C']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (von Willebrand Factor)'],IM,,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*pathology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology', 'Mast Cells/*cytology', 'Minisatellite Repeats', 'von Willebrand Factor/genetics']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71309-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Nov 1;84(9):2954-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-four patients (43%) had evidence of exposure to HCV; 30 of these were anti-HCV+. Of the 23 patients who were positive for both anti-HCV and HCV-RNA, 16 (69%) had a moderate increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity without clinical signs of liver disease. Fourteen patients were seronegative despite the presence of HCV-RNA in the serum. The proportion of different HCV genotypes was not significantly different from other anti-HCV+ patient groups. Although half of the patients with genotype III had normal ALT value, patients with normal ALT levels were represented in all genotype groups. Our study documents the prevalence of HCV infection in childhood ALL survivors, which is responsible for the majority of cases of non-B chronic liver disease in these patients. Whereas serologic screening identifies over 70% of patients with ongoing HCV infection, real HCV infection may be present even in the absence of a detectable humoral immune response to the virus. Based on this observation, determination of HCV-RNA by PCR should be recommended in patients in prolonged remission even if they test negative on serological assay. Normal ALT levels do not exclude the presence of HCV infection because the values were repeatedly normal in over half of our viremic patients.","['Arico, M', 'Maggiore, G', 'Silini, E', 'Bono, F', 'Vigano, C', 'Cerino, A', 'Mondelli, M U']","['Arico M', 'Maggiore G', 'Silini E', 'Bono F', 'Vigano C', 'Cerino A', 'Mondelli MU']","['Dipartimento di Patologia Umana, Universita di Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hepacivirus/genetics', 'Hepatitis C/*complications/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/therapy', 'RNA, Viral/analysis']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71304-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Nov 1;84(9):2919-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To clarify the mechanisms that lead to the activation of IL-6 gene in HTLV-I-infected cells, we first studied the regulatory regions in the IL-6 gene transcription by transfection of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmids containing the IL-6 promoter. When transfected into HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines MT-2 and HUT-102, IL-6 promoter/CAT plasmids were strongly activated without any stimulation. By deletion analysis of 5' upstream region of IL-6 promoter, the DNA region between -73 and -59 bp from the transcription start site of IL-6 gene was important in the expression of IL-6/CAT activities in HTLV-I-infected cells. This region contains nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B binding site. The site-directed mutation of the kappa B motif in IL-6/CAT plasmid resulted in the complete abrogation of IL-6 promoter activity in these cells. Furthermore, when IL-6 promoter/CAT plasmid was introduced into an HTLV-I-uninfected T-cell line, Jurkat, IL-6 promoter activity was silent in the basal level, but strongly increased by the cotransfection with an HTLV-I tax expression plasmid. However, tax expression plasmid showed no transactivation activity, when kappa B site was mutated in IL-6 promoter/CAT plasmid. We found that the IL-6 kappa B site specifically formed a complex with NF-kappa B-containing nuclear extracts from MT-2 and HUT-102 cells. Finally, transfection of HTLV-I tax into Jurkat cells resulted in induction of specific binding of nuclear extracts to the NF-kappa B sequence. These results strongly suggest that HTLV-I tax gene may transactivate IL-6 gene through kappa B site in HTLV-I-positive T-cell lines and activation of NF-kappa B may be crucial in HTLV-I-induced IL-6 gene activation in ATL.","['Mori, N', 'Shirakawa, F', 'Shimizu, H', 'Murakami, S', 'Oda, S', 'Yamamoto, K', 'Eto, S']","['Mori N', 'Shirakawa F', 'Shimizu H', 'Murakami S', 'Oda S', 'Yamamoto K', 'Eto S']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/physiology', 'Genes, pX', 'HTLV-I Infections/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/physiopathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'T-Lymphocytes/microbiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71302-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Nov 1;84(9):2904-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared the effect of butyrate and other short-chain carboxylic acids in transient expression studies with K562 cells using an expression plasmid bearing a luciferase reporter gene driven by the normal human A gamma-globin gene promoter. Butyrate (4 carbons) increased the activity of the human A gamma-globin gene promoter up to 123 times. Marked augmentation of the normal gamma-promoter activity was also noted with 5-carbon valeric acid (up to 394 times) and 3-carbon propionic acid (up to 129 times). The branched isobutyric acid as well as phenylacetate showed less ability to increase promoter activity. Addition of the tandemly repeated AP-1/NF-E2 (AP) enhancer sequences from hypersensitive site 2 (HS2) of the locus control region (LCR) increased gamma-promoter activity up to 24 times. Addition of a nearby 16-bp conserved motif (CM) in HS2 (Safaya S, Rieder RF, Blood 78:146a, 1992 [abstr, suppl 1]) to the AP-containing plasmid construct further increased gamma-promoter activity. In the presence of butyrate, the plasmid bearing both the AP and CM sequences showed gene expression up to 477 times greater than that of the basal gamma-promoter-driven luciferase plasmid in the absence of inducer. A plasmid bearing the herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter was also tested and gene expression was markedly increased by the same organic acids. MEL cells responded to butyrate, valerate, and propionate with induction of hemoglobin synthesis. Responses to isobutyrate and 6-carbon caproate required higher concentrations of the compounds. Thus, other short-chain organic acids as well as butyrate increase gamma-promoter activity in the transient expression system, and this activity can be further augmented by incorporating LCR elements into the expression vector.

Induction of differentiation along the monocytic pathway by phorbol ester results in an approximately twofold rise in enzyme activity and a parallel increase in the rate of 75Se incorporation into immunoprecipitable GSH-Px protein. Induction along the granulocytic pathway by dimethyl formamide (DMF) results in similar changes in steady-state enzyme levels and rates of GSH-Px protein synthesis. Steady-state levels of GSH-Px gene transcripts also increase more than twofold, approximately in parallel with the enzyme levels. Nuclear run-on transcription assays of GSH-Px mRNA synthesis show ratios of induced to uninduced transcript levels of 2.24 and 1.59 with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) induction and DMF, respectively, in HL-60 cells, and ratios of 1.34 and 3.46 with PMA and DMF, respectively, in PLB-985 cells. Half lives of GSH-Px mRNA are unchanged or slightly shorter after differentiation of HL-60 cells, and slightly longer after induction of PLB-985. Overall, the present studies show that GSH-Px activity rises during in vitro-induced monocytic or granulocytic differentiation of myeloid cell lines and that the increased expression of the cellular GSH-Px gene occurs through complex mechanisms that include transcriptional up-regulation. This pattern contrasts with the nearly complete cotranslational regulation of GSH-Px expression by exogenous selenium.","['Shen, Q', 'Chada, S', 'Whitney, C', 'Newburger, P E']","['Shen Q', 'Chada S', 'Whitney C', 'Newburger PE']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester 01655.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8696NH0Y2X (Dimethylformamide)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (CYBB protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dimethylformamide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Granulocytes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Monocytes', 'NADPH Oxidase 2', '*NADPH Oxidases', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phagocytes/*enzymology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)70501-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Dec 1;84(11):3902-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The NFKB2 gene represents a candidate proto-oncogene, since it has been found to be involved in a chromosomal translocation t(10;14)(q24;q32) in one case of B-cell lymphoma and in gene rearrangements in various types of lymphoid malignancies. To elucidate the structural and functional consequences of NFKB2 rearrangements, we report the molecular characterization of three novel rearranged NFKB2 genes in lymphoid tumors. In one case of multiple myeloma (MM), cloning and sequencing analysis of reciprocal breakpoint sites showed that they occurred within intron 15 of the NFKB2 gene and led to the complete deletion of the 3' portion of the gene coding for the ankyrin domain. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis showed that the novel regions involved in the NFKB2 rearrangement originated from chromosome 7q34, thus implying the occurrence of a t(7;10)(q34;q24) reciprocal chromosomal translocation. In one case of T-cell cutaneous lymphoma (CTCL) and in one of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), NFKB2 rearrangements occurred, respectively, within exons 18 and 20 of the gene and involved recombinations with distinct regions of chromosome 10q24. Molecular analysis suggested that these rearrangements may occur as a consequence of small internal chromosomal deletions. In both of these cases, the rearrangements led to specific carboxy-terminal truncations of NFKB2 generating abnormal transcripts that coded for proteins lacking portions of the ankyrin domain. These proteins localize in the nucleus, suggesting their constitutive activation in vivo. Overall, our results indicate that NFKB2 rearrangements in lymphoid neoplasia may occur by heterogeneous mechanisms, including internal chromosomal deletion or chromosomal translocation. The common consequence of these rearrangements appears to be the deletion of 3' sequences of NFKB2 leading to the production of carboxy-truncated constitutively nuclear proteins that may be involved in tumorigenesis.","['Migliazza, A', 'Lombardi, L', 'Rocchi, M', 'Trecca, D', 'Chang, C C', 'Antonacci, R', 'Fracchiolla, N S', 'Ciana, P', 'Maiolo, A T', 'Neri, A']","['Migliazza A', 'Lombardi L', 'Rocchi M', 'Trecca D', 'Chang CC', 'Antonacci R', 'Fracchiolla NS', 'Ciana P', 'Maiolo AT', 'Neri A']","['Laboratorio di Ematologia Sperimentale e Genetica Molecolare, Istituto di Scienze Mediche, Universita di Milano, Ospedale Maggiore IRCCS, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Ankyrins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Ankyrins/genetics', 'Base Sequence', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*ultrastructure', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Sequence Alignment', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Skin Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Subcellular Fractions/chemistry', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)70495-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Dec 1;84(11):3850-60.,"['NFKB2', 'lyt-10', 'rel']",,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/X78673', 'GENBANK/X78674', 'GENBANK/X78675', 'GENBANK/X78676']",,,,

However, the proper management of patients who present with or develop leukocytosis during remission induction with all-trans RA is not established, nor is there a clear relation between leukocytosis and the development of the retinoic acid syndrome. We reviewed the course of our patients who underwent induction with all-trans RA to identify potential factors that might predict for the development of this syndrome and to identify which patients, if any, might specifically benefit from additional treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Seventy-eight courses of all-trans RA therapy were administered to patients with a molecular diagnosis of APL. Initial and peak leukocyte counts, their rate of rise, leukocyte count criteria developed in Europe, and cell surface marker expression were all analyzed relative to subsequent development of both the RA syndrome as well as all causes of early mortality. The outcome of patients who received specific treatment for retinoid-induced leukocytosis was also examined. No factor was found to consistently predict for the development of the RA syndrome. Although the occurrence of the syndrome was positively associated with the peak value of the peripheral blood leukocyte count (P = .001), neither the initial leukocyte count nor the rate of rise in leukocyte counts on days preceding onset of the syndrome were sufficiently well-correlated to be clinically useful (P = .21). The leukocyte count criteria developed in Europe had a sensitivity of 62%, a specificity of 69%, and a positive predictive value that ranged from only 44% to 72%. However, we unexpectedly found that basal expression of CD13 (aminopeptidase N), a cell surface enzyme previously linked to tumor cell invasion and an inferior outcome in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, was highly associated with both development of the syndrome (P < .05) as well as an elevated leukocyte count (P = .006). Neither low-dose chemotherapy nor leukapheresis prevented development of the syndrome nor ameliorated its effects. In fact, 9 of 11 patients who received these interventions sustained fatal or near-fatal events, most of which were due to hemorrhage. However, early treatment with a short-course of high-dose corticosteroids halted progression of the syndrome in most cases. Finally, we found that expression of the type ""A"" isoform of PML/RAR-alpha (also known as bcr3 or ""short"") was associated with a significantly shorter duration of relapse-free and overall survival (P = .005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Vahdat, L', 'Maslak, P', 'Miller, W H Jr', 'Eardley, A', 'Heller, G', 'Scheinberg, D A', 'Warrell, R P Jr']","['Vahdat L', 'Maslak P', 'Miller WH Jr', 'Eardley A', 'Heller G', 'Scheinberg DA', 'Warrell RP Jr']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'CD13 Antigens/*biosynthesis', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology/mortality', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*mortality/pathology', 'Leukocytosis/*chemically induced', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Pulmonary Edema/*chemically induced/mortality/prevention & control', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Syndrome', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*adverse effects/therapeutic use']",,1994/12/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)70494-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Dec 1;84(11):3843-9.,,"['CA-55349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-57645/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'FD-R-000764/FD/FDA HHS/United States']",42,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tissue immunophenotyping was performed in 24 cases, 6 of which had frozen tissue available, and the results were compared with the membrane immunophenotype of the circulating villous lymphocytes and cells extracted from spleen and lymph nodes. In the spleen, SLVL is characterized by involvement of the white pulp follicles, which may be surrounded or replaced by the lymphoma cells. In the red pulp, the cells form small nodules and infiltrate diffusely with sinusoidal invasion. The cytologic appearance of the neoplastic cells varies from a resemblance to small mantle-zone--like lymphocytes to that of marginal-zone cells and there are scattered blast forms. In involved lymph nodes, the infiltrate again centers on the follicles that are usually replaced, but occasionally show preservation of follicle centers; sinuses are often preserved. The tissue immunophenotype is similar to that of marginal-zone B cells.

To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms that control tal-1 expression, we investigated tal-1 chromatin structure in erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines and in T-cell lines either with or without tal-1 rearrangements. Tal-1 transcription was shown to be monoallelic in Jurkat, a T-cell line that expresses tal-1 in the absence of apparent genomic alteration of the locus. Methylation studies indicated that the tal-15' GC-rich region behaves like a CpG island, hypomethylated in normal cells, and methylated de novo on transcriptionally inactive alleles in established cell lines. Five major DNase-I hypersensitive sites (HS) were mapped in the tal-1 locus. HS I, IV, and V were exclusively observed in the erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines that express tal-1 from the promoters 1a and 1b. HS II was weak in hematopoietic cell lines, absent in Hela, and greatly enhanced in Jurkat, suggesting that this region might be implicated in the cis-activation of tal-1 promoter 1b in this cell line. HS III was weak in HEL and Jurkat, and greatly enhanced in DU528, a T-cell line that bears a t (1;14) and initiates tal-1 transcription within exon 4.

The median follow-up period was 64 months (range, 3 to 126). There were 84 acute myeloblastic leukemias (AMLs) and 41 acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). At time of autologous BM transplantation (ABMT); 64 AMLs were in first complete remission (CR1), and 20 were in second CR (CR2); 35 ALL were in CR1, and 6 were in CR2. The median age of the patients was 33 years (range, 16 to 55). The median interval between achieving CR and autografting was 5 months (range, 1.3 to 23). The pretransplant regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) and total body irradiation. All patients were grafted with autologous BM treated in vitro with mafosfamide used at levels individually adjusted in 95 patients and at a standard dose in 30 patients. The initial richness in granulomacrophagic progenitors (CFU-GM) of the harvested BMs was 5.16 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg (range, 0.55 to 33). After mafosfamide purging, the residual CFU-GM number was 0.021 x 10(4)/kg (range, 0 to 1.78). The probability of successful engraftment was significantly higher and the time to engraftment was significantly shorter in ALL. Of 33 patients grafted with BM containing no residual CFU-GM, those with AML (n = 22) had platelet recoveries that were significantly longer than those for AML patients receiving BM with residual CFU-GM. At 8 years, patients autografted in CR1 for AML and ALL had a leukemia-free survival (LFS) of 58% and 56%, respectively, with a relapse incidence (RI) of 25% and 37%, respectively. Patients autografted in CR2 for AML had an LFS of 34% and an RI of 48% at 5 years. The incidence of late relapses was significantly higher in ALLs. By multivariate analysis, four factors were found to influence favorably engraftment in addition to a diagnosis of ALL, a younger age, ABMT performed in CR1, the adjusted dose technique of purging, and a shorter interval from CR to ABMT. Two factors were correlated with a better outcome. (1) The LFS was significantly higher and the transplant-related mortality significantly lower in patients who received richer BM. (2) The RI was significantly lower in patients autografted within 150 days from CR.

Arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4, n-6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5, n-3) were the most potent inhibitors of proliferation in a dose-dependent way. Retinoic acid (RA) was used as a positive control. Inhibitors of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase or addition of antioxidants did not influence the effect of EPA or AA on cell proliferation. Increased capacity to generate superoxide anions after phorbol ester treatment and a reduced serglycin messenger RNA level in cells treated with AA or EPA indicated that these fatty acids induced differentiation in HL-60 cells similar to that induced by RA. However, down-regulation of the c-myc mRNA level, also typical for differentiation with RA in HL-60 cells, was not observed in cells incubated with AA or EPA. Flow cytometric analyses showed that in cultures incubated with AA or EPA, the proportion of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle increased. Similar effects were observed with RA. By flow cytometry and light scatter analyses it could be shown that AA made 8% of the cells apoptotic and 7% necrotic. The corresponding numbers were 21% and 10% for RA-treated cells, and 19% and 32% for EPA-treated cells. The present study shows that AA and EPA reduce the proliferation rate of HL-60 cells. This is mediated by mechanisms independent of eicosanoids or lipid peroxidation products and is due to effects both on apoptosis/necrosis and cell differentiation.","['Finstad, H S', 'Kolset, S O', 'Holme, J A', 'Wiger, R', 'Farrants, A K', 'Blomhoff, R', 'Drevon, C A']","['Finstad HS', 'Kolset SO', 'Holme JA', 'Wiger R', 'Farrants AK', 'Blomhoff R', 'Drevon CA']","['Section for Dietary Research, Institute of Nutrition Research, University of Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)', '0 (serglycin)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '7BO8G1BYQU (Masoprocol)', 'AAN7QOV9EA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arachidonic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Eicosapentaenoic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids/pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Granulocytes', 'Humans', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Masoprocol/pharmacology', 'Monocytes', 'Necrosis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Proteoglycans/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Respiratory Burst/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)70489-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Dec 1;84(11):3799-809.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, in contrast to infantile acute leukemia, in adults with AML-M4 and AML-M5, MLL rearrangements do not identify a subgroup of patients with different clinical features or prognosis.","['Bower, M', 'Parry, P', 'Carter, M', 'Lillington, D M', 'Amess, J', 'Lister, T A', 'Evans, G', 'Young, B D']","['Bower M', 'Parry P', 'Carter M', 'Lillington DM', 'Amess J', 'Lister TA', 'Evans G', 'Young BD']","['Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Centre for Human Genome Research, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, San Diego, CA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/ultrastructure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Prognosis', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transcription Factors']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)70485-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Dec 1;84(11):3776-80.,"['ALL-1', 'HXR', 'Htrx-1', 'MLL']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results were highly variable: 6.8% failed to grow any stromal cells (group I); 42.5% either failed to grow to confluency or appeared to have a decreased number of adipocytes and/or macrophages (group II); and 52.8% appeared as normal confluent cultures with fibroblasts, adipocytes, and macrophages (group III). Analyses of patient data suggested that group I patients had a longer disease duration and poorer survival (P = .07). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis of cytokine production was performed on 20 of the normal-appearing AA LTMCs and 12 LTMCs established from normal donors. Significant differences between the AA and control groups were apparent for macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF). The most dramatic differences observed were elevated levels of MIP-1 alpha and GM-CSF and decreased levels of IL-1ra, particularly after IL-1 alpha stimulation. In contrast, IL-1 alpha stimulation of AA LTMCs produced levels of IL-6, LIF, and G-CSF comparable with those of controls. These data suggest that defects exist within the microenvironment of some AA marrows. Whether the majority of these defects are the cause or consequence of aplasia is not clear. However, we speculate that some of these abnormalities may contribute to the maintenance of the hypoplastic state and, in extreme cases, prevent engraftment of donor marrow.","['Holmberg, L A', 'Seidel, K', 'Leisenring, W', 'Torok-Storb, B']","['Holmberg LA', 'Seidel K', 'Leisenring W', 'Torok-Storb B']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Monokines)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Adipose Tissue/metabolism/*pathology', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*pathology/therapy', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Connective Tissue/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Graft Survival', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins', 'Monokines/biosynthesis/physiology']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)70499-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Dec 1;84(11):3685-90.,,"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK34431/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently found a novel hyperphosphorylated 80-kD protein tyrosine kinase, p80, in a human Ki-1 lymphoma with this translocation. Subsequent cDNA cloning showed that p80 is a fusion protein of two different genes on chromosome 2p23 and 5q35, the novel tyrosine kinase gene and nucleophosmin gene, respectively. In this study, we intended to detect p80 on lymphoma tissues with immunologic methods. Thus, we developed rabbit polyclonal antibody using a synthetic peptide corresponding to a part of its kinase domain. The antibody (anti-p80) immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted p80 specifically from AMS3. Then, to examine whether t(2;5)(p23;q35) was present on biopsied lymphomas, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) covering the fusion junction of p80 mRNA was performed. Among 10 Ki-1 lymphomas and 10 additional lymphomas other than the Ki-1 lymphomas, expression of p80 mRNA was detected in three cases exclusively. When these 20 cases and additional 30 lymphomas were immunostained with anti-p80, positive staining was noted exclusively in the three cases found by PCR to have harbored the p80 mRNA. Thus, the present immunostaining, as well as PCR, was shown to be efficient for detecting lymphomas producing this chimeric protein/mRNA.","['Shiota, M', 'Fujimoto, J', 'Takenaga, M', 'Satoh, H', 'Ichinohasama, R', 'Abe, M', 'Nakano, M', 'Yamamoto, T', 'Mori, S']","['Shiota M', 'Fujimoto J', 'Takenaga M', 'Satoh H', 'Ichinohasama R', 'Abe M', 'Nakano M', 'Yamamoto T', 'Mori S']","['Department of Pathology and Oncology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (LTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Ltk protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*ultrastructure', 'Cross Reactions', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/immunology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics/immunology', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)70467-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Dec 1;84(11):3648-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 3 samples collected from 3 patients 4 months or more posttransplantation, residual recipient cells were detected in the polymorphonuclear cell fraction but were present at a lower level or were undetectable in the lymphocyte fraction. These cells are of hematopoietic origin because they were detected at equivalent levels in whole blood and in B and T lymphocytes sorted with antibody-coated magnetic beads. They were not detected in samples collected more than 15 months posttransplantation for 6 of 7 patients. The persistence of residual recipient cells within 1 year posttransplantation is not restricted to male patients receiving a transplant from a female donor because they were also detected in 2 female patients using an allele-specific amplification method for the thyroid peroxydase gene that also has a high sensitivity (0.01%).

Thus, the analysis was performed during and after high-dose chemotherapy (from day -6 to day -1), at the time of SCT (day 0), and thereafter (through day +17). Despite the heterogeneity of these patients and their conditioning regimens, a consistent kinetic pattern was observed for all analyzed cytokines. Particularly, (1) SCF serum concentration did not significantly fluctuate. (2) High levels of LIF (approximately 250 to 450 pg/mL) before chemotherapy rapidly declined to markedly lower concentrations (approximately 10 ng/mL) starting from day -1 through day +17; (3) conversely, IL-3 level was low before treatment, sharply increased during chemotherapy, and rapidly returned to base-line level after SCT. Hypothetically, the sharp LIF decrease and IL-3 increase during chemotherapy may underlie the induction of stem cell cycling and differentiation caused by hematopoietic ablation. Furthermore, (4) IL-6 concentration was low before and immediately after chemotherapy, but increased starting from day +5, peaked at day +6 through 9 and then declined to baseline level from day +10 onward; (5) a strictly similar pattern was consistently observed for both G-CSF and IL-8 levels, in agreement with our previous studies. It is relevant that peak IL-6, G-CSF, and IL-8 concentrations were directly correlated to peak neutrophil numbers in the recovery phase, thus suggesting an important role for these cytokines in granulocyte rescue; in line with this interpretation, hematologic patients undergoing PBSCT (10 of 15) exhibited higher peaks of IL-6, G-CSF, and IL-8 and a more pronounced increase of neutrophil/platelet number than did hematologic cases undergoing BMSCT (5 of 15). Altogether, these studies indicate a coordinate pattern of cytokine release during hematopoietic ablation/recovery after chemotherapy and autologous SCT, the fluctuations of LIF and IL-3 levels during chemotherapy are seemingly related to stem cell recruitment, whereas the post-SCT increase of IL-6, G-CSF, and IL-8 may underlie the neutrophil recovery.","['Testa, U', 'Martucci, R', 'Rutella, S', 'Scambia, G', 'Sica, S', 'Benedetti Panici, P', 'Pierelli, L', 'Menichella, G', 'Leone, G', 'Mancuso, S']","['Testa U', 'Martucci R', 'Rutella S', 'Scambia G', 'Sica S', 'Benedetti Panici P', 'Pierelli L', 'Menichella G', 'Leone G', 'Mancuso S', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cytokines/*blood', 'Female', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*blood', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hodgkin Disease/blood/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/blood/*therapy', 'Platelet Count', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,1994/11/15 00:00,1994/11/15 00:01,['1994/11/15 00:00'],"['1994/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73935-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Nov 15;84(10):3532-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied 20 patients and one cell line whose cells contained 12p13 translocations and/or 12p deletions using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with phage, plasmid, and cosmid probes that we previously mapped and ordered on 12p12-13. FISH analysis showed that the 12p13 translocation breakpoints were clustered between two cosmids, D12S133 and D12S142, in 11 of 12 patients and in one cell line. FISH analysis of 11 patients with deletions demonstrated that the deletions were interstitial rather than terminal and that the distal part of 12p12, including the GDI-D4 gene and D12S54 marker, was deleted in all 11 patients. Moreover, FISH analysis showed that cells from 3 of these patients contained both a del(12p) and a 12p13 translocation and that the affected regions of these rearrangements appeared to overlap. We identified three yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones that span all the 12p13 translocation breakpoints mapped between D12S133 and D12S142. They have inserts of human DNA between 1.39 and 1.67 Mb. Because the region between D12S133 and D12S142 also represents the telomeric border of the smallest commonly deleted region of 12p, we also studied patients with a del(12p) using these YACs. The smallest YAC, 964c10, was deleted in 8 of 9 patients studied.

The results were expressed by the drug concentration required for 50% inhibition of cell viability (IC50). The cytotoxicity of chlorambucil (CLB) was compared with that of fludarabine and the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitors, camptothecin, 9-aminocamptothecin, 10,11-methylenedioxy-20(S)-camptothecin (10,11-MDC) and 9-amino-10,11-methylenedioxy-20(S)-campthothecin (9-A-10,11-MDC), and topotecan. Considerable heterogeneity in sensitivity to CLB was observed, with a median IC50 of 40.5 mumol/L in untreated patients. B-CLL cells from patients treated with CLB had a significantly higher median IC50 of 86.0 mumol/L (P < .01). Untreated as well as CLB-treated patients were divided into two subsets. For the purpose of this study, B-CLL lymphocytes with an IC50 CLB of less than 61.0 mumol/L were designated as ""sensitive"" and those with an IC50 CLB of > or = 61.0 mumol/L were designated as ""resistant."" After baseline assays, 15 untreated patients received CLB; after treatment, the IC50 increased in B-CLL lymphocytes from 13 of 15 patients. The response to CLB treatment, determined by its effect on the absolute lymphocyte count and by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group clinical criteria, was significantly better in patients whose lymphocytes had an IC50 CLB of less than 61.0 mumol/L before therapy (P < .01). B-CLL lymphocytes also had a variable degree of sensitivity in vitro to each of the other drugs. There was significant cross-resistance between CLB and fludarabine (P < 0.01). Whereas only 29% of CLB-resistant B-lymphocyte specimens obtained from individual patients were sensitive to fludarabine in vitro, 52% and 67% of CLB-resistant lymphocyte samples were sensitive to 10,11-MDC and 9-A-10,11-MDC, respectively. We have previously reported that p53 gene mutations were associated with aggressive B-CLL and a poor prognosis. B lymphocytes from seven patients with these mutations were resistant to CLB, and five of six were resistant to fludarabine. Lymphocytes from four of seven were resistant to 10,11-MDC, and three of four were resistant to 9-A-10,11-MDC. This study implies that the MTT assay may be useful in identifying subsets of CLL patients resistant to conventional chemotherapy. However, definitive conclusions can not be drawn in view of the small number of patients studied prospectively. In addition, these results suggest the potential of camptothecin-based therapy for patients unresponsive to standard treatment.","['Silber, R', 'Degar, B', 'Costin, D', 'Newcomb, E W', 'Mani, M', 'Rosenberg, C R', 'Morse, L', 'Drygas, J C', 'Canellakis, Z N', 'Potmesil, M']","['Silber R', 'Degar B', 'Costin D', 'Newcomb EW', 'Mani M', 'Rosenberg CR', 'Morse L', 'Drygas JC', 'Canellakis ZN', 'Potmesil M']","['Department of Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, New York.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Camptothecin/analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorambucil/*therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/toxicity']",,1994/11/15 00:00,1994/11/15 00:01,['1994/11/15 00:00'],"['1994/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73924-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Nov 15;84(10):3440-6.,,"['CA 50529/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 54484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 56129/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

NF1 encodes a protein called neurofibromin, which accelerates guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis on the p21ras (Ras) family of signaling proteins. We used a genetic approach to test the hypothesis that NF1 negatively regulates myeloid cell growth through its effect on Ras. This model predicts that, if RAS mutations and loss of NF1 function deregulate myeloid growth by the same biomechanical mechanism, then activating RAS mutations will be restricted to children with malignant myeloid disorders who do not have NF-1. We studied 71 children, including 28 with bone marrow monosomy 7 syndrome (Mo7), 35with juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JCML), three with other forms of preleukemia, and five with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), for activating mutations of KRAS and NRAS. The incidence of RAS mutations was 21% (12 of 55) in patients without NF-1 and 0% (zero of 16) in children with NF-1 (P = .04). Among the 55 patients who did not have NF-1, we found RAS mutations in four of 27 with Mo 7, in five of 24 with JCML, in two of 3 with AML, and in a patient with myeloproliferative syndrome (MPS). These data from primary human cancer cells provide strong genetic evidence that NF1 limits the growth of myeloid cells by regulating Ras.","['Kalra, R', 'Paderanga, D C', 'Olson, K', 'Shannon, K M']","['Kalra R', 'Paderanga DC', 'Olson K', 'Shannon KM']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Neurofibromin 1)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Codon/genetics', 'Exons', '*Genes, Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neurofibromin 1', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', '*Point Mutation', 'Preleukemia/*genetics', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Signal Transduction']",,1994/11/15 00:00,1994/11/15 00:01,['1994/11/15 00:00'],"['1994/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73923-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Nov 15;84(10):3435-9.,['NF1'],"['3M01 RR01271-13S1/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 07636/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In view of these findings, we conducted an escalating dose trial of 2-CdA in adult patients with relapsed or resistant AML. Thirty-six patients who had received extensive prior therapy were treated at 9 dose levels of 2-CdA at daily doses ranging from 5 to 21 mg/m2 for 5 days. 2-CdA eliminated leukemic blasts from the peripheral blood in 32 of 36 cases; however, bone marrow hypoplasia was seen only at daily dose levels > or = 15 mg/m2. We observed a total of 3 complete remissions: 1 at the 15 mg/m2/d dose level and 2 at the 21 mg/m2/d dose level; these responses persisted for 3, 2, and 3 months, respectively. Although prolonged myelosuppression would have been dose-limiting at 21 mg/m2/d for 5 days, the most important adverse effect was the development of a sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy. This reaction, whose onset was substantially delayed after completion of drug treatment, was observed in 2 of 5 patients at the 19 mg/m2/d level and in 4 of 4 evaluable patients at the 21 mg/m2/d level. Pathologically, this process was characterized by axonal degeneration and secondary demyelination. Other side effects included reactivation of a posttransplant Epstein-Barr virus-related lymphoma in 1 patient and tumor lysis syndrome. We conclude that the maximally tolerable dose of 2-CdA in adult patients (17 mg/m2/d for 5 days) in approximately twofold in excess of that previously reported in children and that the limiting toxic effect is a degenerative neuropathic disorder. We confirm that this drug has definite activity in AML, but the magnitude of this effect needs to be determined in larger numbers of patients who have received less extensive therapy. This agent deserves further evaluation in patients with both AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia at these higher doses and perhaps as part of a preparative regimen for patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation.","['Vahdat, L', 'Wong, E T', 'Wile, M J', 'Rosenblum, M', 'Foley, K M', 'Warrell, R P Jr']","['Vahdat L', 'Wong ET', 'Wile MJ', 'Rosenblum M', 'Foley KM', 'Warrell RP Jr']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Axons/drug effects/pathology', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Motor Neurons/*drug effects/pathology', 'Neural Conduction/*drug effects', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/*chemically induced/pathology/physiopathology', 'Sural Nerve/drug effects/pathology']",,1994/11/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/11/15 00:00'],"['1994/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73922-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Nov 15;84(10):3429-34.,,['CA-05826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although liver-directed retroviral transduction can result in long-term gene expression in vivo, the low level of protein production has limited its clinical application. We reasoned that the insertion of liver-specific promoters into retroviral vectors would increase gene expression in vivo. The 347-bp human alpha 1-antitrypsin (hAAT), the 810-bp murine albumin (mAIb), the 490-bp rat phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (rPECK), and the 596-bp rat liver fatty acid binding protein promoters were inserted into a Moloney murine leukemia retroviral backbone containing the hAAT reporter gene. Vectors that produced appropriately sized RNA and hAAT protein in vitro were tested in vivo by transducing regenerating rat livers. Long-term serum expression of the hAAT reporter gene was normalized to retroviral transduction efficiency as determined by using a polymerase chain reaction-based assay of genomic DNA from transduced rat livers. The hAAT, mAIb, and rPEPCK promoters were, respectively, 35-, 8-, and 0.02-fold as strong as the previously studied constitutive Pol-II promoter.

These studies suggested that occult TL has an adverse prognostic significance unless retrieval chemotherapy is given and that performance of testicular biopsy at completion of maintenance chemotherapy is not contributory to prolongation of disease-free survival for males with ALL because the treatment employing testicular radiation plus retrieval chemotherapy for both occult TL and isolated overt TL after off-therapy is similarly very effective.","['Koizumi, S', 'Shimizu, H', 'Asami, K', 'Utsumi, J', 'Ariyoshi, N', 'Watanabe, A', 'Ninomiya, T', 'Takaue, Y', 'Matsumoto, K', 'Nishikawa, K']","['Koizumi S', 'Shimizu H', 'Asami K', 'Utsumi J', 'Ariyoshi N', 'Watanabe A', 'Ninomiya T', 'Takaue Y', 'Matsumoto K', 'Nishikawa K', 'et al.']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kanazawa University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Remission Induction', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Testis/*pathology']",,1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1994 Aug;60(2):137-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These metabolic derangements may be mediated in large part through endogenous host proteins produced in response to various pathological stimuli. Differentiation factor/leukaemia inhibitory factor (D-factor) is a cytokine whose functions overlap those of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), IL-6 and IL-1. Recombinant murine D-factor produced a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of heparin-releasable LPL activity in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Although 2-10 fold less potent than recombinant murine TNF, D-factor inhibited LPL activity at concentrations of 1-10 ng/ml. When added together, D-factor and TNF produced a synergistic inhibition of LPL activity. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) was 100-fold less potent than D-factor; 0.1 ng/ml of D-factor or 10 ng/ml of IL-6 caused a 50% inhibition of LPL activity. D-factor and TNF increased IL-6 production in 3T3-L1 cells. Ten ng/ml of D-factor or 1.0 ng/ml of TNF stimulated the release of < 1 ng/ml of IL-6 and inhibited LPL activity to 11 +/- 3% and 3 +/- 2% of control, respectively, whereas 50 ng/ml of recombinant IL-6 was required to decrease LPL activity to 24 +/- 19% of control. TNF produced a marked decrease in LPL mRNA, whereas D-factor had minimal or no effect at doses which inhibited LPL activity almost completely. Western blot analysis of cell extracts showed that TNF caused a greater decrease in LPL protein production than D-factor.2+ with TNF, may contribute to the manifestations of cachexia.","['Berg, M', 'Fraker, D L', 'Alexander, H R']","['Berg M', 'Fraker DL', 'Alexander HR']","['Surgical Metabolism Section, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Adipocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cachexia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/*drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['1043-4666(94)90067-1 [pii]', '10.1016/1043-4666(94)90067-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1994 Jul;6(4):425-32. doi: 10.1016/1043-4666(94)90067-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TGF-beta 1 has been shown to play a modulatory role in haematopoiesis and immunoregulation, expressed through its ability to inhibit the activities induced by other cytokines; however, the mechanisms underlying this activity are currently unclear. The potency of this activity varies according to the selected stimulatory cytokine and we have found that the proliferation of leukaemic cell lines induced by interleukin 4 (IL-4) is particularly sensitive to inhibition by TGF-beta 1 and provides a useful model to study the mechanism of action of TGF-beta. We have previously shown that IL-4 mediated mitogenic signal transduction in human systems involves the induction of phosphatase activity leading to the dephosphorylation of an 80-kDa protein (p80). We now show that TGF-beta 1 inhibits IL-4 induced dephosphorylation of p80 in a dose responsive manner closely correlated with its ability to inhibit the biological activity of IL-4. This suggests that TGF-beta 1 is inhibiting the same protein-tyrosine-phosphatase required by IL-4 to transduce its mitogenic signal. The biochemical mechanism underlying the biological activity of TGF-beta 1 in inhibiting IL-4 bioactivity is therefore the blocking of post receptor binding signal transduction processes.","['Mire-Sluis, A R', 'Page, L', 'Wadhwa, M', 'Thorpe, R']","['Mire-Sluis AR', 'Page L', 'Wadhwa M', 'Thorpe R']","['Division of Immunobiology, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,,"['Amino Acids/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Phosphates/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['1043-4666(94)90063-9 [pii]', '10.1016/1043-4666(94)90063-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1994 Jul;6(4):389-98. doi: 10.1016/1043-4666(94)90063-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proteolytic processing of the TNF receptors was investigated in monoblastic THP-1 and promyelocytic HL-60-10 leukemic cell lines. The release of soluble forms of both receptors was rapidly stimulated by staurosporine-sensitive protein kinase C activation by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and more slowly stimulated by TNF. No receptor release was seen below a temperature of 16 degrees C. NH4Cl (10 mmol/liter) and monensin (1 mumol/liter), known to increase intracellular pH, inhibited to some extent PMA- and TNF-induced release of both TNF-R55-BP and TNF-R75-BP. The inhibitory effect of monensin might be explained by a diminished translocation of newly synthesized receptor to the plasma membrane. The weak inhibitory effect of NH4Cl on PMA-induced release of soluble receptor forms could be due to effects on a pH-sensitive compartment. PMA-induced down-regulation of receptors was not dependent on acidity as it occurred also in the presence of monensin and NH4Cl when the release of TNF-BPs is partially blocked. Dibutyryl cAMP inhibited the PMA-induced release of TNF-R55-BP but not of TNF-R75-BP in both cell lines investigated. In addition, dibutyryl cAMP alone stimulated the release of both receptors but only in THP-1 cells.

This disorder has been shown to be autosomal recessive, and is often caused by missense, nonsense, and/or frameshift mutations in the OAT gene. With the view of applying gene therapy, a Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based recombinant retrovirus vector has been constructed. The human OAT cDNA was placed under the control of the enhancer-promoter regulatory elements derived from the MoMLV long terminal repeat (LTR). The construct was transfected into the retroviral packaging cell lines GP + E - 86 and psi CRIP to produce virus particles. Supernatant from these OAT retrovirus producer cell lines were used to transduce mouse C57B1/6 embryonal fibroblasts.

In these vectors the chimeric long terminal repeat (chLTR) drives the expression of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene that is followed by an internal SV40 virus early region promoter linked to the neomycin phosphotransferase II (NEO) gene. As an initial measure of the relative promoter/enhancer strength of the chLTR vectors, the murine NIH-3T3 cell line and the human JURKAT cell lines were transfected and assayed for CAT reporter activity. Relative to the MoMLV vector, the HaMSV construct was the most active in NIH-3T3 cells whereas the SL3-3 vector displayed the greatest activity in JURKAT cells. Retroviral vector producer cell populations and cell clones were established for each chLTR vector, and all were capable of yielding high vector titers (> 10(5) G418R cfu/ml on NIH-3T3). Supernatant from these cells was used to transduce both mouse and human cell lines and primary cells. In NIH-3T3 cells and two murine fibrosarcoma cell lines, the HaMSV chLTR vector was slightly more active than the MoMLV chLTR vector. In the human HepG2 and HeLa cell lines, the MPSV chLTR vector was the most active. Data from the human JURKAT T-cell line and a T cell line derived from an ADA-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) patient demonstrate that the SL3-3 chLTR is the most active in these lymphoid cell lines. The greatest difference in the comparison of the different chLTR vectors was observed in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells, where the MoMLV vector produced up to 100 times more CAT activity than the SL3-3 vector.

Daunomycin proved to be more toxic to differentiated Friend cells than to their undifferentiated counterparts. No changes in the daunomycin uptake rates of the two cell types were detectable. Externally added catalase and desferrioxamine mesylate protected against the additional cytotoxicity of daunomycin in differentiated cells, pointing to hydrogen peroxide and iron ions as mediators of the toxic effect. Daunomycin-dependent, cyanide-insensitive oxygen consumption of control and induced cells did not differ significantly, and the rate of formation of the daunomycin semiquinone radical electron paramagnetic resonance signal was similar in both cell types, indicating that the difference in toxicity was not due to increased drug activation by plasma membrane enzymes. Differentiated cells had a lowered catalase content; the cellular iron content was shown to increase by 2.8-fold upon cell differentiation, with hemoglobin-bound iron being about 50% of the total. Altogether, the results suggest increased intracellular hydrogen peroxide generation mediated by hemoglobin, combined with a decrease in catalase activity and an increase in accessible iron, as responsible for the higher sensitivity to daunomycin shown by differentiated Friend cells.

We have proposed a mechanism to account for this phenomenon [Kindman, L. A., & Meyer, T. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 1270-1277], which hypothesized the existence of five channels, each with a different affinity for InsP3. As a direct test of this hypothesis, InsP3 binding to microsomes from RBL cells was examined under conditions similar to those used for calcium release. Scatchard analyses performed under a variety of conditions indicates the presence of high affinity (KD = 0.9 +/- 0.3 nM) and low affinity (KD = 47 +/- 5 nM) InsP3 binding sites. The low affinity sites are more prevalent, constituting 82 +/- 5% of the total. Both sites are identified in the presence and absence of MgATP. Moreover, both sites are selective for InsP3 over InsP4, through high concentrations of InsP4 displace InsP3 from each site (with inhibition constants of 16 and 267 nM InsP4, respectively). The relative abundance of the two InsP3 binding sites is Ca2+ dependent. An increase in Ca2+ from 0.1 to 0.5 microM results in the apparent conversion of a portion of the low affinity sites into high affinity sites into high affinity sites. Ca2+ (0.5 microM) also increased the KD of the low affinity InsP3 binding site.

In LPS-sensitive C57B1/6 mice, LPS doses as low as 0.01 micrograms per mouse decreased adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity by greater than 50%. In LPS-resistant C3H/HeJ mice, which do not produce cytokines in response to LPS, doses of LPS as high as 10 micrograms per mouse did not affect LPL activity in adipose tissue. In muscle of C57Bl/6 mice, LPL activity was decreased by 27% after 10 micrograms of LPS, whereas in C3H/HeJ mice there was no effect. These results indicate that the LPS-induced decrease in both adipose and muscle LPL activity is mediated by cytokines. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1, leukemia-inhibiting factor (LIF), interferon alfa, and interferon gamma all decreased adipose tissue LPL activity in intact mice. In skeletal and cardiac muscle, only IL-1 and interferon gamma decreased LPL activity, whereas TNF, LIF, and interferon alfa had no effect. Inhibition of TNF activity blocked the increase in serum triglycerides that is characteristically observed after LPS but did not affect the ability of LPS to decrease adipose tissue LPL activity. Inhibition of IL-1 activity with IL-1 receptor antagonist partially inhibited the increase in serum triglycerides; however, the ability of LPS to decrease LPL activity in either adipose or muscle tissue was not affected. These data indicate that although TNF and IL-1 play a role in mediating the increase in serum triglyceride levels, these cytokines do not play a crucial role in the inhibition of either adipose or muscle LPL activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Feingold, K R', 'Marshall, M', 'Gulli, R', 'Moser, A H', 'Grunfeld, C']","['Feingold KR', 'Marshall M', 'Gulli R', 'Moser AH', 'Grunfeld C']","['Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arterioscler Thromb,Arteriosclerosis and thrombosis : a journal of vascular biology,9101388,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Endotoxins)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Endotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/blood/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Triglycerides/blood', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1161/01.atv.14.11.1866 [doi]'],ppublish,Arterioscler Thromb. 1994 Nov;14(11):1866-72. doi: 10.1161/01.atv.14.11.1866.,,"['DK-07418/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-40990/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This protein [provisionally called recombination hotspot associated factor (ReHF-1)] was also found to bind to a similar target sequence that is present immediately at the 3' end of the human V delta 3 gene segment. In a small number of lines tested, the ReHF-1 protein was expressed in gamma delta lineage T cells and in a number of B cell precursor ALLs whose TCR delta locus has been rearranged. The molecular weight of ReHF-1 protein was determined to be approximately 30 kDa by UV cross-linking analysis. Gel filtration chromatography and sedimentation velocity centrifugation analyses indicate that the ReHF-1 protein exists as a multimeric protein in its native form. These data might suggest a possible role for this protein in the rearrangement of the TCR delta locus. Furthermore, another protein, ReHF-2, that appears to have strict sequence specificity was found to bind only to the complementary single strand of the target sequence. The interaction of these proteins with a conserved target sequence at the chromosomal breakpoint junction might suggest that they are involved in a novel enzymatic mechanism reminiscent of the general features of DNA recombination or replication events in Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae.","['Kasai, M', 'Aoki, K', 'Matsuo, Y', 'Minowada, J', 'Maziarz, R T', 'Strominger, J L']","['Kasai M', 'Aoki K', 'Matsuo Y', 'Minowada J', 'Maziarz RT', 'Strominger JL']","['Department of Immunology, National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics/*immunology', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/intimm/6.7.1017 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Immunol. 1994 Jul;6(7):1017-25. doi: 10.1093/intimm/6.7.1017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We constructed a retroviral vector for RII beta (MT-RII beta) by inserting human RII beta complementary DNA into the OT1521 retroviral vector plasmid that contains an internal mouse metallothionein-1 promoter and a neomycin resistance gene. The PA317 packaging cell line was then transfected with MT-RII beta plasmid to produce the amphotrophic stock of MT-RII beta retroviral vector. The infection with MT-RII beta and treatment with CdCl2 brought about growth arrest in HL-60 human leukemia and Ki-ras-transformed NIH 3T3 clone DT cells in monolayer culture with no sign of toxicity. The growth inhibition correlated with the expression of RII beta and accompanied changes in cell morphology; cells became flat, exhibiting enlarged cytoplasm. The growth of these cells in semisolid medium (anchorage-independent growth) was almost completely suppressed. In contrast, overexpression of the RI alpha subunit of protein kinase enhanced the cell proliferation in DT cells. The MT-RII beta-infected cells exhibited an increased sensitivity toward treatment with cAMP analogues, such as 8-Cl-cAMP and N6-benzyl-cAMP, as compared with the parental noninfected cells. In MT-RII beta HL-60 cells, N6-benzyl-cAMP treatment greatly enhanced the expression of monocytic surface markers. These results suggest that the RII beta cAMP receptor, by binding to its ligand, cAMP, acts as a tumor suppressor protein exerting growth inhibition, differentiation, and reverse transformation.","['Tortora, G', 'Budillon, A', 'Yokozaki, H', 'Clair, T', 'Pepe, S', 'Merlo, G', 'Rohlff, C', 'Cho-Chung, Y S']","['Tortora G', 'Budillon A', 'Yokozaki H', 'Clair T', 'Pepe S', 'Merlo G', 'Rohlff C', 'Cho-Chung YS']","['Cellular Biochemistry Section, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase RIIbeta Subunit)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (PRKAR2B protein, human)', '0 (Prkar2b protein, mouse)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '00BH33GNGH (Cadmium)', '23583-48-4 (8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate)', ""32115-08-5 (N(6)-benzyl-cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate)"", '9038-94-2 (Metallothionein)', 'BQ94Z7E5OR (8-chloro-cyclic adenosine monophosphate)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells', '8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Allosteric Site', 'Animals', 'Cadmium/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Cyclic AMP/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase RIIbeta Subunit', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Metallothionein/genetics', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1994 Jul;5(7):753-9.,['v-Ki-ras'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Murine myelomonocytic WEHI-3B D+ cells were transfected by electroporation with the linearized pMTJ11 plasmid and subsequently cloned in the presence of G-418. Exposure of these clones to cadmium resulted in a high level of expression of c-jun mRNA and protein, as demonstrated by Northern hybridization and Western blotting. When these clones were examined immediately after their establishment, expression of c-jun was accompanied by the appearance of a mature phenotype in many clones, as measured by the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium and by the expression of Mac-1 (CD11b), a cell surface marker on differentiated cells. Morphological changes indicative of the differentiated state were also observed by staining. These findings indicate that expression of c-jun is capable of initiating the differentiation of WEHI-3B D+ cells in the absence of an external inducer of maturation.

Stepwise logistic regression was performed to ascertain the association between the initial clinicohaematological variables and survival > or = 8 years, and a prognostic index was derived. The usefulness of both Sokal's and the new prognostic index to identify long-term survivors was assessed by calculating their positive and negative predictive accuracies, sensitivity and specificity. Median survival of the series was 45 months (range 1-255), with 784 patients (96.4%) having died and 109 (13.4%) surviving 8 years or longer. Younger age, smaller spleen, platelets < or = 600 x 10(9)/l, and lower blood blast percentage were associated with survival > or = 8 years; platelets < or = 600 x 10(9)/l and lower blood blast percentage were the predictive factors in patients 50 years old or younger.

However, the high incidence of subsequent medullary relapse in these cases strongly suggests that leukaemia is present at submicroscopic levels at the time of 'isolated' relapse. PCR analysis of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements now allows detection of leukaemia at levels as low as 0.001%. We have therefore used this technique to reassess bone marrow status at morphologically isolated relapse in 13 children with B-lineage ALL (11 with off-treatment relapses, two on treatment). In 12 of these 13 patients marrow disease was detectable by PCR at the time of this relapse--in all cases at levels below the threshold of light microscopy. Where relapse occurred off-therapy this indicated re-emergence of disease. since MRD has never been detected by PCR at this stage in patients remaining in long-term remission. In both patients who relapsed on-therapy the level of MRD at the time of relapse represented an increase on that seen in their previous marrow sample. We conclude that re-emerging bone marrow disease can be detected in most cases of 'isolated' relapse when investigated by this highly sensitive technique. Our findings at a molecular level confirm a long-held clinical suspicion and indicate that full systemic re-induction as well as local therapy is obligatory for these children.","['Goulden, N', 'Langlands, K', 'Steward, C', 'Katz, F', 'Potter, M', 'Chessells, J', 'Oakhill, A']","['Goulden N', 'Langlands K', 'Steward C', 'Katz F', 'Potter M', 'Chessells J', 'Oakhill A']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Bristol.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recurrence']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb04910.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1994 Jun;87(2):282-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb04910.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All with childhood T-ALL, except for one case expressing cytoplasmic TCR delta chain, were classified on the basis of differential expression of cytoplasmic CD3 (cCD3), TCR beta chain (cTCR beta) and surface CD3 (sCD3) into the following three groups: group I (cCD3+, cTCR beta-, sCD3-), eight cases (19.5%); group II (cCD3+, cTCR beta +, sCD3-), 23 cases (56.1%); group III (cCD3+, cTCR beta +/-, sCD3+), 10 cases (24.4%). Each group defines the stepwise maturational stage of the CD3/TCR complex along the intrathymic T-cell differentiation. Group I had the lowest initial WBC count among the three groups (P < 0.05) and showed significantly (P < 0.05) a higher event-free survival (0.75) than those of group II (0.33). There was no significant difference in both the initial WBC count and the event-free survival between groups II and III. Thus, the absence of cTCR beta in sCD3-negative T-ALL appears to be a good prognostic factor, suggesting that this classification provides a useful tool to predict the prognosis of childhood T-ALL. This is the first report, to our knowledge, studying the relationship between the expression of cytoplasmic CD3/TCR antigens and the clinical features in T-ALL.","['Inukai, T', 'Saito, M', 'Mori, T', 'Nishino, K', 'Abe, T', 'Kinoshita, A', 'Suzuki, T', 'Kurosawa, Y', 'Okazaki, T', 'Sugita, K']","['Inukai T', 'Saito M', 'Mori T', 'Nishino K', 'Abe T', 'Kinoshita A', 'Suzuki T', 'Kurosawa Y', 'Okazaki T', 'Sugita K', 'et al.']","['Department of Paediatrics, Yamanashi Medical University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytoplasm/*immunology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/classification/drug therapy/*immunology/mortality', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*analysis']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb04909.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1994 Jun;87(2):273-81. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb04909.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two other heavy metal compounds, AgNO3 and phenylmercuric acetate, caused a similar increase in TF activity. The increase was independent of protein synthesis. Other reagents tested, CdCl2, ZnCl2, NiCl2, ADP, FMLP and monocyte chemotactic factor (MCF-1), did not cause a rapid increase in functional activity, when tested under the same experimental conditions. The addition of HgCl2 to the cells causes, in a concentration-dependent manner, a 10-12-fold increase in intracellular calcium (Cai) which coincides with increase in TF activity. Calcium ionophore also caused an increase in TF activity of the U937 cells. Upon treatment with HgCl2 the cell surface of U937 cells showed a large increase in the level of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the cell surface (as measured by potentiation of the rate of activation of prothrombin by factor Xa-factor Va) but with no change in the level of TF antigen on the cell surface. We consider that the TF is present on the cell surface of the monocyte but relatively inactive towards the physiological substrate, factor X (FX), until HgCl2 causes a change in the polarity of the cell membrane exposing PS on the outer leaflet by a mechanism likely to be enhanced by the increase in intracellular calcium.","['Kaneko, H', 'Kakkar, V V', 'Scully, M F']","['Kaneko H', 'Kakkar VV', 'Scully MF']","['Thrombosis Research Institute, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['53GH7MZT1R (Mercuric Chloride)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Blood Coagulation/*drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mercuric Chloride/*pharmacology', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Thromboplastin/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb04875.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1994 May;87(1):87-93. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb04875.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed the familial aggregation of all haematological neoplasms in 4061 family members of 189 patients with various haematological neoplasms and two control groups: 955 relatives of 36 patients with non-malignant haematological disorders and 508 relatives of 33 patients with type II diabetes mellitus. Data collection included self-administered questionnaires. The odds ratio for haematological neoplasms among relatives of the index cases adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, number of relatives in the family, and degree of familial linkage in the study group versus the two control groups was 3.62 (95% confidence interval, 1.44-9.07; P < 0.01). The vast majority of the haematological neoplasms among family members did not belong to the same histopathological category as the index cases.

CdA showed high in vitro activity against samples from chronic and acute lymphocytic leukaemia and acute myelocytic leukaemia, but little or no response was observed in the solid tumour groups.

The high correlation between CdA and AraC was maintained even if the analysis was based only on the haematological tumours. The results indicate that CdA is differentially active against haematological tumours with little or no activity against solid tumours. CdA also appears highly cross resistant with AraC. If this disease-specific information is substantiated in further clinical trials and extended to other phase I-II drugs, non-clonogenic drug resistance assays such as the FMCA may become useful in new drug evaluation, and in targeting specific diagnoses and patients for phase II trials.","['Larsson, R', 'Fridborg, H', 'Liliemark, J', 'Csoka, K', 'Kristensen, J', 'de la Torre, M', 'Nygren, P']","['Larsson R', 'Fridborg H', 'Liliemark J', 'Csoka K', 'Kristensen J', 'de la Torre M', 'Nygren P']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,['47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)'],IM,,"['Adrenocortical Carcinoma/drug therapy', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Cladribine/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0959-8049(94)90136-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0959-8049(94)90136-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1994;30A(7):1022-6. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(94)90136-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A review of patients transplanted between May 1975 and August 1991 was undertaken in order to evaluate problems and outcome, and examine the role of both autologous and allogeneic BMT at various stages in the treatment of ANLL. Forty-seven patients received either an allogeneic (n = 24) if a suitable donor was identified or autologous (n = 23) BMT if there was no allogeneic donor. Conditioning therapy consisted of total body irradiation (TBI) and cyclophosphamide (n = 14) or busulfan and cyclophosphamide (n = 33) with or without melphalan. Graft-versus-host disease prevention was with methotrexate (n = 9), methotrexate and cyclosporin (n = 10) or T cell depletion (n = 5). Minimum follow-up for surviving patients was 24 months (median 65 months). For patients transplanted in first remission there was a 0% and 9 +/- 6% transplant-related mortality, a 37 +/- 11% and 33 +/- 12% relapse risk and a 63 +/- 11% and 63 +/- 12% event-free survival for autologous and allogeneic BMT, respectively. In second remission, there was a 14% mortality, 50 +/- 20% relapse risk and 43 +/- 19% event-free survival for allogeneic BMT. No patient transplanted in relapse survived.

Response (ANC to > 10(9)/l) occurred in 83% of rhGM-CSF cycles (29/35). Median time to response was 2.4 days (mean 6.7 days). Kinetics of response was dependent on diagnosis and treatment history. Fever abated with increasing ANC in 13/17 patients (76%) who entered the trial with hyperpyrexia. Treatment with rhGM-CSF allowed chemotherapy to be resumed on schedule in 7/9 relevant cycles.

Other tumours reported at increased incidence, in particular among Hodgkin's disease patients, for whom a carcinogenic effect of chemotherapy seems plausible, are non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and lung cancer. Other secondary solid tumors have also been reported, but for none of them an independent effect of chemotherapy has been demonstrated.","['Boffetta, P', 'Kaldor, J M']","['Boffetta P', 'Kaldor JM']","['International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/02841869409121767 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 1994;33(6):591-8. doi: 10.3109/02841869409121767.,,,52,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: To determine whether pseudotype formation resulting in expanded cell tropism may be an important mechanism, cellular targets and tissue distribution of FIV and FeLV were determined by in situ hybridization and/or immunohistochemistry. To determine whether FeLV can transactivate the FIV long terminal repeat (LTR) resulting in increased FIV expression, in vitro transient expression assays were performed. To examine whether persistent FeLV infection can cause the deletion of a suppressive T-lymphocyte population, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures from persistently FeLV-infected cats were infected with FIV and monitored for FIV antigen levels. RESULTS: Macrophages were the predominant target of FIV infection and were disseminated in a similar pattern in lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues of both FIV-infected and FeLV/FIV-coinfected cats. FeLV-infected cells expressing FIV RNA were not present. Significant transactivation of the FIV LTR in FeLV-infected cells was not demonstrated. FIV antigen production was similar upon in vitro infection of PBMC from FeLV-infected and uninfected cats.

Benzene metabolism is reviewed with the aim of suggesting metabolites that may play a role in the etiology of the disease. The data relating to the formation of DNA adducts and their potential significance are analyzed. The clastogenic activity of benzene is discussed both in terms of biomarkers of exposure and as a potential indication of leukemogenesis. In addition to chromosome aberrations, sister chromatid exchange, and micronucleus formation, the significance of chromosomal translocations is discussed. The mutagenic activity of benzene metabolites is reviewed and benzene is placed in perspective as a leukemogen with other carcinogens and the lack of leukemogenic activity by compounds of related structure is noted.

The mechanism of resistance in these cell lines is multifactorial, with DNA repair playing a dominant role. The amines incorporated in the complexes were selected from the alicyclic, heterocyclic and isoaliphatic class, and contained 3, 4, 5 or 6 carbon atoms. The studies demonstrated that ascending each of the homologous series increased cytotoxic potency against sensitive and cisplatin-resistant cell lines and, more importantly, reduced the cross-resistance of cisplatin-resistant cells. Resistance factors (IC50 in resistant cells/IC50 in wild-type cells) were substantially lower than those for cisplatin, but greater than those seen for tetraplatin. In L1210/DACH cells, the potency remained similar across the alicyclic and isoaliphatic series, while there was a consistent decrease in activity in the heterocyclic series for each stepwise increase in amine size. Furthermore, the relationship between structure and resistance factor in L1210/DACH cells was in direct contrast to that seen in the L1210/DDP model in that the factors increased on ascending the homologous series stepwise. The lower members of the alicyclic and heterocyclic series and cisplatin had comparable resistance factors in the L1210/DACH line; higher members displayed resistance factors that were comparable to or greater than that of tetraplatin. These results provide evidence for amine class and size as factors that can modulate the potency and capacity of ammine/amine platinum complexes to circumvent cisplatin or tetraplatin resistance.","['Yoshida, M', 'Khokhar, A R', 'Siddik, Z H']","['Yoshida M', 'Khokhar AR', 'Siddik ZH']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,"['0 (Amines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'SFK1SGY8V1 (ormaplatin)']",IM,,"['Amines/*chemical synthesis/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/*toxicity', 'Cisplatin/toxicity', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*chemical synthesis/*toxicity', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1994 Oct;9(5):425-34.,,"['R01 CA41581/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA50380/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Competitive polymerase chain reaction assays were developed to determine the absolute and relative amounts of tmGM-CSFR alpha versus sGM-CSFR alpha message synthesized by various cell lines and tissues. RESULTS: sGM-CSFR alpha transcripts were detected in bone marrow, monocyte/macrophages (cultured in GM-CSF), rheumatoid synovial tissue, and rheumatoid synovial tissue T cell lines, and represented the predominant transcript in synovial fibroblasts and osteoarthritis synovial tissue. Levels of expression in monocyte/macrophages and some synovial fibroblast and T cell lines approached those seen in transfected cell lines producing functional sGM-CSFR alpha. CONCLUSION: sGM-CSFR alpha represents a functional antagonist of GM-CSF activity in vitro.

These three C-nucleosides exert their cytotoxicity by forming an analogue of NAD, wherein nicotinamide is replaced by the C-nucleoside base. The antiproliferative activities of these three agents were compared in a panel of 60 human cancer cell lines. To examine the relationship of benzamide riboside and selenazofurin to tiazofurin, COMPARE computer analysis was performed, and correlation coefficients of 0.761 and 0.815 were obtained for benzamide riboside and selenazofurin, respectively. The biochemical activities of these agents were examined in human myelogenous leukemia K562 cells. Incubation of K562 cells for 4 hr with 10 microM each of benzamide riboside, selenazofurin and tiazofurin resulted in a 49, 71, and 26% decrease in IMPDH activity with a concurrent increase in intracellular IMP pools. As a consequence of IMPDH inhibition, GTP and dGTP concentrations were curtailed. These studies demonstrated that selenazofurin was the most potent of the three agents. To compare the cellular synthesis of NAD analogues of these agents, K562 cells were incubated with 10 microM each of benzamide riboside, tiazofurin and selenazofurin after prelabeling the cells with [2,8-3H]adenosine. The results demonstrated that benzamide riboside produced 2- and 3-fold more of NAD analogue (BAD) than tiazofurin and selenazofurin did. To elucidate the effects of the three compounds on other NAD-utilizing enzymes, the inhibitory activities of purified benzamide adenine dinucleotide (BAD), thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (TAD) and selenazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (SAD) were studied in commercially available purified preparations of lactate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase. TAD and SAD did not inhibit these three dehydrogenases. Although BAD did not influence lactate and glutamate dehydrogenases, it selectively inhibited 50% of malate dehydrogenase activity at a 3.2 microM concentration.

Differences between specialised cell types reflect variations in their patterns of gene expression. The regulation of transcription initiation is an important control point for gene expression and it is, therefore, not surprising that transcription factors play a pivotal role in mammalian development and differentiation. Haemopoiesis offers a uniquely tractable system for the study of lineage commitment and differentiation. The importance of transcription factors in the normal regulation of haemopoiesis is underlined by the frequency with which transcription factors are targeted by leukaemogenic mutations. Studies of the function and regulation of haemopoietic transcription factors, especially those expressed in lineage-restricted patterns, should greatly increase our understanding of the molecular control of haemopoiesis.

However, a specific accumulation of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase was noticed in cells grown in the presence of copper, that was not detectable for other proteins. Purification of the enzyme demonstrated that Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase was present as a reconstitutable, copper-deficient protein with high specific activity (kcat./Cu = 0.89 x 10(9) M-1.s-1) in untreated K562 cells and as a fully metallated protein with low specific activity (kcat./Cu = 0.54 x 10(9) M-1.s-1) in copper-treated cells. Pulse-chase experiments using [3H]lysine indicated that turnover rates of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase in K562 cells were not affected by growth in copper-enriched medium, whereas turnover of total protein was significantly enhanced as a function of metal supplementation. From these results we conclude that: (i) unlike in yeast [Carri, Galiazzo, Ciriolo and Rotilio (1991) FEBS Lett. 278, 263-266] Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase is not specifically regulated by copper at the transcriptional level in human K562 cells, suggesting that this type of regulation has not been conserved during the evolution of higher eukaryotes; (ii) copper ions cause an inactivation of the enzyme in intact K562 cells; and (iii) the metabolic stability of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase results in its relative accumulation under conditions that lead to increased protein turnover.","['Steinkuhler, C', 'Carri, M T', 'Micheli, G', 'Knoepfel, L', 'Weser, U', 'Rotilio, G']","['Steinkuhler C', 'Carri MT', 'Micheli G', 'Knoepfel L', 'Weser U', 'Rotilio G']","['Department of Biology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Copper/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Kidney/cytology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Polyribosomes/metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Superoxide Dismutase/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenopus laevis']",PMC1137286,1994/09/15 00:00,1994/09/15 00:01,['1994/09/15 00:00'],"['1994/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3020687 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1994 Sep 15;302 ( Pt 3):687-94. doi: 10.1042/bj3020687.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If this is the case, one would expect that there is a relationship between the pattern of neuropsychological and magnetic resonance imaging deficits and that both may indicate cerebellar abnormalities. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the profiles of neuropsychological functions and the morphologic features of the cerebellum, using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging planimetry in survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with radiation and chemotherapy. DESIGN: Thirteen survivors of childhood ALL with onset at age 2 to 5 years and a uniform protocol of treatment involving cranial radiation of 24 Gy and five doses of intrathecal methotrexate sodium participated in the study. Ten controls matched the patients in age and socioeconomic status. Each child was assessed with a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests and with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. MEASUREMENTS: The neuropsychological scores were transformed into z scores and clustered into right and left hemisphere measures. Planimetric measures of the cerebellar vermis and pons were collected in the midsagittal plane. RESULTS: Consistently observed in survivors of ALL were the following: (1) significant cognitive deficits in visual-spatial-motor coordination and figural memory, functions commonly related to the right side of the brain; and (2) hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, lobuli I through V and particularly VI to VII. Lateralization of the neurobehavioral deficits was not reflected in structural brain abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Coexistence of the cerebellar hypoplasia and visual-motor coordination and memory deficits supports the neurodevelopmental approach to brain sequelae in survivors of ALL; it also suggests significance of the cerebellum for both motor and complex nonmotor cognitive processing.","['Ciesielski, K T', 'Yanofsky, R', 'Ludwig, R N', 'Hill, D E', 'Hart, B L', 'Astur, R S', 'Snyder, T']","['Ciesielski KT', 'Yanofsky R', 'Ludwig RN', 'Hill DE', 'Hart BL', 'Astur RS', 'Snyder T']","['Department of Psychology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Neurol,Archives of neurology,0372436,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Cerebellum/*abnormalities/pathology', 'Child', 'Cognition Disorders/*complications/pathology', 'Dendrites/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/pathology']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1001/archneur.1994.00540220031012 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Neurol. 1994 Oct;51(10):985-93. doi: 10.1001/archneur.1994.00540220031012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Body mass index (BMI), determined as weight/height, was used as a measure of fatness. The BMI Z scores were calculated for each patient from standard tables. The ALL group was compared with a control group of 18 age matched children who had received chemotherapy but no radiotherapy. Changes in BMI between diagnosis and two and four years later were analysed by paired t tests. Mean BMI Z scores at diagnosis were similar between ALL boys, ALL girls, and the control group. Two years after diagnosis the ALL group, particularly the girls, showed a significant increase in BMI. By four years BMI had decreased slightly in the ALL boys, but had increased still further in the ALL girls with 57% having BMI Z scores greater than 2. In the control group BMI increased, but not significantly, at two and four years. It is concluded that the obesity seen in patients treated for ALL is more pronounced in girls than boys, and that cranial irradiation is an important factor.","['Odame, I', 'Reilly, J J', 'Gibson, B E', 'Donaldson, M D']","['Odame I', 'Reilly JJ', 'Gibson BE', 'Donaldson MD']","['Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Yorkhill, Glasgow.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,,IM,,"['Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors', 'Survivors']",PMC1029948,1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/adc.71.2.147 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1994 Aug;71(2):147-9. doi: 10.1136/adc.71.2.147.,,,,,,,,,,,,['Arch Dis Child. 1995 Jan;72(1):97.

We determined the ability of tumor cells to penetrate matrigel-coated filters in the presence or absence of PSK. PSK (100 micrograms/ml) reduced to half the number of invasive tumor cells for 3 hr incubation. PSK inhibited tumor cell invasion of matrigel-coated filters in a dose-dependent manner. Matrigel includes laminin, collagen, fibronectin and heparan sulfate proteoglycan. It is possible, therefore, that PSK may inhibit enzymes which digest the components of basement membranes, extra cellular matrices (ECM).

A mechanism for RA-induced differentiation of HL60 cells may involve retinoylation (RA acylation) which is a post-translational modification of proteins occurring in many eukaryotic cell lines. Here, we found that differentiation by the synthetic retinoid (E)4-[3-(3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)-3-oxo-1-propenyl]-benzoic acid (Ch55) was dose-dependent in serum-free medium. The synthetic retinoid 4(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenylcarbamoyl) benzoic acid (Am80) did not induce differentiation. Ch55 bound covalently to proteins of HL60 cells. In contrast, covalent binding of Am80 to HL60 proteins was much lower. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis patterns of proteins labeled covalently by RA and Ch55 were different with few proteins labeled by both retinoids. The level of retinoylation was increased by Am80 and combinations of RA with either Ch55 or Am80 synergistically induced differentiation of HL60 cells. These results suggest that covalent modification of proteins by a retinoid may play a role in inducing differentiation of HL60 cells. In addition, the synergy seen with combinations of RA and either Ch55 or Am80 suggests that some synthetic retinoids may be active because they displace RA from intracellular sites or because they inhibit RA catabolism.","['Takahashi, N', 'Breitman, T R']","['Takahashi N', 'Breitman TR']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Chalcones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tetrahydronaphthalenes)', '08V52GZ3H9 (tamibarotene)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '5S5A2Q39HX (Chalcone)', ""95906-67-5 (3,5-di-tert-butylchalcone 4'-carboxylic acid)""]",IM,,"['Benzoates/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Chalcone/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Chalcones', 'Drug Synergism', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/*drug effects', 'Tetrahydronaphthalenes/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(84)71414-7 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1994.1414 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1994 Oct;314(1):82-9. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1994.1414.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the muscle of patients with HTLV-I-associated myopathy, the predominant endomysial cells surrounding healthy muscle fibers were CD8+ cells followed by CD4+ cells and macrophages. MHC-I antigens were ubiquitous in the muscles of all 6 patients, even in those without endomysial inflammation. HTLV-I sequences were amplified from the whole muscle biopsy specimens but the cells harboring viral antigens were rare endomysial macrophages and not muscle fibers. Although HTLV-I sequences were amplified from all the patients' peripheral blood lymphocytes, these cells did not exert myotoxicity or resulted in viral replication in cocultures with their homologous myotubes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Leon-Monzon, M', 'Illa, I', 'Dalakas, M C']","['Leon-Monzon M', 'Illa I', 'Dalakas MC']","['Neuromuscular Diseases Section, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Neurol,Annals of neurology,7707449,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Gene Amplification', 'Genes, Viral', 'HTLV-I Antigens/analysis', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymyositis/*etiology/genetics/immunology']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ana.410360414 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Neurol. 1994 Oct;36(4):643-9. doi: 10.1002/ana.410360414.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, some leukemic cells are too primitive to be identified based on conventional morphology, cytochemistry, and immunophenotype criteria. The gene for myeloperoxidase (MPO) is central to the lineage designation of myeloid cells and their function. Expression of MPO messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) may serve to determine the myeloid lineage of primitive leukemic cells that do not express the final product, MPO. Recently, a procedure has been developed for detection of MPO mRNA in leukemic cells, based on message amplification by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Three variant polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods, developed in view of future diagnostic applications of the RT-PCR procedure are reported: (A) nested PCR, using a second pair of internal primers for reamplification of the first PCR product; (B) multiplex PCR for concomitant amplification of up to seven sequences encompassing all regions of MPO mRNA; (C) adaptation of the standard PCR procedure and the two variant methods for use of cellular material from air-dried unstained or Wright stained smears. These variant procedures developed on the HL-60 cell line make the RT-PCR detection of MPO mRNA easily applicable as a new diagnostic test in acute leukemias and confer the versatility needed in the clinical setting. The advantages of our new procedure for MPO mRNA detection are: high sensitivity and specificity, speed, simplicity, and safety. Myeloid lineage of leukemic blasts can be established, confirmed, or ruled out in 6 to 10 hours, making results available at the time of bone marrow sign-out.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Crisan, D']",['Crisan D'],"['Department of Clinical Pathology, William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI 48073.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Molecular Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,,"['Actins/genetics', 'Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Molecular Probes/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Peroxidase/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 1994 Jul-Aug;24(4):355-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experimentation procedures, evaluation criteria, and therapies are all based on cell killing. Yet there is substantial evidence that the kill/cure paradigm has reached its limit, and may be blinding us to other mechanisms to control this family of diseases. Both old and new data lead to the conclusion that the derangements in cellular function, while profound, are in large measure derivatives of normal mechanisms for organ growth, repair and renewal. Further, these are dynamic processes, potentially capable of reversal. If one views cancer as a community of cells in which signalling and communication is deranged, but functional, it becomes clear that cytotoxic approaches may serve to exacerbate the very control and communication defects which permit growth, invasion and metastasis. A new model is proposed, in which the cancer cell is seen as largely normal, but aberrantly regulated. Viewed from this perspective, the ""cures"" we have achieved may not be the result to total kill, but instead may result from a reassertion of control. This conceptualization offers an explanation for many laboratory and clinical observations, such as the induction of drug resistance medicated by pre-existing detoxification mechanisms, the cyclic progression of many tumours, and the compelling relationship between graft-versus-host disease and the long-term disease-free survival of transplanted leukaemia patients. Further, it opens conceptual avenues to new therapies and evaluation procedures.","['Schipper, H']",['Schipper H'],"['WHO Collaborating Centre for Quality of Life in Cancer Care Manitoba Cancer Foundation, University of Manitoba, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Singapore,Ann Acad Med Singap,"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",7503289,,IM,,"['Cell Communication/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Physiological Phenomena', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*pathology/*therapy']",,1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Acad Med Singap. 1994 May;23(3):382-6.,,,30,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Phase II evaluation and comparison with historical control patients and other series in which the investigators used higher interferon-alpha doses. SETTING: Tertiary care leukemia research clinic. PATIENTS: 41 patients with newly diagnosed or previously treated chronic-phase, Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia received interferon-alpha at a dose of 2 x 10(6) U/m2 body surface area daily for 28 days and then three times weekly. MEASUREMENTS: Complete blood counts and physical examinations were done monthly to determine hematologic remission and toxicity. To determine karyotypic response, bone marrow cytogenetic analyses were done at 6 monthly intervals in patients who achieved a complete hematologic remission. In addition, Kaplan-Meier survival curves and median survival values were generated from diagnosis and the start of therapy with interferon-alpha. RESULTS: 70% of patients treated with low-dose interferon-alpha within 1 year of diagnosis achieved a complete hematologic remission, and 22% of these patients had a major or complete karyotypic response. Investigators who used higher interferon-alpha doses in similar patient populations have reported complete hematologic remission rates of 59% to 70% and major and complete cytogenetic response rates of 16% to 29%. The Kaplan-Meier estimated 5-year survival rate of minimally pretreated patients in our study is 73% (95% CI, 51% to 95%), which compares favorably with survivals reported by investigators who used higher doses. The estimated yearly cost of the interferon-alpha used in our study is $5953 compared with a median of $24,375 for the higher doses used by other investigators. Less toxicity was also observed. CONCLUSION: Low-dose interferon-alpha is as effective as higher-dose interferon-alpha in inducing remissions and prolonging survival in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia but is considerably less expensive and toxic.","['Schofield, J R', 'Robinson, W A', 'Murphy, J R', 'Rovira, D K']","['Schofield JR', 'Robinson WA', 'Murphy JR', 'Rovira DK']","['University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Drug Costs', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/economics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",,1994/11/15 00:00,1994/11/15 00:01,['1994/11/15 00:00'],"['1994/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7326/0003-4819-121-10-199411150-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1994 Nov 15;121(10):736-44. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-121-10-199411150-00002.,,,,,,,,,,,,['Ann Intern Med. 1995 May 1;122(9):728-9.

LPS induces expression of LIF and LIF inhibits acute inflammation.,L442-6,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injected into the trachea of rats was found to induce the secretion of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) into bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid with a maximum expression of LIF after 2-12 h. The acute pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation caused by the intratracheal injection of bacterial endotoxin (LPS) could be inhibited by the intratracheal coinjection of recombinant LIF. Compared with intratracheal injection of LPS alone, intratracheal coinjection of LIF and LPS decreases the number of BAL neutrophils obtained 6 h later by approximately 50% (P < 0.0001). LIF decreased the amount of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF), but not the amount of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6, in the BAL fluid of LPS-injected rats. Similarly, intravenous LIF was found to decrease TNF expression, but increase IL-6 expression, in the serum of rats receiving intravenous LPS. Intravenous LIF, even in the absence of LPS, was found to cause IL-6 expression. In conclusion, intratracheal LPS initiates the secretion of endogenous LIF into the alveolar space where LIF may contribute to the downregulation of LPS-initiated acute neutrophilic inflammation by downregulating expression of TNF. LIF may down-regulate LPS-initiated TNF expression at least in part indirectly by upregulating expression of IL-6, a cytokine known to downregulate LPS-initiated TNF expression.","['Ulich, T R', 'Fann, M J', 'Patterson, P H', 'Williams, J H', 'Samal, B', 'Del Castillo, J', 'Yin, S', 'Guo, K', 'Remick, D G']","['Ulich TR', 'Fann MJ', 'Patterson PH', 'Williams JH', 'Samal B', 'Del Castillo J', 'Yin S', 'Guo K', 'Remick DG']","['Department of Pathology, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla 92093.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/chemistry', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Injections', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/physiology', 'Pneumonia/*prevention & control', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Trachea', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/ajplung.1994.267.4.L442 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1994 Oct;267(4 Pt 1):L442-6. doi: 10.1152/ajplung.1994.267.4.L442.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells suspended in hypotonic (50-60% of isotonic) media undergo a small (< 0.2 pH units), but significant (P < 0.05), intracellular acidification within 5 min. However, after 30 min of RVD, pHi is not significantly different from the initial pHi in 20 mM HCO3- medium and is significantly higher in HCO3(-)-free medium. Experiments performed in media with or without 150 microM 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid and HCO3- demonstrate that the anion exchanger (AE) mediates a net Cl- influx, with compensating HCO3- efflux, during RVD. To determine which transport systems are involved in counteracting this tendency toward acidification, we measured transport rates and examined the effect of transport system inhibitors on pHi. We found that inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange (NHE) with 12.5 microM ethylisoproplamiloride (EIPA) causes pHi to fall significantly by the end of 30 min of RVD. As assessed by EIPA-sensitive 22Na+ uptake measurements, NHE, largely dormant under resting isotonic conditions, becomes significantly activated by the end of 30 min of RVD, despite recovery of pHi and cell volume to near-normal levels. Thus a shift in the normal pHi dependence and/or volume dependence of NHE activity must occur during RVD under hypotonic conditions. In contrast, H(+)-monocarboxylate cotransport appears to play only a supportive role in pH regulation during RVD, as indicated by lack of stimulation of [14C]lactate efflux during RVD.","['Hallows, K R', 'Restrepo, D', 'Knauf, P A']","['Hallows KR', 'Restrepo D', 'Knauf PA']","['Department of Biophysics, University of Rochester Medical Center, New York 14642.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,"['0 (Anions)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Coumaric Acids)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Lactates)', '0 (Monocarboxylic Acid Transporters)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers)', '28166-41-8 (alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)']",IM,['Am J Physiol 1995 Mar;268(3 Pt 1):section C followi'],"['Anions/pharmacokinetics', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Chlorides/pharmacokinetics', 'Coumaric Acids/pharmacology', 'Culture Media', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Intracellular Membranes/*metabolism', 'Ion Exchange', 'Lactates/metabolism', 'Lactic Acid', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Monocarboxylic Acid Transporters', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/ajpcell.1994.267.4.C1057 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1994 Oct;267(4 Pt 1):C1057-66. doi: 10.1152/ajpcell.1994.267.4.C1057.,,"['DK-27495/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-42495/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-18208/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These ""channels"" differ pharmacologically and in their modes of activation from those described in lymphocytes and Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. With use of measured 86Rb+ and 36Cl- fluxes, together with a diffusion kinetic model, the membrane potential (Em) and apparent K+ and Cl- permeabilities (PK and PCl) were estimated under various isotonic and hypotonic conditions. Under isotonic (300 mosM) conditions, Em is close to the Nernst potential for K+ and PCl is < 0.1 PK. Rapid and steeply graded increases in the measured Cl- efflux rate and calculated PCl occur with decreasing tonicity, with the largest increases at tonicities < 80% of isotonic. K+ efflux and the apparent PK increase only modestly with decreasing tonicity. At 50% tonicity, PCl rises to nearly 10 times PK, which should cause substantial membrane depolarization, with Em approaching the Nernst potential for Cl-. Gramicidin treatment markedly accelerates the rate of RVD and net 36Cl- efflux in hypotonic Na(+)-and Cl(-)-free media, providing further evidence that PK is rate limiting during RVD. K+ loss exceeds Cl- loss during RVD, and the total loss of K+ and Cl- is insufficient to account for the observed degree of volume recovery in 50% tonicity media, indicating that other (organic) osmolytes must take part in the HL-60 cell RVD response.","['Hallows, K R', 'Knauf, P A']","['Hallows KR', 'Knauf PA']","['Department of Biophysics, University of Rochester Medical Center, New York 14642.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,"['0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Hypotonic Solutions)', 'MLT4718TJW (Rubidium)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Am J Physiol 1995 Jun;268(6 Pt 3):section C followi', 'Am J Physiol 1995 Mar;268(3 Pt 1):section C following table of contents']","['Calcium/pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Chlorides/*pharmacokinetics', 'Culture Media', 'Humans', 'Hypotonic Solutions/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Potassium/pharmacokinetics', 'Rubidium/pharmacokinetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Water-Electrolyte Balance']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/ajpcell.1994.267.4.C1045 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1994 Oct;267(4 Pt 1):C1045-56. doi: 10.1152/ajpcell.1994.267.4.C1045.,,"['DK-27495/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-18208/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM-07356/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The causes of secondary malignancies are probably multifactorial, but radiation therapy and chemotherapy have certainly been implicated in the development of posttherapy neoplasia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A case of pleural mesothelioma after successful radiation therapy for Hodgkin's disease is described with a review of radiation-associated mesotheliomas reported in the literature. In Hodgkin's disease, patients may receive radiation, chemotherapy, or combined treatment; the most common secondary malignancy is acute nonlymphocytic leukemia while sarcomas are the second most common solid tumors.

Seventy-two of the 194 required further chemotherapy and received a second cycle of the same or similar therapy; 63 of these 72 were evaluable. For each marrow, a tumor burden index (TBI) was calculated, as the product of the marrow cellularity and the proportion of malignant cells. For each patient, the decrement in TBI between the initial and day approximately 14 marrows was recorded. Patients who achieved second-cycle CR were comparable to those who did not in general descriptors; there was no difference between second-cycle CR achievers and nonachievers in the cytoreduction effected by the initial cycle of therapy (74.9% +/- 4.5% [sigma] versus 71.9% +/- 5.9%). We then stratified patients according to the first-cycle cytoreduction, asking if we could find a level that was reliably predictive of increased or decreased likelihood of achieving CR with cycle 2. We could not, despite testing at many centile cuts.

The efficacy of this drug results from its facile uptake by cells, rapid polyglutamylation and virtually stoichiometric inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a key enzyme in cell replication. From the work of a multitude of biochemists, molecular biologists, organic chemists and pharmacologists, much is known about the mode of action of MTX and the mechanisms by which tumors exhibit inherent or acquired resistance to this drug. MTX enters cells primarily by a carrier-mediated active transport system whose principal substrate is 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and additional glutamates are added to the gamma-position of the parent glutamate moiety. The tight binding of MTX to DHFR is defined from NMR and X-ray crystallographic studies of the enzyme and its drug or substrate complexes, supplemented by site-directed mutagenesis to confirm specific interactions. Resistance to the drug, encountered in cell culture model systems or in cancer patients, can result from an increased level of DHFR (due to gene amplification), mutant DHFR with reduced affinity for MTX, or decreased uptake or polyglutamylation of the drug. Although DHFR is an extremely well-studied enzyme, there is still some uncertainty about its kinetics, mechanism for reduction of folate, multiple forms, and activation by a diverse group of agents. Prodrug forms of MTX, e.g., MTX alpha-phenylalanine, which can be activated by carboxypeptidase A-monoclonal antibody conjugates, offer promise for improved efficacy of the drug by selective targeting to tumors. The large body of information summarized above has aided in the development of other folate antagonists, provides a paradigm for assessing the status of other cancer chemotherapeutic agents in current use, and offers a platform from which to speculate about the future of the field.","['Huennekens, F M']",['Huennekens FM'],"['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', '*Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0065-2571(94)90025-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1994;34:397-419. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(94)90025-6.,,['CA 39836/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],84,,,,,,,,,,,,

The four known kinases, cytosolic thymidine kinase (TK1) and deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and the mitochondrial thymidine kinase (TK2) and deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK), have been purified and characterized as to the subunit structure as well as specificity with a large number of analogs. These results are summarized and used to establish selective assays for the four enzymes in crude extracts of normal and malignant human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, gastrointestinal tissues and sarcomas. TK2 and dGK activities were found at low levels in all tissues, possibly correlated to the content of mitochondria. TK1 activity was detected only in samples containing a significant number of S phase cells. We have measured dCK activity as well as dCK polypeptide level by immuno blotting in these extracts. High levels of dCK were found in normal mononuclear leukocytes (91-145 ng dCK/mg protein) and in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (80 +/- 30 ng/mg, n = 23). Hairy cell leukemia contained lower levels (28 +/- 23 ng/mg, n = 7), as did unexpectedly three samples of T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (18 +/- 14 ng/mg). Phytohemaglutinine stimulation of normal lymphocytes did not lead to any substantial increase in either dCK activity or expression (less than 2.5-fold). In colon adenocarcinomas, the dCK content was significantly higher (21 +/- 9.3 ng/mg, n = 20) than in normal colon mucosa (8.2 +/- 3.7 ng/mg, n = 19, p < 0.05). A similar pattern of dCK expression was found in gastric adenocarcinomas (21 +/- 13 ng/mg, n = 5) and normal ventricular mucosa (6.2 +/- 5.4 ng/mg, n = 5, p < 0.15). One leiomyosarcoma and one extra-skeletal osteosarcoma showed a dCK levels comparable to those found in normal lymphocytes (84 +/- 6 and 109 +/- 4 ng/mg), while other sarcoma samples contained levels comparable to the gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas (20 +/- 7 ng/mg, n = 12). We confirm that dCK is expressed constitutively and predominantly in lymphoid cells, but conclude that a significant expression may be found in non-lymphoid tissues as well, with increased levels in the corresponding tumor tissue. 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine (CdA), an antileukemic agent used in treatment of hairy cell leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemias (B-CLL), is phosphorylated by dCK which was used as the selective substrate for this enzyme. A study was performed to investigate if there was a correlation between the dCK levels and the response to CdA treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Eriksson, S', 'Arner, E', 'Spasokoukotskaja, T', 'Wang, L', 'Karlsson, A', 'Brosjo, O', 'Gunven, P', 'Julusson, G', 'Liliemark, J']","['Eriksson S', 'Arner E', 'Spasokoukotskaja T', 'Wang L', 'Karlsson A', 'Brosjo O', 'Gunven P', 'Julusson G', 'Liliemark J']","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical Nobel Institute, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.- (deoxyribonucleoside kinases)']",IM,,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cladribine/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*enzymology', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/*metabolism', 'Sarcoma/drug therapy/enzymology']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0065-2571(94)90006-x [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1994;34:13-25. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(94)90006-x.,,,105,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years adriamycin was sometimes replaced by mitoxanthrone which caused greater myelotoxicity. As a positive feature of the exchange of adriamycin for mitoxanthrone, authors using it, report its lower cardiotoxicity. In the literature there are, however, occasional reports on a lower cardiotoxicity of adriamycin when administered in a continuous infusion. In the submitted work the authors sought answers to two questions. 1. Is the cardiotoxicity of adriamycin administered in a continuous infusion lower than the cardiotoxicity of adriamycin administered as a bolus? 2. Is it possible to add to VAD chemotherapy cyclophosphamide without increasing the toxicity excessively? After echocardiographic evaluation of the diastolic and systolic function following a cumulative dose of 200 mg the authors observed smaller changes of the above functions in the group treated with adriamycin a in a continuous infusion (patients with multiple myeloma) than in the group with bolus therapy (patients with non-Hodgkin lymphomas and acute leukaemia). Addition of 600 mg cyclophosphamide on the 5th, 10th and 20th day to the classical VAD pattern made treatment more intensive without causing a deteriorated tolerance of this treatment.","['Adam, Z', 'Elbl, L', 'Vorlicek, J', 'Hajek, R', 'Tomiska, M', 'Hejlova, N', 'Kralova, E', 'Novotna, H']","['Adam Z', 'Elbl L', 'Vorlicek J', 'Hajek R', 'Tomiska M', 'Hejlova N', 'Kralova E', 'Novotna H']",['II. interni klinika FN Brno.'],['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Vnitr Lek,Vnitrni lekarstvi,0413602,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'CVAD protocol']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Vnitr Lek. 1994 Aug;40(8):506-12.,,,,,,,,,,"Nizsi kardiotoxicita adriamycinu pri kontinualnim podani u nemocnych s refrakternim mnohocetnym myelomem lecenych cyklofosfamidem, vincristinem, adriamycinem a dexamethazonem (C-VAD).",,,,,

Tax is also able to indirectly stimulate transcription of several growth regulatory genes by an indirect mechanism via association with host transcription factors. One of the cellular targets of the trans-activating effects of Tax is the NF-kappa B/Rel family transcription factors, pleiotropic regulators of immunoregulatory, cytokine, and viral gene expression. Recent studies demonstrated that specific subunits of NF-kappa B (NFKB2(p 100) and c-Rel) were overexpressed in HTLV-I-infected and Tax-expressing cells. Furthermore, Tax physically associated with NFKB2(p 100). Monospecific antibodies directed against individual NF-kappa B subunits were generated and used to investigate the consequences of the interactions between Tax and NF-kappa B in a cotransfection-immunofluorescence assay. These studies demonstrate: (1) distinct compartmentalization of NF-kappa B precursors and products, (2) differential induction of the endogenous I kappa B alpha protein by transfected NF-kappa B subunits, (3) subcellular relocalization of Tax to the cytoplasm or nucleus depending on the coexpressed NF-kappa B subunit, and (4) Tax interaction with the Rel homology domain region of NFKB2.

Although LPDV cannot be grown in cultured cells, it was possible to isolate molecular clones of biologically active integrated proviral genomes from spleens of infected turkeys. Based upon molecular hybridization and nucleotide sequence comparisons of its pol gene, LPDV was shown to represent a distinct group of avian retroviruses most closely related to avian sarcoma-leukemia viruses. Here we report the complete nucleotide sequence of the LPDV genome as well as amino acid sequence analysis of its gag gene products. The genetic organization of LPDV is characteristic of members of the oncovirus subfamily. Further sequence comparisons of the gag gene confirmed that LPDV is most closely related to Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). However, the gag, pro, and pol open reading frames (ORFs) were in different translational phases so that the expression of their mature gene products would require the double frame-shifting mechanism utilized by simian retroviruses, mouse mammary tumor virus, and human T-cell leukemia virus. In contrast, the RSV proteinase is synthesized as part of the gag precursor. The LPDV gag gene differs from that of RSV as well as from all other retroviruses in that it encodes a unique 31,000-Da (p31) protein, located between the MA and the CA coding sequences. FOur short ORFs of unknown function were present, Whether the putative products of these ORFs account for the acute nature of LPDV-induced disease remains to be determined.","['Sarid, R', 'Chajut, A', 'Gak, E', 'Kim, Y', 'Hixson, C V', 'Oroszlan, S', 'Tronick, S R', 'Gazit, A', 'Yaniv, A']","['Sarid R', 'Chajut A', 'Gak E', 'Kim Y', 'Hixson CV', 'Oroszlan S', 'Tronick SR', 'Gazit A', 'Yaniv A']","['Department of Human Microbiology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Gene Products, pol)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Gene Products, env/genetics', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics', 'Gene Products, pol/genetics', '*Genome, Viral', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*veterinary/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Poultry Diseases/*virology', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Turkeys/*virology']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(84)71584-4 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1994.1584 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1994 Nov 1;204(2):680-91. doi: 10.1006/viro.1994.1584.,,['N01-CO-7410/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/U09568'],,,,

Using a parent and two MHC class I mutant cell lines, we have tested the role of MHC class I molecules in natural killer (NK) cells, lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Both class I expressing parent cells and class I loss mutants were insensitive to NK cell lysis as assayed, regardless of the amount of class I molecules on the target cell surface. However, LAK cells demonstrated higher cytolysis on these target cells than NK cells, suggesting different mechanisms of target cell recognition or different levels of lytic activity by these two effector cell populations. Up-regulation of class I expression on the target surface by gamma interferon (gamma-IFN) had little influence on NK and LAK susceptibility, indicating there was no correlation between class I expression and bovine NK or LAK cytolysis. However, allogeneic CTLs mediated a lytic pattern distinct from NK and LAK cells, in which target sensitivity to allogeneic CTLs correlated with the amount of class I molecules expressed on the cell surface. Additionally, effector-target cell conjugation studies demonstrated that target class I expression was not involved in NK and LAK cells binding to targets.

A rise of body temperature above 37 degrees C up to five hours after exposure is related to doses exceeding 2.5 Gy, while an acute onset of diarrhoea is an indicator of a severe accident with more than 9 Gy.

Study of 30 cases].,183-6,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of the combination, alpha-interferon (IFN)-hydroxyurea (HU) in the treatment of patients with Philadelphia positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (Ph'-CML). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study was started in 1988 in which 30 patients with chronic phase, low-risk Ph'-CML, according to Kantarjian's staging system, were included. They were treated with IFN at a dose of 5 MU/m2 subcutaneously twice a week plus HU in doses between 0.5 and 3 g/m2/day. The clinic and biologic controls performed twice a month included granulocyte alkaline phosphatase, and cytogenetic studies of bone-marrow and peripheral blood were carry out every third month. The quality and duration of haematologic and cytogenetic remissions were evaluated, along with the untoward effect of the treatment. Survival was estimated in accordance to the Kaplan Meier method. RESULTS: The mean age was 49 years (range: 17-70) and the M/F ratio was 18/12. The median follow-up was 51 months (range: 8-89). Twenty patients were in early- and four late-chronic phase. Complete haematological remission (CHR) was achieved in 26 patients (87%) with a median of 52 months and an estimated global median survival of 81 months. Cytogenetic response was seen in 11 patients (52%) of the 21 who were evaluable after 11 months of treatment. Disappearance of Ph' (complete cytogenetic response) was seen in 6 cases (28%). The incidence of early blast crisis in the first three years was, respectively, 0%, 3% and 6%. The treatment toxicity was negligible in most cases, having to suppress the treatment only in one patient due to persistent fever. CONCLUSIONS: The association of IFN and HU is effective and well tolerated in patients with low-risk CML, and it improves survival in CHR and overall survival.","['Nese, M', 'de Bellis, R', 'Urtiarte, R', 'Di Landro, J']","['Nese M', 'de Bellis R', 'Urtiarte R', 'Di Landro J']","['Departamento de Hematologia Clinica, Facultad de Medicina, Montevideo, Uruguay.']",['spa'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Fever/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Immunologic Factors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1994 Jun;39(3):183-6.,,,,,,,,,,Tratamiento de la leucemia mieloide cronica con alfa interferon e hidroxiurea.

In this study we have analysed the capacity of CD4+ T cells from infected mice to produce IL-3 following stimulation with ConA for 24-72 h. In contrast to the position with IL-2, the production of which is markedly impaired during LP-BM5 infection, similar levels of IL-3 were measured in culture supernatants of splenocytes from infected and uninfected mice harvested at 24 h of stimulation. Forty eight and 72 h of ConA stimulation led to increasing levels of IL-3 being measured in cultures from uninfected mice, whilst in cultures from infected animals, IL-3 levels remained stagnant. Similar results were obtained 4, 8 and 13 weeks post-infection. In view of the fact that parallel experiments revealed markedly impaired proliferative responses to ConA during MAIDS, we conclude that IL-3 production is basically intact at the cellular level in T cells during MAIDS; but when in a situation requiring clonal expansion of the activated T cells, IL-3 production will be inhibited owing to the impaired capacity for proliferation.","['Neuenschwander, A U', 'Marker, O', 'Thomsen, A R']","['Neuenschwander AU', 'Marker O', 'Thomsen AR']","['Institute of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Interleukin-3/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology', 'Spleen/immunology']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1994.tb03482.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1994 Oct;40(4):410-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1994.tb03482.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This virus, as well as the closely related and rarer HTLV-2, is transmitted sexually, probably perinatally, and by infected blood and blood products. Among spumaviruses, an additional retrovirus subfamily, the human spumaretrovirus (HSRV)--or human foamy virus--seems to have a low pathogenicity for human, although it is believed to be associated with Graves disease.

The bleeding diathesis rapidly disappears. However relapses occur within few months due to the catabolism of retinoic acid induced by the treatment itself. A chemotherapy is generally proposed, in order to consolidate the complete remission. The combination of retinoic acid and chemotherapy has dramatically increased the probability of long term survival. The breakpoint of the translocation t(15;17) is located inside the retinoic acid receptor gene on chromosome 17. A new product is made, due to the fusion of the truncated retinoic acid receptor and a gene on chromosome 15.

Therefore, to identify morbid-mortality risk factors in this setting can be useful to improve therapeutic ratio. METHODS: We studied 15 variables in 46 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treated with cyclophosphamide, total body irradiation (TBI) and allogeneic BMT. A multivariant analysis with an unconditional logistic regression model was used. RESULTS: Variables found to be related with early mortality included general state of health and acute graft versus host disease. Patients with a Karnofsky index (KI) between 60% and 80% had a higher risk of early death than those with a KI between 90 and 100%.

It has been observed in the course of developmental processes, such as X chromosome inactivation and genomic imprinting. The methylation of DNA, an important factor in the epigenetic control of gene expression, may also be involved in tumorigenesis. After the t(9;22) chromosomal translocation and generation of the Philadelphia chromosome, the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), most of the abl coding sequence is fused to the 5' region of the bcr gene. Expression of the hybrid bcr-abl gene is, therefore, regulated by the bcr promoter. In most cases of CML, one of the two abl promoters (Pa) is nested within the bcr-abl transcriptional unit and should be able to transcribe the type Ia 6-kb normal abl mRNA from the Philadelphia chromosome. However, we have found that the 6-kb transcript is present only in CML cell lines containing a normal abl allele and that the apparent inactivation of the nested Pa promoter is associated with allele-specific methylation. Furthermore, we have noticed that the Pa promoter is contained within a CpG island and undergoes progressive de novo methylation in the course of the disease. This is attested to by the fact that DNA samples from CML patients that are methylation-free at the time of diagnosis invariably become methylated in advanced CML. Since tumor progression in CML cannot always be inferred from the clinical presentation, assessment of de novo CpG methylation may prove to be of critical value in management of the disease. It could herald blastic transformation at a stage when bone marrow transplantation, the only potentially curative therapeutic procedure in CML, is still effective.","['Zion, M', 'Ben-Yehuda, D', 'Avraham, A', 'Cohen, O', 'Wetzler, M', 'Melloul, D', 'Ben-Neriah, Y']","['Zion M', 'Ben-Yehuda D', 'Avraham A', 'Cohen O', 'Wetzler M', 'Melloul D', 'Ben-Neriah Y']","['Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, abl', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Mammals', 'Methylation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC45094,1994/10/25 00:00,1994/10/25 00:01,['1994/10/25 00:00'],"['1994/10/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/25 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.22.10722 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Oct 25;91(22):10722-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.22.10722.,"['abl', 'bcr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This gene encodes a putative transcription factor with homology to the zinc fingers and other domains of the Drosophila trithorax gene product and to the ""AT-hook"" motif of high mobility group proteins. To map potential transcriptional activation or repression domains of the MLL protein, yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain and MLL hybrid protein-expressing plasmids were cotransfected with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmids in a transient transfection system. We found that MLL contains a strong activation domain and a repression domain. The former, located telomeric (3') to the breakpoint region, activated transcription 18-fold to > 200-fold, depending on the promoter and cell line used for transfection. A repression domain that repressed transcription 4-fold was located centromeric (5') to the breakpoint region of MLL. The MLL AT-hook domain protein was expressed in bacteria and was utilized in a gel mobility shift assay to assess DNA-binding activity. The MLL AT-hook domain could bind cruciform DNA, recognizing structure rather than sequence of the target DNA. In translocations involving MLL, loss of an activation domain with retention of a repression domain and a DNA-binding domain on the der(11) chromosome could alter the expression of downstream target genes, suggesting a potential mechanism of action for MLL in leukemia.","['Zeleznik-Le, N J', 'Harden, A M', 'Rowley, J D']","['Zeleznik-Le NJ', 'Harden AM', 'Rowley JD']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL 60637.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Drosophila/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Insect', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mutagenesis', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Zinc Fingers']",PMC45071,1994/10/25 00:00,1994/10/25 00:01,['1994/10/25 00:00'],"['1994/10/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/25 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.22.10610 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Oct 25;91(22):10610-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.22.10610.,['MLL'],['CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

After reverse transcription, there can be a delay of many hours before the viral DNA is integrated. It is important for the retrovirus to ensure that the viral DNA does not integrate into itself during this period; such autointegration is a suicidal process that would result in destruction of the viral genome. Understanding of the mechanism that blocks autointegration of the viral DNA may lead to insights into how to inhibit viral replication by inducing the viral DNA to autointegrate. Evidence is presented in this report that viral nucleoprotein complexes isolated from cells infected with Moloney murine leukemia virus exhibit a barrier to autointegration. The barrier can be disrupted by high salt treatment and, subsequently, restored by addition of factors provided by a host cell extract.

The mouse agouti gene was recently cloned and shown to encode a distinctive 131-amino acid protein with a consensus signal peptide. Here we describe the cloning of the human homolog of the mouse agouti gene using an interspecies DNA-hybridization approach. Sequence analysis revealed that the coding region of the human agouti gene is 85% identical to the mouse gene and has the potential to encode a protein of 132 amino acids with a consensus signal peptide. Chromosomal assignment using somatic-cell-hybrid mapping panels and fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated that the human agouti gene maps to chromosome band 20q11.2. This result revealed that the human agouti gene is closely linked to several traits, including a locus called MODY (for maturity onset diabetes of the young) and another region that is associated with the development of myeloid leukemia.

Components of this network participate, upon stimulation, in a complex array of phosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interactions which leads to the formation of transient multimolecular complexes. Complexes containing products of the protooncogenes ras and raf-1 and the protein kinase MEK-1 activate the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which play a central role in the integration of different mitogenic signals by directly phosphorylating cytoplasmic and nuclear targets. In this report we present evidence that the kinase encoded by the tumor progression locus 2 gene (Tpl-2) contributes to the activation of the MAPK cascade. MAPK activation induced by the Tpl-2 protein is blocked by dominant negative mutants of Ras and Raf-1, whereas a kinase-deficient Tpl-2 mutant down-regulates mitogenic signals induced by v-Ha-Ras or v-Raf. These data suggest that Tpl-2 activates the MAPK cascade, perhaps through its participation in the assembly of Ras/Raf-1-containing multimolecular complexes.","['Patriotis, C', 'Makris, A', 'Chernoff, J', 'Tsichlis, P N']","['Patriotis C', 'Makris A', 'Chernoff J', 'Tsichlis PN']","['Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (Map3k8 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Activation', '*Genes, ras', 'Immunoblotting', 'Kidney', '*MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases', 'Mammals', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",PMC44895,1994/10/11 00:00,1994/10/11 00:01,['1994/10/11 00:00'],"['1994/10/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/11 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.21.9755 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Oct 11;91(21):9755-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.21.9755.,"['Tpl-2', 'raf-1', 'ras']","['CA06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA38047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR05539/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The engineered ribozymes, as well as antisense sequence complementary to the Mo-MLV psi packaging region, were cloned into the 3' untranslated region of the neomycin-resistance gene (neo). This was coupled to the simian virus 40 early promoter within the pSV2neo vector. For the ribozymes against the Mo-MLV psi site, the constructs were transfected into Mo-MLV-infected and virus-producing mouse NIH 3T3 cells. With the exception of one of the single ribozymes (the one least effective in cutting target RNA in vitro), all of the constructs effectively (70-80%) suppressed retrovirus production. These results demonstrate a direct correlation between in vitro cleavage and in vivo ribozyme-mediated virus suppression. In addition, a ribozyme targeted to the HIV-1 psi packaging site was engineered into the same vector and transfected into the human T-cell line SupT1. The transfectants were cloned and then challenged with HIV-1. When compared to vector-transfected control cells, a significant reduction in HIV-1 production was observed as measured by p24 and syncytia formation assays.

However, the generally low titers and inefficient infectivity of retroviral vectors in human cells have limited their use. We previously reported that the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus can serve as the exclusive envelope protein component for one specific retroviral vector, LGRNL, that expresses vesicular stomatitis virus G. We now report a more useful general transient transfection scheme for producing very high-titer vesicular stomatitis virus G-enveloped pseudotypes from any Moloney murine leukemia-based retroviral vector without having to rely on the expression of the cytotoxic G protein from the retroviral vector itself. We also demonstrate very high efficiency of infection with a pseudotyped lacZ vector in primary mouse hepatocytes. We suggest that pseudotyped retroviral vectors carrying reporter genes will permit genetic studies in many previously inaccessible vertebrate and invertebrate systems. Furthermore, because these vectors represent retroviral vectors of sufficiently high titer to allow efficient direct retroviral-mediated in vivo gene transfer, we also suggest that pseudotyped vectors carrying potentially therapeutic genes will become useful to test the potential for in vivo gene therapy.","['Yee, J K', 'Miyanohara, A', 'LaPorte, P', 'Bouic, K', 'Burns, J C', 'Friedmann, T']","['Yee JK', 'Miyanohara A', 'LaPorte P', 'Bouic K', 'Burns JC', 'Friedmann T']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibrosarcoma', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HeLa Cells', 'Helper Viruses', 'Humans', 'Liver/*metabolism/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Rats', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Retroviridae', 'Transfection/*methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus', 'beta-Galactosidase/analysis/biosynthesis']",PMC44853,1994/09/27 00:00,1994/09/27 00:01,['1994/09/27 00:00'],"['1994/09/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/27 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.20.9564 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Sep 27;91(20):9564-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.20.9564.,,"['CA58317/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD20034/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HL47119/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is usually assayed in fresh tissue or cell suspensions by enzyme analysis, immunofluorescence, or immunoperoxidase. We have obtained satisfactory staining for TdT in routinely processed paraffin sections using a recently described antigen retrieval pretreatment based on microwave oven heating of the sections and a polyclonal rabbit anti-TdT serum. With this technique, we assayed paraffin sections from lymph nodes of 91 patients with a variety of malignant lymphomas, including 35 cases of lymphoblastic lymphoma. The specificity of this immunoperoxidase method of TdT analysis was confirmed by comparing the results obtained with conventional TdT analysis by indirect immunofluorescence. Neoplastic cells from 33 of the 35 (94%) patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma were TdT positive with both techniques. All remaining 50 cases of other subtypes of malignant lymphoma were TdT negative. Specificity was further confirmed by demonstrating TdT-positive blasts in paraffin sections of bone marrow biopsies from 44 patients with TdT-positive (by indirect immunofluorescence) acute leukemias and in paraffin sections of extramedullary leukemic infiltrates from eight patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Other control material studied included eight lymph nodes with Hodgkin's disease, four normal spleen, seven reactive lymph nodes, and 25 nonneoplastic bone marrow samples, all of which gave the expected results, i.e., rare scattered TdT-positive cells in bone marrow and lymph nodes, absence of staining in Hodgkin's disease malignant cells and spleen.

The culture of ES cells requires a source of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), often provided by culture with a mouse fibroblast (STO) feeder layer, buffalo rat liver cell-conditioned media (BRL-CM), or the addition of recombinant LIF. To date, all of the ES cell culture systems use mammalian sources of LIF. We found that mouse ES cells can be maintained for over 10 passages in an undifferentiated state with media conditioned by a chicken liver cell line (LMH-CM) or on a feeder layer made with primary chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEF). These ES cells can undergo both spontaneous and induced differentiation, which is associated with the disappearance or reduction of the expression of alkaline phosphatase and SSEA-1, similar to that observed for ES cells cultured with BRL-CM or STO feeder layers. The ES cells cultured in LMH-CM did not express cytokeratin Endo-A antigen recognized by TROMA-1, but their differentiated progeny did express this antigen. In contrast to LMH-CM, Endo-A was expressed in ES cells cultured on CEF feeder layers and in differentiated progeny.

In the present study, we demonstrate that mda-6 (WAF1/CIP1) is an immediate early response gene induced during differentiation of the promyelocytic HL-60 leukemia cell line along the granulocytic or macrophage/monocyte pathway. mda-6 gene expression in HL-60 cells is induced within 1 to 3 h during differentiation along the macrophage/monocyte pathway evoked by 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Vit D3) or the granulocytic pathway produced by retinoic acid (RA) or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Immunoprecipitation analyses using an anti-p21 antibody indicate a temporal induction of p21 protein following treatment with TPA, DMSO or RA. A relationship between rapid induction of mda-6 gene expression and differentiation is indicated by a delay in this expression in an HL-60 cell variant resistant to TPA-induced growth arrest and differentiation. A similar delay in mda-6 gene expression is not observed in Vit D3 treated TPA-resistant variant cells that are also sensitive to induction of monocytic differentiation. Since HL-60 cells have a null-p53 phenotype, these results demonstrate that p21 induction occurs during initiation of terminal differentiation in a p53-independent manner. In this context, p21 may play a more global role in growth control and differentiation than originally envisioned.","['Jiang, H', 'Lin, J', 'Su, Z Z', 'Collart, F R', 'Huberman, E', 'Fisher, P B']","['Jiang H', 'Lin J', 'Su ZZ', 'Collart FR', 'Huberman E', 'Fisher PB']","['Department of Pathology, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,,"['Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Immediate-Early', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1994 Nov;9(11):3397-406.,['mda-6'],"['CA35675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43208/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that a significant proportion of the IRF-1 mRNA detected in normal human hematopoietic cells and cultured cell lines lacks exon 2 (containing the AUG initiation codon) and 3 as a result of exon skipping. Surprisingly, when we examined the bone marrow and peripheral mononuclear cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or leukemia secondary to MDS, we could still detect the exon-skipped form but little or none of the intact IRF-1 mRNA. This appears to be the result of accelerated exon skipping since we could find no mutations within the exons and splicing junctions from these patients. The exon-skipped form of IRF-1 lacking exons 2 and 3 displayed neither DNA binding nor tumor suppressive activities.

Here, we report that E2A-Pbx1 can also immortalize myeloid progenitors in vitro, and that the outgrowth of immortalized myeloblasts is evident only in the presence of the myeloid lymphokine, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). When cultured in the presence of GM-CSF, responsive myeloblasts from normal marrow exhibit concurrent proliferation and differentiation, and undergo terminal differentiation into non-mitotic neutrophils and macrophages within 4 weeks. Infection of identical cultures with a retrovirus encoding E2A-Pbx1 produces a rapid outgrowth of myeloid progenitors that express high levels of E2A-Pbx1 protein. A small fraction of myeloblasts in each population exhibited limited differentiation to neutrophils, and all populations of myeloblasts retained a strict dependence on GM-CSF for both survival and proliferation. This data suggests that the function of E2A-Pbx1 in leukemias is to strongly retard differentiation without affecting growth-factor dependence.","['Kamps, M P', 'Wright, D D']","['Kamps MP', 'Wright DD']","['Department of Pathology, University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine, La Jolla 92093-0612.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCF Transcription Factors)', '0 (TCF7L1 protein, human)', '0 (Tcf7l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*physiology', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'TCF Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1994 Nov;9(11):3159-66.,,['5 RO1 CA 56876-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Tax binding site on NF-kappa B p50 is the Rel homology domain, which is conserved in the Rel/NF-kappa B family proteins. The formations of these complexes by Tax mutants were well correlated with their transactivating capacities.

Necropsy was performed 3 days later and the results rated for pathology (i.e., severity of lesions observed). Age-related performance declines were observed in all behavioral tests except 15-min locomotor activity. Strain effects were observed in 15-min (BN more active than F344 and F1) and 24-h locomotor activity test (F344 more active than BN and F1 strains); rotorod performance (F344 fell more than BN and F1); and in all measures [errors (E), runtime (RT)], shock frequency (SF), and duration (SD)] in the 14-unit T maze (F344 worse than BN, BN worse than F1).

In a second experiment, only 7- and 31-month-old F1 rats were tested in the 14-unit T maze and the results obtained in Experiment 1 were replicated. Gross necropsy revealed age and strain effects in the number of lesions observed and the mean ratings of pathology. The 24-month-old F344 rats exhibited the greatest number of lesions and had the highest ratings (generally observed as chronic nephrosis and enlarged spleens characteristic of mononuclear cell leukemia). BN rats exhibited a high incidence of hydronephrosis at all age levels. While experiencing less obvious pathology, F1 rats experienced a significant number of lesions in the 31-month-old group. Pathology ratings correlated with behavioral performance but only for a few tests (e.g., SD and RT in 14 unit T maze in 24-month-old F344). Thus, behavioral performance declined with age and the battery of tests differentiated between the strains tested (in general, F344 worse than BN; BN worse than F1). The correlation of pathology ratings at gross necropsy with behavior did not appear to be systematic, suggesting that morbidity was not responsible for the age-related performance declines. However, more extensive evaluation of the relationship of age-related changes in health status to behavior with larger samples of rats is suggested.","['Spangler, E L', 'Waggie, K S', 'Hengemihle, J', 'Roberts, D', 'Hess, B', 'Ingram, D K']","['Spangler EL', 'Waggie KS', 'Hengemihle J', 'Roberts D', 'Hess B', 'Ingram DK']","['Molecular Physiology and Genetics Section, Nathan W.

Red cell ferritin correlated with serum ferritin, however, serum ferritin level remained above normal range during all phases of the disease. A negative correlation between red cell ferritin and hemoglobin (Hb) (r = -0.605, p < 0.001) suggested that red cell ferritin level reflected the rate of iron utilization for heme synthesis. Decreased red cell iron stores observed in the remission may be explained by regression of dyserythropoiesis and by restoration of normal Hb synthesis after busulphan treatment. A progressive dyserythropoiesis in the blast crisis may lead to an increased red cell ferritin level.","['Cermak, J', 'Voglova, J', 'Brabec, V', 'Neuwirt, J', 'Chrobak, L']","['Cermak J', 'Voglova J', 'Brabec V', 'Neuwirt J', 'Chrobak L']","['Department of Clinical Hematology Teaching Hospital, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Transferrin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,,"['Biopsy', 'Blast Crisis/blood/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/*chemistry', 'Female', 'Ferritins/*blood', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iron/blood/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Reference Values', 'Transferrin/metabolism']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 1994;41(4):217-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For those with HLA-identical siblings, the question of whether to perform a bone marrow transplantation or to continue chemotherapy has not been answered. METHODS: We compared the results of treatment with marrow transplants from HLA-identical siblings in 376 children, as reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, with the results of chemotherapy in 540 children treated by the Pediatric Oncology Group. A preliminary analysis identified variables associated with treatment failure in both groups. We selected cohorts by matching these variables. A possible bias associated with differences in the interval between remission and treatment was controlled for by choosing matched pairs in which the duration of the second remission in the chemotherapy recipient was at least as long as the time between the second remission and transplantation in the transplant recipient. A total of 255 matched pairs were studied. RESULTS: The mean (+/- SE) probability of a relapse at five years was significantly lower among the transplant recipients than among the chemotherapy recipients (45 +/- 4 percent vs. 80 +/- 3 percent, P < 0.001). At five years the probability of leukemia-free survival was higher after transplantation than after chemotherapy (40 +/- 3 percent vs. 17 +/- 3 percent, P < 0.001). The relative benefit of transplantation as compared with chemotherapy was similar in children with prognostic factors indicating a high or low risk of relapse (the duration of the first remission, age, leukocyte count at the time of the diagnosis, and phenotype of the leukemic cells). CONCLUSIONS: For children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a second remission, bone marrow transplants from HLA-identical siblings result in fewer relapses and longer leukemia-free survival than does chemotherapy.","['Barrett, A J', 'Horowitz, M M', 'Pollock, B H', 'Zhang, M J', 'Bortin, M M', 'Buchanan, G R', 'Camitta, B M', 'Ochs, J', 'Graham-Pole, J', 'Rowlings, P A']","['Barrett AJ', 'Horowitz MM', 'Pollock BH', 'Zhang MJ', 'Bortin MM', 'Buchanan GR', 'Camitta BM', 'Ochs J', 'Graham-Pole J', 'Rowlings PA', 'et al.']","['National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, Md.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens', '*Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Probability', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1994/11/10 00:00,1994/11/10 00:01,['1994/11/10 00:00'],"['1994/11/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/10 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199411103311902 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1994 Nov 10;331(19):1253-8. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199411103311902.,,"['CA-33625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA-40053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10-CA-29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,"['N Engl J Med. 1995 Mar 23;332(12):823-4.

The murine transcription factor Ets-1 was shown to bind to the LVb and LVc elements of the enhancer by DNase I protection and methylation interference assays. Enhancers containing disrupted Ets-1 binding sites were tested in transient expression assays in the murine T-cell line EL4.E1; alterations in the LVb element affected constitutive enhancer activity, while mutation of either the LVb or LVc element disrupted phorbol ester-induced enhancer activity. Members of the ets gene family of proteins display similar DNA-binding properties; therefore, we speculated that ets proteins other than Ets-1 also might bind these elements. Crude nuclear extracts of EL4.E1 cells were assayed to identify the protein(s) that potentially functions at the LVb element. The predominant binding activity was not Ets-1 but rather two independent DNA-protein complexes that comigrated in mobility shift assays. UV cross-linking and denaturing gel electrophoresis sized the two DNA-binding species, which we denoted p55 and p100. Immunoprecipitation combined with UV cross-linking identified p55 as the alpha subunit of GA-binding protein. The DNA-binding properties of p100 and several ets proteins were compared. Similarities suggested that p100 is also an ETS domain protein, possibly Elf-1. This strategy could be used to identify other ETS domain proteins in crude nuclear extracts.

Tax acts indirectly by inducing or modifying the action of various host transcription factors, including members of the NF-kappa B/Rel family of enhancer-binding proteins. In resting T cells, many of these NF-kappa B/Rel factors are sequestered in the cytoplasm by various ankyrin-rich inhibitory proteins, including I kappa B alpha. HTLV-I Tax expression leads to the constitutive nuclear expression of biologically active NF-kappa B and c-Rel complexes; however, the biochemical mechanism(s) underlying this response remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that Tax-stimulated nuclear expression of NF-kappa B in both HTLV-I-infected and Tax-transfected human T cells is associated with the phosphorylation and rapid proteolytic degradation of I kappa B alpha. In contrast to prior in vitro studies, at least a fraction of the phosphorylated form of I kappa B alpha remains physically associated with the NF-kappa B complex in vivo but is subject to rapid degradation, thereby promoting the nuclear translocation of the active NF-kappa B complex. We further demonstrate that Tax induction of nuclear c-Rel expression is activated by the RelA (p65) subunit of NF-kappa B, which activates transcription of the c-rel gene through an intrinsic kappa B enhancer element. In normal cells, the subsequent accumulation of nuclear c-Rel acts to inhibit its own continued production, indicating the presence of an autoregulatory loop. However, the pathologic action HTLV-I Tax leads to the deregulated and sustained nuclear expression of both NF-kappa B and c-Rel, a response that may contribute to HTLV-I-induced T-cell transformation.","['Sun, S C', 'Elwood, J', 'Beraud, C', 'Greene, W C']","['Sun SC', 'Elwood J', 'Beraud C', 'Greene WC']","['Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco 94141-9100, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/virology', 'Transcription Factor RelA', 'Transcriptional Activation']",PMC359272,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.14.11.7377-7384.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1994 Nov;14(11):7377-84. doi: 10.1128/mcb.14.11.7377-7384.1994.,"['c-rel', 'tax']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that HMBA causes a rapid decrease in the level of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk4) protein. This decrease results from decreased stability of the protein, while the rate of synthesis of the protein is not affected by HMBA. The decrease in the level of cdk4 protein is followed by suppression of the pRB kinase activity associated with cdk4. Cyclin D3, which can bind and activated cdk4, is increased in HMBA-induced cells and is found in complex with pRB and the transcription factor E2F. In uninduced cells cyclin D3 complexes with pRB and E2F are barely detected. At the later stages of differentiation, MEL cells become arrested in G1 and cdk2 kinase activity is suppressed; this is accompanied by a decrease in the level of cyclin A and cdk2 proteins.

In contrast, overexpression of cdk2 protein does not inhibit induced differentiation.

The insertionally activated transcripts encode protein products which have constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and can induce erythroleukemia but not sarcomas. We have previously found that a valine-to-isoleucine point mutation at position 157 (V157I mutant) within the tyrosine kinase domain of this truncated erbB can dramatically activate the sarcomagenic potential of the oncogene and increase the kinase activity of this oncoprotein. This mutation lies at position 157 of the insertionally activated c-erbB product, affecting a highly conserved valine residue of the glycine loop involved in ATP binding and phosphate transfer. To investigate the functional importance of this residue in the catalytic activity of kinases, we have introduced at this position, by site-directed mutagenesis, codons representing the remaining 18 amino acid residues. Most of the mutants have diminished activity, with six of them completely devoid of kinase activity, indicating the sensitivity of this region to conformational changes. Some of these mutants displayed increased kinase activity and greater transforming potential in comparison with IA c-erbB, but none had levels as high as those of the V157I mutant. In general, the sarcomagenic potential of the various erbB mutants correlated with their autophosphorylation state and their ability to cause phosphorylation of MAP kinase. However, there are important exceptions such as the V157G mutant, which lacks enhanced autophosphorylation but is highly sarcomagenic. Studies of this and other autophosphorylation site mutants point to the existence of an autophosphorylation-independent pathway in sarcomagenesis. The requirement for leukemogenic potential is much less stringent and correlates with positivity of kinase activity. When the valine-to-isoleucine substitution was put in context of the full-length erbB protein, the mutation relaxed the ligand dependence and had a positive effect on the transforming potential of the full-length c-erbB.","['Shu, H K', 'Chang, C M', 'Ravi, L', 'Ling, L', 'Castellano, C M', 'Walter, E', 'Pelley, R J', 'Kung, H J']","['Shu HK', 'Chang CM', 'Ravi L', 'Ling L', 'Castellano CM', 'Walter E', 'Pelley RJ', 'Kung HJ']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'HG18B9YRS7 (Valine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Point Mutation', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*genetics', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Valine/genetics']",PMC359217,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.14.10.6868-6878.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1994 Oct;14(10):6868-78. doi: 10.1128/mcb.14.10.6868-6878.1994.,,"['CA39207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60171/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08-CA01199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inactivation of PML function in APL may play a critical role in APL pathogenesis. Our results demonstrated that PML, but not PML-RAR alpha, is a growth suppressor. This is supported by the following findings: (i) PML suppressed anchorage-independent growth of APL-derived NB4 cells on soft agar and tumorigenicity in nude mice, (ii) PML suppressed the oncogenic transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts by cooperative oncogenes, and (iii) PML suppressed transformation of NIH 3T3 cells by the activated neu oncogene. Cotransfection of PML with PML-RAR alpha resulted in a significant reduction in PML's transformation suppressor function in vivo, indicating that the fusion protein can be a dominant negative inhibitor of PML function in APL cells. This observation was further supported by the finding that cotransfection of PML and PML-RAR alpha resulted in altered normal cellular localization of PML. Our results also demonstrated that PML, but not PML-RAR alpha, is a promoter-specific transcription suppressor.

Induced expression of cellular genes is thought to be important for transformation of T cells to continued growth, a prelude to the establishment of adult T-cell leukemia. However, neither underlying mechanisms nor kinetics of the Tax-mediated activation of NF-kappa B are understood. We have analyzed a permanently transfected Jurkat T-cell line in which the expression of Tax is entirely dependent on addition of heavy metals. The initial NF-kappa B binding activity seen after induction of Tax is due almost exclusively to p50/p65 heterodimers. At later times, NF-kappa B complexes containing c-Rel and/or p52 accumulate. The early activation of p50/p65 complexes is a posttranslational event, since neither mRNA nor protein levels of NF-kappa B subunits had increased at that time. We demonstrate for the first time a Tax-induced proteolytic degradation of the NF-kappa B inhibitor, I kappa B-alpha, which may trigger the initial nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B. As nuclear NF-kappa B rapidly and potently stimulates resynthesis of I kappa B-alpha, the steady-state level of I kappa B-alpha does not significantly change. Thus, the dramatic Tax-induced increase in the I kappa B-alpha turnover may continually weaken inhibition and activate NF-kappa B. Additional, distinct actions of Tax may contribute further to the high levels of NF-kappa B activity seen.","['Kanno, T', 'Brown, K', 'Franzoso, G', 'Siebenlist, U']","['Kanno T', 'Brown K', 'Franzoso G', 'Siebenlist U']","['Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Chlorides)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Zinc Compounds)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '86Q357L16B (zinc chloride)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",IM,,"['Chlorides/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Endopeptidases/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit', 'T-Lymphocytes/*microbiology', 'Transcription Factor RelA', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Compounds/pharmacology']",PMC359174,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.14.10.6443-6451.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1994 Oct;14(10):6443-51. doi: 10.1128/mcb.14.10.6443-6451.1994.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although quinine (SQ1) and quinidine are reversal agents and inhibitors of the MDR pump, the results from in vivo experiments and in vitro experiments with these diastereomers are contradictory. These observations suggest that an oxidized metabolite of SQ1 is a more potent inhibitor of the MDR pump than is the parent compound. The chemical synthesis of the epoxides of SQ1 and quinidine is reported. The epoxy compounds have been tested as inhibitors of the ATP-dependent MDR pump in human CEM/VLB100 cells. The procedure is based on preloading the cells with an inhibitor and a low concentration of a substrate, rhodamine 123 (R123). After several cold rinses, the cell suspension is passed through a filtration-flow apparatus and the R123 in the filtrate (determined by fluorescence measurements) reveals the initial efflux of R123 through the MDR pump.

The greatest increase in survival rate from 1973 until 1987 has been achieved in hematopoietic tumors such as acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), in which survival increased from 47.6% (1973-1977) to 60.8% (1983-1987), and Burkitt's lymphoma in which survival increased from 27.6% (1973-1977) to 68.7% (1983-1987).

Flattening in the survival rates since 1978-1982 has been observed for acute leukemia, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, and osteosarcoma. Females have better survival rates for most pediatric tumors, except Hodgkin's disease. Analysis of race of childhood leukemia confirmed that black children have worse survival than white.

Observed flattening in the survival rates since 1978-1982 of leukemia and some solid tumors warrants further follow-up.","['Novakovic, B']",['Novakovic B'],"['Genetic Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'African Americans', 'Brain Neoplasms/mortality', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Population Surveillance', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality', '*SEER Program', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Whites']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950230606 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1994;23(6):480-6. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950230606.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients included 14 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), 1 with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), 1 with juvenile CML, 4 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 1 with acute nonlymphocytic leukaemia. Eleven had an allogeneic BMT from an HLA-matched sibling, and 1 from an unrelated donor. Nine patients received 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide purged autologous marrow. Median time to myeloid engraftment (ANC > 500/microliters) was 19 days in allogeneic BMT patients and 28 days in autologous BMT patients (P < .01). Mucositis was the major regimen-related toxicity (RRT). GI toxicity in the form of diarrhoea affected ten patients and five had veno-occlusive disease of the liver. Two patients had mild bladder toxicity and one died of renal toxicity. There was no CNS or cardiac toxicity. There was no significant difference in the incidence of toxicity according to the type of BMT (autologous or allogeneic), total dose, or sequence of TBI. With a median follow-up of 44 months, ten patients are alive (6/12 allogeneic BMT patients and 4/9 autologous BMT patients). Of the 11 deaths, four were related to toxicity (2 aspergillus, 1 haemorrhage following liver biopsy, and 1 from haemolytic-uraemic syndrome), and 4/12 allogeneic and 4/9 autologous BMT patients died from relapsed disease.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-eight eligible patients with previously untreated disseminated non-lymphoblastic lymphoma were enrolled on a Childrens Cancer Group study. Therapy included cycles of chemotherapy, systemic and intrathecal (IT), ever 3 weeks for a total maximal duration of 57 weeks. Fifty-five patients had small non-cleaved cell lymphoma (SNCCL) and 13 had diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL). Forty-seven were stage III, six were stage IV, and 15 had B-ALL; 13 had central nervous system (CNS) involvement. RESULTS: Four year event-free survival (EFS) was 53% (SE +/- 12%). Stage III SNCCL patients with LDH < 500 IU/L achieved an improved EFS compared to other SNCCL patients (86% vs. 42% 4 year EFS, P = .072). The primary site of failure for advanced stage SNCCL patients was the CNS. All Ki-1-positive DLCL patients relapsed. Patterns of failure, time to relapse, and outcome following relapse differed between SNCCL and DLCL patients. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced stage SNCCL requires better CNS-directed chemotherapy to reduce the CNS failure rate; however, the achievement of durable disease-free survival in four of 11 patients with CNS disease without use of cranial irradiation suggests merit for further evaluation of chemotherapy-only strategies. DLCL patients do not need intensive CNS-directed chemotherapy.","['Finlay, J L', 'Anderson, J R', 'Cecalupo, A J', 'Hutchinson, R J', 'Kadin, M E', 'Kjeldsberg, C R', 'Provisor, A J', 'Woods, W G', 'Meadows, A T']","['Finlay JL', 'Anderson JR', 'Cecalupo AJ', 'Hutchinson RJ', 'Kadin ME', 'Kjeldsberg CR', 'Provisor AJ', 'Woods WG', 'Meadows AT']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'CHOP protocol']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/administration & dosage', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950230602 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1994;23(6):453-63. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950230602.,,"['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 05436/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is shown how doctrinal, regulatory and legal hypertrophy produced by radiation protection often results in poor medical surveillance. This situation also arises by virtue of the rigid application of the ALARA principle (primary prevention) that considers workers in most cases as ""virtually exposed"". National regulations tend to privilege diagnostic exploration of deterministic damage, applying selective criteria to ""slices"" of the ""state of health"", whereas a global evaluation is required by the ICRP and by EEC regulations. In this context, there is a veiled intention, by now historically consolidated, to use such diagnostic tests as biodosimetric indicators. Another and persistent cause for concern is the practice of acquiring data on the radiosensitivity of some organs and systems for the (unlikely) occurrence of an accident. Instead, less consideration seems to be given to the early diagnosis of stochastic damage (leukemia and solid tumours). The physician has to confront not only the possible tumours due to occupational irradiation, but inevitably and prevalently (and often exclusively) the so-called ""spontaneous"" tumours that lead to an estimated mortality of 25% or more. Both radio-induced and spontaneous are in the end clinically observed in their globality, without distinction. In this context, medical surveillance undoubtedly acquires obligations with regard to tumour prevention (secondary prevention), considering also that sites with a high coefficient of risk of tumoral radio-induction basically coincide with the most frequently occurring cancers in the average population. Based on the above considerations, a diagnostic protocol is proposed that reconciles, with due economy but with the right balance, the real requirements of medical surveillance, reducing as far as possible undesirable effects such as ""damage from excessive protection"" (often of a formal character) and patient/physician delay, which is extremely dangerous for the early diagnosis of tumours.","['Gelas, M', 'Giraud, M', 'Righi, E', 'Tobajas, L']","['Gelas M', 'Giraud M', 'Righi E', 'Tobajas L']","['Service Medical, Compagnie Generale des Matieres Nucleaires (COGEMA), Velizy-Villacoublay, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Med Lav,La Medicina del lavoro,0401176,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/radiation effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lens, Crystalline/radiation effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/diagnosis/*prevention & control', 'Occupational Diseases/diagnosis/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Ovary/radiation effects', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Injuries/diagnosis/*prevention & control', '*Radiation Protection', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Testis/radiation effects']",,1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Lav. 1994 May-Jun;85(3):193-204.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, the occurrence of mild GVHD could be desirable in high-risk leukemic patients, due to a relapse-preventing effect known as the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. Given that different prophylactic interventions are available to prevent GVHD development, the decision problem consists in assessing both type and dosage of the drugs in order to avoid or induce GVHD, according to the specific patient's condition. The decision problem can be represented and solved by using an influence diagram. The choice of this formalism allows using new available methods for building and updating the model of the decision problem. The qualitative structure of the model and the conditional probabilities were first derived by combining literature results with a medical expert's judgement. More specifically, probabilities were initially assigned as ranges rather than as point values. Then, conditional probabilities were updated, by using a learning algorithm, as new cases became available. The authors analyzed 50 cases of pediatric patients affected by either malignant or nonmalignant diseases, undergoing BMT and receiving GVHD prophylaxis. They used the first 25 cases to adjust the initially assigned conditional probabilities, then checked the model obtained on the remaining patients.

Those who work in the nuclear industry are exposed to low-level predominantly gamma radiation for longer periods, and provide an alternative direct source of information. We have combined mortality data from seven cohort studies on nearly 96,000 nuclear industry workers monitored for external radiation in Canada, UK, and USA to assess directly the carcinogenic effects of protracted low-dose exposure to ionising radiation. The excess relative risk for death from leukaemia, excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, was 2.2 per Sv (90% Cl 0.1 to 5.7). This estimate is intermediate between the linear estimate of 3.7 per Sv and the linear-quadratic estimate (as used in recent leukaemia risk assessments) of 1.4 per Sv derived from Japanese atomic bomb survivors' data. The excess relative risk for death from all cancers, excluding leukaemia, was -0.07 per Sv (90% Cl -0.4 to 0.3). This estimate is consistent with a range of risks varying from negative to nearly twice those estimated from atomic bomb survivors (0.18 per Sv).

The data are consistent with a transmissible genetic instability induced in a stem cell resulting in a diversity of aberrations in its clonal progeny many cell divisions later.","['Kadhim, M A', 'Lorimore, S A', 'Hepburn, M D', 'Goodhead, D T', 'Buckle, V J', 'Wright, E G']","['Kadhim MA', 'Lorimore SA', 'Hepburn MD', 'Goodhead DT', 'Buckle VJ', 'Wright EG']","['Department of Haematology, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,,IM,,"['*Alpha Particles', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*radiation effects/ultrastructure', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/radiation effects/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology/genetics', '*Linear Energy Transfer', 'Mice']",,1994/10/08 00:00,1994/10/08 00:01,['1994/10/08 00:00'],"['1994/10/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/08 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0140-6736(94)91643-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0140-6736(94)91643-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1994 Oct 8;344(8928):987-8. doi: 10.1016/s0140-6736(94)91643-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: We reviewed our experience with 90 adult patients with ALL examined at the Mayo Clinic between 1982 and 1992 and used it as a background for discussion of prognostic factors and management options in adult patients with ALL. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The pretreatment characteristics of patients, types of induction chemotherapy, and postremission treatment, including bone marrow transplantation (BMT), were analyzed for prognostic significance for each of three outcomes: complete remission (CR) rate, duration of CR, and overall survival of patients. RESULTS: Of the 90 study patients, 80 had received induction chemotherapy. Overall long-term survival for treated patients was 25%. None of the 10 patients younger than 18 years of age underwent BMT, and their long-term survival was 80%. Of the other 70 patients, who were 18 years old or older, 42 (60%) had a CR with induction chemotherapy. Of these 42 patients, 31 did not undergo BMT, and their long-term survival was less than 13%. BMT was done in six patients during a first CR (with 100% survival), in four during a later CR (with 50% survival), and in six with disease (with 17% survival). The median age of patients who received chemotherapy was 50 years (range, 19 to 87) and that of patients who underwent BMT was 34 years (range, 18 to 46). Overall, age was the only significant prognostic factor. CONCLUSION: With our application of current chemotherapy, the outcome in adult patients (18 years old or older) with ALL was dismal. The results were considerably better in patients younger than 18 years of age or in those who underwent BMT as post-remission therapy. Comprehensive assessment of our experience and that in the literature, however, did not resolve issues about current management. Participation of patients in comparative trials is critical for determining the best therapy for ALL in adults.","['Ho, T C', 'Tefferi, A', 'Su, J Q', 'Litzow, M R', 'Hoagland, H C', 'Noel, P']","['Ho TC', 'Tefferi A', 'Su JQ', 'Litzow MR', 'Hoagland HC', 'Noel P']","['Mayo Medical School, Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota 55905.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mayo Clin Proc,Mayo Clinic proceedings,0405543,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/etiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0025-6196(12)61817-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0025-6196(12)61817-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Mayo Clin Proc. 1994 Oct;69(10):937-48. doi: 10.1016/s0025-6196(12)61817-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retinoids represent a potentially useful class of drugs in chemoprevention. Preclinical data and clinical experience suggests that different retinoids may have different spectra of antitumour activity and synergistic interactions between retinoids and cytokines have also been reported. 13-cis retinoic acid has shown some promising activity in preventing the onset of second primary tumours in head and neck cancer and fenretinide is being tested in the prevention of second primary breast cancers. An understanding fo the role of the different retinoid receptors could lead to the design of compounds with a better therapeutic index. Despite these early indications that retinoids could be useful in this area, the development of such drugs is far from easy. Appropriate study designs for screening differentiating agents in the clinic, and the relevance of preclinical models of chemoprevention are challenges to be addressed. Unresolved issues include optimal patient selection, long clinical trial times, optimal dose, schedule and treatment duration. The use of biological surrogate markers for longer time-dependent trial endpoints could significantly contribute to more rapid development. Ongoing clinical studies, particularly in tobacco-related diseases, will better define the role of retinoids in this clinical setting. Clinicians should be encouraged to enter patients into large well organized clinical studies.","['Man, T']",['Man T'],"['Roche International Clinical Research Centre, Lingolsheim, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Retinoids)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', 'EH28UP18IF (Isotretinoin)']",IM,,"['Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Fenretinide/therapeutic use', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Isotretinoin/therapeutic use', 'Lung Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Retinoids/*therapeutic use', 'Risk Factors']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Oct;8(10):1785-90.,,,15,,,,,,,,,,,,

This finding has led to the hypothesis that a recessive oncogene may be present in the DNA common to both sex chromosomes, that is the pseudoautosomal region. The alpha chain of the receptor for the hemopoietic growth factor GM-CSF has recently been mapped to the human pseudoautosomal region and, given the role of this molecule in the control of normal hemopoiesis, it is thought to be a good candidate gene. This paper examines the structure, expression, and sequence of the GM-CSF receptor alpha chain gene (GMR alpha) in three primary AML-M2,XO samples and one AML-M2,XO cell line. Results of this work show no gross rearrangement or loss of the remaining allele of GMR alpha, detectable expression of its transcript and protein, and no changes at the nucleotide sequence level. Thus, we find no evidence to support a role for the GM-CSF receptor alpha chain molecule in the development of AML-M2,XO leukemias.","['Brown, M A', 'Harrison-Smith, M', 'DeLuca, E', 'Begley, C G', 'Gough, N M']","['Brown MA', 'Harrison-Smith M', 'DeLuca E', 'Begley CG', 'Gough NM']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', '*Sex Chromosomes']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Oct;8(10):1774-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eight patients presented with acute type ATLL and one had a chronic form lasting for 16 months prior to the development of the acute phase. Lymph node histology (three cases) was consistent with a T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (large and small cells). Antibodies to HTLV-I were detected by ELISA and particle agglutination in the serum from eight of nine patients. DNA analysis showed HTLV-I proviral DNA in all seven cases investigated, including the single serologically negative patient. In five cases, HTLV-I was monoclonally integrated and in one case oligoclonal. In the seventh case viral DNA clonal status was ambiguous.

NB4 cells differentiate into granulocytes in response to all-trans retinoic acid, but little is known about the ability of these cells to form monocytes and macrophages. We show here that NB4 cells treated individually with a variety of agents, including recombinant human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D3 (1,25 D3) or 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), resulted in only partial or incomplete differentiation along the monocyte/macrophage pathway. However, when M-CSF was combined with TPA, or 1,25 D3 with TPA, a synergistic response was observed such that differentiation to fully functioning monocytes or macrophages occurred. In contrast, 1,25 D3 with M-CSF resulted in only a modest increase in the number of non-specific esterase positive cells and no increase in the phagocytic activity (ingestion of latex beads) when compared to either agent alone. We suggest that TPA and 1,25 D3 are monocyte/macrophage-specific differentiation inducing agents in NB4 cells but that both are required to achieve optimal macrophage function. We suggest a model for the synergistic action of TPA and 1,25 D3 and propose that inducing monocytic differentiation could also be considered in designing clinical protocols for the treatment of acute leukemia.","['Bhatia, M', 'Kirkland, J B', 'Meckling-Gill, K A']","['Bhatia M', 'Kirkland JB', 'Meckling-Gill KA']","['Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.1.- (Esterases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Esterases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology/pathology']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Oct;8(10):1744-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The absence of receptors on granulocytes raised a problem with the observed ability of IL-6 to stimulate granulocyte colony formation in mouse bone marrow cultures. Analysis showed that this colony formation was linear with respect to cultured cell numbers and that IL-6 was able to stimulate granulocyte colony formation by at least some transferred isolated clones or individual blast colony cells recultured in the absence of other cell types.

DAH treatment (2 g/kg/day) given for 95 days as a single daily i.p. injection to DBA/2 mice either 3 or 12 days following inoculation with a high dose (10(3) plaque-forming units) of FV-P resulted in a marked increase in the mean survival time of treated animals (212 and 191%, respectively). Since FV-P elicits spleen enlargement and polycythemia, we examined the effects of DAH on spleen size, spleen-nucleated cell number, and hematocrit, in normal and FV-P infected mice, at different times in the course of continuous DAH treatments. DAH treatment initiated 3 days after viral infection inhibits the virus-induced splenomegaly, with at day 26 p.i. 1.15 x 10(8) and 12.6 x 10(8) nucleated cells per spleen observed in DAH-treated mice and untreated mice respectively, whereas only 1.03 x 10(8) nucleated cells were observed in uninfected mice. Furthermore, DAH prevents virus-induced polycythemia: on day 26, an hematocrit of 39% was measured in DAH-treated mice as compared to 60% in untreated mice. DAH treatment initiated 12 days after viral infection reduces splenomegaly, the number of nucleated spleen cells and the hematocrit of infected mice. DAH treatment initiated 3 days after viral infection prevents the tremendous increase of CFU-E in the spleen of infected mice: on day 11, the spleen of infected mice contained 4.6 x 10(6) CFU-E, while the spleen of treated mice only contained 26 x 10(3) CFU-E, and on day 26 the spleen CFU-E numbers were 45.4 x 10(6) and 1.5 x 10(6) in untreated and treated infected mice, respectively. In control uninfected mice, DAH treatment induced a transient decrease in spleen CFU-E followed by a rebound phenomenon. In vitro, preincubation with DAH inhibits colony formation by FV-P infected CFU-E, at doses starting at 3 mM, as compared to uninfected CFU-E. These data show that DAH inhibits the expression of the retroviral infection, and appears to preferentially inhibit the proliferation of infected target cells (CFU-E) in vivo.","['Tournaire, R', 'Arnaud, S', 'Hamedi-Sangsari, F', 'Malley, S', 'Grange, J', 'Blanchet, J P', 'Dore, J F', 'Vila, J']","['Tournaire R', 'Arnaud S', 'Hamedi-Sangsari F', 'Malley S', 'Grange J', 'Blanchet JP', 'Dore JF', 'Vila J']","['INSERM U. 218, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '20154-32-9 (beta-aspartylhydroxamic acid)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Asparagine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/complications/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Polycythemia/etiology/prevention & control', 'Retroviridae Infections/complications/mortality/*pathology', 'Spleen/drug effects/pathology', 'Splenomegaly/etiology/prevention & control', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/complications/mortality/*pathology']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Oct;8(10):1703-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ninety-three patients had evaluable PCR assays for both the p190bcr-abl and p210bcr-abl type of BCR-ABL gene rearrangements. Twenty-one of 93 patients (23%) were positive for the BCR-ABL rearrangement by the PCR assay. Fourteen of these patients had the p210brc-abl BCR-ABL rearrangement characteristically seen in CML patients, while seven had the p190bcr-abl rearrangement seen in ALL alone. Of 61 patients analyzed, both with conventional cytogenetics and PCR, eight (13%) were positive for the Ph1, while 14 (23%) were positive for the BCR-ABL rearrangement by the PCR assay. Discordance between the PCR assay and cytogenetics occurred in eight cases where the PCR assay was positive and the cytogenetics negative, and two cases where the PCR assay was negative and cytogenetics positive. PCR positivity did not correlate with treatment response, survival, or relapse-free survival, but there was a higher percentage of L2 FAB morphology in the PCR+ cases compared to the PCR-cases (67 vs. 28%, p = 0.003). In addition, the data suggested that patients with a p190bcr-abl rearrangement have a better response to induction therapy, but a worse relapse-free survival compared to patients with a p210bcr-abl breakpoint, but these differences were not statistically significant. These data suggest that PCR and conventional cytogenetics may provide complementary information, since there appear to be a subset of patients who are Ph1-negative yet BCR-ABL positive by PCR.

Using a DNA probe directed to the centromere of chromosome 8, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on archival Wright-stained blood and bone marrow smears of seven patients with CML and with a known +8 clone by metaphase cytogenetics to determine the distribution of +8 in interphase cells. All slides had been stored at ambient temperature for 12-26 months. The bone marrow aspirate smears of 21 non-leukemic patients served as controls. Trisomy 8 was demonstrated in all myeloid cell lines including the neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and erythroid precursors, but not in the lymphocytes. The extra chromosome 8 was present in mature segmented granulocytes as well as more immature precursors. The percentage of +8 cells was highest in specimens from patients with CML in myeloid blast crisis (mean 64%), followed by those in accelerated phase (mean 39%). Three specimens from patients in morphologic chronic phase showed the lowest percentage of +8 cells (mean 13%). One patient was studied twice and showed a substantial expansion of +8 cells with progression from accelerated phase to myeloid blast crisis. Compared to metaphase cytogenetics, the proportion of +8 cells detected by FISH was often lower. We conclude that the acquisition of trisomy 8 in CML occurs in a pluripotent myeloid stem cell apparently incapable of expressing mature lymphoid phenotype, and that morphologic progression of disease is generally associated with an expansion of the +8 component.","['Nguyen, P L', 'Arthur, D C', 'Litz, C E', 'Brunning, R D']","['Nguyen PL', 'Arthur DC', 'Litz CE', 'Brunning RD']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Minnesota Hospital and Clinic, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Blast Crisis/blood/genetics/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/pathology', '*Trisomy']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Oct;8(10):1654-62.,,['CA 21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the 'evolution' of MDS to AML we compared the karyotypes of MDS patients at presentation and at development of AML. Of 170 patients with MDS who developed AML, 63 had banded karyotypes done at both time points. Fifteen patients had refractory anemia (RA) or RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), 27 had RA with excess blasts (RAEB), and 21 had RAEB in transformation (RAEBT). Patients had MDS for at least 12 weeks prior to developing AML. Thirty-one patients received cytotoxic therapy for MDS. Seventeen of 63 patients (27%) acquired a cytogenetic change when they developed AML. This percentage was significantly higher in RA/RARS patients compared to RAEB/RAEBT (53.3 vs. 18.8%, p < 0.01). Age, prior malignancy, cytotoxic therapy for MDS, and time to development of AML did not influence the probability of acquiring a cytogenetic change. The small number of patients did not allow testing for the effect of specific karyotypes on the incidence of cytogenetic change or the effect of this change on AML prognosis. The only recurring cytogenetic change was addition of chromosome 13 which occurred in four of 17 patients who changed. These data suggest that a cytogenetic change may be partly responsible for the transformation of RA/RARS, but not RAEB or RAEBT, to AML. This supports the concept that RAEB, RAEBT, and AML are different manifestations of the same disease, whereas RA/RARS are conditions that predispose to acute leukemia.","['Ghaddar, H M', 'Stass, S A', 'Pierce, S', 'Estey, E H']","['Ghaddar HM', 'Stass SA', 'Pierce S', 'Estey EH']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory/genetics', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/genetics', 'Anemia, Sideroblastic/genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Oct;8(10):1649-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These observations have led to clinical trials in which 13-cis-retinoic acid (13cRA) 1 mg/kg/day was combined with interferon alpha-2a (IFN alpha) 3 or 6 x 10(6) U/day. The first two such trials produced exciting results: 50% response rate in patients with previously untreated stages IB-IVA cervix cancer and 68% in patients with advanced squamous cell skin cancer. These data led to a number of additional trials of the combination, but the high response rates seen in the initial cervix and skin trials have not been duplicated in the other squamous tumors tested (head and neck, lung, pretreated cervix). In addition, trials in two non-squamous histologies were negative (lung and melanoma). However, the regimen was not always studied in an optimal population of previously untreated patients and the negative results in pretreated cervix patients point to the relevance of this consideration. Nevertheless, the observation that the combination of 13cRA and IFN alpha (both of which bind to specific receptors and change gene expression) is able to induce regression in advanced tumors, must be regarded as highly important. Key questions to be addressed include an understanding of the biologic mechanism of specific tumor sensitivity (why some squamous tumors and not others?), and mechanisms of resistance in sensitive tumor types (e.g. cervix). Such data may lead to trials targeted to tumor types with defined biologic features having a high likelihood of clinical benefit. In the meantime, studies integrating this combination with other active treatment modalities such as radiation is warranted in cervix and skin carcinomas.","['Eisenhauer, E A', 'Lippman, S M', 'Kavanagh, J J', 'Parades-Espinoza, M', 'Arnold, A', 'Hong, W K', 'Massimini, G', 'Schleuniger, U', 'Bollag, W', 'Holdener, E E']","['Eisenhauer EA', 'Lippman SM', 'Kavanagh JJ', 'Parades-Espinoza M', 'Arnold A', 'Hong WK', 'Massimini G', 'Schleuniger U', 'Bollag W', 'Holdener EE', 'et al.']","[""NCIC Clinical Trials Group, Queen's University, Kingston, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EH28UP18IF (Isotretinoin)']",IM,,"['Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/therapy', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Isotretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Skin Neoplasms/therapy', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/therapy']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Oct;8(10):1622-5.,,,26,,,,,,,,,,,,

The translocation fuses the PML gene to the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) gene resulting in the production of a PML-RAR alpha fusion protein. The hybrid molecule retains most of the functional domains of both native products, PML and RAR alpha, but it has novel features. Its cellular distribution is completely reorganized when compared to that of PML: the hybrid is found in multiple small nuclear substructures and upon retinoic acid treatment, it goes back to the normal PML localization, that is in typical well organized nuclear bodies. PML-RAR alpha also acquires novel transcriptional properties if compared to RAR alpha, it does so either by direct binding to target gene regulatory sequences or by protein interaction with cofactors. Expression of PML-RAR alpha in HL60 or U937 cell has been shown to block their maturation while it can force their differentiation at high doses of retinoic acid. Different mechanisms are proposed to explain how PML-RAR alpha blocks differentiation and how this may be reversed by retinoic acid. A likely hypothesis might be the delocalization of critical cofactors into the aberrant PML-RAR alpha substructures while the therapeutic effect of retinoic acid would be correlated to its capacity to restore a normal nuclear organization.","['Lavau, C', 'Dejean, A']","['Lavau C', 'Dejean A']","['Dept des Retrovirus, INSERM U. 163, Institut Pasteur, France.']",['eng'],"['Duplicate Publication', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/ultrastructure', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/therapy', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Oct;8(10):1615-21.,,,53,,,,,,,,,,,,

KY-ADR1 was selected from a cytosine arabinoside (Ara C) resistant cell line by gradually increasing the concentration of ADR and KY-ADR2 from the parental cell line, KY-821, by the same method. The IC50s of both cell lines were 4.3 x 10(-5) and 3.6 x 10(-5) M ADR, respectively. Both lines revealed a similar cross resistance to various anticancer drugs, but KY-ADR1 was resistant to Ara C, whereas KY-ADR2 was sensitive. MDR1 gene was over-expressed and P-glycoprotein was expressed on the cytoplasmic membrane in both lines. Neither verapamil nor cyclosporin A could completely reverse ADR resistance. In addition, no significant changes in topoisomerase II and glutathione-s-transferase levels were detected. These findings indicate that ADR resistance in both cell lines is mainly mediated by P-glycoprotein and some other mechanism may be present. Interestingly, growth of both cell lines was stimulated by natural IL-1 and not affected by TNF alpha and IFN gamma, whereas growth of parental KY-821 was inhibited by these factors.

One PCR primer set was designed not to discriminate between mutant K-ras and wild-type K-ras and thus amplified the total K-ras gene. The other PCR primer set was designed to be allele-specific for K-ras gene containing a G to C mutation at codon 12. This primer set could discriminate the mutant and wild-type genes when the proportion of the mutated sequence was 0.2% of the total K-ras gene. To test the method on biological specimens, genomic DNA samples were analyzed from the peripheral blood of a patient who had secondary AML with the same codon 12 K-ras mutation. Two samples taken from this patient 2 months apart during follow-up had myeloblast cell contents of 67 and 80%. However, the percentage of mutated K-ras was 50% in both samples, suggesting that this patient may be inherently heterozygotic in this particular mutation. This ratio of mutated to normal K-ras in the patient's cells was confirmed by RNA-SSCP analysis and RNA sequencing. This quantitation method can provide a sensitive and specific estimation of the content of mutated K-ras alleles in patient samples.","['Horikoshi, T', 'Lenz, H J', 'Danenberg, K', 'Koch, O M', 'Bertino, J R', 'Danenberg, P V']","['Horikoshi T', 'Lenz HJ', 'Danenberg K', 'Koch OM', 'Bertino JR', 'Danenberg PV']","['Kenneth Norris Jr Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90033.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,,"['Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Codon/genetics', 'DNA/blood', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/blood', '*Genes, ras', 'Genetic Carrier Screening', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/cytology/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/blood/genetics', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Reference Values']",,1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(94)90069-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(94)90069-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1994 Sep;18(9):693-702. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)90069-8.,"['K-ras', 'ras']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ID50s for 17 cases of de novo AML varied from 5 to 300 ng/ml giving a median of 105 ng/ml which was similar to the median of 11 normal marrow mononuclear cell preparations (80 ng/ml) but considerably less than the median ID50 of eight blood lymphocyte samples (3500 ng/ml). ID50s for five relapsed and two refractory AML samples ranged from 27 to 240 ng/ml, well within the de novo range: we had obtained presentation samples for two of these and, in both cases, ID50s were lower at relapse. ID50s, however, were raised in seven marrow mononuclear cell populations taken soon after remission induction (ID50 for remission MNC and normal MNC = 200 and 80 ng/ml, respectively); this may reflect either a property of regenerating populations, or an activation of cellular resistance mechanisms following chemotherapy. ID50s for 17 cases of BCLL ranged from 7 to 200 ng/ml with a median of 48 ng/ml which was significantly lower than the ID50 of AML blasts or of blood lymphocytes. Cyclosporin induced less than two-fold reductions in ID50s of blood lymphocytes, marrow mononuclear cells and de novo AML and BCLL blasts despite giving log reversals in resistance in the CEM VLB100 line. This reflected numbers of P-glycoprotein positive cells in our samples, which were high in CEM VLB100 but low in fresh normal or leukaemic cell suspensions. For both de novo AML and BCLL groups, however, the change in ID50, on addition of cyclosporin, was significant. These data imply a minor role for P-glycoprotein in drug resistance of leukaemic blasts. Nevertheless, there was a positive correlation between daunorubicin ID50s in de novo AML and time to remission which confirms that in vitro chemosensitivity assays can provide a useful measure of in vivo resistance.","['Baines, P', 'Limaye, M', 'Hoy, T', 'Padua, R A', 'Whittaker, J', 'al-Sabah, A', 'Burnett, A']","['Baines P', 'Limaye M', 'Hoy T', 'Padua RA', 'Whittaker J', 'al-Sabah A', 'Burnett A']","['Department of Haematology, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis/*metabolism', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*toxicity', '*Drug Resistance', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/pathology', 'Reference Values']",,1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(94)90068-X [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(94)90068-x [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1994 Sep;18(9):683-91. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)90068-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The plasma sIL-2R level correlated positively with the bone marrow cellularity and bone marrow blast mass, but not with the absolute number of CD25+ lymphocytes.

Isolated mast cells failed to proliferate with or without growth factors used irrespective of culture conditions. Mononuclear cell fraction obtained from all patients gave rise to relatively numerous mast cells in interphase culture using IL-3 but not in other culture systems. The simultaneous addition of leukemic cell membrane and IL-3 or delayed addition of leukemic cell membrane produced more numerous and mature mast cells in the upper layer of interphase culture using IL-3. However, addition of leukemic cell membrane alone failed to increase the number of mast cells. Similar results were obtain using mononuclear cells obtained from volunteers and cord blood cells. These results indicate that a cell to cell contact or interstitial substance together with IL-3 are essential requirements for growth and maturation of mast cell precursors and that the cell membrane itself in some cases of leukemia has the ability to induce maturation of mast cell precursors.","['Fukuda, T', 'Kakihara, T', 'Kamishima, T', 'Ohnishi, Y', 'Naito, M', 'Kishi, K', 'Shibata, A']","['Fukuda T', 'Kakihara T', 'Kamishima T', 'Ohnishi Y', 'Naito M', 'Kishi K', 'Shibata A']","['Second Department of Pathology, Niigata University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Culture Media', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(94)90056-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(94)90056-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1994 Oct;18(10):749-59. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)90056-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BLV is transmitted horizontally among cattle, and infected animals have anti-BLV titers. Expression of BLV antigen, however, is silent in peripheral blood lymphocytes in vivo. The tropism of BLV has been assumed to be limited to B lymphocytes, because no other cell type has been found to harbor the virus in vivo. Since retrovirus-like particles had been identified in milk, and infection can be transmitted by milk, we decided to investigate whether BLV was in mammary epithelial cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Pure cultures of mammary epithelial cells were established from cells shed into the milk of 28 cows. BLV was searched in these cultures by immunocytochemistry and the polymerase chain reaction, the specificity of the latter confirmed by Southern blot hybridization and DNA sequencing. BLV was searched immunocytochemically in mammary tissue sections from 12 cows. RESULTS: Antigenic and/or molecular evidence of BLV was found in the cultured cells of 20 cows. Antigenic evidence of BLV was found in tissue sections from 10 cows, indicating virus expression in vivo. Simultaneous detection of BLV p24 and cytokeratins, localized antigen expression to the mammary epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: These indications of BLV in mammary epithelial cells in vivo suggest that BLV is capable of infecting and expressing antigen in glandular epithelium in vivo and has a broader tissue tropism than was previously thought. They raise the question of how persistent mammary infection by BLV may influence the course of bovine lymphoma, and what effect the virus may have on the mammary gland.","['Buehring, G C', 'Kramme, P M', 'Schultz, R D']","['Buehring GC', 'Kramme PM', 'Schultz RD']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/pathology', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis/genetics', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*microbiology/pathology', 'Epithelium/immunology/microbiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/immunology/*microbiology/pathology', 'Milk/cytology/microbiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1994 Sep;71(3):359-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent observations indicate a role for LIF in inflammatory processes. To examine the potential involvement of LIF in the regulation of mesangial cell behavior, we studied LIF expression in early primary cultures of rat and human mesangial cells, as well as the response of mesangial cells to exogenous LIF. Growing or growth-arrested rat mesangial cells constitutively expressed very low levels of LIF mRNA, barely detectable by Northern blot analysis. Strong induction of LIF mRNA expression was caused by cytokines, such as interleukin-1 beta (5 ng/ml), tumor necrosis factor alpha (100 ng/ml) and PDGF (100 ng/ml), as well as LPS (200 ng/ml). The induction was transient with a peak after three to five hours. Dexamethasone (0.1 microM) almost completely inhibited the induction of LIF. Weak induction of LIF mRNA was observed after stimulation with basic fibroblast growth factor, endothelin and transforming growth factor beta. In combination with IL-1 beta, TGF beta showed synergistic effects on LIF induction. LIF itself or IL-6 had no effect on LIF mRNA expression. A similar induction pattern was observed for the expression of IL-6 mRNA. LIF protein was detected by specific ELISA in the supernatants of human mesangial cells stimulated by LPS or IL-1 beta. In addition, we found that mesangial cells not only express LIF but they are also target cells for LIF. Recombinant LIF effectively induced transient expression of the immediate early genes, c-fos, jun-B and Egr-1 in rat mesangial cells, with a maximum at 30 to 60 minutes. LIF was not mitogenic for mesangial cells. Our findings indicate that glomerular mesangial cells produce and react to LIF. As a cytokine with autocrine potential, LIF may play a physiological and/or pathophysiological role in the glomerulus, the exact nature and relevance of which remain to be explored.","['Hartner, A', 'Sterzel, R B', 'Reindl, N', 'Hocke, G M', 'Fey, G H', 'Goppelt-Struebe, M']","['Hartner A', 'Sterzel RB', 'Reindl N', 'Hocke GM', 'Fey GH', 'Goppelt-Struebe M']","['Medizinische Klinik IV, Universitaet Erlangen-Nuernberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Kidney Int,Kidney international,0323470,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Cytokines/*immunology', 'DNA Primers', 'Dexamethasone', 'Gene Expression', 'Glomerular Mesangium/cytology/*immunology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Growth Substances/immunology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0085-2538(15)58487-1 [pii]', '10.1038/ki.1994.206 [doi]']",ppublish,Kidney Int. 1994 Jun;45(6):1562-71. doi: 10.1038/ki.1994.206.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequent purification and gene cloning proved that it is a human homologue of a bacterial reducing coenzyme, thioredoxin (TRX). ADF/human TRX (hTRX) has multiple functions both in the extracellular and intracellular compartments, such as cytokine activity, dithiol-reducing activity and radical scavenging activity. ADF/hTRX can facilitate the interactions between the transcriptional factors and its target DNA sequences, which may result in the overexpression of IL -2R alpha in HTLV-I infected cells. Recently, we have detected the presence of ADF/hTRX in human serum (sADF) obtained from healthy volunteers using the insulin reducing assay and Western blotting analysis. Another endogenous redox regulator, glutathione (GSH) system, has long been studied for its relation to cell proliferation and activation. Our recent data showed that thiol compounds such as L-cysteine and GSH may be involved in the activation and cell cycle progression of stimulated lymphocytes. We have also found that ADF/hTRX promotes L-cysteine transport into the cells and increases intracellular GSH content, indicating the close association between ADF/hTRX and GSH systems. Redox regulation by ADF/hTRX and GSH systems seems to play an important role in regulating cell proliferation and activation. To assess the possible alteration of the sADF level in pathological conditions, such as viral infections, an ELISA system for ADF/hTRX was recently established using two different monoclonal antibodies against rADF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Kitaoka, Y', 'Sachi, Y', 'Mori, T', 'Yodoi, J']","['Kitaoka Y', 'Sachi Y', 'Mori T', 'Yodoi J']","['Department of Biological Responses, Kyoto University.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Twenty-three institutions in the Childrens Cancer Group. SUBJECTS: A total of 593 adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 409 sibling controls. OUTCOME MEASURES: Enrollment in special programs, grades during high school, graduation from high school, college admission, and college graduation. RESULTS: After diagnosis, survivors were more likely than their sibling controls to enter a special education (relative risk [RR] = 3.4; P < .01) or a learning disabled (RR = 3.6; P < .01) program, while just as likely to enter gifted and talented programs (RR = 1.0). The risk associated with special education and learning disabled programs increased with increasing dose of cranial radiotherapy. Despite these problems, survivors generally had the same probability as their siblings of finishing high school, entering college, and earning a bachelor's degree. However, survivors treated with 24 Gy and those diagnosed before 6 years of age were less likely to enter college (RR = 0.67 and 0.6, respectively; P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: This large study demonstrates that childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors have a greater likelihood of being placed in special education or learning disabled programs than their siblings, but that most are able to overcome these problems.

DESIGN: Prospective randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled prophylactic trial. SETTING: Inpatient setting in multiple cooperating cancer centers. SUBJECTS: Convenience sample with a total of 551 granulocytopenic patients, 95% of whom had leukemia or underwent bone marrow transplantation. INTERVENTIONS: Penicillin V (500 mg twice a day) vs placebo given in combination with oral pefloxacin (400 mg twice a day). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Occurrence of fever and/or infection. RESULTS: Fever or infection (without fever) developed in 190 (71%) of 268 evaluable patients in the penicillin arm compared with 213 (80%) of 268 evaluable patients in the placebo arm (P = .03; 95% confidence interval [CI] for the difference, -16% to -1%). Bacteremia occurred in 58 (22%) of 268 placebo-treated patients and in 38 (14%) of 268 penicillin-treated patients (P = .03; 95% CI for the difference, -14% to -1%), primarily due to a reduction in streptococcal bacteremic episodes that occurred in 14 penicillin-treated patients (5%) and in 27 placebo-treated patients (10%) (P = .05; 95% CI for the difference, -9% to -0.3%). Gram-negative rod bacteremias occurred in only two patients (1%) and in five patients (2%), respectively.

The mRNA is predicted to encode a protein containing four peptides which precisely match amino acid sequences from a previously identified 55-kDa actin-bundling protein, p55. In vitro translation of the cDNA results in a 55-kDa protein which binds to actin filaments in the presence of purified p55 from HeLa cells. The p55 mRNA is undetectable in non-EBV-infected B- and T-cell lines or in a myelomonocytic cell line (U937). Newly infected primary human B lymphocytes, EBV-transformed B-cell lines, latently infected Burkitt tumor cells expressing EBNA2 and LMP1, a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line (K562), and an osteosarcoma cell line (TK143) contain high levels of p55 mRNA or protein. In EBV-transformed B cells, p55 localizes to perinuclear cytoplasm and to cell surface processes that resemble filopodia. The p55 mRNA is detected at high levels in spleen and brain tissues, at moderate levels in lung and placenta tissues, and at low levels in skeletal muscle, liver, and tonsil tissues and is undetectable in heart, kidney, pancreas, and bone marrow tissues. Immunohistochemical staining of human brain tissue demonstrates p55 localization to the perinuclear cytoplasm and dendritic processes of many, but not all, types of cortical or cerebellar neurons, to glial cells, and to capillary endothelial cells. In cultured primary rat neurons, p55 is distributed throughout the perinuclear cytoplasm and in subcortical filamentous structures of dendrites and growth cones. p55 is highly evolutionarily conserved since it shows 40% amino acid sequence identity to the Drosophila singed gene product and 37% identity to fascin, an echinoderm actin-bundling protein. The evolutionary conservation of p55 and its lack of extensive homology to other actin-binding proteins suggest that p55 has specific microfilament-associated functions in cells in which it is differentially expressed, including neural cells and EBV-transformed B lymphocytes.","['Mosialos, G', 'Yamashiro, S', 'Baughman, R W', 'Matsudaira, P', 'Vara, L', 'Matsumura, F', 'Kieff, E', 'Birkenbach, M']","['Mosialos G', 'Yamashiro S', 'Baughman RW', 'Matsudaira P', 'Vara L', 'Matsumura F', 'Kieff E', 'Birkenbach M']","['Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (GAP-43 Protein)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '125267-21-2 (Myristoylated Alanine-Rich C Kinase Substrate)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/virology', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Evolution', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA, Complementary/isolation & purification', 'GAP-43 Protein', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Microfilament Proteins/analysis/chemistry/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Myristoylated Alanine-Rich C Kinase Substrate', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/analysis', 'Organ Specificity', 'Proteins/analysis']",PMC237173,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.11.7320-7328.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Nov;68(11):7320-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.11.7320-7328.1994.,,"['CA42742/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/U09873'],,,,

Both cell types showed specific virus binding competitively blocked by unlabeled virions. The number of binding sites for EMC virus on HeLa and K562 cells were approximately 1.6 x 10(5) and 3.5 x 10(5) per cell, respectively, and dissociation binding constants were 1.1 and 2.7 nM, respectively. Treatment of cells with cycloheximide after pretreatment with trypsin eliminated EMC virus attachment, suggesting that the virus-binding moiety is proteinaceous in nature. Digestion of cells, cell membranes, and sodium deoxycholate-solubilized cell membranes with proteases or neuraminidases or treatment of cells with lectins demonstrated that the EMC virus-cell interaction is mediated by a sialoglycoprotein. Proteins with a molecular mass of 70 kDa were isolated from detergent-solubilized cell membranes of both HeLa and K562 cells by EMC virus affinity chromatography. The purified proteins, as well as their 70-kDa-molecular-mass equivalents detected in intact surface membranes of HeLa and K562 cells, specifically bound EMC virus in a virus overlay protein blot assay, whereas membranes from nonpermissive K562 D clone cells did not. Western immunoblot analysis with glycophorin A-specific antibody confirmed that the identified 70-kDa binding site on K562 cells is not glycophorin A, which is the EMC virus receptor molecule on virus-nonpermissive human erythrocytes (HeLa cells do not express glycophorin A).

Expression of Tax1 suppressed the GALTax activity at the GAL4 site as a result of squelching, and the suppressed activity was recovered by the overexpression of SRF, suggesting that SRF is a factor that is required for GALTax activity and that is inhibited by competition with Tax1. The expression of antisense SRF RNA specifically inhibited GALTax activity to less than 20%. Deletion of the Tax1 interaction domain of SRF at its C terminus converted SRF from an activator of GALTax to an inhibitor. These results suggest that SRF is an essential component of the transcriptional activation of Tax1 in addition to a mediator of CArG box binding.","['Fujii, M', 'Tsuchiya, H', 'Chuhjo, T', 'Minamino, T', 'Miyamoto, K', 'Seiki, M']","['Fujii M', 'Tsuchiya H', 'Chuhjo T', 'Minamino T', 'Miyamoto K', 'Seiki M']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Oncology, Kanazawa University, Ishikawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (GAL4 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Fungal Proteins/physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Serum Response Factor', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', '*Transcriptional Activation']",PMC237168,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.11.7275-7283.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Nov;68(11):7275-83. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.11.7275-7283.1994.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about the types of transcription factors present in neurons or about whether different neuronal populations within a ganglion vary in their complement of these factors. With respect to HSV-1 latency, it is not known how or why the latency-associated transcript (LAT) promoter is able to function continually during latency while all other viral promoters are inactive. To further studies of these two phenomena, we constructed seven recombinant viruses with various promoter constructs driving expression of the lacZ reporter gene. Each construct was inserted into HSV-1 at the glycoprotein C locus, and recombinant viruses were evaluated for the ability to express beta-galactosidase during acute and latent viral infections in murine dorsal root ganglia. During acute infection of murine dorsal root ganglia, the activities of the promoters varied over a wide range. Constructs containing the murine metallothionein promoter (MT1), the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter, the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat (LTR), or the region upstream of and including the HSV LAT core promoter (LAT) were active during the acute but not the latent phase of infection. The addition of transcription factor binding sites present in the upstream LAT region to the MT1 and LTR promoters (LAT-MT1 and LAT-LTR, respectively) significantly increased acute-phase expression. Despite these high initial rates of transcription, of all the promoter constructs only LAT-LTR was able to remain transcriptionally active after the establishment of a latent state. Thus, the Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR provides a DNA element which functions to prevent promoter inactivation during latency. An analogous HSV long-term-expression element is evidently not present in the upstream LAT promoter, indicating that the HSV long-term-expression function is provided by a region outside of that which gives high-level neuronal expression during the acute phase of infection.","['Lokensgard, J R', 'Bloom, D C', 'Dobson, A T', 'Feldman, L T']","['Lokensgard JR', 'Bloom DC', 'Dobson AT', 'Feldman LT']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, UCLA School of Medicine 90024.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Base Sequence', 'Female', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Simplexvirus/*genetics/physiology', 'Trigeminal Ganglion/virology', '*Virus Latency', 'beta-Galactosidase/biosynthesis']",PMC237154,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.11.7148-7158.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Nov;68(11):7148-58. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.11.7148-7158.1994.,,"['AI06236/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI28338/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'NS30420/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike FV, it does not induce acute erythroleukemia but retains the immunosuppressive property of FV and induces suppression of the primary antibody response rapidly and persistently in adult mice. A previous study showed that the FIS variant contains two viral components, a replication-competent virus and a defective virus. In this study, we have biologically purified the FIS variant by end point dilution and we show that the replication-competent virus FIS-2 alone can induce immunosuppression as the parental FIS variant. Most newborn mice infected with FIS-2 developed erythroleukemia, but with an increased latency period compared with that of F-MuLV clone 57. In contrast, FIS-2 induced suppression of the primary antibody response and disease more rapidly than F-MuLV clone 57 in immunocompetent, adult mice. FIS-2 was further molecularly cloned and characterized. Restriction mapping and nucleotide sequence analysis of FIS-2 showed a high degree of homology between FIS-2 and F-MuLV clone 57, suggesting that FIS-2 is a variant of F-MuLV. The striking difference is the deletion of one of the tandem repeats in the FIS-2 long terminal repeat and the single point mutation in the binding sites for core-binding protein and FVa compared with the long terminal repeat of F-MuLV clone 57. Two single point mutations led to the appearance of two extra potential N glycosylation sites in the FIS-2 gag-encoded glycoprotein. Together, the results suggest that FIS-2 represents an interesting murine model to study retrovirus-induced immunosuppression on the basis of its unique combined property of low leukemogenicity and relatively strong and persistent immunosuppressive activity in adult mice.","['Dai, H Y', 'Faxvaag, A', 'Troseth, G I', 'Aarset, H', 'Dalen, A']","['Dai HY', 'Faxvaag A', 'Troseth GI', 'Aarset H', 'Dalen A']","['Unigen Center for Molecular Biology, University of Trondheim, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry', 'Virus Replication']",PMC237134,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.11.6976-6984.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Nov;68(11):6976-84. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.11.6976-6984.1994.,,,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/Z35109', 'GENBANK/Z35110', 'GENBANK/Z35111']",,,,

We recently found that intraperitoneal (i.p.) inoculation of neonatal mice with the same virus significantly enhanced its leukemogenicity. In this study, infections of neonatal mice by the two different routes of inoculation were compared. We studied replication of the virus in vivo to identify critical preleukemic events. These would be observed in mice inoculated i.p. by Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV but not when inoculation was s.c. Infectious center assays indicated that regardless of the route of inoculation, Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV showed delayed infection of the thymus compared with wild-type M-MuLV. On the other hand, i.p.-inoculated mice showed more rapid appearance of infectious centers in the bone marrow than did s.c.-inoculated animals. Thus, the enhanced leukemogenicity of i.p. inoculation correlated with efficient early infection of the bone marrow and not with early infection of the thymus. These results suggest a role for bone marrow infection for efficient leukemogenesis in Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV-infected mice. Consistent with this notion, if bone marrow infection was decreased by injecting 10- to 12-day-old animals i.p., leukemogenicity resembled that of s.c. inoculation. Thus, two cell types that are critical for the induction of efficient leukemia were implicated. One cell delivers virus from the site of s.c. inoculation (the skin) to the bone marrow and is apparently restricted for Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV replication. The second cell is in the bone marrow, and its early infection is required for efficient leukemogenesis.","['Belli, B', 'Fan, H']","['Belli B', 'Fan H']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of California, Irvine 92717.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/virology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*etiology', 'Mice', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Preleukemia/etiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*etiology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*etiology']",PMC237123,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.11.6883-6889.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Nov;68(11):6883-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.11.6883-6889.1994.,,"['AI07319/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09334/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elevated risks for cancers at the same site for relatives of cancer probands have been reported for both common cancers and a number of the rarer cancer sites. For a particular cancer site, however, the estimated risks to relatives have varied considerably depending on criteria for selection of probands, how cancers were determined in relatives, and overall study design. Not surprisingly, the estimated risks of other cancers in relatives of probands with cancer at a given site have been subject to even more variation. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to use the Utah Population Database resource to systematically study familial clustering of 28 distinct cancer site definitions among first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, and off-spring) of cancer probands. METHODS: We estimated familial relative risks from the Utah Population Database by identifying all cases of cancer in these first-degree relatives. These observed values were compared with those expected based on cohort-specific internal rates calculated from 399,786 relatives of all individuals in the Utah Population Database known to have died in Utah. RESULTS: All sites showed an excess of cancers of the same site among relatives, with thyroid and colon cancers and lymphocytic leukemia showing the highest familial risks. When the analyses were restricted to cases with early ages at diagnosis, increased familial components for most cancer sites became evident. A significant difference in familial relative risk (FRR) between male (FRR = 4.04; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.13-5.07) and female (FRR = 2.24; 95% CI = 1.54-3.08) probands was found for colon cancer. Highly significant familial associations (one-sided; P < .001) were found among breast, colon, and prostate cancers and between breast and thyroid cancers. Statistically significant (one-sided, P < .01) associations were also found between tobacco-associated sites (lung, larynx, lip, and cervix). CONCLUSIONS: This study represents a unique comprehensive population-based study of familial cancer. The familial associations reported here will be useful in generating hypotheses about specific genetic and environmental factors that can be tested in genetic linkage and case-control studies.","['Goldgar, D E', 'Easton, D F', 'Cannon-Albright, L A', 'Skolnick, M H']","['Goldgar DE', 'Easton DF', 'Cannon-Albright LA', 'Skolnick MH']","['Department of Medical Informatics, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Utah/epidemiology']",,1994/11/02 00:00,1994/11/02 00:01,['1994/11/02 00:00'],"['1994/11/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/02 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/86.21.1600 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1994 Nov 2;86(21):1600-8. doi: 10.1093/jnci/86.21.1600.,,"['CA48711/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA54936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CN05222/CN/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These compounds were used to initiate a systematic investigation of the role of chain length, terminal nitrogen alkyl group size, and symmetry of the methylene backbone in the antineoplastic properties of polyamine analogues. New synthetic methods predicated on our earlier polyamine fragment synthesis are described for accessing the tetraamines of interest. An unsymmetrically substituted diamine reagent, N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-N,N'-bis(mesitylenesulfonyl)-1,4-diaminobu tane, was developed for entry into unsymmetrical tetraamines. All of the tetraamines synthesized were first evaluated in a murine leukemia L1210 cell IC50 assay at 48 and 96 h. In an attempt to correlate this behavior with some aspect of polyamine metabolism, each compound was tested for its ability to compete with spermidine for the polyamine uptake apparatus, its impact on the polyamine biosynthetic enzymes ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC), and its effect on the polyamine-catabolizing enzyme spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) and on polyamine pools. While there was no obvious correlation between the 48 and 96 h IC50's and the impact of the analogues on polyamine metabolism, there were other structure-activity relationships. Correlations were observed to exist between chain length and IC50's and between terminal alkyl substituents and impact on Ki, ODC, and AdoMetDC.

Our objectives were to characterize the disposition of vincristine in pediatric patients, to determine clinical, demographic, or biochemical variables related to variability in vincristine pharmacokinetic parameters, and to assess the relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters and vincristine neurotoxicity. Plasma samples were collected at 5 and 30 minutes, and 1, 3, and 24 hours after a rapid intravenous injection during 3 minutes. Vincristine-induced neurotoxicity was retrospectively evaluated by chart review. Pharmacokinetic studies were completed for 64 doses in 54 children between 2 months and 18 years of age (median, 4.3 years), including 2-month-old monozygous twin girls. Vincristine clearance, estimated by Bayesian methods, was highly variable, with a mean (SD) clearance of 19.9 (14.9) ml/min per kilogram or 482 (342) ml/min per square meter. Mean clearance for all subjects was faster than in published studies of adults, which may be related in part to the greater specificity of the assay used in our study, as well as to age-related differences in drug disposition. Vincristine-associated neurotoxicity was frequent but mild and was not predicted by vincristine systemic exposure; however, neurotoxicity may have been underestimated. Clearance in one patient who received concomitant treatment with pentobarbital exceeded the 75th percentile for all patients, and four of five patients receiving concomitant histamine2 antagonists had clearances below the 25th percentile for all subjects, suggesting that drugs that induce or inhibit hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymes may affect vincristine disposition.

Primary CTCLs that do not belong to one of these entities represent a heterogeneous and ill-defined group of neoplasms. This paper describes the clinical and histological features of 35 of such cases. The object of this study was to define prognostic parameters for this group of primary CTCLs. Using a slightly modified version of the updated Kiel classification, a subdivision was made into CTCL, pleomorphic, small cell type (n = 3); pleomorphic, medium-sized cell type (n = 6); pleomorphic, large cell type (n = 18); and immunoblastic lymphomas (n = 8). Altogether, these lymphomas had a poor prognosis with estimated 2- and 4-year survival rates of 53 and 22 percent, respectively. Patients with pleomorphic, small and medium-sized cell lymphomas (n = 9) proved to have a significantly better survival than those with pleomorphic, large cell lymphomas (P = 0.032) and immunoblastic lymphomas (P = 0.008). Primary cutaneous immunoblastic lymphomas had the worst prognosis with an estimated 2-year survival rate of 14 percent. Other parameters including age (P = 0.345), sex (P = 0.662), extent of skin lesions at presentation (P = 0.0854), and mode of initial treatment (P = 0.609) had no significant effect on the survival time. The results of this study suggest that primary CTCLs other than classical MF, SS, and CD30-positive lymphomas have a poor prognosis in most cases, and that the current classification may be a useful means of predicting the clinical behaviour in these lymphomas.","['Beljaards, R C', 'Meijer, C J', 'Van der Putte, S C', 'Hollema, H', 'Geerts, M L', 'Bezemer, P D', 'Willemze, R']","['Beljaards RC', 'Meijer CJ', 'Van der Putte SC', 'Hollema H', 'Geerts ML', 'Bezemer PD', 'Willemze R']","['Department of Dermatology, Free University Hospital of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/classification/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/classification/mortality/*pathology']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/path.1711720110 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 1994 Jan;172(1):53-60. doi: 10.1002/path.1711720110.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It would be useful to know whether tumor cells are sensitive to a given drug prior to its use. To this end, we developed a method of assessing Adriamycin (doxorubicin) binding to tumor nuclei as a possible means of detecting sensitivity to the drug. Adriamycin-sensitive murine osteosarcoma cells were used to develop the assay. The in vitro conditions (drug concentration, duration of incubation, and temperature) were optimized with use of the murine osteosarcoma cells in culture. After the cells had been incubated with Adriamycin, cell viability was determined and Adriamycin fluorescence intensity was measured with a cytofluorometer. The optimal parameters for Adriamycin binding were found to be a 30-minute incubation in a 10 micrograms/ml concentration of Adriamycin at 37 degrees C; the frequency of cells that emitted Adriamycin fluorescence from the nucleus compared with the total number of living cells reached 100% under these conditions. In a murine leukemia cell line with known sensitivity to Adriamycin, the cells emitted red fluorescence from the nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas in a resistant line the cells emitted Adriamycin fluorescence from only the cytoplasm. We demonstrated that it is possible to differentiate nuclear from cytoplasmic concentration of Adriamycin in a tumor cell with use of a fluorescent microscope and that resistant cell lines can be distinguished from sensitive cell lines by this method.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Gebhardt, M C', 'Kusuzaki, K', 'Mankin, H J', 'Springfield, D S']","['Gebhardt MC', 'Kusuzaki K', 'Mankin HJ', 'Springfield DS']","['Orthopaedic Oncology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston 02114.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Orthop Res,Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,8404726,['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fluorometry/*methods', 'Mice', 'Osteosarcoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jor.1100120504 [doi]'],ppublish,J Orthop Res. 1994 Sep;12(5):621-7. doi: 10.1002/jor.1100120504.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They also have similar toxicities, including myelosuppression, immunosuppression, and sporadic neurotoxicity. This review compares the spectrum of neurotoxicity of each of these agents. Now that these drugs are commercially available and are being widely used, physicians should be aware of potentially serious side effects that may be encountered. METHODS: The literature was searched using MedLine and Cancerline, as well as the bibliographies of published reports through the fall of 1993. In addition, case records from National Cancer Institute (NCI) Group C protocols were reviewed for fludarabine in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and cladribine and pentostatin in hairy cell leukemia (HCL), as well as adverse drug reactions reported to the NCI from January 1980 through September 1993. RESULTS: At higher than recommended doses, life-threatening and fatal neurotoxicity were encountered with all three drugs. At the recommended doses, each agent induced neurotoxicity in approximately 15% of patients, mostly mild and reversible. However, severe neurologic complications were reported; these were occasionally delayed, sometimes fatal, but often at least partially reversible. CONCLUSION: The doses of these three agents should not be increased above the recommended levels. Development of moderate or worse neurotoxicity should result in discontinuation of that drug.","['Cheson, B D', 'Vena, D A', 'Foss, F M', 'Sorensen, J M']","['Cheson BD', 'Vena DA', 'Foss FM', 'Sorensen JM']","['Division of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Cladribine/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nervous System/*drug effects', 'Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced', 'Pentostatin/adverse effects', 'Purine Nucleosides/*adverse effects', 'Vidarabine/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.10.2216 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Oct;12(10):2216-28. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.10.2216.,,,89,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients received 33 courses of TPT as a 5-day infusion at doses ranging from 0.70 to 2.7 mg/m2/d. Pharmacologic studies were performed to determine the TPT concentrations at steady-state (Css) and to examine parameters in the patients' leukemic blasts ex vivo that may be related to TPT sensitivity, eg, topo I content, p-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression, and the inhibitory effects of relevant TPT concentrations on the growth of blast colonies in clonogenic assays relative to the range of TPT Css values achieved. RESULTS: Severe mucositis of the oropharynx and perianal tissues was intolerable at TPT doses greater than 2.1 mg/m2/d, the recommended dose for phase II studies in leukemia. One complete response (CR) in a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis (CML-B) and one partial response (PR) in a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were noted. Significant reductions in circulating blast-cell numbers occurred in all courses, and complete leukemia clearance from the peripheral blood, albeit transient, was noted in 11 courses. TPT Css values ranged from 4.8 to 72.5 nmol/L. Colony-forming assays showed that the TPT LD90 (dose that inhibits the growth of leukemia blast colonies by 90%) values for blasts varied from 6 to 22 nmol/L, a range that overlapped with TPT Css values. In view of these variations in TPT sensitivity, several aspects of topo I-mediated drug action were also studied. In 10 of 11 samples, the multi-drug resistance (Mdr) modulator quinidine altered nuclear daunorubicin (DNR) accumulation and whole-cell TPT accumulation by less than 15%, which suggests that Pgp-mediated effects on drug efflux are insufficient to explain the fourfold range of TPT sensitivities in the colony-forming assays. Immunohistochemistry showed that topo I was expressed in all of the blasts from individual patients without detectable cell-to-cell heterogeneity in each marrow. Western blots indicated that topo I content varied over a 10-fold range. Although the sample size was small, topo I content appeared to be higher in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), intermediate in AML, and lower in CML-B. Topo I content did not appear to be related to the proliferative status of the blasts. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that substantial dose escalation of TPT above myelosuppressive doses reached in solid-tumor patients is feasible in patients with refractory leukemia, that biologically relevant TPT Css values are achievable, and that further developmental trials are warranted.","['Rowinsky, E K', 'Adjei, A', 'Donehower, R C', 'Gore, S D', 'Jones, R J', 'Burke, P J', 'Cheng, Y C', 'Grochow, L B', 'Kaufmann, S H']","['Rowinsky EK', 'Adjei A', 'Donehower RC', 'Gore SD', 'Jones RJ', 'Burke PJ', 'Cheng YC', 'Grochow LB', 'Kaufmann SH']","['Division of Pharmacology, Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD 21287-8934.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'ITX08688JL (Quinidine)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Camptothecin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Mucosa', 'Quinidine/pharmacology', 'Remission Induction', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Topotecan', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.10.2193 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Oct;12(10):2193-203. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.10.2193.,,"['CA 44358/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-57738/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred fifty-six patients were transplanted for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL; n = 79), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML; n = 182), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML; n = 195); 42 patients were transplanted for aplastic anemia (AA) and 59 for a variety of other hematologic and nonhematologic disorders, malignant and nonmalignant. Conditioning regimens included high-dose chemotherapy with or without total-body irradiation (TBI). Statistical analyses determined the cumulative incidence of developing a secondary cancer and elucidated the associated risk factors. Complete records (1 to 24 years of follow-up) on all patients were available. RESULTS: Nine patients developed 10 secondary cancers for a cumulative actuarial risk of 12% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.3 to 23.0) 11 years after transplant. The age-adjusted incidence of secondary cancer was 4.2 times higher than that of primary cancer in the general population. Eight of the 10 were epithelial in origin and three were cutaneous. TBI and acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with a severity > or = grade II were associated with the development of any secondary cancer. On the other hand, chronic GVHD was a risk factor only for the development of secondary skin neoplasms. CONCLUSION: Adult recipients of BMT face a significant risk of developing a secondary malignancy. Their risk is similar to that of other patients with hematologic malignancies who are treated with chemoradiotherapy only. Epithelial tumors, rather than the more commonly reported Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphomas, were most common. The fact that we did not routinely use T-cell-depleted marrow grafts nor anti-T-cell immunoglobulin for the treatment of acute GVHD may explain this variance.","['Lowsky, R', 'Lipton, J', 'Fyles, G', 'Minden, M', 'Meharchand, J', 'Tejpar, I', 'Atkins, H', 'Sutcliffe, S', 'Messner, H']","['Lowsky R', 'Lipton J', 'Fyles G', 'Minden M', 'Meharchand J', 'Tejpar I', 'Atkins H', 'Sutcliffe S', 'Messner H']","['Department of Medicine, Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.10.2187 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Oct;12(10):2187-92. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.10.2187.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The concentration of sCD23 was measured in the serum of 45 B-CLL patients, 50 patients with other lymphoproliferative disorders, and 41 healthy donors (HD). sCD23 serum levels from B-CLL patients were correlated with parameters of disease activity and total tumor mass (TTM) score. In selected cases, sCD23 was measured repeatedly over a 24-month period. Expression, density, and calculated total amount of membrane CD23 on peripheral-blood B-CLL cells, as well as its correlation to sCD23 levels in serum and supernatants, were determined. RESULTS: sCD23 in B-CLL patients serum was highly elevated as compared with other lymphoproliferative disorders, with the exception of immunocytoma (IC). Both advanced Rai stages and active forms of B-CLL were associated with higher levels of sCD23. There was a highly significant reciprocal relationship between sCD23 and lymphocyte count doubling time (LCDT). Serum sCD23 correlated positively with serum deoxythymidine kinase activity and TTM score, but not with absolute lymphocyte counts. The repetitive measurement of serum sCD23 showed the usefulness of this marker in monitoring disease progression in B-CLL. The total amount of membrane CD23 on in vitro-cultured B-CLL cells correlated significantly with sCD23 levels in the supernatant, whereas correlation between serum sCD23 and membrane CD23 on freshly isolated B-CLL cells was absent. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that sCD23 is a highly sensitive and specific parameter with prognostic potential for B-CLL, which may be used as a tumor marker and may help to assess disease activity.","['Reinisch, W', 'Willheim, M', 'Hilgarth, M', 'Gasche, C', 'Mader, R', 'Szepfalusi, S', 'Steger, G', 'Berger, R', 'Lechner, K', 'Boltz-Nitulescu, G']","['Reinisch W', 'Willheim M', 'Hilgarth M', 'Gasche C', 'Mader R', 'Szepfalusi S', 'Steger G', 'Berger R', 'Lechner K', 'Boltz-Nitulescu G', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, L.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May 1987 and November 1992, 43 patients were diagnosed with AML. Tissue typing at diagnosis determined whether patients would proceed to autologous or allogeneic BMT as end consolidation after six cycles of chemotherapy. Conditioning for BMT was with BuCy, followed by allogeneic or unpurged autologous marrow infusion. RESULTS: Of 37 patients who received chemotherapy, 35 achieved remission (95%) after one to six courses of treatment and 34 (92%) were transplanted. Five relapsed before BMT, four were subsequently transplanted in second complete remission (CR2) (n = 3) or untreated first relapse (n = 1), and one failed to respond to further therapy. All other patients proceeded to BMT in first complete remission (CR1). Eleven patients received allografts: one relapsed and one died of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), for a leukemia-free survival rate of 90% at a median of 41 months after BMT (range, 3 to 60). For 23 autografts, there were two toxic deaths and eight relapses, with a leukemia-free survival rate of 61% at a median of 11 months after BMT (range, 0 to 66). The high relapse rate following autologous BMT led us to escalate the dose of Bu from 16 mg/kg to 600 mg/m2 using a single daily dose of Bu. CONCLUSION: With modern supportive therapy, most newly diagnosed children with AML will enter remission and are eligible for intensification therapy. BuCy is well tolerated in children, which allowed us to escalate the dose of Bu in recent patients. Further follow-up is needed to determine whether this has an impact on the relapse rate following autologous BMT.","['Shaw, P J', 'Bergin, M E', 'Burgess, M A', 'Dalla Pozza, L', 'Kellie, S J', 'Rowell, G', 'Stevens, M M', 'Webster, B H', 'Bradstock, K F']","['Shaw PJ', 'Bergin ME', 'Burgess MA', 'Dalla Pozza L', 'Kellie SJ', 'Rowell G', 'Stevens MM', 'Webster BH', 'Bradstock KF']","['Department of Oncology, Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, Camperdown, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.10.2138 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Oct;12(10):2138-45. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.10.2138.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A study exploring changes in treatment strategies over two decades.,401-9,"OBJECTIVES: The aim was to analyse the consumption of different items in conventional treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and their cost, in order to evaluate the economic consequences of new treatment strategies. DESIGN: Data on items of treatment were gathered retrospectively from case notes, including amount and date. Prices were gathered from price lists made up for internal billing/accounting. SETTING: The patients were all treated in a hospital with excellent treatment and service facilities. SUBJECTS: Seventy-three AML patients treated from 1973 to 1980, all since deceased, were compared with 54 patients treated from 1981 to 1988, of whom 14 were alive at the end of the observation period. INTERVENTIONS: The patients were treated according to randomized treatment protocols to achieve complete remission. Maintenance treatment or consolidation courses were given. In relapse, new induction treatment was given. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Complete remission and survival were registered. The costs were divided into basic hospital costs and patient-specific costs. RESULTS: The mean total treatment cost for an AML patient in the 1970s was 211,138 SEK, and in 1980s 356,911 SEK. (UK 1 pound = 10.57 SEK, US$1 = 5.91 SEK 1990). All treatment costs increased between the periods: hospital costs by 20%, and patient-specific costs by 186%. Antibiotics, cytostatics and outpatient department costs had increased the most. The mean survival time almost doubled, and in the 1980s group there were several long-term survivors. CONCLUSIONS: The costs for AML treatment increased considerably from the 1970s to the 1980s. The effectiveness of these treatments increased as well, resulting in increased rate and duration of survival, and several patients were long-term survivors. It was not possible to identify the cost consequences of separate new technologies.","['Stalfelt, A M', 'Brodin, H']","['Stalfelt AM', 'Brodin H']","['Department of Social Medicine, Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Intern Med,Journal of internal medicine,8904841,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Combined Modality Therapy/economics', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Female', 'Hospital Costs/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*economics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncology Service, Hospital/*economics', 'Quality of Life', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Sweden', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2796.1994.tb00816.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Intern Med. 1994 Oct;236(4):401-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2796.1994.tb00816.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is because a substantial amount of disease-related genetic damage appears in the blood cells of these patients, thus masking genetic damage that may have been caused prior to the disease. We describe a new approach that may be used to measure precancer-related chromosomal aberrations in such patients by totally separating the affected T lymphocytes from the malignant B lymphocytes. The approach employs stable chromosome translocations and will detect prior exposures above the detection limit of approximately 0.05-0.1 Gy. The utility of this approach is illustrated by using blood lymphocytes from a nuclear dockyard worker who claims his B cell leukaemia was induced by work-related radiation exposures. Blood lymphocytes were obtained after diagnosis of the disease, but prior to therapy, and measurements were made of the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities in PHA-stimulated lymphocytes without prior separation of T and B cells and in T lymphocytes after complete separation from B cells using a rosetting technique. Results show that the separation of T cells prior to PHA stimulation eliminates the cancer-related chromosomal damage and thus appears to facilitate biodosimetry of pre-cancer exposures in such patients.","['Lucas, J N', 'Swansbury, G', 'Clutterbuck, R', 'Hill, F', 'Burk, C', 'Straume, T']","['Lucas JN', 'Swansbury G', 'Clutterbuck R', 'Hill F', 'Burk C', 'Straume T']","['Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, University of California, Livermore 94551.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Separation', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*diagnosis', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping/methods', 'Male', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Trisomy']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['LKDRELVDXBQ1GCQD [pii]', '10.1080/09553009414551331 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 1994 Oct;66(4):385-9. doi: 10.1080/09553009414551331.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence for multiple in vivo T cell clonal expansions.,4281-90,"To characterize circulating T cell subpopulations in B chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, TCR V alpha and V beta gene-segment use was analyzed by PCR using a panel of V gene-segment subfamily-specific oligonucleotide primers (V alpha 1-29/V beta 1-24). Virtually all V alpha and V beta subfamily specificities were expressed in these patients (nine stage A and four stage C), and the mean values obtained for each specificity were similar to those of a group of 13 healthy donors. Nonetheless, individual analysis revealed that unique V alpha or V beta gene-segment transcripts were overrepresented in patients compared with the control group. Overrepresentation of some TCR V beta chains was also detected by cytofluorometric analysis using a panel of 18 anti-V beta-specific mAbs. To further characterize these T cell subpopulations, we sequenced five different V beta-C beta PCR products in two selected stage A patients and found highly predominant recurrent transcripts in each of the five V beta specificities (50% to 100% of the analyzed sequences with identical V(D)J regions). These results were confirmed on bulk cDNA (i.e., without cloning) and extended to other V beta specificities (up to nine clonal expansions of 24 V beta specificities in one patient) and two other patients using a PCR-based method that determines V(D)J junction size patterns. Finally, it was observed that a V beta 19+ T cell subpopulation was clonally expanded in one patient to up to 30% of circulating T cells. This V beta 19+ CD8+ T cell clone was shown to specifically recognize the autologous tumor cells in vitro, as determined in cytokine release assays. Together, these results support the view that multiple expansions of unique T cell clones may derive in vivo from B chronic lymphocytic leukemia tumor-associated Ag stimulation.","['Farace, F', 'Orlanducci, F', 'Dietrich, P Y', 'Gaudin, C', 'Angevin, E', 'Courtier, M H', 'Bayle, C', 'Hercend, T', 'Triebel, F']","['Farace F', 'Orlanducci F', 'Dietrich PY', 'Gaudin C', 'Angevin E', 'Courtier MH', 'Bayle C', 'Hercend T', 'Triebel F']","['Immunology Unit, Gustave Roussy Institute, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/biosynthesis/*genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 Nov 1;153(9):4281-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We report six cases of concurrent CTCL and BCM in which B- and T-cell lineages were demonstrated by immunologic studies. The literature includes 13 additional cases. All 19 CTCL-BCM cases are reviewed. RESULTS: CTCL either preceded or followed the BCM, which was a low-grade malignancy in most cases (16 of 19). Possible explanations for the association include a genetic predisposition, underlying viral infection, chemotherapy-induced carcinogenesis, stimulation of a B-cell clone by malignant helper T cells, and alterations in progenitor cells before determination of B- and T-cell lineage. CONCLUSION: An alteration in progenitor cells, with subsequent oncogenic activation of variable origin, might account for most cases of coexistent CTCL and BCM.","['Grange, F', 'Avril, M F', 'Esteve, E', 'Joly, P', 'Bosq, J', 'de Murets, A', 'Thomine, E', 'Ortoli, J C', 'Duvillard, P', 'Vaillant, L']","['Grange F', 'Avril MF', 'Esteve E', 'Joly P', 'Bosq J', 'de Murets A', 'Thomine E', 'Ortoli JC', 'Duvillard P', 'Vaillant L', 'et al.']","['Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycosis Fungoides/*pathology', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0190-9622(94)70232-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0190-9622(94)70232-2 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 1994 Nov;31(5 Pt 1):724-31. doi: 10.1016/s0190-9622(94)70232-2.,,,37,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis by polymerase chain reaction of individual colonies.,1383-9,"Interferon-alpha induces durable cytogenetic remissions in about one-quarter of newly diagnosed patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Even so, after short-term follow-up, previous studies have shown that residual leukemic cells can be detected by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in all of these individuals. The objectives of our study were therefore to obtain long-term follow-up data on residual disease in a cohort of complete responders and to determine if leukemic cells with clonogenic potential are present in patients despite the absence of relapse. We performed (a) serial analysis of blood and/or bone marrow for a reverse transcriptase PCR amplified BCR-ABL transcript at times well beyond the point that cytogenetic remission was first attained and (b) reverse transcriptase PCR of individually plucked myeloid and erythroid colonies for the presence of the same transcript. Seven CML patients who had previously attained complete cytogenetic remission while on interferon-alpha were investigated. Six of the seven patients were in complete cytogenetic remission at the time of analysis, whereas one patient had early evidence of cytogenetic relapse. With ongoing therapy, five patients with the longest follow-up eventually achieved PCR negativity at time periods of 27, 32, 36, 49, and 67 mo after a complete cytogenetic remission was first noted. Even so, residual disease was detected in progenitor cells derived from two patients, each of whom had been in continuous cytogenetic remission for approximately 2.5 and 3.5 yr, respectively. Progenitors expressing BCR-ABL transcripts were also detected in the patient with early cytogenetic relapse. These observations demonstrate that residual disease resides in colony-forming cells that should have the potential to repopulate the bone marrow. However, the presence of a minority of Ph-positive CML progenitor cells for a very long period of time is still compatible with durable remission, confirming that a situation of tumor dormancy may be induced in CML by interferon therapy.","['Talpaz, M', 'Estrov, Z', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Ku, S', 'Foteh, A', 'Kurzrock, R']","['Talpaz M', 'Estrov Z', 'Kantarjian H', 'Ku S', 'Foteh A', 'Kurzrock R']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry', 'Cohort Studies', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis/blood', 'Remission Induction', 'Stem Cells/chemistry/*pathology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC295262,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI117473 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1994 Oct;94(4):1383-9. doi: 10.1172/JCI117473.,"['ABL', 'BCR']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Half-maximum stimulation by the purified CD-GF was achieved at a concentration of 40 ng/ml.

Of the 13 complexes comprising the three series, 3 were inactive in the cisplatin-resistant L1210/DDP model, but the other 10 maintained good efficacy (T/C = 131%-167%). Long-term survivors, frequently observed with these complexes in the L1210/0 model, were also seen in the L1210/DDP model but to a lesser extent. In the homologous alicyclic series, which contained six analogs, as the alicyclic ring size increased, potency against L1210/0 and L1210/DDP cells also increased up to cyclohexylamine, and then declined. Four ammine/alicyclic amine analogs were evaluated against L1210/DACH cells, which are cross-resistant to tetraplatin, and the clinically predictive M5076 reticulosarcoma. Although the congeners were ineffective or minimally effective in prolonging the survival time of L1210/DACH-bearing mice (T/C = 111%-134%), 20%-40% cure rate was consistently observed and suggested that the compounds possessed a low inherent ability to circumvent resistance in these tumor cells also. In the solid M5076 model, activity was greatest (tumor growth delays of about 25 days) for the alicyclic homologs containing the ammine/cyclobutylamine or ammine/cyclopentylamine carrier ligand combination. In summary, ammine/amine platinum (II) analogs have demonstrated promise at the preclinical level in their ability to circumvent acquired resistance, which is a major drawback of cisplatin use in treating cancer.","['Siddik, Z H', 'Thai, G', 'Yoshida, M', 'Zhang, Y P', 'Khokhar, A R']","['Siddik ZH', 'Thai G', 'Yoshida M', 'Zhang YP', 'Khokhar AR']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Platinum Compounds)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Platinum Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01212810 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1994;120(10):571-7. doi: 10.1007/BF01212810.,,"['P030 CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA41581/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA50380/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following denaturation and renaturation, EDN and EDNsFv were partially purified by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose. Final purification of EDN was achieved by Sephadex G-100, whereas EDNsFv which contained a 6-histidyl residue carboxyl terminus was highly purified using the metal chelate resin, Ni(2+)-nitriloacetic acid. Whereas the recombinant EDN had ribonuclease activity that was similar to the native protein, the fusion protein had enzymatic activity that was 6-13% that of native EDN. The fusion protein was able to bind to the human transferrin receptor. In contrast to rEDN that had no inherent cytotoxicity to human tumor cells, the EDNsFv fusion protein was cytotoxic to human leukemia cells that express the human transferrin receptor with an IC50, 0.2-1 nM. At 1.3 nM EDNsFv, no cytotoxicity was observed on cells that lack the human transferrin receptor. Free antibody to the human transferrin receptor, E6, inhibited the cytotoxicity of the EDNsFv. Human enzymes may be engineered to acquire cytotoxic properties by fusing them to antibodies.

GLVR1 is shown to have approximately 3-4-fold higher affinity for phosphate than other mammalian phosphate transporters described to date. Productive infection of GLVR1-expressing cells by GaLV, but not other retroviruses, results in the complete blockade of GLVR1-specific uptake of inorganic phosphate. Since productive infection of cells with GaLV is generally not cytotoxic, it is likely that more than one phosphate transporter exists on the cell surface.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Available experimental and clinical data on the influence of fractionation on leukemia cell killing, immunosuppression, and sparing of normal tissues were analyzed. RESULTS: Review of available data shows: (a) The role of fractionation on leukemia cell killing may vary with the leukemia type. For acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia, a few experimental and several clinical studies show no or little fractionation effect; a 12-13 Gy fractionated scheme could, therefore, be more efficient than a conventional 10 Gy single dose total body irradiation. For chronic myelogenous leukemia, some sensitivity to fractionation is suggested, so that an increase in total or fractional dose may be necessary in fractionated schemes to equate the efficacy of a 10 Gy single dose. For acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a high fractionation sensitivity was observed for some leukemic cell lines in vitro, without undisputable clinical confirmation for the moment. (b) Numerous experimental studies have demonstrated that the immunosuppressive effect of total body irradiation, a major determinant of engraftment, is highly fractionation sensitive. In humans, high rates of graft failures have been reported when T-cell depletion of the graft was associated to fractionated total body irradiation schedules. (c) A large amount of radiobiological and clinical data have demonstrated that late radiation-induced injuries to normal tissues and organs are highly fractionation sensitive. However, in a context of total body irradiation for bone marrow transplantation, the number of other determinants of normal tissue damage makes it difficult to demonstrate a clear-cut advantage of fractionated over single dose scheme, with a possible exception for children. CONCLUSIONS: In 1994, available data suggest that very cautious attempts could be made to adapt total body irradiation schedules to the potential normal tissue toxicity, T-cell depletion, and to the type of leukemia.","['Cosset, J M', 'Socie, G', 'Dubray, B', 'Girinsky, T', 'Fourquet, A', 'Gluckman, E']","['Cosset JM', 'Socie G', 'Dubray B', 'Girinsky T', 'Fourquet A', 'Gluckman E']","[""Departement d'Oncologie Radiotherapique, Institut Curie, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,,"['Bone Marrow/radiation effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Gonads/radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Kidney/radiation effects', 'Lens, Crystalline/radiation effects', 'Leukemia/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Liver/radiation effects', 'Lung/radiation effects', '*Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",,1994/09/30 00:00,1994/09/30 00:01,['1994/09/30 00:00'],"['1994/09/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/30 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(94)90031-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(94)90031-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1994 Sep 30;30(2):477-92. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(94)90031-0.,,,159,,,,,,,,,,,,

A systematic survey of the literature and autoptic evaluation of the larynx in a relatively small number of patients with systemic lymphoreticular malignancies yielded the following findings: Primary tumors of the larynx must be clearly distinguished from laryngeal involvement by systemic or leukemic infiltrations. By far the most common primary hemopoietic tumors of the larynx are extramedullary plasmacytoma (about 90 cases published) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL; about 65 cases published). Primary Hodgkin's disease, granulocytic sarcoma and mast cell sarcoma are extremely rare at this site. Plasmacytoma and NHL both preferentially involve the supraglottis. The subglottis is infrequently affected. Laryngeal plasmacytoma and NHL usually present clinically as localized stage IE and IIE tumors that exhibit no significant tendency to recur or generalize. The therapy of choice is local irradiation while chemotherapy should be reserved for recurrent or progressive disease. Prognosis is favourable in most cases of primary laryngeal plasmacytoma and NHL. Secondary involvement of the larynx by systemic lesions or leukemic infiltrations is usually associated with a very poor prognosis. The prognosis of patients with laryngeal involvement in acute or chronic myeloid leukemia is always poor. Although the histopathological diagnoses given in many case reports are often difficult to compare because of differences in terminology, there seems to be a marked preponderance of B-cell tumors of high-grade malignancy (centroblastic or immunoblastic lymphoma in the Kiel classification of NHL) that probably represents lymphomas originating from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Horny, H P']",['Horny HP'],"['Abteilung fur Spezielle Histopathologie und Zytopathologie, Universitat Tubingen.']",['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,HNO,HNO,2985099R,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Laryngeal Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Larynx/pathology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Prognosis']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,HNO. 1994 Jul;42(7):398-404.,,,107,,,,,,,Der Kehlkopf bei lymphoproliferativen und myeloproliferativen Erkrankungen.

However, established human tumor cell lines along with fully immunocompetent autologous lymphocytes, are seldom available. Therefore studies were carried out to test whether parental or TZC-treated tumor cells could be differentially recognized by allogeneic lymphocytes. Experiments were performed in both human and murine models, using a lung adenocarcinoma line treated in vitro with TZC, or an established xenogenized mouse lymphoma, respectively. The results indicate that allogeneic cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) recognize specifically murine TZC-treated tumor cells.

We determined the titers of neutralizing antibodies by densitometrically scanning the intensity of the PCR bands. These titers correlated well with those determined by the plaque assay using a pseudotype of vesicular stomatitis virus bearing the envelope antigens of HTLV-1. At high serum concentrations, many seronegative samples markedly inhibited the plating of the HTLV-1 pseudotype whereas they barely affected results obtained by PCR.

Among the irradiated patients, cancer mortality was significantly greater than expected from the national rates for England and Wales, with a ratio of observed deaths to expected (relative risk, RR) of 1.30, and significant increases individually for leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma and cancers of the oesophagus, colon, pancreas, lung, bones, connective and soft tissue, prostate, bladder and kidney. Among the unirradiated patients, cancer mortality was lower than expected from national rates (RR = 0.79). Among irradiated patients, the RRs for leukaemia, lung cancer, and all other neoplasms all decreased significantly with increasing time since first treatment following an initial increase. By 35 years after first treatment, the radiation-related excess for lung cancer had completely disappeared, while for other neoplasms the RR remained significantly raised, although at a lower level than in earlier periods. Most irradiated patients received several courses of treatment within a 5-year period. Based on a 1 in 15 random sample, the mean total body dose received in this period was 2.64 Gy, with the heaviest dose to the vertebrae.

The following data indicate that diminished apoptotic response was the mechanism of acquired pleiotropic drug resistance: (i) apoptosis was a common mechanism of cell death for agents expressing cross-resistance; (ii) induction of apoptosis by drugs, medium depletion and serum deprivation was decreased in R9 cells; (iii) DNA degradation in apoptotic cells was lower in resistant lines, probably reflecting a modification of apoptotic pathway in resistant cells; (iv) inhibition of cell division and DNA synthesis by drugs was similar in sensitive and resistant cells. These data indicated a similar level of initial damage, as typical for resistance based on modified apoptotic response. There was no difference in bcl-2 protein level between sensitive and resistant cells. Thus acquired pleiotropic resistance and diminished apoptotic response in R9 cells were induced by a bcl-2-independent mechanism. Surface T-cell antigen CD4 was expressed in MOLT-4 and lost in R9 cells. The role of CD4 down-regulation in apoptosis-related drug resistance remains to be explored. The association between acquired pleiotropic drug resistance and increased survival capacity in unfavorable growth conditions indicated that drug-induced selection of cells with diminished apoptotic response may stimulate neoplastic progression. Alkylating agents induced similar cytotoxicity and only slightly lower apoptosis in R9 cells in comparison with MOLT-4 cells. Our data show that some drugs may overcome acquired pleiotropic drug resistance based on the modified apoptotic pathway.","['Frankfurt, O S', 'Seckinger, D', 'Sugarbaker, E V']","['Frankfurt OS', 'Seckinger D', 'Sugarbaker EV']","['Oncology Laboratory, Cedars Medical Center, Miami, Fl 33136.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines/pharmacokinetics']",,1994/10/15 00:00,1994/10/15 00:01,['1994/10/15 00:00'],"['1994/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910590214 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1994 Oct 15;59(2):217-24. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910590214.,,['CA50677/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent epidemiological findings have also shown an association between cigarette smoking and an increased risk of leukemia. However, further evidence is required to document the biological plausibility of this association. In evaluating this link, it is important to note that cigarette smoke contains benzene and various pyrolytic compounds, among other carcinogens. This study aims to determine the uptake of benzene by measuring 3 benzene-related compounds in cigarette smokers and non-smokers. Urinary concentrations of catechol (CAT), hydroquinone (HQ), and trans,trans-muconic acid (tt-MA) were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorimetric and UV detection, respectively. The results showed that these compounds were present in all urine samples. However, the concentrations were significantly higher in smokers than in non-smokers. The mean level of urinary tt-MA was 0.19 +/- 0.09 mg/g creatinine for 46 male smokers and the corresponding value for 40 non-smokers was 0.14 +/- 0.07 mg/g creatinine. The mean concentrations of HQ and CAT were 0.81 +/- 0.4 and 3.51 +/- 2.6 mg/g creatinine for smokers, and 0.45 +/- 0.4 and 1.94 +/- 1.2 mg/g creatinine for non-smokers, respectively. These results suggest that cigarette smoking is associated with a significant additional exposure to benzene and its related compounds. Furthermore, significant correlations were observed between the concentrations of cotinine, the metabolite of nicotine, and the above compounds. These findings suggest that the exposure originated from cigarette smoking.","['Ong, C N', 'Lee, B L', 'Shi, C Y', 'Ong, H Y', 'Lee, H P']","['Ong CN', 'Lee BL', 'Shi CY', 'Ong HY', 'Lee HP']","['Department of Community, Occupational and Family Medicine, National of Singapore, Kent Ridge.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Benzene Derivatives)', 'K5161X06LL (Cotinine)']",IM,,"['Benzene Derivatives/*urine', 'Cotinine/urine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Male', 'Smoking/*urine']",,1994/10/15 00:00,1994/10/15 00:01,['1994/10/15 00:00'],"['1994/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910590206 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1994 Oct 15;59(2):177-80. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910590206.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Optimal effects were obtained at 100, 75, and 60 microM of the 3 bile acids respectively. Cell-cycle flow-cytometric analysis showed that a substantial fraction of HL60 cells accumulated at the G0/G1 transition. Protein-kinase-C inhibitors such as sphinganine and H-7 inhibited the differentiation-inducing effect of bile acids, suggesting a possible role for PKC in this regulation. When bile acids were combined with non-effective concentrations of all-trans retinoic acid, enhancement of the monocytic differentiation of THP-1 human leukemia cells was observed.

Forty-nine B-cell neoplasms, including 20 cases of monocytoid B-cell lymphoma (MBCL), were studied by frozen section immunohistochemistry with these antibodies to evaluate their utility. Tonsil, lymph node, and reactive spleen also were studied with the antibodies. Although a wide overlap was observed among the different lymphomas, a majority of cases of MBCL and half of cases of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) reacted with both markers, suggesting both marginal/follicular and mantle cell antigen expression. None of four cases of mantle cell lymphoma reacted with the proposed mantle cell marker UCL3D3, whereas three of these cases immunoreacted with UCL4D12. This marker is known to react with a subpopulation of follicular center cells and possibly with marginal zone lymphocytes. A comparison of nodal and extranodal neoplasms failed to show a significant difference in the pattern of immunoreactivity with these antibodies. Tonsil and lymph node controls showed some mantle zone staining with both antibodies, and there was a slight overlap in mantle and marginal zone staining of the spleen controls. These findings suggest an immunologic similarity between some cases of HCL and MBCL.

Allogeneic BMT from C3H/HeJ mice and treatment with PBS yielded T cell leukemia in chimeras after the same latent period as that observed in normal AKR/J mice. In contrast, IL-2-treated chimeras caused an incidence of only 40% T cell leukemia. The preventing effect of IL-2 on leukemia development was not observed in one-year-treated chimeras, probably due to a lack of continuous antileukemic effects over the long term. Both LAK and NK activities in spleen cells were significantly increased in IL-2-treated chimeras. The cytotoxicity against T cell lymphoma cell line derived from AKR/J also increased in the IL-2-treated chimeras. Similarly, LPS-, PWM-, and IL-2-induced responses were increased in the IL-2-treated chimeras. TNF-alpha secretion from spleen cells also rose after IL-2-administration. IL-1 beta, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha mRNA became detectable in spleen cells using the PCR technique. The characteristics of leukemia cells in chimeras with overt leukemia were not directly affected by IL-2 administration. It is suggested that partial inhibition of spontaneous T cell leukemia development in AKR/J mice by allogeneic BMT and IL-2 may be due to the enhancement of graft-versus-leukemia effects. Further study may provide insights into the mechanisms involved in preventing leukemia development after allogenic BMT and IL-2 in AKR/J mice.","['Hashino, S']",['Hashino S'],"['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi,[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science,17410290R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chimera', 'Cytokines/metabolism', '*H-2 Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi. 1994 May;69(3):601-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been reported that various diseases occur in transgenic mice harboring either tax, pX, or env-pX gene, such as mesenchymal tumor, neurofibroma, thymic atrophy, muscle degeneration, exocrinopathy and arthropathy. We previously demonstrated that rat but not mouse CD4 positive T cells could be easily infected and immortalized by HTLV-I and infectious transmission of HTLV-I induced HAM/TSP-like myelopathy in WKAH rats after long incubation periods of 16 months. These observations prompted us to produce a series of transgenic rats that expressed the pX gene products under the control of mouse H-2Kd promotor in order to evaluate further the biological and pathological function of the pX gene in vivo. In various tissues of pX transgenic rats (pX rats), pX mRNA was constitutively expressed irrespective of age. PX rats developed mammary tumors with massive infiltration by neutrophils as early as 9 months of age. Pathological and immunohistochemical examination revealed that the tumors were undifferentiated carcinomas of the mammary gland origin. They were transplantable into pX rats, but not into normal syngenic rats. High levels of mRNA expression of not only the pX transgene but also the host genes such as Gro (melanoma growth-stimulatory activity/KC), MIP-2 (macrophage inflammatory protein-2) and IL-1 alpha were demonstrated in the tumor tissues. Gro and MIP-2 which were known as IL-8 families were likely to be produced by tumor cells and appeared to be responsible for neutrophil infiltration in the tumor tissues.

We applied this relatively uncommon approach to the study of prognosis in 137 patients affected by acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS AND RESULTS: Employing simple presentation parameters (age, WBC, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly) we used cluster analysis to define 3 groups with different overall survival (p = 0.0019). This classification was obtained following a rescaling of the variables and principal component analysis. Validation was performed through random definition of a control group. With the same variables, univariate analysis demonstrated age was the only prognostic factor, while Cox's model was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: In our series cluster analysis allowed a better definition of prognosis than Cox's analysis. Since the 3 groups are well identifiable, each patient can be rapidly classified and his allocation confirmed by discriminant functions. For cluster 2 we were able to project a possible myelodysplastic evolution, while cluster 3 was more frequently associated with a monocytic blastic component. We think that cluster analysis deserves consideration as an alternative statistical approach in the analysis of large series of data; its usefulness lies in its power to define homogeneous prognostic or biologic subgroups and to elaborate further hypotheses for new studies.","['Rigolin, G M', 'Fagioli, F', 'Spanedda, R', 'Scapoli, G', 'Lanza, F', 'Cuneo, A', 'Tomasi, P', 'Castoldi, G']","['Rigolin GM', 'Fagioli F', 'Spanedda R', 'Scapoli G', 'Lanza F', 'Cuneo A', 'Tomasi P', 'Castoldi G']","['Institute of Hematology, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1994 May-Jun;79(3):233-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we report our preliminary results with this drug in B-CLL patients. METHODS AND PATIENTS: Twenty-seven B-CLL patients (16 refractory to previous therapy, 7 responsive and treated for subsequent disease reexpansion, 4 untreated with active disease) were administered FLU at a dose of 25 mg/sqm for 5 days every 4 weeks. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were evaluable and 14 of them (56%) were responsive. All four untreated patients responded: 1 CR (PCR analysis showed the persistence of clonal VDJ rearrangement) and 3 PR, while 67% of the previously responsive group again showed a reaction: 2 PR (33%) and 2 nodular PR (33%). Among the refractory patients we recorded 6 responses (39%): 1 CR (6%) and 5 PR (33%). Besides 2 cases of lethal myelotoxicity, we observed 2 cases of encephalopathy and 2 cases of heart failure. Four deaths may have been related to FLU therapy (15%). CONCLUSIONS: We confirm the effectiveness of FLU and the improved outcome, in terms of toxicity and response rate, it provides in untreated B-CLL patients. Further studies are needed to explore the possible negative effects of FLU on neuronal and heart function, and the impact of this drug on survival in selected groups of patients.","['Spriano, M', 'Clavio, M', 'Carrara, P', 'Canepa, L', 'Miglino, M', 'Pierri, I', 'Celesti, L', 'Rossi, E', 'Vimercati, R', 'Bruni, R']","['Spriano M', 'Clavio M', 'Carrara P', 'Canepa L', 'Miglino M', 'Pierri I', 'Celesti L', 'Rossi E', 'Vimercati R', 'Bruni R', 'et al.']","['I Division of Hematology, S.

METHODS: CD23 expression was determined with FITC-labelled anti-CD23 monoclonal antibody, and sCD23 release with a sandwich enzyme immunoassay. Twenty-one patients affected by B-CLL (stage A or B) were studied before and after three different treatment regimens (alpha-interferon, corticosteroids, alpha-interferon+corticosteroids). RESULTS: CD23 was highly expressed in the B-cells of all patients, and expression was not modified by any of the therapies, sCD23 release from leukemic cells was significantly greater (p < 0.00001) in untreated subjects than controls, and in vitro treatment with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) led to a 10-fold increase (p < 0.0001) in sCD23 secretion. On the contrary, PMA did not increase sCD23 release in normal B cells. Treatment with corticosteroids (either alone or associated with alpha-interferon) reduced sCD23 secretion from leukemic cells, whereas alpha-interferon alone was not able to modify sCD23 release. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the hypothesis that CD23 plays a role in the maintenance and progression of B-CLL and that the pharmacological modulation of this receptor/lymphokine could be useful in the therapy of B-CLL.","['Pozzato, G', 'de Paoli, P', 'Franzin, F', 'Tulissi, P', 'Moretti, M', 'Basaglia, G', 'Santini, G F']","['Pozzato G', 'de Paoli P', 'Franzin F', 'Tulissi P', 'Moretti M', 'Basaglia G', 'Santini GF']","['Istituto di Patologia Medica, Cattedra di Medicina Interna II, Universita di Trieste, Ospedale di Pordenone, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Steroids)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, IgE/biosynthesis/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Steroids/*pharmacology']",,1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1994 May-Jun;79(3):205-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of these cells have rearranged their heavy-chain locus but not their light chain genes, suggesting that an active v-abl protein interferes with this differentiation step. To test this hypothesis, light-chain gene structure was examined in pre-B cells transformed by temperature-sensitive mutants of the Abelson virus and in derivatives that survive at the nonpermissive temperature because they express a human BCL-2 gene. Our studies reveal that inactivation of the v-abl protein tyrosine kinase triggers high-frequency rearrangement of kappa and lambda light-chain genes. These events are accompanied by marked increases in the expression of RAG-1 and RAG-2 RNAs. These increases occur in the absence of protein synthesis but are dependent on inactivation of the v-abl protein tyrosine kinase. As documented in the accompanying paper (Klug et al., this issue), an active v-abl protein also suppresses the activity of NF-kappa B/rel and expression controlled by the kappa intron enhancer. Together these data demonstrate that the v-abl protein specifically interferes with light-chain gene rearrangement by suppressing at least two pathways essential for this stage of B-cell differentiation and suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation is important in regulating RAG gene expression.","['Chen, Y Y', 'Wang, L C', 'Huang, M S', 'Rosenberg, N']","['Chen YY', 'Wang LC', 'Huang MS', 'Rosenberg N']","['Immunology Graduate Program, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', '0 (RAG2 protein, human)', '0 (Rag2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Recombinases)', '0 (V(D)J recombination activating protein 2)', '128559-51-3 (RAG-1 protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (integron integrase IntI1)']",IM,,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', '*Homeodomain Proteins', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/genetics', '*Integrases', 'Introns', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel', 'Recombinases']",,1994/03/15 00:00,1994/03/15 00:01,['1994/03/15 00:00'],"['1994/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1101/gad.8.6.688 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Dev. 1994 Mar 15;8(6):688-97. doi: 10.1101/gad.8.6.688.,"['RAG-1', 'RAG-2', 'rel', 'v-abl']","['CA09172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA24220/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abelson-transformed pre-B cell lines generally retain transcriptionally inactive, unrearranged immunoglobulin kappa alleles. We demonstrate that nontransformed pre-B cells expanded from the mouse bone marrow efficiently transcribe unrearranged kappa alleles. In addition, they contain activated complexes of the NF-kappa B/Rel transcription factor family, in contrast with their Abelson-transformed counterparts. Using conditionally transformed pre-B cell lines, we show that the v-abl viral transforming protein, a tyrosine kinase, blocks germ-line kappa gene transcription and negatively regulates NF-kappa B/Rel activity. An active v-abl kinase specifically inhibits the NF-kappa B/Rel-dependent kappa intron enhancer, which is implicated in promoting both transcription and rearrangement of the kappa locus. v-abl inhibits the activated state of NF-kappa B/Rel complexes in a pre-B cell via a post-translational mechanism that results in increased stability of the inhibitory subunit I kappa B alpha. This analysis suggests a molecular pathway by which v-abl inhibits kappa locus transcription and rearrangement.","['Klug, C A', 'Gerety, S J', 'Shah, P C', 'Chen, Y Y', 'Rice, N R', 'Rosenberg, N', 'Singh, H']","['Klug CA', 'Gerety SJ', 'Shah PC', 'Chen YY', 'Rice NR', 'Rosenberg N', 'Singh H']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Illinois 60637.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,1994/03/15 00:00,1994/03/15 00:01,['1994/03/15 00:00'],"['1994/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1101/gad.8.6.678 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Dev. 1994 Mar 15;8(6):678-87. doi: 10.1101/gad.8.6.678.,['v-abl'],"['5T32GM08369/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 24220/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07183/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both respiration and maximal ATP synthase capacity were more severely diminished by H2O2 in induced cells. The effects were mediated by intracellular redox-active iron and OH. radicals. Specifically, the mechanisms of the selective oxidant injury to F0F1 ATP synthase observed in differentiating cells likely involved impairment of F0-F1 coupling sensitive to oligomycin. We suggest a Fenton-like reaction of H2O2 with iron ions, more available in the differentiating cells, as occurring at the surface and/or in the lipid bulk phase of the inner mitochondrial membrane, thus injuring subunits responsible for the coupling of F0F1 ATP synthase through generation in situ of the actual damaging species. Besides, we propose heme iron as the most likely candidate for such reaction in induced cells actively synthesizing heme.

Fc alpha-receptors (Fc alpha R) are present on neutrophils, eosinophils and a series of human mononuclear phagocytes, including monocytes, alveolar macrophages and leukaemia cell lines (U-937). In the present study, using idiotypes and anti-idiotypic antibodies, we report that THP-1 cells, a myelomonocytic cell line, constitutively express Fc alpha R and that all IgA preparations used bind the receptor. Of the stimuli used (phorbol myristate acetate, retinoic acid, calcitriol), only calcitriol can induce differentiation of THP-1 cells, as assessed by CD14 expression. The expression of Fc alpha R appears to be independent of cell differentiation, since calcitriol pretreatment has no effect on IgA-binding. Finally, My43, a monoclonal antibody recognizing the Fc alpha R on U-937 cells, does not bind to THP-1 cells or to human alveolar macrophages. In addition, preincubation of THP-1 cells or human alveolar macrophages with My43 does not diminish IgA-binding to these cells. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) encoding the Fc alpha R isolated from U-937 is expressed, although possibly at a lower level, in alveolar macrophages and THP-1 cells. In conclusion, Fc alpha R are constitutively expressed on THP-1 cells and share some characteristics with the Fc alpha R described in human alveolar macrophages. THP-1 cells, therefore, may represent a reasonable model for further investigation of the interaction of immunoglobulin A and tissue macrophages.","['Sibille, Y', 'Depelchin, S', 'Staquet, P', 'Chatelain, B', 'Coulie, P', 'Shen, L', 'Vander Maelen, C', 'Vaerman, J P']","['Sibille Y', 'Depelchin S', 'Staquet P', 'Chatelain B', 'Coulie P', 'Shen L', 'Vander Maelen C', 'Vaerman JP']","['Experimental Medicine Unit, Catholic University of Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur Respir J,The European respiratory journal,8803460,"['0 (IgA receptor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Macrophages, Alveolar/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Fc/*biosynthesis']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur Respir J. 1994 Jun;7(6):1111-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, the oxidative response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) is normal. We now show that, in PV patients exhibiting significantly reduced PMN chemiluminescence after PAF stimulation, PAF induced platelet aggregation was also reduced--40 +/- 3% compared to 50 +/- 2% in controls (p < 0.01). The defective aggregatory response to PAF in PV remained over a wide range of stimuli concentrations. Platelet aggregation induced by PMA and ADP, however, was similar in PV and controls. In contrast, platelet aggregation induced by PAF (or by ADP and PMA) was not significantly reduced in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, essential thrombocythemia and multiple myeloma. Furthermore, the release of beta-thromboglobulin was slightly but not significantly higher after PAF stimulation in PV and this argues against an abnormal PAF receptor as the cause of the defective function. Thus, not only PV neutrophils, but also PV platelets show a discrete defect of the stimulus response coupling for PAF, indicating a disease-specific abnormality that appears to be of clonal origin.","['Le Blanc, K', 'Berg, A', 'Palmblad, J', 'Samuelsson, J']","['Le Blanc K', 'Berg A', 'Palmblad J', 'Samuelsson J']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, Stockholm Soder Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Adenosine Diphosphate/*pharmacology', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood', 'Platelet Activating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Platelet Aggregation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Polycythemia Vera/*blood', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",,1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1994.tb00662.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1994 Sep;53(3):145-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1994.tb00662.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although autocrine growth stimulation of human leukemias is occasionally observed in vitro, it is possible that mutations of signal-transduction or cell-cycle control genes may also be important in the development of factor independence. We have previously shown that the proto-oncogene Raf-1, a 70-kd serine/threonine protein kinase, is rapidly phosphorylated and activated by hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), and Steel factor and is likely to be an important intermediate in mitogenic signal transduction pathways in hematopoietic cells. In an effort to better understand the possible role of abnormal signal transduction in the development of factor independence, we compared the state of phosphorylation and associated kinase activity of Raf-1 between a series of factor-dependent human and murine-myeloid normal cells or cell lines and a series of factor-independent myeloid cell lines. In factor-dependent myeloid cells (normal neutrophils; monocytes; and the cell lines MO7, 32Dc13, and FDC-P1), Raf-1 phosphorylation and associated kinase activity was strictly regulated by the supply of growth factor. In contrast, each of eight factor-independent leukemic cell lines examined, HL-60, KG-1, K562, U937, JOSK-S, JOSK-M, JOSK-K, and JOSK-I, expressed hyperphosphorylated Raf-1 with increased Raf-1 associated kinase activity in the absence of growth factor addition. To further explore the relationship of Raf-1 to factor-independent growth, factor-independent sublines were derived from two factor-dependent cell lines, MO7 and FDC-P1, by culture in CSF-deprived medium. Also, several factor-independent sublines were derived by transfection of a cDNA encoding p210BCR/ABL into three different cell lines: MO7, 32Dc13, and FDC-P1. In each case, the new sublines expressed constitutively hyperphosphorylated and activated Raf-1. The correlation of hyperphosphorylation of Raf-1 with factor independence was also observed with primary acute myeloblastic leukemia cells. The rate of ""spontaneous"" proliferation of primary acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) cells in vitro correlated with the extent of Raf-1 phosphorylation. These results suggest that the evolution of myeloid leukemic cells to factor independence is associated with phosphorylation and activation of Raf-1, implicating Raf-1 and signal transduction pathways which activate RAf-1 in this process.","['Okuda, K', 'Matulonis, U', 'Salgia, R', 'Kanakura, Y', 'Druker, B', 'Griffin, J D']","['Okuda K', 'Matulonis U', 'Salgia R', 'Kanakura Y', 'Druker B', 'Griffin JD']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)']",IM,,"['Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1994 Oct;22(11):1111-7.,['Raf-1'],"['CA34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47843/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Enhancement of cell adhesion to fibronectin was also observed on treatment of HL60 cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). However, an additive effect of BZ alpha GalNAc and TPA treatments was not observed. The expression of VLA4 and VLA5 did not change during treatment with BZ alpha GalNAc or TPA. Cell adhesion to fibronectin before and after treatment with BZ alpha GalNAc or TPA was inhibited by anti-VLA4 and anti-VLA5 monoclonal antibodies. Staining of the cells with Helix pomatia lectin demonstrated that culturing of the cells with BZ alpha GalNAc blocked elongation of O-linked oligosaccharides on the cell surface and led to accumulation of GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr. Labeling of cell surface carbohydrates with [3H]-glucosamine followed by treatment with TPA revealed that O-glycosylated glycoproteins including CD43 were released from the cell surface during this treatment. These findings indicate that integrin-dependent cell adhesion, particularly VLA4- or VLA5-dependent cell adhesion, of HL60 cells is prevented with the extension of O-linked oligosaccharides and recovers with the disappearance of O-linked oligosaccharides from the cell surface.","['Kojima, N', 'Saito, M', 'Tsuji, S']","['Kojima N', 'Saito M', 'Tsuji S']","['Glyco Molecular Biology, Frontier Research Program, Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Benzyl Compounds)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (SPN protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '3554-93-6 (benzyl-alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine)', 'KM15WK8O5T (Acetylgalactosamine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'RSY4RK37KQ (Swainsonine)']",IM,,"['Acetylgalactosamine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Antigens, CD', 'Benzyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Fibronectins/*physiology', 'Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Leukocytes/*physiology', 'Leukosialin', 'Oligosaccharides/metabolism', 'Sialoglycoproteins/analysis', 'Swainsonine/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(84)71291-2 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1994.1291 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1994 Oct;214(2):537-42. doi: 10.1006/excr.1994.1291.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Baicalein, esculetin and related compounds, baicalein, wogonin, esculin and scoparone, inhibited CEM cell proliferation. Baicalein exhibited the greatest antiproliferative activity with an IC50 of 4.7 +/- 0.5 microM and the maximal suppression of 91.5 +/- 1.4% in CEM cells. The protein tyrosine kinase activity in the CEM cells was significantly reduced by baicalein (10(-6)-10(-4) M) and esculetin (10(-4) M). Baicalein exhibited a greater inhibitory activity on the protein tyrosine kinase than did esculetin (74.1 +/- 3.3% vs. 64.6 +/- 2.8% inhibition at 10(-4) M). On the other hand, the protein kinase C activity stimulated by phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate was reduced by directly incubating with baicalein (10(-6)-10(-4) M) and esculetin (10(-4) M). However, the inhibitory activities on protein kinase C did not show a dose-dependency. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of platelet-derived growth factor-A (PDGF-A) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) messenger RNA levels demonstrates that baicalein and esculetin reduced the PDGF-A mRNA level, but less affected the TGF-beta 1 mRNA. Baicalein exhibited the greater reduction on the expression of PDGF-A mRNA than did esculetin. It is suggested that baicalein and esculetin may affect cell proliferation by direct inhibition of growth-related signal, protein tyrosine kinase, as well as reduction of mRNA expression of growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor.","['Huang, H C', 'Hsieh, L M', 'Chen, H W', 'Lin, Y S', 'Chen, J S']","['Huang HC', 'Hsieh LM', 'Chen HW', 'Lin YS', 'Chen JS']","['Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Umbelliferones)', '49QAH60606 (baicalein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'SM2XD6V944 (esculetin)']",IM,,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', '*Flavanones', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Umbelliferones/*pharmacology']",,1994/06/15 00:00,1994/06/15 00:01,['1994/06/15 00:00'],"['1994/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0922-4106(94)90121-x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 1994 Jun 15;268(1):73-8. doi: 10.1016/0922-4106(94)90121-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These tumors are either lymphomas (4 cases) or germ cell tumors (15 cases). Their diagnosis was not difficult, although in the first stages enlarged and painful testicles are often wrongly identified as orchiepididymitis and treated as such. Therapy management proves to be delicate as a result of the significant tumor spread seen in these patients with dysfunctional immune systems. Regarding lymphomas, a low-dose multiagent chemotherapy with intrathecal chemotherapy was recommended by Levine. Concerning germ cell tumors, Wilson prefers an instant aggressive treatment with retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy (whether or not combined with chemotherapy) to avoid the risk of recurrence.

We have previously identified in vivo phosphorylation sites and some of the protein kinase systems involved. Two distinct proline-directed kinase families phosphorylate Ser25 and Ser38 of Op18 with overlapping but distinct site preference. These two kinase families, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and cyclin-dependent cdc2 kinases, are involved in receptor-regulated and cell-cycle-regulated phosphorylation events, respectively. During analysis of Op18 phosphorylation in the Jurkat T-cell line, we also found that Ser16 of Op18 is phosphorylated in response to a Ca2+ signal generated by T-cell receptor stimulation or the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. As suggested by a previous study, T-cell-receptor-induced phosphorylation events may be mediated by the Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase type Gr (CaM kinase-Gr). The present study shows that activation of this protein kinase correlates with phosphorylation of Ser16 of Op18, and in vitro experiments reveal efficient and selective phosphorylation of this residue. The CaM kinase-Gr is only expressed in certain lymphoid cell lines, and the present study shows that ionomycin-induced phosphorylation of Op18 Ser16 is restricted to cells expressing this protein kinase. Finally, CaM kinase-Gr-dependent in vitro phosphorylation of a crude cellular extract reveals a striking preference of this protein kinase for Op18 compared to other cellular substrates. In conclusion, the results suggest that Ser16 of Op18 is a major cytosolic target for activated CaM kinase-Gr.","['Marklund, U', 'Larsson, N', 'Brattsand, G', 'Osterman, O', 'Chatila, T A', 'Gullberg, M']","['Marklund U', 'Larsson N', 'Brattsand G', 'Osterman O', 'Chatila TA', 'Gullberg M']","['Department for Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Microtubule Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STMN1 protein, human)', '0 (Stathmin)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', '*Microtubule Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Phosphoproteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/metabolism', '*Serine', 'Stathmin', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1994.00053.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1994 Oct 1;225(1):53-60. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1994.00053.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An antiserum raised against the unique V3 domain of PKC-theta identified an 80-kDa protein in all human T-cell lines tested, in erythroleukemia K562 cells and in histiocytic lymphoma U-937 cells, but not in a B-lymphoma line (Raji) or in several melanoma, carcinoma, schwanoma or astrocytoma lines, confirming, at the protein level, its predominant expression in hematopoietic cell lines, in particular T cells. Immunoreactive PKC-theta was detected almost exclusively in the cytosolic compartment of unstimulated Jurkat T cells. Stimulation with phorbol ester, however, caused rapid translocation to the membrane. In order to compare the properties of PKC-theta with a representative member of the Ca(2+)-dependent PKC enzymes, full-length cDNAs encoding PKC-theta or PKC-alpha were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells, and recombinant enzymes were partially purified via a six-histidine peptide tag. The catalytic activity of these PKC enzymes was assayed against distinct substrates in the absence and presence of known PKC cofactors. Significant differences were found with respect to activation requirements and substrate preferences between PKC-theta and PKC-alpha. Both enzymes were stimulated by phospholipid and phorbol ester, and were active towards a PKC-derived substrate peptide corresponding to the pseudosubstrate site of PKC. In contrast to PKC-alpha, however, full activation of PKC-theta did not require Ca2+, and its basal activity towards histone H1 was not stimulated by lipid cofactors. Additionally, a myelin-basic-protein-(MBP)-derived peptide, which was readily phosphorylated by PKC-alpha, was a poor substrate for PKC-theta. Similar to PKC-alpha, transient PKC-theta overexpression in murine EL4 thymoma cells caused an approximately 2.5-fold increase in the phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced transcriptional activation of an interleukin-2 promoter-reporter gene construct. The unique expression and functional properties of PKC-theta suggest that it may play a specialized role in T-cell signaling pathways.","['Baier, G', 'Baier-Bitterlich, G', 'Meller, N', 'Coggeshall, K M', 'Giampa, L', 'Telford, D', 'Isakov, N', 'Altman, A']","['Baier G', 'Baier-Bitterlich G', 'Meller N', 'Coggeshall KM', 'Giampa L', 'Telford D', 'Isakov N', 'Altman A']",['La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Astrocytoma', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Lymphoma', 'Melanoma', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neurilemmoma', 'Protein Kinase C/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1994.00195.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1994 Oct 1;225(1):195-203. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1994.00195.x.,,['CA35299/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This conclusion has been reached through direct experiments performed with two MEL cell clones, one characterized by a high and the other by a low rate of differentiation. In both cell types, introduction of an anti-calpain antibody resulted in a significant delay in the onset of down-regulation of PKC isoforms, and in an increase in the latent period that precedes differentiation. Both cell lines also displayed reduced rates of PKC decay and accumulation of mature erythroid cells. Furthermore, in the fast-responding clone, calpastatin, the natural calpain-inhibitor protein, was found to be almost completely absent, resulting in activation and expression of proteolytic activity of calpain even at micromolar concentrations of Ca2+, a condition not sufficient to trigger calpain activation in the slowly responding clone which contains high levels of calpastatin.

At least three features of nucleosomal DNA could be responsible for the creation of these favored sites: the presence of histones, attachment of the DNA to a protein surface, and DNA bending. To test each of these possibilities, we studied integration in vitro with human immunodeficiency virus and murine leukemia virus integrases into four model targets that mimic features of nucleosomal DNA: (i) catabolite activator protein-DNA complexes; (ii) lac repressor-operator complexes; (iii) lac repressor-induced loops; and (iv) intrinsically bent A-tract DNA. We found that bending of the target DNA can create favored integration sites at the outer face of the helix, irrespective of whether the bent DNA is attached to a protein surface. Our findings offer an explanation for the preferred usage of nucleosomes as integration targets. In addition, they suggest that bending of the target DNA might be an intrinsic feature of the integration reaction.","['Muller, H P', 'Varmus, H E']","['Muller HP', 'Varmus HE']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco 94143-0502.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein/metabolism', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'HIV/physiology', 'Integrases', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/physiology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Nucleosomes/genetics/*virology', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*physiology', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",PMC395405,1994/10/03 00:00,1994/10/03 00:01,['1994/10/03 00:00'],"['1994/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1994 Oct 3;13(19):4704-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The precision of in vitro assays to test the susceptibility of cancer cells to cytotoxic drugs depends on the ability to maintain the cells' viability in culture. We found that bone marrow-derived allogeneic stromal cells are critical to prevent death by apoptosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Thus, we devised an in vitro drug sensitivity assay in which ALL cells are seeded onto stromal cells and viable leukemic cells are counted at the end of cultures by flow cytometry. Our preliminary results indicate that this assay is suitable for evaluating the drug sensitivity of leukemic lymphoblasts and testing the antileukemic activity of potentially effective compounds which have not yet been administered to patients with ALL. The identification of immunophenotypes expressed on leukemic cells but absent or extremely rare among normal hematopoietic progenitors allows close monitoring of the effects of drug treatment in vivo. Phenotypes that afford a detection level of 1 leukemic cell among 10,000 normal bone marrow cells have been identified in 90% of cases of T-ALL, 25% of B-lineage ALL, and 40% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

The role of Kupffer cells in tumor development is very important as Kupffer cells can be manipulated to a tumoricidal state with biological response modifiers to kill tumor cells and thus to decrease tumor burden and extend survival time. To gain additional information on the role of Kupffer cells and their interaction with tumor cells in hepatic metastases, we studied an established experimental hematogenous metastatic model (Friend erythroleukemia) in mouse livers by light and electron microscopy. Highly activated Kupffer cells were observed in close contact with tumor cells in sinusoids and also in tumor forming foci within the hepatic parenchyma. The Kupffer cells were activated by the presence of the hematogenous tumor cells and were able to lyse and phagocytose them. However, some tumor cells evaded the Kupffer cells as metastases still occurred. Kupffer cells and other macrophages were found to leave the sinusoids and migrate to sites of potential tumor development where they interacted with tumor cells and intimately wrapped their processes around fat storing cells. It is possible that these macrophages which cross biological barriers could be used to deliver drug-loaded microparticles (liposomes and microcapsules) to tumors.","['McCuskey, P A', 'Kan, Z', 'Wallace, S']","['McCuskey PA', 'Kan Z', 'Wallace S']","['Department of Diagnostic Radiology, University of Texas M.

We show that interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), although able to decrease in vivo the number of leukemic cells, protects chronic B lymphocytic leukemia cells from in vitro programmed cell death or apoptosis. This inhibition of spontaneous in vitro apoptosis of leukemic B cells was observed after 24-48 hr of culture with 100-1000 U of either Interferon-alpha 2a or 2b. The protective activity was observed in the majority of the patients tested (6 out of 8) independent of the amount of apoptosis observed. Furthermore, in contrast to IL-4, IFN-alpha did not up-regulate the expression of Bcl-2. This suggests that B-CLL cells can be prevented from undergoing apoptosis in vitro by at least two different mechanisms: one, triggered for instance by IL-4, is associated with Bcl-2 production and the second triggered by Interferon-alpha is Bcl-2 independent. To elucidate the pathways mobilized by Interferon-alpha we also studied the regulation of c-myc expression in our experimental system. We found that (i) induction of in vitro B-CLL apoptosis was not associated with up-regulation of c-myc, (ii) c-myc expression as assessed by mRNA and protein determinations was increased after in vitro or in vivo Interferon-alpha stimulation. Additional experiments using c-myc specific oligonucleotides demonstrated that when Interferon-alpha-mediated c-myc expression was decreased by 60%, the in vitro protective effect of Interferon-alpha was not modified. Thus our data show that in contrast to the situation in vivo, Interferon-alpha prevents spontaneous in vitro B-CLL cells apoptosis through a Bcl-2-independent pathway which is probably not related to c-myc up-regulation.","['Chaouchi, N', 'Wallon, C', 'Taieb, J', 'Auffredou, M T', 'Tertian, G', 'Lemoine, F M', 'Delfraissy, J F', 'Vazquez, A']","['Chaouchi N', 'Wallon C', 'Taieb J', 'Auffredou MT', 'Tertian G', 'Lemoine FM', 'Delfraissy JF', 'Vazquez A']","['INSERM U 131, Clamart, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Immunol Immunopathol,Clinical immunology and immunopathology,0356637,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Base Sequence', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*physiology', 'Up-Regulation/physiology']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0090122984711883 [pii]', '10.1006/clin.1994.1188 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Immunol Immunopathol. 1994 Nov;73(2):197-204. doi: 10.1006/clin.1994.1188.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with radiation-induced GH deficiency usually remain responsive to exogenous growth hormone releasing hormone, implying radiation damages the hypothalamus rather than the pituitary. Little is known about the effect of cranial irradiation on the neuroendocrine control of GH secretion. This study was to determine the effect of cranial irradiation on somatostatin tone. DESIGN: Somatostatin tone was examined by manipulating cholinergic tone in young adults with radiation-induced GH deficiency and a control population. Each individual underwent three separate studies: the GH response to 100 micrograms GHRH-(1-29)-NH2 was assessed alone, and 60 minutes after pyridostigmine or pirenzepine. PATIENTS: Eight young male adults with radiation induced GH deficiency following treatment in childhood for a brain tumour or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and ten healthy adult men were studied. MEASUREMENTS: Serum growth hormone was measured at 15-minute intervals throughout each of the three study periods. RESULTS: One of 10 controls and four of eight irradiated subjects had a peak GH level to GHRH analogue of less than 20 mU/l. After pretreatment with pyridostigmine, all subjects except one irradiated subject had a peak GH level of greater than 20 mU/l. Pretreatment with pyridostigmine and pirenzepine significantly modified the GH response to GHRH analogue within both groups (P < 0.0005). Pretreatment with pyridostigmine significantly enhanced the GH response to GHRH analogue (median (range) area under the curve, 9029 (1956-20940) mU/l/min in controls vs 1970 (628-3608) mU/l/min in the irradiated group) compared with GHRH analogue alone (1953 (512-16140) mU/l/min in control group vs 997 (266-3488) mU/l/min in the irradiated group). Pretreatment with pirenzepine significantly attenuated the GH response to GHRH analogue (552 (64-1274) mU/l/min in controls vs 305 (134-2726) mU/l/min in irradiated group). Between the groups there was no significant difference in GH area under the curve (AUC) after GHRH analogue alone. There was a significantly (P = 0.0014) greater increment of GH secretion after pyridostigmine and GHRH analogue compared with GHRH analogue alone (difference in AUC of pyridostigmine+GHRH analogue and GHRH analogue alone 6348 (696-12856) mU/l controls vs 542 (120-1340) mU/l in the irradiated group) and significantly (P = 0.033) greater suppression of GH secretion after pirenzepine and GHRH analogue compared with GHRH analogue alone (difference in AUC of GHRH analogue alone and pirenzepine+GHRH analogue 1644 (222-15205) mU/l in controls vs 479 (469-1623) mU/l in the irradiated group) in the control population compared with those who had received cranial irradiation in childhood. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that cranial irradiation reduces but does not abolish somatostatin (SRIH) tone and also reduces endogenous GHRH secretion. Although SRIH tone is reduced, it can be increased by cholinergic manipulation and is therefore not irreversibly fixed. This has possible implications if GHRH analogues were used to treat children with radiation induced GH deficiency.","['Ogilvy-Stuart, A L', 'Wallace, W H', 'Shalet, S M']","['Ogilvy-Stuart AL', 'Wallace WH', 'Shalet SM']","['Department of Endocrinology, Christie Hospital, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,"['0 (Peptide Fragments)', '3G0285N20N (Pirenzepine)', '51110-01-1 (Somatostatin)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', '9034-39-3 (Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone)', '90830-28-7 (somatotropin releasing hormone (1-29))', 'KVI301NA53 (Pyridostigmine Bromide)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Brain Neoplasms/radiotherapy', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Growth Hormone/blood/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Pirenzepine/pharmacology', 'Pyridostigmine Bromide/pharmacology', 'Somatostatin/blood/*metabolism']",,1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2265.1994.tb02525.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 1994 Aug;41(2):163-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2265.1994.tb02525.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since oxidation by cytochrome P-450 enzymes is critical in the catabolism of this drug, we evaluated whether pretreatment with an inhibitor of this system, liarozole, could attenuate this phenomenon. A total of 20 patients with solid tumors completed a 4-week course of all-trans RA therapy. On days 1, 2, 28, and 29, serial plasma samples were obtained from these patients after ingestion of a single oral dose (45 mg/m2) of all-trans RA. On days 2 and 29, liarozole was given 1 h prior to ingestion of all-trans RA at single doses ranging from 75 to 300 mg. The areas under the plasma RA concentration x time curves (AUCs) were then compared in the presence and absence of pretreatment. Following continuous oral treatment, the mean day-28 AUC of all-trans RA was significantly lower than the group mean level on day 1 (504 vs 132 ng h-1 ml-1; P = 0.05). This decline in plasma concentrations on day 28 was partially reversed by liarozole, which increased the mean plasma all-trans RA AUC on day 29 to 243 ng h-1 ml-1 (P = 0.004). The lowest dose of liarozole that reliably produced this effect was 300 mg. No enhanced toxicity was associated with liarozole administration. We conclude that liarozole at a dose of 300 mg effectively attenuates the induced decline in all-trans RA plasma concentrations that occurs with continuous treatment. This combination may be useful in attenuating or reversing retinoid resistance.","['Miller, V A', 'Rigas, J R', 'Muindi, J R', 'Tong, W P', 'Venkatraman, E', 'Kris, M G', 'Warrell, R P Jr']","['Miller VA', 'Rigas JR', 'Muindi JR', 'Tong WP', 'Venkatraman E', 'Kris MG', 'Warrell RP Jr']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Cornell University Medical College, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'K0Q29TGV9Y (liarozole)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacokinetics']",,1994/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00685665 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1994;34(6):522-6. doi: 10.1007/BF00685665.,,['CA-57645/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results show that total folate accumulation and depletion in tissues is closely related to plasma levels, with somewhat greater persistence occurring in tissues, presumably due to polyglutamylation. Examination of individual folates in plasma showed that the combined 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2FH4) plus tetrahydrofolate (FH4) pool was the most extensively elevated pool other than that of the parent compound [S]-5-formyltetrahydrofolate ([S]-5-CHOFH4). The dihydrofolate (FH2) also became elevated, whereas the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-CH3FH4) remained unchanged. Individual folates that were elevated in tissues were generally the same as those elevated in plasma, the exception being a significant accumulation of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10-CHOFH4) in both intestinal epithelial and L1210 cells. The elevation of FH2 in L1210 cells was greater and persisted longer than that in intestinal epithelium, whereas the opposite was true for CH2FH4 + FH4. This differential effect in tumor versus epithelial tissue is consistent with the selective rescue of normal tissue by LV.","['Bunni, M A', 'Sirotnak, F M', 'Otter, G M', 'Priest, D G']","['Bunni MA', 'Sirotnak FM', 'Otter GM', 'Priest DG']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Epithelium/metabolism', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*metabolism', 'Leucovorin/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Peritoneum/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00685654 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1994;34(6):455-8. doi: 10.1007/BF00685654.,,"['CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22754/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of the present work was-using the method of flow cytometry and monoclonal antibodies-to detect surface signs on lymphocytes in the peripheral blood stream of patients with lymphatic leukaemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 29 patients with chronic lymphatic leukaemia type B (B-CLL) CD signs were examined, using flow cytometry and the findings were compared with those obtained in a control group of 63 healthy subjects. Evidence of CD 19+ CD5+ lymphocytes (B1 cells) in B-CLL (83.4 +/- 15% vs. 3.5 +/- 1.9% in controls) was of diagnostic importance. These CD5+ B cells are polyreactive, ""memory B"" lymphocytes which contrary to ""conventional"" lymphocytes B2 (CD5-B) do not differentiate further to plasma cells. Accumulation of B1 (CD5+ B) lymphocytes was, on the other hand, associated in patients with B-CLL with a decrease of B2 (CD5-B) lymphocytes (2.8 +/- 4.0% vs 9.0 +/- 4.2%) (p < 0.01). This finding can in case of excess of B1 (CD5+ B) lymphocytes explain the tendency of patients with B-CLL to develop autoimmune complications (e.g. AIHA); and conversely a decrease of B2 (CD5-B) lymphocytes can lead to hypogammaglobulinaemia which is also associated with B-CLL. A tendency towards autoimmunity may be also promoted by a decline of so-called inductors of suppressor cells (CD 4+ CD45RA); in patients with B-CLL among CD4 T lymphocytes 32.5 +/- 15% CD 45RA+ cells were found, as compared to 43.0 +/- 14.8% in controls (p < 0.011) and a lower ratio of true suppressor T cells (CD8+ CD11b+) in patients with B-CLL: 47.0 +/- 17.6% CD11b+ from CD8+ cells, as compared with controls 80.4 +/- 13.3 CD11b from CD 8+ cells (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The method of flow cytometry with double fluorescence thus contributes to the accurate diagnosis of B-CLL, to monitoring of the therapeutic effect but also to knowledge of the immunopathology of the disease.","['Kvasnicka, J', 'Kruzik, P', 'Cmunt, E', 'Neurwirtova, R']","['Kvasnicka J', 'Kruzik P', 'Cmunt E', 'Neurwirtova R']","['Oddeleni klinicke hematologie, VFN, Praha.']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,,IM,,"['Adult', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Subsets']",,1994/08/22 00:00,1994/08/22 00:01,['1994/08/22 00:00'],"['1994/08/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/22 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/22 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 1994 Aug 22;133(16):506-10.,,,,,,,,,,Zastoupeni lymfocytarnich subpopulaci u chronicke lymfaticke leukemie typu B pri vysetreni prutokovou cytometrii.,,,,,

The aim of this work was to follow the effect of GM-CSF (Leucomax Sandoz) in myelosuppression after the therapy with cytotoxic drugs. METHOD AND RESULTS: Leucomax was given to 22 patients with oncohematological disease (3 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 5 patients with various myeloid malignacies, 4 myelomas and 10 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphomas). In comparison to the literary data lower doses of Leucomax were used, it is 150-200 micrograms a day and patient. The length of administration of the growth factor was reduced to the shortest possible time according to the leukocyte count monitoring. Leucomax administration was started when leukocytes dropped below 1.10(9), in patients with severe leukopenias after repeated chemotherapy Leucomax was applied earlier. From 17 patients treated for sufficiently long period of time 70% responded to the GM-CSF application without any serious side-effects. In most cases, with the exception of myeloma, the growth factor was applied for 4-10 days. The leukocyte increase above 3 x 10(9) appeared in 3-8 days after the start of the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Correctly indicated application of growth factors in postcytostatic myelosuppression is a great contribution to antitumor therapy. According to our experience in most cases 5-7 days of the daily dose of 150-200 micrograms of GM-CSF is sufficient for the stimulation of leukopoiesis. In postherapeutic myelosuppression in acute myeloblastic leukemia the growth factor should be used only as a life saving therapy since it can stimulate the leukemic cell population.","['Neuwirtova, R', 'Siskova, M', 'Kvasnicka, J', 'Cmunt, E', 'Benesova, E', 'Klamova, H']","['Neuwirtova R', 'Siskova M', 'Kvasnicka J', 'Cmunt E', 'Benesova E', 'Klamova H']","['Oddeleni klinicke hematologie FN2 s FP, Praha.']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use']",,1994/08/22 00:00,1994/08/22 00:01,['1994/08/22 00:00'],"['1994/08/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/22 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/22 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 1994 Aug 22;133(16):500-4.,,,,,,,,,,Pouziti rustoveho faktoru pro granulocyto-makrofagovou radu v lecbe postcytostaticke myelosuprese u onkohematologickych nemocnych.,,,,,

The low- and intermediate-level resistant cell lines, selected in < or = 40 ng/ml of vincristine, demonstrated resistance to Vinca alkaloids and to an epipodophyllotoxin but little or none to an anthracycline. The expression of murine mdr genes, as analyzed by Northern blotting, revealed a baseline expression of murine mdr2 in parental cells that was unchanged in the drug-resistant cell lines. Overexpression of mdr3 was observed only in the highest-level resistant cell line, PC-V160, whereas mdr1 mRNA was not detected in any of the cell lines. The polymerase chain reaction, using mdr3-specific primers, excluded the possibility that low levels of P-glycoprotein expression contributed to the resistance phenotype in the low and intermediate-level resistant cell lines. Northern blot analysis using a human complementary DNA probe for the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) demonstrated overexpression of murine mrp in each of the vincristine-selected sublines. Genomic amplification of the mrp gene was coincident with mrp overexpression. The expression of mrp was also examined in two series of previously characterized doxorubicin-selected cell lines derived from parental PC4 and C7D murine erythroleukemia cells. In contrast to the vincristine-selected cell lines, overexpression of mrp was not detected. These studies demonstrate that, in murine erythroleukemia cells selected for vincristine resistance, overexpression of murine mrp occurred prior to that for murine mdr.

Based on the ratio of the 50% inhibitory concentration values, B5-180(3) cells were approximately 35-fold resistant to 4HC compared with the parental cells. 4HC-induced ISC levels (as measured by alkaline elution) were approximately 9-fold lower in the 4HC-resistant line than the parent line. To determine whether the approximately 9-fold reduction of initial 4HC-induced ISCs was related to elevated aldehyde dehydrogenase (ADH), we examined PM-mediated cytotoxicity and ISC induction in the two cell lines. Unlike 4HC, the cytotoxicity of PM is independent of ADH activity. B5-180(3) cells were between 5- and 7-fold resistant to the cytotoxic effects of PM and were only slightly (approximately 1.3-fold) resistant to PM-mediated ISC induction. Furthermore, when cells were exposed to 4HC in the presence of 40 micrograms/ml cyanamide, an efficient inhibitor of ADH, the resistance index based on the 50% inhibitory concentration values was decreased to approximately 8. Elevated ADH can therefore explain most of the decrease in 4HC-induced ISCs, with elevated GSH levels probably accounting for the remaining small increment of resistance. Thus, decreased levels of ISC induction can account for a factor of approximately 9 of the total approximately 35-fold resistance to 4HC. The remaining increment of resistance to 4HC, as well as the cross-resistance to PM, appears to relate to an enhanced ability of the resistant subline to tolerate drug-induced ISCs. Thus, multiple factors appear to be involved in the resistance of these cells to the cytotoxic and DNA-damaging effects of 4HC, with elevated ADH and temporal factors (related to the processing of DNA damage) being the most important of these.","['Andersson, B S', 'Mroue, M', 'Britten, R A', 'Murray, D']","['Andersson BS', 'Mroue M', 'Britten RA', 'Murray D']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.

However, human and murine hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient leukemia cell lines have been shown to respond to 6TG by growth arrest and differentiation by a mechanism apparently not involving incorporation of 6TG into DNA. If so, leukemia cells resistant to 6MP should still respond to 6TG by growth arrest via an undescribed epigenetic mechanism. To test this, polyclonal 6MP-resistant variants were produced from three human leukemia cell lines, HL-60, U937, and CCRF-CEM. Treatment of both sensitive and resistant cells with 6TG induced growth arrest. The effect of 6TG in the 6MP-sensitive HL-60 and U937 cells was associated with significant loss of viability and DNA fragmentation. In contrast, the 6TG-treated 6MP-resistant cells exhibited a slower decline in viability and no DNA fragmentation. To identify the mechanism by which 6TG may induce growth arrest, tRNA was isolated from 6MP-resistant cells cultured for 48 h with 6TG. 6TG was found to be incorporated into tRNAs normally containing queuine in the anticodon wobble position.

In the PCR assay, 7 of 8 and 11 of 14 normal control specimens showed a polyclonal methylation pattern in the PGK and FMR1 genes, respectively. Of the malignant specimens, 17 of 17 and 17 of 18 showed a monoclonal methylation pattern in the PGK and FMR1 genes, respectively. The Southern blot and PCR assay gave similar results with regards to the PGK gene. It is concluded that the PCR and Southern blot clonality assays are comparable with regards to the PGK gene and that both the PGK and FMR1 genes may be reliably used in the determination of clonality. The methods, however, are limited by the skewed methylation patterns seen in hematological specimens in a significant number of normal females.","['Lee, S T', 'McGlennen, R C', 'Litz, C E']","['Lee ST', 'McGlennen RC', 'Litz CE']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota Hospital, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (FMR1 protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '139135-51-6 (Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein)', 'EC 2.7.2.3 (Phosphoglycerate Kinase)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Female', 'Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Methylation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics', 'Phosphoglycerate Kinase/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*RNA-Binding Proteins', 'X Chromosome']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Oct 1;54(19):5212-6.,['FMR1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was significant tumor inhibition, including tumor cure, when these tumor-inoculated mice were treated with either unmodified or 131I (300 microCi)-linked Dal B02 (50 micrograms/mouse), a monoclonal antibody directed against surface-associated antigens on human CLL B-cells and several histological types of B-lymphoma cells. There was no significant difference between the antitumor activity of unmodified Dal B02 and 131I-linked Dal B02 when the treatment was given 3 days after i.p. or i.v. inoculation of 5 x 10(6) D10-1 cells. However, when the mice were treated 3 days after i.p. inoculation of 15 x 10(6) D10-1 cells, or 7 days after the i.v. inoculation of 5 x 10(6) D10-1 cells, 131I-linked Dal B02 was a more potent tumor inhibitor than was unmodified Dal B02 (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). Two injections of 131I (500 microCi) linked to 100 micrograms of a Dal B02 F(ab')2 fragment preparation also prolonged the survival of i.p. or i.v. tumor-inoculated mice (P < 0.05 and P = 0.05, respectively). In nude mice with established s.c. xenografts of D10-1 cells, two injections of 131I (300 microCi) linked to 50 micrograms of Dal B02 led to complete tumor cure in 3 of 4, mice, but two injections of 50 micrograms of unmodified Dal B02 had no effect on the s.c. xenografts. Two injections of 131I (500 microCI) linked to 100 micrograms of Dal B02 F(ab')2 fragment caused significant tumor inhibition but no tumor cure. 131I (300 microCi) linked to 50 micrograms of a nonspecific IgG1 only led to minor tumor inhibition. A mixture of unmodified Dal B02 and 131I-linked nonspecific IgG1 was not a more potent tumor inhibitor than the 131I-linked nonspecific IgG1 preparation by itself. These results suggest that Dal B02 may be an effective carrier for the radioimmunotherapy of human B-cell CLL and other appropriate B-cell lymphomas, especially in the progressive phase of B-cell CLL, which is usually not amenable to currently available therapeutic modalities.","['Zhu, Z', 'Ghose, T', 'Hoskin, D', 'Lee, C L', 'Fernandez, L A', 'Lee, S H', 'Mammen, M']","['Zhu Z', 'Ghose T', 'Hoskin D', 'Lee CL', 'Fernandez LA', 'Lee SH', 'Mammen M']","['Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*radiotherapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', '*Radioimmunotherapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Oct 1;54(19):5111-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using an RNA-polymerase chain reaction assay, expression of this gene was examined in the highly chemoresistant pediatric malignancy, neuroblastoma. MRP expression was observed in 5 human neuroblastoma cell lines and in all 25 primary neuroblastoma tumors of stage I through IVS. Tumors with amplification of the N-myc oncogene were found to have significantly higher MRP expression that those with no amplification (P = 0.0016). Expression of the MRP gene in the tumor specimens was highly correlated with expression of the N-myc gene (P = 0.0009), while expression of the MDR1 gene, encoding P-glycoprotein, was not related to expression of either the N-myc or MRP genes. Decreased expression of the N-myc oncogene in neuroblastoma cell lines SH-SY5Y and BE(2)-C, following treatment with retinoic acid, was paralleled by down-regulation of MRP gene expression, contrasting with increased expression of the MDR1 gene. Expression of the MRP gene is thus common in both primary neuroblastoma tumors and cultured cell lines, and correlates with amplification and overexpression of the N-myc oncogene, which is central to the malignant phenotype of this disease.","['Bordow, S B', 'Haber, M', 'Madafiglio, J', 'Cheung, B', 'Marshall, G M', 'Norris, M D']","['Bordow SB', 'Haber M', 'Madafiglio J', 'Cheung B', 'Marshall GM', 'Norris MD']","[""Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research Centre, Prince of Wales Children's Hospital, Randwick, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', '*Gene Amplification', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neuroblastoma/*genetics', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Oct 1;54(19):5036-40.,['N-myc'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patient 1 had +11 as the sole chromosome aberration in 16/20 karyotypes whereas two related clones with +11 in all abnormal metaphases (14/18) were detected in patient 2. A proportion of interphase cells with three signals, comparable to the proportion of abnormal metaphases, was detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in these patients. Morphologic aberrations of the nonblast cell population affecting multiple cell lineages, along with a circulating minor megakaryoblastic component, were observed at diagnosis in both patients. By separation of bone marrow cells over a density gradient of Percoll two cell fractions were obtained, the former containing more than 80% erythroid precursors (collected at a density of 1065-1075 mg/ml), the latter containing more than 78% blast cells plus granulomonocytic precursors (collected at a density of 1060-1055 mg/ml). FISH documented the presence of a majority of interphase nuclei with three signals in the erythroblast-enriched cell fraction and in the blast-enriched cell fraction.

That the techniques one uses determine which findings one gets, is evident. But equally important is the influence of our a priori expectations; they may cause us to choose inadvertently those methods that are most likely to yield results that appear to confirm an already preconceived picture of reality. The conceptual models and methods of solid tumor cytogenetics are to a large extent inherited from leukemia and lymphoma cytogenetics. We illustrate how this may bias the generation and interpretation of new findings, especially when carcinomas are investigated. These malignant epithelial tumors much more often harbor cytogenetically unrelated clones than do hematologic or mesenchymal neoplasms. Carcinoma cytogenetics is therefore extremely susceptible to selection differences, making the results heavily dependent on which sample is processed, how it is disaggregated, how and for how long the cells are cultured, and on how the analysis is performed and the results presented. This calls for more efforts to be directed toward establishing also the phenotypic nature of those cells that are being karyotyped. As one cannot yet quality-grade most clonal chromosome changes in any reliable manner, meaning that one cannot determine to what extent each aberration or each clone contributes to the neoplastic process, statements about the ""true"" karyotypes of tumor parenchymas should be viewed with suspicion. A complete carcinoma karyotype may be much more complex than extrapolations from the analysis of a few cells may lead one to believe.","['Pandis, N', 'Bardi, G', 'Heim, S']","['Pandis N', 'Bardi G', 'Heim S']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Odense University, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,,"['Chromosomes, Human', '*Cytogenetics/methods', 'Humans', 'Medical Illustration', '*Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(94)90453-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(94)90453-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1994 Sep;76(2):77-84. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(94)90453-7.,,,64,,,,,,,,,,,,

PURPOSE: To examine the risk of fatal leukemia according to various farming practices in a large cohort of Canadian farm operators. METHODS: A cohort study of the mortality experience (1971-1987) of male farmers in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta has been conducted. The census records of 156,242 male farmers identified on the 1971 Census of Agriculture and the corresponding Census of Population were linked to mortality records through 1987. RESULTS: We observed a statistically significant test for trend (p = 0.03) between leukemia mortality and the number of chickens and/or turkeys owned (relative risk for > or = 130 chickens and/or turkeys = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.99, 1.77). No association was observed between leukemia mortality and either insecticide or herbicide use. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is necessary regarding why farmers exposed to chickens may be at an increased risk of leukemia.","['Semenciw, R M', 'Morrison, H I', 'Morison, D', 'Mao, Y']","['Semenciw RM', 'Morrison HI', 'Morison D', 'Mao Y']","['Laboratory Centre for Disease Control, Department of National Health and Welfare, Ottawa, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Can J Public Health,Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,0372714,,IM,,"['Adult', ""Agricultural Workers' Diseases/*mortality"", 'Alberta/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*mortality', 'Male', 'Manitoba/epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Saskatchewan/epidemiology']",,1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Can J Public Health. 1994 May-Jun;85(3):208-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Synthetic enediynes designed with low molecular complexity are also highly cytotoxic, specifically to human leukemic cells, by a mechanism involving the induction of apoptosis. We have used a variety of biological assays to evaluate the cytotoxic properties of synthetic dynemicin analogs which contain a spectrum of structural modifications and reactivities. It was found that the induction of apoptosis and nuclear degradation by the synthetic compounds did not require an ability to bind or cleave DNA. Prevention of apoptosis was observed in analogs which were electronically stabilized to inhibit aromatic rearrangement and generation of diradicals. The preventive capability of the stabilized analogs was observed against a wide variety of toxic agents including topoisomerase I and II inhibitors, anti-mitotic and DNA anti-metabolite drugs, as well as alkylating agents. The structural determinants involved in inhibiting the induction of apoptosis are described. The significance of these results with respect to relevant mechanism of tumor regression are discussed.","['Hiatt, A', 'Merlock, R', 'Mauch, S', 'Wrasidlo, W']","['Hiatt A', 'Merlock R', 'Mauch S', 'Wrasidlo W']","['Department of Cell Biology, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enediynes)', 'D3G8N2863A (dynemicin A)']",IM,,"['Anthraquinones/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enediynes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",,1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0968-0896(00)82187-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0968-0896(00)82187-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 1994 May;2(5):315-22. doi: 10.1016/s0968-0896(00)82187-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The efficacy and toxicity of 4HC are dose-related. The maximally tolerated concentration, 60-100 micrograms/ml, is toxic to tumor cells but also to normal committed hematopoietic progenitor cells. The anti-CD15 monoclonal antibody (mAb) PM-81 has also been employed for purging BM in patients with AML. In some patients, all tumor cells may not be lysed due to antigenic heterogeneity. Because the two agents used individually are associated with potential limitations in terms of toxicity to normal cells and efficacy of tumor cell purging, using these agents together might have advantages. In fact, in this study the use of these two agents together in subtherapeutic concentration ranges as single agents revealed killing of cells from the HL60 and NB4 promyelocytic leukemia cell lines in addition to cells from patients with AML while sparing normal progenitor cells. Surprisingly, not only did the combination enhance killing of tumor cells, but the order of addition of the two agents was important in maximizing toxicity to tumor cells. Adding mAb+complement (C') first or simultaneously to 4HC was less effective than adding 4HC first followed by mAb + C'. This combination regimen was toxic to HL60 and NB4 leukemia cells that may not be killed by the mAb alone due to antigen-negative tumor cells or by low concentrations of 4HC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Rubin, J', 'Malley, V', 'Ball, E D']","['Rubin J', 'Malley V', 'Ball ED']","['Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, PA 15213.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Hematother,Journal of hematotherapy,9306048,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/immunology', 'Lewis X Antigen/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.1.1994.3.121 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother. 1994 Summer;3(2):121-7. doi: 10.1089/scd.1.1994.3.121.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients were previously treated with conventional chemotherapy and 3 failed to respond to IFN-alpha administered prior to our study. Median duration of disease from diagnosis was 36 months. Seven patients were in first chronic phase and the other 3 were in blast crisis, second chronic phase, and relapse post-bone marrow transplantation (BMT), respectively. Hematological response (median follow-up 16 months) was observed in 9 patients, with a decline in number of white blood cells and platelets. Elimination of Ph1 was observed in the patient who relapsed post-BMT with complete elimination bcr/abl RNA by polymerase chain reaction. Rebound lymphocytosis and eosinophilia were observed in most of the patients. Toxicity was acceptable. The main adverse effects were fever, chills, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. The side effects were reversible and no interruption of treatment was required. There was no treatment-related hospitalization or deaths.

They are remarkably lytic with human complement. In addition, CAMPATH-1G (rat IgG2b) and CAMPATH-1H (human IgG1) bind to human Fc receptors and are very effective for cell lysis in vivo. CAMPATH-1M (rat IgM) and CAMPATH-1G have been used to control GVHD and graft rejection in bone marrow transplantation by depletion of the T cells of the donor and recipient. Depletion of donor T cells alone gave excellent control of GVHD but up to 20% of the patients transplanted from HLA-matched siblings, and 51% of those transplanted from nonsibling donors, experienced graft failure caused by immunological rejection. Graft rejection could be partly overcome by additional immunosuppression either with CsA or total lymphoid irradiation (TLI). More effective was the use of CAMPATH-1G in vivo to deplete residual host lymphocytes. Preliminary results from current protocols of antibody depletion give two year actuarial leukemia-free survival as good as or better than similar studies with conventional GVHD prophylaxis, as well as a decreased morbidity from chronic GVHD, although engraftment was delayed by about 5 days. We propose that prophylactic T cell depletion with CAMPATH-1 antibodies is a simple and valid alternative to drug-based immunosuppression that may be particularly applicable to patients with acute leukemia or nonmalignant diseases transplanted from HLA-matched siblings as well as any patients transplanted from unrelated donors. Future developments of antibody-based immunosuppression may allow the extension of marrow transplantation for tolerance induction to organ transplants or in autoimmune diseases.","['Hale, G', 'Waldmann, H']","['Hale G', 'Waldmann H']","['Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Hematother,Journal of hematotherapy,9306048,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Graft Rejection/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens/genetics', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', '*Immunoglobulin G', '*Immunoglobulin M', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recurrence', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.1.1994.3.15 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother. 1994 Spring;3(1):15-31. doi: 10.1089/scd.1.1994.3.15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experiences with cord blood transplants suggest that graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) may be less readily induced, even in the face of HLA differences. However, this decreased potential for GvHD might also abrogate the graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effects of the transplant. The GvL potential might be doubly compromised since cord blood NK activity is also decreased. We have compared alloreactivity, NK cell activity and lymphokine-activated killer cell (LAK) activity of cord blood mononuclear cells with adult mononuclear cells. We find a reduced (but not absent) alloproliferative, allostimulatory and allocytotoxic capacity of cord blood mononuclear cells. Phenotyping revealed no significant differences in the proportion of T cells in cord-versus-adult blood, but cord blood T cells were nearly all of the naive CD45RA subset. Expression of LFA-1 alpha and LFA-1 beta was normal on resting cord T cells; however, they expressed significantly less ICAM-1 (CD54) than did adult PBMC. Cord blood B cells and monocytes expressed normal levels of HLA Class II. Although no differences were found in NK cell percentages or subsets in resting cord blood, cord blood NK activity was very low. However, LAK activity was much more readily induced in cord blood as compared to adult PBMC, which could be explained in part by a higher frequency of LAK precursors (LAKp).

In this study we show that induced cellular differentiation of HL-60 cells grown in chemically defined media by dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to granulocytic cells increases the acetylhydrolase activity with a concomitant increased secretion of the enzyme into the media. This increase in acetylhydrolase activity is blocked by the presence of actinomycin D (1 microM) or cycloheximide (1-2 microM) in the culture media. Acetylhydrolase is located both in the cytosolic and particulate fractions; the relative distribution of acetylhydrolase activity in the particulate fraction and cytosol increases and decreases respectively, as the differentiation progresses. The addition of an intracellular protein transport inhibitor, monensin, causes further accumulation of acetylhydrolase activity in the particulate fraction and a decrease in the media, with no effect on the acetylhydrolase activity in the cytosol. Acetylhydrolase in differentiated HL-60 cells acquires properties similar to those of the plasma acetylhydrolase in that it becomes less sensitive to 5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid and p-bromophenacylbromide inhibition than the acetylhydrolase in undifferentiated cells. The acetylhydrolase secreted into the media by the differentiated cells was almost totally insensitive to these inhibitors, whereas the acetylhydrolase from the particulate fraction gave an intermediate response; the cytosolic acetylhydrolase was sensitive to both inhibitors. However, the acetylhydrolase secreted by differentiated HL-60 cells has a different electrophoretic mobility, temperature sensitivity, and association with lipoproteins when compared to that of human plasma acetylhydrolase. Collectively, these results indicate cellular differentiation induces intracellular acetylhydrolase activity through a mechanism involving both transcriptional and translational events. Furthermore, the acetylhydrolase synthesized during the DMSO-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells is then secreted into the media via the intracellular membrane transport system for proteins. Based on results obtained with HL-60 cells as a cell model, it is likely that more than one isoform of acetylhydrolase exists in the extracellular milieu.","['Lee, T C', 'Fitzgerald, V', 'Chatterjee, R', 'Malone, B', 'Snyder, F']","['Lee TC', 'Fitzgerald V', 'Chatterjee R', 'Malone B', 'Snyder F']","['Medical Sciences Division, Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, TN 37831-0117.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Lipid Mediat Cell Signal,Journal of lipid mediators and cell signalling,9430888,"['0 (Lipoproteins)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.47 (1-Alkyl-2-acetylglycerophosphocholine Esterase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,,"['1-Alkyl-2-acetylglycerophosphocholine Esterase', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Golgi Apparatus/drug effects/physiology', 'Granulocytes/cytology/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'Lipoproteins/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/enzymology', 'Phospholipases A/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Subcellular Fractions/enzymology', 'Temperature', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Lipid Mediat Cell Signal. 1994 May;9(3):267-83.,,"['HL27109-13A1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL35495-07A1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK42804-03A1/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Known purification procedures of MGSA from human sources or expression systems give a low yield and require multiple chromatography steps. Here, a fast and high-yield method for the purification of recombinant MGSA is described. Approximately 500 micrograms MGSA were recovered from the bacterial lysate of a 10 liter culture within a day. For this purpose, total mRNA of Hs294T melanoma cells was isolated and cDNA of MGSA was obtained by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction. The cDNA of MGSA was subcloned into the expression vector pGEX-2T, generating a fusion with the Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase gene. The fusion protein was expressed in E. coli DH5a and purified from the bacterial lysate using glutathione-sepharose beads. MGSA was cleaved from the complex of fusion protein and glutathione-sepharose beads with thrombin and purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography with a Mono-S-column. The bioactivity of the recombinant MGSA was assessed by chemotactic migration and triggered [Ca2+]i-transients in human neutrophils. In addition, [125I]MGSA bound specifically to undifferentiated human leukemia cells HL-60 transfected with the cDNA of the interleukin-8 (IL-8) receptor beta with similar properties as [125I]IL-8.

Trans-UCA was found to be a strong inhibitor of NK cell activity whereas cis-UCA had no effect. Trans-UCA also partially inhibited cytotoxic function of IL-2-activated NK cells and reduced IL-2-induced activation of NK cells. This is the first report describing trans-UCA to be active, and cis-UCA inactive, in regulating an immune function.

Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is known to open a receptor-operated ion channel (P2Z class) in human lymphocytes which conducts a range of cationic permeants. The activity of a range of different agonists and inhibitors towards the P2Z-purinoceptor was investigated by measuring the agonist-induced influx of Ba2+ into fura-2 loaded lymphocytes. 2. The most potent agonist was 2' & 3'-0-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP (benzoylbenzoic ATP) which gave 2 fold greater maximum Ba2+ influx and had a 10 fold lower EC50 than for ATP. The rank order of agonist potency in K(+)-media was benzoylbenzoic ATP >> ATP = 2-methylthio ATP = 2-chloro ATP > ATP-gamma-S. ADP, UTP and alpha,beta-methylene ATP were unable to stimulate Ba2+ influx. 3. Extracellular Na+ inhibited the increment of Ba2+ influx induced by all concentrations of ATP, 2-methylthio ATP, 2-chloroATP and ATP-gamma-S. This inhibitory effect of extracellular Na+ is also reflected in the different EC50s for benzoylbenzoic ATP (8 microM in K(+)-media, 18 microM in Na(+)-media) but the maximal response to this agonist was the same in the presence or absence of Na+. 4. Treatment of lymphocytes with 2,3 dialdehyde ATP (oxidized ATP0 at 300 microM for 60 min gave total and irreversible inhibition of ATP-induced Ba2+ influx. 5'-p-Fluorosulphonyl benzoyladenosine (FSBA) also was an irreversible inhibitor but the maximal inhibition achieved was 90%. 5. It is concluded that the P2z-purinoceptor of human lymphocytes has a rank order of agonist potency which clearly distinguishes it from other P2-receptors and that oxidized ATP is a convenient irreversible inhibitor for the P2Z-purinoceptor.","['Wiley, J S', 'Chen, J R', 'Snook, M B', 'Jamieson, G P']","['Wiley JS', 'Chen JR', 'Snook MB', 'Jamieson GP']","['Haematology Department, Austin Hospital, Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Purine Nucleotides)', '0 (Purinergic P2 Receptor Agonists)', '0 (Purinergic P2 Receptor Antagonists)', '24GP945V5T (Barium)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*pharmacology', 'Barium/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Culture Media', 'Cytosol/drug effects/metabolism', 'Fluorometry', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Potassium/pharmacology', 'Purine Nucleotides/*pharmacology', '*Purinergic P2 Receptor Agonists', '*Purinergic P2 Receptor Antagonists', 'Sodium/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC1910210,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1476-5381.1994.tb13172.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 1994 Jul;112(3):946-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1476-5381.1994.tb13172.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hemin strongly inhibited the growth of K562-L, which had a low Hb-producing activity, but not that of K562-H, which had a high Hb-producing activity. When the cell growth of K562-L was inhibited by hemin, the S phase of the cell cycle decreased and the G2/M phase increased. In contrast, hemin had no effect on the cell cycle of K562-H. Without hemin treatment, the alpha-globin mRNA level was related to the degree of Hb production in K562-L and -H but the gamma-globin mRNA level was not. With hemin treatment, there was no increase in the alpha-globin mRNA level in K562-L but there was an increase in K562-H. The difference in alpha-globin mRNA levels correlated with the Hb production in K562-L and -H induced by hemin. The levels of c-myc and c-myb mRNAs in K562-L decreased when cell growth was strongly inhibited by hemin. These findings indicate that the growth inhibition of K562 cells by hemin is due to a suppression of the progression from the G0/G1 phase to the S phase and a delay in the G2/M phase, caused by the inhibition of c-myc and c-myb transcription. It is also affected by the Hb production, reflected in alpha-globin transcription.","['Sasaki, D', 'Kosunago, S', 'Mikami, T', 'Matsumoto, T', 'Suzuki, M']","['Sasaki D', 'Kosunago S', 'Mikami T', 'Matsumoto T', 'Suzuki M']","['Department of Microbiology, Tohoku College of Pharmacy, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genes, myc/drug effects', 'Globins/biosynthesis', 'Hemin/*pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Oncogenes/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb.17.586 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 1994 May;17(5):586-90. doi: 10.1248/bpb.17.586.,"['c-myb', 'c-myc']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following standard conditioning, which included total lymphoid irradiation, the median days to reach 0.5 and 1.0 x 10(9)/l neutrophils were respectively 18 (range 9-34) and 28 (range 10-59); to 25 and 100 x 10(9)/l platelets the corresponding times were 17 days (range 5-32 days) and 27 days (range 13-127 days). In all, the day 14 trephine biopsy showed engraftment. At median follow-up of 20 months (range 5-44 months) only one patient has developed possible grade I cutaneous GVHD that responded promptly to corticosteroids: no chronic GVHD or CMV pneumonitis has been encountered. Of those with haematological malignancy transplanted in remission only two with acute leukaemia have relapsed. In aplastic anaemia graft loss initially occurred but this has been overcome by adding Campath-1G in vivo and omitting CsA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Jacobs, P', 'Wood, L', 'Fullard, L', 'Waldmann, H', 'Hale, G']","['Jacobs P', 'Wood L', 'Fullard L', 'Waldmann H', 'Hale G']","['University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre, Groote Schuur Hospital, S.

Campaigns promoting an unrelated marrow donor registry were started in August 1993 and recruited approximately 26,000 volunteers. A peripheral stem cell program is just beginning. The overall results of BMT in Taiwan are comparable to other countries. The complications of BMT are similar to Western series, except that acute GVHD was rarer in one large series; this observation needs further study. A particular indication for allogeneic BMT in Taiwan is thalassemia, accounting for 10% of all patients. Disease-free survival after BMT for thalassemia is 44%; graft rejection is the major cause of treatment failure. Another important issue is the role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in BMT, since the prevalence of HBV infection in Taiwan is very high (> 90%). Abnormal liver function is currently the most common complication and might be related to HBV. Among nearly 100 allogeneic BMTs with HBV carriers as either donor or recipient, 2 patients (approximately 2%) died of HBV-related hepatic failure.

In a follow-up study of 74,828 benzene-exposed and 35,805 non-exposed workers in China, pathology reports, medical records, and/or histopathologic material were reviewed for all patients with hematopoietic malignancies to ensure correct classification and to provide clinicopathologic descriptions. Eighty-two patients with hematopoietic neoplasms and related disorders were identified among benzene-exposed workers, including 32 cases of acute leukemia, 7--myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 9--chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL), 20--malignant lymphoma or related disorder (ML), 9--aplastic anemia, and 5 others. Among the comparison group, 13 hematologic malignancies were observed, including 6 patients with acute leukemia, 2--CGL, 3--ML, and 2 others. The hematopathologic characteristics of the benzene-exposed ANLL cases resembled those following chemotherapy or radiotherapy. ANLL in workers exposed to benzene may represent a distinct clinicopathologic entity, with characteristics similar to treatment-related ANLL, including a preceding preleukemic phase in some patients.

These include V gene replacement, ongoing gene rearrangement and somatic hypermutation. These mechanisms may be operational at discrete points in the B cell differentiation pathway and generate idiotype diversity in various malignant B cell tumors. In particular, V region mutations have been established as a major mechanism of tumor escape from anti-idiotype immunotherapy in some lymphoma. On the other hand, previous studies on a few selected cases have shown that this mutation process does not affect the B cell clone during chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, to what extent this intraclonal stability is a general phenomenon during B cell CLL is not clear. Therefore, we randomly selected 6 patients suffering from classical B cell CLL (sIgM (+), CD5 (+), CD19 (+)) at different stages of the disease and analysed the intraclonal variability of the expressed variable region of the heavy chain (VH). After PCR amplification of the cDNA corresponding to the rearranged VDJ regions, the products were cloned and sequenced. In five cases, multiple clone analysis did not show any intraclonal variability whatever the stage of the disease. Furthermore, in a single case, this intraclonal stability was confirmed during a three year period of time when the disease progressed. The sixth case behaved differently since we found multiple nucleotide substitutions, apparently accumulating as the malignant clone expanded. Besides the theoretical difficulties that these changes can induce during immunotherapy, two findings merit further discussion: 1) the distribution of the ongoing mutations affecting the VH region was not suggestive of an antigen driven selection, 2) this intraclonal variability was specific for the VH region, since the VL region showed no intraclonal variation.","['Korganow, A S', 'Martin, T', 'Weber, J C', 'Lioure, B', 'Lutz, P', 'Knapp, A M', 'Pasquali, J L']","['Korganow AS', 'Martin T', 'Weber JC', 'Lioure B', 'Lutz P', 'Knapp AM', 'Pasquali JL']","['Laboratory of Immunopathology, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Clone Cells/chemistry', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199409049651 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Jun;14(1-2):55-69. doi: 10.3109/10428199409049651.,['VH'],,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/S73953', 'GENBANK/S73955', 'GENBANK/S73957', 'GENBANK/S73959', 'GENBANK/S73961', 'GENBANK/S73963', 'GENBANK/S73966']",,,,

These results suggest that the competitive PCR technique is a reliable method to quantitatively determine mdr-1 gene expression, but it may be difficult to predict responsiveness to chemotherapy by using this technique alone.","['Kato, S', 'Ideguchi, H', 'Futata, Y', 'Hamasaki, N', 'Umemura, T', 'Nishimura, J']","['Kato S', 'Ideguchi H', 'Futata Y', 'Hamasaki N', 'Umemura T', 'Nishimura J']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Fukuoka University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199409049658 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Jun;14(1-2):129-35. doi: 10.3109/10428199409049658.,['mdr-1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both in vitro growth pattern and in vitro differentiation were significantly predictive for progression to AML. Other predictive parameters were FAB classification and the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities in all metaphases analysed. Since FAB classification and in vitro bone marrow culturing appeared confounding variables, the in vitro data were analysed for high risk patients, RAEB and RAEBt and low risk patients, RA and RARS. In 91/110 RAEB(t) patients the estimated chance to develop AML was 25% in cases of normal growth versus 62% if abnormal (p < 0.06). In 82/87 RA(RS) patients the estimated chance to develop AML was 5% and 40% respectively (p = 0.0004). After AML progression median survival was only 2 months (0-16.1 months). In RAEB(t) patients bone marrow culturing did not discriminate for better survival, although a trend was shown. The estimated median survival was 16 months if growth was normal versus 8 months if abnormal (p = 0.07). In RA(RS) patients the median survival also was not significantly different, 31 versus 22 months respectively (p = 0.39). However, if in vitro growth and differentiation were both normal a significant difference in median survival was observed, 35 versus 22 months (p = 0.016). In conclusion, in vitro bone marrow culturing has predictive value for AML development in RA(RS) patients. In RAEB(t), due to many patients dying early in cytopenia, the predictive value is less pronounced. Especially normal growth in RA(RS) patients makes progression to AML very unlikely and these patients should be considered for a supportive approach. In RA(RS) patients with normal growth and differentiation (about 25% of all patients) in vitro bone marrow culturing also predicts a better survival.","['Raymakers, R', 'Preijers, F', 'Boezeman, J', 'Rutten, E', 'De Witte, T']","['Raymakers R', 'Preijers F', 'Boezeman J', 'Rutten E', 'De Witte T']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Examination', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/*mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cells/pathology', 'Survival Rate']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199409049656 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Jun;14(1-2):111-20. doi: 10.3109/10428199409049656.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent data have shown that these breakpoints are clustered in a approximately 15kb region of a gene named HRX. This gene product has homology to the Drosophila trithorax gene product, which suggests it may play a role in regulating transcription control. Disruption of HRX as a result of chromosomal translocation is thought to contribute to the leukaemogenic process; this may occur in utero giving rise to infant acute leukaemia or may be induced by epipodophyllotoxic drugs resulting in secondary leukaemia. Translocations of 11q23 can involve a number of different partner chromosomes. The reciprocal genes on chromosomes 4q21, 9p22 and 19p13 have been recently cloned and are predicted to encode proline and serine rich proteins.

No significant correlation between myeloid surface marker expression and POEM positivity could be detected, while the presence of the CD 19 or CD 24 antigen significantly correlated with POEM negativity. The detection of lymphoid markers on POEM+ blasts indicates, that these leukemias might be derived from bipotential progenitors, which have retained their lymphoid antigens during myeloid differentiation. In one case a bilineage leukemia with a POEM+/CD 19- and a POEM-/CD 19+ population could be identified by immunoelectron microscopical studies (IEM). The remaining 34 AUL cases were POEM negative.

APL is associated with a reciprocal chromosomal translocation t(15,17) which has been shown to disrupt the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) gene. As a result, a portion of the RAR alpha gene becomes fused with a chromosome 15 locus termed PML (promyelocytic myeloid leukemia) from which chimeric PML/RAR alpha fusion mRNAs are expressed. The presence of these fusion transcripts in APL patients strongly support the hypothesis that both the t(15;17), and thus PML/RAR alpha, play a crucial role in the leukemogenesis of this disease. APL cells are specifically responsive to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and this characteristic has allowed the first differentiation therapy with retinoic acid.

Three of the cDNAs cloned hybridized to RA-inducible transcripts on Northern blots, one of which was shown to encode sequences for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), a recently described cytokine that is chemotactic for monocytes but not for neutrophils. Nuclear run-on analysis indicated that the upregulation of the MCP-1 gene occurs at the transcriptional level in HL-60 cells. MCP-1 transcript levels also increased after RA treatment of the NB4 acute promyelocytic cell line. MCP-1 transcripts were undetectable in freshly isolated neutrophils by Northern analysis or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction but were readily detectable in neutrophils after incubation in media at 37 degrees C for 20 hours, suggesting that an activation event can lead to MCP-1 expression in neutrophils. Immunocytochemistry confirmed the presence of MCP-1 protein in activated neutrophils. This is the first report that the MCP-1 gene is RA-responsive in myeloid cell lines and is expressed in neutrophils.

Cytogenetic and/or bcl-1 rearrangement analysis with 2 probes (MTC, p94PS) were performed in 28 cases. Strong PRAD-1 overexpression was observed in 19 of the 20 MCLs including 3 gastrointestinal forms and 4 blastic variants. t(11;14) and/or bcl-1 rearrangement was detected in 6 of the 12 MCLs examined.

Among chronic lymphoproliferative disorders other than MCL, only 1 atypical chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with a t(11;14) translocation and bcl-1 rearrangement and the 2 hairy cell leukemias (HCLs) analyzed showed upregulation of PRAD-1 gene.

The mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activities were fivefold and threefold higher in mononuclear blood cells from 33 patients with leukemia, compared with cells from 23 healthy subjects, whereas elevations in RNA levels were twofold and 40% only. The activities of the two proteins correlated in normal cells (r = .46), whereas an inverse correlation was found in leukemic cells (r = -.40). Relatively weak correlations were found between LDL receptor RNA levels and receptor activity in normal (r = .48) and leukemic cells (r = .49), and HMG-CoA reductase RNA levels correlated (r = .53) with reductase activity in leukemic cells only. The ratios of protein activities to RNA levels in cells were constant during consecutive blood samplings and similar in leukemic blood and bone marrow cells from the same individual. During cholesterol deprivation, protein activities increased more than RNA levels, and leukemic cells with high LDL receptor activity showed a partial resistance to the suppressing effect of sterols on LDL receptor gene expression. The results demonstrate that LDL receptor RNA levels alone can not explain variation in receptor activity, suggesting post-RNA regulation of LDL receptor expression, similar to what has been described for HMG-CoA reductase. Taken together, the present results suggest multilevel regulation of both proteins and demonstrate that each cell clone, normal or malignant, has a unique ratio of protein activity to RNA level. Leukemic cells, in contrast to normal cells, can meet increased cholesterol requirements by either elevated LDL receptor activity or increased cholesterol synthesis, which is of potential interest for diagnosis and specific treatment of leukemia.","['Vitols, S', 'Norgren, S', 'Juliusson, G', 'Tatidis, L', 'Luthman, H']","['Vitols S', 'Norgren S', 'Juliusson G', 'Tatidis L', 'Luthman H']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', '0 (Sterols)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cholesterol/administration & dosage/physiology', 'Culture Media', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases/*genetics', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Receptors, LDL/*genetics', 'Sterols/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/10/15 00:00,1994/10/15 00:01,['1994/10/15 00:00'],"['1994/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71389-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Oct 15;84(8):2689-98.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major alterations are inv(3)(q21q26) and t(3:3)(q21;q26) and are often classified as the 3q21q26 syndrome.

In these studies, four additional cases of AML with inv(3)(q21q26) are shown to express the EVI1 gene and to have breakpoints 3' of the gene. To characterize the 3q21 breakpoint region, cosmid and phage clones were isolated that cover approximately 100 kb. At 3q21, the breakpoints for both AMLs with t(3;3)(q21;q26) and inv(3)(q21q26) were found to cluster over a region of approximately 50 kb downstream of the Ribophorin I gene.

These results showed that quantitation of IL-6R and gp130 expression by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction is useful for the rapid prediction of the responsiveness of leukemic cells to IL-6, especially in cases of administration of IL-6.","['Inoue, K', 'Sugiyama, H', 'Ogawa, H', 'Yamagami, T', 'Azuma, T', 'Oka, Y', 'Miwa, H', 'Kita, K', 'Hiraoka, A', 'Masaoka, T']","['Inoue K', 'Sugiyama H', 'Ogawa H', 'Yamagami T', 'Azuma T', 'Oka Y', 'Miwa H', 'Kita K', 'Hiraoka A', 'Masaoka T', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine III, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LAMP1 protein, human)', '0 (Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/10/15 00:00,1994/10/15 00:01,['1994/10/15 00:00'],"['1994/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71387-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Oct 15;84(8):2672-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine whether this stimulation could occur intracellularly, we developed Epo autocrine models of stimulation in the human pluripotent UT-7 cell line. Retroviral expression of Epo totally abolished the growth factor requirement of UT-7 cells. Autonomous proliferation was not cell density-dependent and occurred at a unicellular level, showing a genuine autocrine mode of stimulation. Total blockage of Epo secretion induced by the endoplasmic reticulum-retention amino acids Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) signals in 11 lines prevented autonomous proliferation, whereas a leaky retention system, observed in 3 other lines, resulted in limited autocrine stimulation without true long-term autonomous proliferation. Production of Epo, in contrast to KDEL-modified Epo, induced reductions in Epo binding, Epo receptor (EpoR) mRNA, and phosphorylation levels similar to those induced by the addition of exogenous Epo to the parental cell line. In addition, autonomous growth and survival were inhibited by the addition of Epo-neutralizing antibodies, affording evidence that autocrine stimulation through EpoR activation takes place on the cell surface. Finally, phenotypic analysis of the virus-infected clones indicated that Epo production did not change the differentiative capacities of UT-7 cells. All these data show that Epo autocrine stimulation is dependent on Epo secretion and takes place on the cell surface. From all analyzed parameters, the effects of Epo autocrine stimulation and those of exogenously added Epo appear to be identical.","['Villeval, J L', 'Mitjavila, M T', 'Dusanter-Fourt, I', 'Wendling, F', 'Mayeux, P', 'Vainchenker, W']","['Villeval JL', 'Mitjavila MT', 'Dusanter-Fourt I', 'Wendling F', 'Mayeux P', 'Vainchenker W']","['INSERM U.362, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Protein Sorting Signals)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '113516-56-6 (lysyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-leucine)']",IM,,"['Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/genetics/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Sorting Signals', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/genetics/physiology', 'Retroviridae/genetics']",,1994/10/15 00:00,1994/10/15 00:01,['1994/10/15 00:00'],"['1994/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71385-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Oct 15;84(8):2649-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the CDK4I gene is thought to be a putative tumor-suppressor gene. We report here that both alleles of the CDK4I gene were completely or partially deleted in human leukemia cells derived from both patients and established cell lines. Thirty-seven hematopoietic cell lines and samples from 72 patients with leukemias were examined for homozygous loss of the CDK4I gene locus by Southern blot analysis. We found that a part or the whole of the CDK4I gene was homozygously deleted in 14 of the 37 (38%) cell lines and 4 of 72 (6%) samples from leukemia patients, including 45 with acute myelocytic leukemia, 14 with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and 13 with chronic myelocytic leukemia in blastic crisis. In the cell lines, the homozygous deletion of the CDK4I gene was detected in a variety of cell lineages, whereas all 4 cases showing the homozygous deletion were confined to ALL. It should be noted that 2 of them had no cytogenetic abnormalities of chromosome 9. Our results suggest that loss of the CDK4I function may contribute to immortalization of human leukemia cells and play a causative role at least in development of human lymphocytic leukemias.","['Ogawa, S', 'Hirano, N', 'Sato, N', 'Takahashi, T', 'Hangaishi, A', 'Tanaka, K', 'Kurokawa, M', 'Tanaka, T', 'Mitani, K', 'Yazaki, Y']","['Ogawa S', 'Hirano N', 'Sato N', 'Takahashi T', 'Hangaishi A', 'Tanaka K', 'Kurokawa M', 'Tanaka T', 'Mitani K', 'Yazaki Y', 'et al.']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', '*Cyclin-Dependent Kinases', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', '*Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/10/15 00:00,1994/10/15 00:01,['1994/10/15 00:00'],"['1994/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71359-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Oct 15;84(8):2431-5.,['CDK4I'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, the molecular cloning of teh breakpoints has led to the identification of the two fused genes, CBFB on 16q and MYH11 on 16p. We have analyzed 24 patients with AML-M4Eo at diagnosis and 47 patients with AML of other FAB subtypes, by a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for the CBFB/MYH11 fusion mRNAs. Three types of fusion mRNAs were detected in 22 samples of AML-M4Eo (type A, n = 20; type C, n = 1; and type D, n = 1). Among these 22 positive samples, inv(16) was found in the 20 cytogenetically studied cases. No fusion transcript was detected in two patients with AML-M4Eo and in patients with other types of AML. These results confirm that CBFB/MYH11 transcripts (with a predominant type A form) are present in most cases of inv(16) AML. Moreover, detection of the hybrid transcript is closely associated with the finding of abnormal bone marrow (BM) eosinophils in AML-M4Eo as it is not found in other, FAB subtypes of AML, including AML-M4. To assess the presence of type A CBFB/MYH11 fusion transcripts in five AML-M4Eo patients in remission, we designed a sensitive assay combining nested PCR and allele-specific amplification (NPASA). Residual leukemia cells were detected in four patients who were in remission from 4 to 22 months, but not in one patient in long-term remission (5 years).

Chromosomes 1 and 6 were also commonly involved in structural abnormalities (14 and 10 patients, respectively), although no particular bands were noted. However, the short arm of chromosome 1 was preferentially involved in deletion, suggesting a certain antioncogene on 1p associated with the development of myeloma. In addition; fluorescence in situ hybridization was successfully applied to determine the nature of the structural abnormalities in a patient with t(8;22) translocation.

A complete clinical remission was defined as achievement of a normal complete blood count and CD3+ LGL count. Previous prednisone treatment in eight of these patients had produced one clinical remission and four partial responses; tapering of prednisone in each of these patients resulted in recurrence of severe neutropenia. Five patients in this study received both methotrexate and tapering doses of prednisone.

We found that NB4 cells are resistant to differentiation by nonretinoid inducers such as hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), butyrates, vitamin D3, or hypoxanthine, all of which can induce differentiation in the commonly used HL60 leukemia cell line. Preexposure of NB4 cells to low concentrations of RA for a period as short as 30 minutes abolished resistance to nonretinoids and potentiated differentiation. Sequential RA and HMBA treatment yielded maximal differentiation by 3 days of drug exposure, whereas the effect of RA alone peaked after 6 days and yielded a smaller percentage of differentiated cells. RA also reversed NB4 cell resistance to butyrates and allowed for synergistic differentiation by these agents. Pretreatment with HMBA before exposure to RA failed to stimulate differentiation. Sequential RA/HMBA treatment also markedly increased the extent of differentiation of primary cultures of bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from three APL patients. In one case RA/HMBA treatment overcame resistance to RA in vitro. Together, these results suggest that intermittent low doses of RA followed by either HMBA or butyrates may be a useful combination in the treatment of APL.

(PCR) for months to years after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML). Nevertheless, the presence of bcr-abl mRNA by itself does not invariably predict for clinical relapse post-BMT. This has led to the hypothesis that bcr-abl mRNA might be expressed in cells that have lost either proliferative or myeloid differentiation potential. To directly characterize the cells detected by PCR in patients with CML after allogeneic BMT, we first identified five individuals in whom PCR-positive cells could be detected at multiple times post-BMT. Bone marrow samples from these individuals were cultured in vitro and single erythroid, granulocytic, and macrophage colonies, each containing 50 to 100 cells, were examined for the presence of bcr-abl mRNA by PCR. PCR-positive myeloid colonies could be detected in four of five individuals in marrow samples obtained 5 to 56 months post-BMT. Overall, 7 of 135 progenitor cell colonies (5.2%) were found to be PCR-positive. The expression of bcr-abl mRNA appeared to be equally distributed among committed erythroid, macrophage, and granulocyte progenitors. These patients have now been followed-up for an additional 20 to 33 months from the time of progenitor cell PCR analysis but only one of these individuals has been found to have cytogenetic evidence of recurrent Ph+ cells. These results show that long-term persistence of PCR-detectable bcr-abl mRNA after allogeneic BMT can be caused by the persistence of CML-derived clonogenic myeloid precursors that have survived the BMT preparative regimen. These cells continue to have both proliferative and myeloid differentiation capacity in vitro. Nevertheless, these PCR-positive cells do not appear to either expand or differentiate in vivo for prolonged periods, suggesting the presence of mechanisms for suppression of residual clonogenic leukemia cells in vivo.","['Pichert, G', 'Alyea, E P', 'Soiffer, R J', 'Roy, D C', 'Ritz, J']","['Pichert G', 'Alyea EP', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Roy DC', 'Ritz J']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76488-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Oct 1;84(7):2109-14.,,['AI29530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

To make an accurate estimation of an individual patient's prognosis, we introduced a piecewise linear model for describing a hazard function in each prognostic variable. Of the 11 prognostic variables initially analyzed, the absolute count of peripheral basophils was revealed as the most important prognostic factor. A high basophil count was clearly a factor in cases with poor prognosis. The statistical model selection based on the criteria of model approximation finally suggested a model with three covariates; absolute count of peripheral basophils, platelet count, and presence or absence of additional chromosome abnormalities superimposed on the translocation of 9;22. By analyses based on the above model, we estimated that the median of the chronic phase duration for the patients with poor and good prognosis was 12 and 75 months, respectively. The piecewise linear model was well suited for an accurate estimation of an individual patient's prognosis. Thus, the model constructed here would become a reliable control to evaluate investigational approaches, such as hydroxyurea, interferons, and/or bone marrow transplantation.","['Hashimoto, T', 'Ohtaki, M', 'Ueoka, H', 'Munaka, M', 'Kuramoto, A', 'Kamada, N']","['Hashimoto T', 'Ohtaki M', 'Ueoka H', 'Munaka M', 'Kuramoto A', 'Kamada N']","['Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,['G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Busulfan/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Time Factors']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1994 Jul;60(1):59-69.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the mechanism of leukemic cell lysis by human macrophages. Human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages were activated with interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide. Activated macrophages exhibited lytic activity against leukemic cells (K562 and HL-60 cells) by cocultivation. When macrophages and these leukemic cells were separated by a microporous membrane, activated macrophages did not show any lytic activity against these leukemic cells. However, activated macrophages interacting with leukemic cells under the microporous membrane exhibited lytic activity against leukemic cells that were placed on the microporous membrane. Different kinds of leukemic cells were also effective to induce such lytic activity in the macrophages, but normal lymphocytes could not. Culture supernatants of activated macrophages incubated with leukemic cells did not have cytolytic activity against leukemic cells. The leukemic cells used in this study were confirmed to be resistant to tumor necrosis factor (TNF), but the activated macrophage-mediated cytolytic activity was significantly inhibited by the anti-TNF antibody. These findings suggested that the contact between macrophages and leukemic cells triggered the secretion of lytic factor(s), and that TNF and other labile factor(s) co-operatively functioned to lyse leukemic cells.","['Nakabo, Y', 'Harakawa, N', 'Yamamoto, K', 'Okuma, M', 'Uno, K', 'Sasada, M']","['Nakabo Y', 'Harakawa N', 'Yamamoto K', 'Okuma M', 'Uno K', 'Sasada M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)'],IM,,"['Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', '*Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/physiology']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1994 Jul;60(1):51-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, its functional activity was studied by analysis of the influence of CD 54 on homologous interaction of the blasts. Prior to culture only a minority of the blasts displayed CD 54 positivity. Timed incubation of the blasts in RPMI-1640/FCS or serum-free medium 'spontaneously' increased the percentage of CD 54 positive cells in 11/13 cases with a main increase after 24 h.

There has been very little progress in the management of advanced disease. Hydroxyurea and interferon-alpha have replaced busulfan as first-line therapy in chronic phase. Hydroxyurea provides excellent control of the disease for periods of months or years and has little toxicity. Interferon-alpha induces a reduction in the Philadelphia chromosome in a substantial minority of patients. Interferon-alpha may also prolong survival. Neither hydroxyurea nor interferon-alpha is able to cure the disease. Patients in chronic phase may be cured by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). This procedure has a number of limitations, however, including limited availability, high cost, and substantial morbidity and mortality. Current challenges in BMT are to increase its applicability, to reduce graft-versus-host disease, and to augment graft-versus-leukemia effects. The role of autologous transplantation in CML remains speculative.","['Savage, D G', 'Goldman, J M']","['Savage DG', 'Goldman JM']","['LRF Centre for Adult Leukaemia, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1994 Jul;60(1):1-21.,,,177,,,,,,,,,,,,

While stem cell factor (SCF) and TGF beta 1 seem to have a role in PGC migration (as an adhesion factor and a chemoattractant, respectively), the former is certainly required for PGC survival in vitro and probably in vivo as well. Recent findings suggest that the mechanism by which SCF supports PGC survival is by preventing PGC apoptosis. A similar action appears to be exerted by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a further growth factor influencing PGC growth in culture. PGC proliferation seems to be mainly induced by cAMP dependent mechanisms, but further investigations are needed to clarify the interrelationships among the different molecular pathways activated by SCF, LIF, cAMP and other putative PGC growth factors (i.e. bFGF). Stimulation of long-term proliferation of PGCs, leading to derivation of ES-like cells (embryonal germ cells) obtained by using a combination of growth factors (bFGF, SCF and LIF), opens new intriguing perspectives for such studies and transgenic technology.","['De Felici, M', 'Pesce, M']","['De Felici M', 'Pesce M']","['Department of Public Health and Cell Biology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Prog Growth Factor Res,Progress in growth factor research,8912757,['0 (Growth Substances)'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Germ Cells/*cytology', 'Growth Substances/*physiology', 'Mice']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0955-2235(94)90001-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Prog Growth Factor Res. 1994;5(2):135-43. doi: 10.1016/0955-2235(94)90001-9.,,,35,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that the potential-sensitive fluorescent dye 1-(3-sulfonatopropyl)-4-[beta[2-(di-n-octylamino)-6- naphthyl]vinyl]pyridinium betaine (di-8-ANEPPS) can be used to measure changes in the intramembrane dipole potential. Increasing the content of cholesterol and 6-ketocholestanol (KC), which are known to increase psi D in the bilayer, results in an increase in the ratio, R, of the dye fluorescence excited at 440 nm to that excited at 530 nm in a lipid vesicle suspension; increasing the content of phloretin, which lowers psi D, decreases R. Control experiments show that the ratio is insensitive to changes in the membrane's microviscosity. The lack of an isosbestic point in the fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of the dye at various concentrations of KC and phloretin argues against 1:1 chemical complexation between the dye and KC or phloretin. The macromolecular nonionic surfactant Pluronic F127 catalyzes the insertion of KC and phloretin into lipid vesicle and cell membranes, permitting convenient and controlled modulation of dipole potential. The sensitivity of R to psi D is 10-fold larger than to delta psi, whereas it is insensitive to changes in psi S. This can be understood in terms of the location of the dye chromophore with respect to the electric field profile associated with each of these potentials. These results suggest that the gradient in dipole potential occurs over a span s5 A, a short distance below the membrane-water interface.

We report here on the application of a two-dimensional restriction mapping-Southern hybridisation approach for analysis of retrotransposon families of low to moderate genetic complexity, which is particularly suited to pairwise comparisons between DNA samples. By using this method, non-constitutional mink-cell-focus-forming type retro-elements were readily detectable in AKR mouse thymic lymphomas against a background of approx. 30 related elements in control DNA. However, in the WEHI 3B myeloid leukaemia cell line, the resolution of two-dimensional mapping permitted detection of only occasional reinsertions of intracisternal A particle retro-elements (genetic complexity: 10(3)). In analysing the VL30 family of retrotransposon (genetic complexity: 150) we developed a strategy for identifying the known transcriptionally active sub-set of these elements in genomic DNA through the generation of an internal, diagnostic restriction fragment. Moreover, in some cases of thymic lymphoma, several candidate re-insertions of VL30 elements were detected, consistent with a suggested role for retrotransposition of this class of element in lymphomagenesis of retroviral aetiology.","['French, N S', 'Norton, J D']","['French NS', 'Norton JD']","['CRC Department of Gene Regulation, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Christie Hospital NHS Trust, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,['0 (Retroelements)'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Multigene Family', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', '*Restriction Mapping', '*Retroelements']",,1994/10/18 00:00,1994/10/18 00:01,['1994/10/18 00:00'],"['1994/10/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/18 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4781(94)90075-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4781(94)90075-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1994 Oct 18;1219(2):484-92. doi: 10.1016/0167-4781(94)90075-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Constructs containing either footprints 1-3 or 3-6 cannot be distinguished from the beta-globin gene alone. We further show that binding sites for the erythroid-specific factor NF-E2 can co-operatively interact with parts of the HS3 core fragment, and that HS3 requires elements upstream from -103 in the human beta-globin promoter for full activity.

Recently, a mechanism of iron transport in the absence of transferrin (Tf) was described for the human K562 cell line and a role for ferrireductase activity was implicated in this process as well [Inman, R. S., & Wessling-Resnick, M. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 8521-8528]. The present report characterizes the extracellular reduction of ferricyanide to ferrocyanide catalyzed by K562 cells. The observation that membrane-impermeant ferricyanide competitively inhibits Tf-independent assimilation of iron from 55Fe-nitriloacetic acid indicates that this ferrireductase activity is indeed coupled to the transport mechanism. From a series of initial rate experiments, the kinetic parameters for cell surface ferrireductase activity, Vmax = 0.102 nmol min-1 (10(6) cells)-1 and Km = 6.13 microM, were determined. Neither the Vmax nor the Km of this reaction is modulated by changes in extra- or intracellular iron levels; thus, similar to Tf-independent transport activity in K562 cells, the ferrireductase activity is not regulated in response to iron levels. Transmembrane oxidoreductase activity is also reportedly involved in the control of cellular growth; however, the K562 cell ferrireductase is unresponsive to insulin and is not inhibited by the antitumor drugs adriamycin, actinomycin D, or cis-platin, observations that fail to support a role for this particular activity in cell regulation. Rather, the K562 cell ferrireductase appears to be tightly coupled to the mechanism of Tf-independent transport as demonstrated by its sensitivity to Cd2+, a specific inhibitor of non-Tf iron uptake by K562 cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Inman, R S', 'Coughlan, M M', 'Wessling-Resnick, M']","['Inman RS', 'Coughlan MM', 'Wessling-Resnick M']","['Department of Nutrition, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Ferricyanides)', '0 (Ferrocyanides)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Iron Radioisotopes)', '0 (Transferrin)', '00BH33GNGH (Cadmium)', '13408-62-3 (hexacyanoferrate III)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 1.5.1.38 (FMN Reductase)', 'EC 1.6.- (NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.6.99.- (ferric citrate iron reductase)', 'FLX0VIC39Y (hexacyanoferrate II)']",IM,,"['Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cadmium/pharmacology', '*FMN Reductase', 'Ferricyanides/*metabolism', 'Ferrocyanides/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Insulin/pharmacology', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Iron Radioisotopes', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Transferrin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/10/04 00:00,1994/10/04 00:01,['1994/10/04 00:00'],"['1994/10/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/04 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00205a022 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1994 Oct 4;33(39):11850-7. doi: 10.1021/bi00205a022.,,"['DK45737/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'NIEHS T32 ES07155/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, increased levels of plasma DNA have previously been observed in patients suffering from various malignant diseases. In the present work we have investigated, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), point mutations of the N-ras gene in the DNA of plasma, blood cells and bone marrow of 10 patients suffering from AML or MDS. The different ras mutations detected in five cases were always present in the plasma DNA while sometimes absent in the DNA of peripheral blood cells or bone marrow.

Despite faster increase in the neutrophil counts in the rGM-CSF group, we did not observe any difference either in P-MPO or in P-LF during the period of early engraftment (days 11-19). This finding indicates that the proliferative effect of rGM-CSF on the neutropoiesis may be overestimated when neutrophil counts alone are taken into consideration, and suggests that other mechanisms may have contributed to the increase in the number of circulating neutrophils. The ratio of the serum to plasma level of LF, but not of MPO, was higher in the rGM-CSF group, probably reflecting a specific in vivo neutrophil priming effect. In the rGM-CSF group there was a clear increase of S-ECP during the second and third week post transplant, corresponding to an increase in eosinophil counts, which indicates that rGM-CSF stimulated eosinophil reconstitution without causing excessive activation of the mature eosinophils.","['Hoglund, M', 'Simonsson, B', 'Smedmyr, B', 'Oberg, G', 'Venge, P']","['Hoglund M', 'Simonsson B', 'Smedmyr B', 'Oberg G', 'Venge P']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital of Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Eosinophil Granule Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Proteins/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*pathology', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Eosinophil Granule Proteins', 'Eosinophils/pathology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lactoferrin/blood', 'Leukocyte Count/drug effects', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy', 'Neutrophils', 'Peroxidase/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', '*Ribonucleases']",,1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb04819.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1994 Apr;86(4):709-16. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb04819.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two factors strongly influenced the appearance of thyroid abnormalities: steroid dose at the time of thyroid function testing, and age (< or = 16 years/ > 16 years). Among the younger patients, 21 had no thyroid abnormalities, while five did. Among the older patients, 20 had no thyroid abnormalities, while 32 did (P < 0.001). The occurrence of thyroid abnormalities seemed to influence survival strongly, since the 30-month projected survival time was 83% for patients without abnormalities whereas it was 49% for patients with an abnormal profile (P < 0.001).

Whilst a 'clonal remission' in many such patients may represent a skewed X-chromosome inactivation pattern in haemopoietic cells, its relationship to an underlying preleukaemic state remains uncertain. We therefore analysed the clonal status of 48 female patients in remission of AML using X-chromosome linked restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) within the X-linked PGK and HPRT genes and the DXS255 (M27 beta) locus, and carried out in conjunction a detailed study of the morphological and karyotypic features of the patients' bone marrows. During remission, 35 patients (73%) with AML demonstrated nonclonal haemopoiesis, and their bone marrows were morphologically normal. Remission haemopoietic tissue in nine cases (19%) showed a skewed X-chromosome inactivation pattern and remission bone marrows in these patients had features of trilineage myelodysplasia (TMDS), with seven having similar features at presentation. Analysis of constitutional DNA showed a non-clonal pattern in seven of these patients, but was unsuccessful in two cases. These nine patients with post-chemotherapy TMDS were considered to have true clonal haemopoiesis. Four patients (8%) with a skewed X-chromosome inactivation pattern had normal remission bone marrows. Analysis of constitutional DNA showed a skewed pattern in two of these patients, but was unsuccessful in two cases. Cytogenetic investigation during remission in the nine patients with TMDS showed a normal karyotype in four cases and the acquisition of new karyotypic abnormalities in three cases. In contrast, 10 female patients in remission of de novo acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) were shown to have non-clonal haemopoiesis. We conclude that the majority of patients with AML who achieve remission after cytoreductive chemotherapy have non-clonal haemopoiesis, and when clonal remissions are observed these are commonly associated with the development of trilineage myelodysplasia in the bone marrow, with or without karyotypic abnormalities. True clonal remission in association with morphologically normal haemopoiesis is a rare entity, the significance and frequency of which remain uncertain.","['Jowitt, S N', 'Liu Yin, J A', 'Saunders, M J', 'Lucas, G S']","['Jowitt SN', 'Liu Yin JA', 'Saunders MJ', 'Lucas GS']","['Department of Haematology, Manchester Royal Infirmary.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,,"['Aged', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Dosage Compensation, Genetic', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Remission Induction']",,1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03211.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Dec;85(4):698-705. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03211.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DS cells undergo erythroid differentiation by DMSO treatment with a marked increase in haem synthesis, while DR cells fail to do so due to the lack of the erythroid-specific delta-aminolaevulinate synthase (ALAS-E). Both DS and DR cells showed an increase in the level of FeC mRNA within 18 h of DMSO treatment. The level of FeC mRNA in DR cells was then decreased, while that in DS cells continued to increase for 72 h. Treatment with haemin significantly increased FeC mRNA in DR cells. When cells were treated with both DMSO and haemin, the level of FeC mRNA in DR cells increased to a level comparable to that in DS cells. These findings suggest that the failure to maintain increased FeC mRNA DR cells after DMSO treatment may be due to a deficiency of haem in these cells.","['Fukuda, Y', 'Fujita, H', 'Taketani, S', 'Sassa, S']","['Fukuda Y', 'Fujita H', 'Taketani S', 'Sassa S']","['Rockefeller University, New York, N.Y. 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', 'EC 4.99.1.1 (Ferrochelatase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Ferrochelatase/*metabolism', 'Heme/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03207.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Dec;85(4):670-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03207.x.,,['DK-32890/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

YN-1 contained approximately 1-5% benzidine-positive staining cells, whereas no benzidine-positive cells were observed in Y-1K cells. Haemoglobin production in YN-1 cells was markedly increased with various chemical inducers of erythroid differentiation, but was not in Y-1K cells. In contrast, Y-1K cells expressed CD34 stem cell antigen and CD41 megakaryocyte-specific antigen. These observations suggested that, although both cell lines were committed to the erythroid lineage, each cell line represented a distinct differentiation stage in the erythroid differentiation programme.

CPT-11 Study Group on Hematological Malignancy.,771-4,"A late phase II study of a new camptothecin analogue, irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT-11), was conducted to evaluate the anti-tumour effect and toxicity in patients with refractory leukaemia and lymphoma including adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL)-lymphoma, in a multi-institutional cooperative study. All the patients with ATL had been previously treated with various conventional combination chemotherapies and were refractory to these therapies or had relapsed. CPT-11 was administered at a dose of 40 mg m-2 day-1 for three consecutive days repeated weekly until evidence of disease progression. One complete remission and four partial remissions were achieved in 13 assessable patients with ATL. The median total dose to achieve remission was 240 mg m-2 and the median duration of response was 31 days. The major toxicities were leucopenia (83%), diarrhoea (62%) and nausea/vomiting (69%). These were relatively severe, but they were generally tolerable and reversible. However, one patient died probably as a result of this therapy. No effective chemotherapy for adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma has yet been established, and the prognosis for patients with this disease is very poor. Our results suggest that CPT-11 may be a promising agent for this disease. Further combination therapy with CPT-11 is needed to improve the therapy for ATL.","['Tsuda, H', 'Takatsuki, K', 'Ohno, R', 'Masaoka, T', 'Okada, K', 'Shirakawa, S', 'Ohashi, Y', 'Ota, K']","['Tsuda H', 'Takatsuki K', 'Ohno R', 'Masaoka T', 'Okada K', 'Shirakawa S', 'Ohashi Y', 'Ota K']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Kumamoto University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Camptothecin/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Irinotecan', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",PMC2033383,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1994.394 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1994 Oct;70(4):771-4. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1994.394.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of action of this agent is unknown, but protein kinase C has been implicated. In order to investigate this possibility, we have developed P388 sublines resistant to bryostatin 1, by continuous challenge of the parent cell line with increasing incremental concentrations of the drug over 4 months. Cell lines were established at monthly intervals yielding four sublines: P388/BR/A, which were removed at 1 month; P388/BR/B, obtained after 2 months; P388/BR/C, obtained after 3 months; and P388/BR/D, which were established after 4 months. All four P388/BR sublines show an equal degree of resistance to the growth inhibitory effects of bryostatin 1, with a relative resistance ratio (RR) IC50 of approximately 4,000. The ability of the cytosol of cells to phosphorylate PKC-specific substrate is decreased by 41% for BR/A, 57% for BR/B 80% for BR/C and 94% for BR/D compared with the parental cell line, even when grown in the absence of bryostatin 1 for up to 4 weeks. Similar decreases are seen for cytosolic phorbol ester binding and whole-cell PKC isoenzyme expression. All four P388/BR sublines show high and equal levels of cross-resistance to the PKC activatory phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). There is no loss of resistance to either bryostatin 1 or PMA up to 3 months after termination of exposure of the sublines to bryostatin 1. There was no significant degree of cross-resistance to daunorubicin in the bryosatin 1-resistant cell lines, P388/BR/A, B, C or D, when compared with the parent cell line, P388.","['Prendiville, J', 'McGown, A T', 'Gescher, A', 'Dickson, A J', 'Courage, C', 'Pettit, G R', 'Crowther, D', 'Fox, B W']","['Prendiville J', 'McGown AT', 'Gescher A', 'Dickson AJ', 'Courage C', 'Pettit GR', 'Crowther D', 'Fox BW']","['CRC Department of Experimental Chemotherapy, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Christie Hospital NHS Trust, Withington, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '0 (phorbol ester binding protein)', '0 (phorbol ester receptor)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bryostatins', '*Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Isoenzymes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase C/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Drug/drug effects/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",PMC2033429,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1994.353 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1994 Oct;70(4):573-8. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1994.353.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of RAS oncogenes was analyzed by a fluorescence-activated cell sorting with a panel of monoclonal antibodies. The high expression of DWP, which was reported to recognized activated RAS oncogene, was found in two patients and was associated with high levels of H-RAS expression. These facts prompted us to analyze the DNA sequence of RAS genes with an automated DNA sequencer. Unexpectedly, various kinds of H-RAS point mutations were found in all six cases, including two cases of hot-spot point mutation at codon 12, whereas K-RAS point mutation (no hot-spot point mutations) was found in six cases. The same H-RAS point mutations, at codons 10, 11, and 15, were found in all six cases. To our knowledge, there is no report on H-RAS point mutation in human leukemias.

After treatment with CdA, IFN-alpha generation was studied in 16 patients, with a geometric mean value of 650 IU/ml (p < 0.0005 compared with pre-CdA levels).

The results of the APAAP method were compared with western blotting for specificity and sensitivity. RESULTS: Excellent correlation was obtained between optimised APAAP and western blotting, except in the case of multiple myeloma. JSB-1 seemed to be the more useful monoclonal antibody for the APAAP which was more sensitive than western blotting in its ability to detect single P-gp positive cells.

Alterations in the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) locus.,189-217,"Meningiomas are typically benign tumors arising from arachnoidal cells at the base of the brain. Meningioma is thought to result from the loss or inactivation of a putative tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 22. We analyzed a set of meningioma DNA specimens by Southern blot hybridization with chromosome 22-specific probes and by PCR using oligomer primers and probes specific to the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) gene. Southern analysis suggested that a subset of our specimens are monosomic for 22q11-qter and may have lost one entire copy of chromosome 22. The gene(s) involved in the etiology of meningioma has been localized to 22q11.2-12.3. The locus encoding LIF, a factor that affects the differentiation and proliferation of numerous cell types, has also been localized to this region, at 22q12.1-12.2. The partial overlap of these loci, coupled with the known involvement of the LIF gene product in growth and differentiation, suggested that the LIF locus may be associated with the meningioma defect. We have examined the LIF locus in meningioma specimens at the molecular level by PCR, and by DNA and RNA gel-blot hybridizations. Alterations in the structure and/or expression of the LIF locus were detected in several specimens, including the subset that were shown to be monosomic for 22q. All of our tumor specimens were shown to be undermethylated at the LIF locus relative to constitutional DNA from the same patients.

The cytostatic concentrations of the compound generally caused the G2/M block in the cell cycle progression, but differences between the three tumor cell lines in the events leading to cell death were remarkable. While inhibiting cell proliferation, 9,11-secosterol caused accumulation of HeLa and K562 cells in the metaphase of mitosis. So, abnormal mitosis can play an important role in the cytotoxicity of 9,11-secosterol in these cell lines. In the Ehrlich ascites tumor cell line the increasing concentrations of the drug (up to 40 microM) did not cause an immediate cell killing. Instead, due to continued DNA synthesis without entry into mitosis, cells with high DNA ploidy were produced. It was shown that the cytoskeletal systems such as microtubules and microfilaments were not damaged by the action of 9,11-secosterol.

NB4, a maturation-inducible cell line, and NB4-RAr sublines (R1 and R2) displaying no maturation in the presence of RA have been isolated from a patient in relapse. We show that resistance to maturation is not a mere unresponsiveness to RA: rather, R1 ""resistant"" cells do respond to RA (1 microM) by sustained growth, become competent to undergo terminal maturation, and up-regulate CD11c/CD18 integrins. Interestingly, maturation of ""resistant"" cells, rendered competent by RA, can be achieved by cAMP-elevating agents (prostaglandin E, isoproterenol, cholera toxin, or phosphodiesterase inhibitor) or stable agonistic cAMP analogs such as (SP)-8-chloroadenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphorothioate. This shows that activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cA kinase) can override the RA resistance and suggests interdependent RA and cAMP signaling pathways in acute promyelocytic leukemia maturation. No such cooperation was observed in the R2 resistant cells, though their cA-kinase was functional. (RP)-8-Chloroadenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphorothioate, which by displacing endogenous cAMP inhibits the basal cA-kinase activity, decreased the response of sensitive cells to RA. This raises the possibility that cA-kinase plays a key role in the maturation also of RA-sensitive cells. Our results define two discrete steps in the maturation process: an RA-dependent priming step that maintains proliferation while cells become competent to undergo maturation in response to retinoids and a cAMP-dependent step that triggers RA-primed cells to undergo terminal maturation.

Groupe d'Etude Immunologique des Leucemies.,1-5,"Several classifications of acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) have been proposed as increasing numbers of technologies and reagents allowed to better characterize leukemic tumor cells. The French Groupe d'Etude Immunologique des Leucemies (GEIL) proposes an immunologic classification of ALL derived from this group's initial attempts and on proposals published by others. Its first step is based on a scoring system where individual markers are assigned major, intermediate and minor weights on a scale of respectively 1.5, 1 and 0.5 points. Assignment to a given lineage requires a score of at least 2 in this lineage. Thus are identified the four levels ""null"", ""pure"", ""variant"" and ""multiphenotypic"", depending on score combinations in the three B, T and myeloid lineages. In a second step, within each of these classes, cell differentiation criteria are applied to further identify 4 subclasses within PreB-ALL (PreB1 to PreB4) and 4 within T-ALL (T1 to T4). ALL with only myeloid markers are referred to as M0. This classification was applied to a series of 1014 scorable ALL. Pure ALL represented respectively 72% in children under 16, and 64% in adults, PreB ALL being significantly more frequent in the former (p < 0.01). B-ALL and T-ALL were significantly (p < 0.05) more frequent in adults (respectively 11% and 27%) than in children (7% and 20%).

OBJECTIVE: We studied the impact of various cytokines on ICAM-1 release of several tumor cell lines. METHODS: Two melanoma cell lines (M19, M26), 1 B lymphoblastoid cell line (Daudi), 1 erythroleukemia cell line (K562), 1 Sezary-cell-derived cell line (SeAx), 1 cell line derived from a mycosis fungoides lesion (MyLa) and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were grown in the presence of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), IFN-alpha, interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in various concentrations. ICAM-1 release into the supernatant was measured after 24 and 48 h using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: PBMC and the B lymphoblastoid cell line did not shed detectable amounts of sICAM-1. In all other cell lines, ICAM-1 shedding was found with and without cytokine stimulation. In all cell cell lines except the CTCL-derived one, ICAM-1 shedding was marginally affected by IFN-alpha, IL-2 and IL-6. TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma enhanced the shedding in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In the SeAx line, IL-2 and IFN-gamma inhibited ICAM-1 release. By contrast, TNF-alpha and IL-6 enhanced it. The CTCL-derived MyLa responded to IFN-alpha with a dose-dependent increase in ICAM-1 shedding. All other cytokines had marginal influence. CONCLUSION: Cytokine-modulated ICAM-1 shedding shows quantitative and qualitative differences in the investigated cell lines. This might have implications for the pathophysiology of cutaneous malignancies and their susceptibility to immunotherapies.","['Dummer, R', 'Sigg-Zemann, S', 'Kalthof, K', 'Muletta, S', 'Meyer, J C', 'Burg, G']","['Dummer R', 'Sigg-Zemann S', 'Kalthof K', 'Muletta S', 'Meyer JC', 'Burg G']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Zurich Medical School, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Dermatology,"Dermatology (Basel, Switzerland)",9203244,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Migration Inhibition', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Melanoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mycosis Fungoides/*metabolism/pathology', 'Sezary Syndrome/*metabolism/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000246813 [doi]'],ppublish,Dermatology. 1994;189(2):120-4. doi: 10.1159/000246813.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At least one population of cholinergic sympathetic neurons arises during development by a target-dependent conversion from an initial noradrenergic phenotype. Evidence for retrograde specification has been obtained from transplantation studies in which sympathetic neurons that normally express a noradrenergic phenotype throughout life were induced to innervate sweat glands, a target normally innervated by cholinergic sympathetic neurons. This was accomplished by transplanting footpad skin containing sweat gland primordia from early postnatal donor rats to the hairy skin region of host rats. The sympathetic neurons innervating the novel target decreased their expression of noradrenergic traits and developed choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity. In addition, many sweat gland-associated fibers acquired acetylcholinesterase (AChE) staining and VIP immunoreactivity. These studies indicate that sympathetic neurons in vivo alter their neurotransmitter phenotype in response to novel environmental signals and that sweat glands play a critical role in the cholinergic and peptidergic differentiation of the sympathetic neurons that innervate them. The sweat gland-derived cholinergic differentiation factor is distinct from leukemia inhibitory factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor, two well-characterized cytokines that alter the neurotransmitter properties of cultured sympathetic neurons in a similar fashion. Recent studies indicate that anterograde signalling is also important for the establishment of functional synapses in this system. We have found that the production of cholinergic differentiation activity by sweat glands requires sympathetic innervation, and the acquisition and maintenance of secretory competence by sweat glands depends upon functional cholinergic innervation.","['Schotzinger, R', 'Yin, X', 'Landis, S']","['Schotzinger R', 'Yin X', 'Landis S']","['Department of Neurosciences, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Neurobiol,Journal of neurobiology,0213640,['0 (Neurotransmitter Agents)'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Neurons/*physiology', 'Neurotransmitter Agents/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sweat Glands/*transplantation', 'Sympathetic Nervous System/cytology/*physiology', 'Synapses/physiology']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/neu.480250605 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurobiol. 1994 Jun;25(6):620-39. doi: 10.1002/neu.480250605.,,"['NICHHD HD 25681/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 023678/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",104,,,,,,,,,,,,

At clinically achievable concentrations, all three drugs have been shown to induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells. An improved method was developed for the isolation of pure genomic DNA and the detection of drug-induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in < 1.0 microgram of DNA sample by agarose gel electrophoresis. Morphologic evidence for apoptosis was determined by light microscopy following Wright staining, and cell viability was assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was observed following exposure to 1.0 microM Ara-C for 4 h, which increased with 10 and 50 microM Ara-C. Incubation with 100 microM Ara-C produced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation starting at 3 h, which increased with longer periods of exposure to Ara-C. Utilizing a schedule of 1-h exposure followed by 3-h suspension in drug-free medium, 0.25 microM MTN was found to initiate DNA fragmentation, which increased with exposure to 1.0 and 5.0 microM MTN. However, identical treatment with higher concentrations of MTN resulted in random DNA degradation. Alternatively, continuous exposure to 1.0 microM MTN for 3 h was necessary to initiate internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. This increased with exposure intervals of up to 6 h. Exposure to TXL concentrations as low as 0.01 microM for 24 h caused internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, which increased with dose escalation (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 microM) of TXL. Although continuous exposure to 1.0 microM TXL for a period as short as 8 h produced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, this increased significantly with longer exposure intervals. In general there appears to be a threshold concentration and duration of exposure below which none of these three drugs activates endonucleolytic internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and apoptosis. This threshold is lower for the DNA-interactive drugs MTN and Ara-C but higher for the non-DNA-interactive drug TXL. Higher doses or prolonged treatments with the drugs produce random DNA fragmentation associated with necrotic cell death. These in vitro results may further improve our understanding of the antileukemic cytotoxic effects of these drugs, which may enable a more rational design of drug regimens for optimal treatment of AML.","['Ray, S', 'Ponnathpur, V', 'Huang, Y', 'Tang, C', 'Mahoney, M E', 'Ibrado, A M', 'Bullock, G', 'Bhalla, K']","['Ray S', 'Ponnathpur V', 'Huang Y', 'Tang C', 'Mahoney ME', 'Ibrado AM', 'Bullock G', 'Bhalla K']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mitoxantrone/*pharmacology', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00685559 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1994;34(5):365-71. doi: 10.1007/BF00685559.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our studies show that furin is predominantly localized to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) at steady state, with smaller amounts present in intracellular vesicles. Biochemical and morphological analyses reveal that furin is progressively delivered to a lysosomal compartment, where it is degraded. Analyses of furin deletion mutants and chimeric proteins show that the cytoplasmic domain is both necessary and sufficient for localization to the TGN in various cell types. Interestingly, deletion of most of the cytoplasmic domain of furin results in a molecule that is predominantly localized to intracellular vesicles, some of which display characteristics of lysosomes. To a lesser extent, the cytoplasmically deleted molecule is also localized to the plasma membrane. These observations suggest the existence of an additional determinant for targeting to the endosomal/lysosomal system within the lumenal and/or transmembrane domains of furin. Thus, the overall pattern of trafficking and steady state localization of furin are determined by targeting information contained within more than one region of the molecule.","['Bosshart, H', 'Humphrey, J', 'Deignan, E', 'Davidson, J', 'Drazba, J', 'Yuan, L', 'Oorschot, V', 'Peters, P J', 'Bonifacino, J S']","['Bosshart H', 'Humphrey J', 'Deignan E', 'Davidson J', 'Drazba J', 'Yuan L', 'Oorschot V', 'Peters PJ', 'Bonifacino JS']","['Cell Biology and Metabolism Branch, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Subtilisins)', 'EC 3.4.21.75 (Furin)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Endosomes/*metabolism', 'Furin', 'Golgi Apparatus/*metabolism', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Lysosomes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rats', 'Subtilisins/chemistry/*metabolism']",PMC2120164,1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.126.5.1157 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1994 Sep;126(5):1157-72. doi: 10.1083/jcb.126.5.1157.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

K562 cells were cultured in serially increasing concentrations up to 1.0 microM daunorubicin (DNR), and were found to be 28 times more resistant to DNR in comparison to the parent cells. In the resistant cell line (K562/D1-9), intracellular accumulation of DNR was less than that of the parent cell line, and P-glycoprotein was overexpressed. The resistance was reversed by addition of toremifene in a dose-dependent manner in K562/D1-9, while toremifene had no effect in K562. DNR accumulation was also reversed by toremifene in K562/D1-9, but not in K562. However, there was no significant difference of toremifene retention between K562/D1-9 and K562, and neither verapamil nor DNR increased toremifene accumulation in K562/D1-9. Moreover, toremifene and verapamil did not show an additive effect on intracellular DNR accumulation.

Restoring full sensitivity to idarubicin with verapamil and cyclosporin A derivatives.,119-26,"BACKGROUND: Cell sensitivity to anthracyclines and other drugs depends on several factors, including overexpression of a 170Kd transmembrane glycoprotein (P170) that enhances drug efflux from the cells. Since the result of treatment is negatively related to the expression of P170 in leukemia, malignant lymphoma and other tumors, it is important to investigate drugs and methods that can modify multidrug resistance (MDR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using an MTT-microcultured tetrazolium colorimetric method, we assayed sensitivity to daunorubicin (DNR) and to its 4-demethoxy derivative idarubicin (IDA) in two MDR cell lines (CEM VLB and LOVO DX) and in their respective non-MDR parental lines (CEM and LOVO 109), with and without three MDR modifiers, namely the D-isomer of verapamil (DVRP), cyclosporin A (CyA) and the new CyA derivative SDZ PSC 833. RESULTS: We showed that down-modulation of resistance with MDR modifiers was greater for DNR than for IDA in MDR cells. However, we also demonstrated that restoration of full sensitivity could only be achieved for IDA, not for DNR. DVRP and CyA in combination were more effective than either compound alone and could abolish P170-related resistance to IDA at concentrations of 1-2 microM and 1.6 microM, respectively. SDZ PSC 833 alone was even more effective and set MDR to zero at a concentration ranging between 0.8 and 1.6 microM. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that combinations of IDA and MDR modifiers may improve the results of cancer and leukemia treatment and that they are worth investigating in vivo, with attention to possible effects on drug pharmacokinetics and on normal tissue damage.","['Michieli, M', 'Damiani, D', 'Michelutti, A', 'Melli, C', 'Russo, D', 'Fanin, R', 'Baccarani, M']","['Michieli M', 'Damiani D', 'Michelutti A', 'Melli C', 'Russo D', 'Fanin R', 'Baccarani M']","['Division of Hematology, Udine University Hospital, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Carrier Proteins/*physiology', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/physiology', 'Idarubicin/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology']",,1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1994 Mar-Apr;79(2):119-26.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These findings provide a basis for the overlapping and yet divergent actions of these three factors which share some components of their signal transduction machinery.","['Oh, Y J', ""O'Malley, K L""]","['Oh YJ', ""O'Malley KL""]","['Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Neuroreport,Neuroreport,9100935,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', 'EC 1.14.16.2 (Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase)', 'EC 2.3.1.6 (Choline O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Choline O-Acetyltransferase/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neuronal Plasticity/drug effects', 'Neurons/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Neuropeptides/*biosynthesis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion/cytology/drug effects', 'Sympathetic Nervous System/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/biosynthesis']",,1994/04/14 00:00,1994/04/14 00:01,['1994/04/14 00:00'],"['1994/04/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/14 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001756-199404000-00021 [doi]'],ppublish,Neuroreport. 1994 Apr 14;5(8):937-40. doi: 10.1097/00001756-199404000-00021.,,"['MH 45019/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'NIA 44626/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

For P-gp measurement an immunocytological method using monoclonal antibodies C219, 4E3, and MRK 16 and the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technique were applied. According to our results obtained in healthy volunteers using the immunocytological method, the limit for P-gp overexpression was set at > or = 10% P-gp-positive mononuclear bone marrow cells and at > or = 30% P-gp-positive mononuclear peripheral blood cells. All 42 CML patients in chronic phase had normal P-gp expression. P-gp overexpression was demonstrated in four of six patients in accelerated myelogenous blast cell phase and in four of 12 CML-BC patients. Of eight CML patients in blast crisis (BC) with normal P-gp expression, partial remission was achieved in three and minor response in five after prednisone/vindesine therapy. All four of the 12 CML-BC patients with P-gp overexpression did not respond to this therapy. Normal P-gp expression was seen in 41 (85.4%) of 48 untreated MDS patients. While P-gp overexpression did not develop during therapy in any of the myelodysplastic syndrome patients treated with low-dose ara-C alone, four of eight treated with low-dose ara-C plus GM-CSF and four of 11 treated with low-dose ara-C and IL-3 developed P-gp overexpression after therapy. Furthermore, 11 AML patients at primary diagnosis, including five AML patients with P-gp overexpression, who were treated with idarubicin, vepesid, and cytarabine V (ara-C) showed a complete remission. Additionally, one daunorubicin-cytarabine-pretreated refractory AML patient was treated with the oral form of the P-gp modulator drug dexniguldipine and achieved complete remission for a duration of 7 months. Our results suggest that in CML patients in BC, P-gp expression influences outcome after therapy. Further more, studies in a larger series of patients are necessary to prove the efficacy and toxicity of idarubicin/vepesid and cytardbine--or dexniguldipine-containing--therapy in relation to P-gp expression of AML patients.","['Nussler, V', 'Pelka-Fleischer, R', 'Zwierzina, H', 'Nerl, C', 'Beckert, B', 'Gullis, E', 'Gieseler, F', 'Bock, S', 'Bartl, R', 'Petrides, P E']","['Nussler V', 'Pelka-Fleischer R', 'Zwierzina H', 'Nerl C', 'Beckert B', 'Gullis E', 'Gieseler F', 'Bock S', 'Bartl R', 'Petrides PE', 'et al.']","['GSF, Abteilung Klinische Hamatologie, Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'RSA8KO39WH (Vindesine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', '*Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Vindesine/therapeutic use']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01757351 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1994;69 Suppl 1:S25-9. doi: 10.1007/BF01757351.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effects of such compounds on mdr1/P-glycoprotein (P-gp) gene expression and drug sensitivities in the T-lymphoblastoid human cell line CCRF-CEM and MDR sublines. Thereby, we observed that actinomycin D or adriamycin administered at sublethal concentrations induced increases of mdr1 mRNA levels and resistance within 72 h. Furthermore, on leukemia cell samples collected before and after chemotherapy we checked by a complementary DNA polymerase chain reaction (cDNA-PCR) approach for similar alterations in the relative expression levels of the MDR-associated genes (a) mdr1/P-gp (b) mrp (MDR related protein), and (c) the topoisomerase II isoforms alpha and beta. We found a concomitant increase in mdr1 and mrp gene expression combined with a decreased expression of topoisomerase II alpha in the course of the second relapse of an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This points to the emergence of at least three different MDR mechanisms in this type of leukemia unresponsive to chemotherapy. A chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in blast crisis, however, showed combined increases in mdr1 (about 20-fold) and mrp (about four fold) gene expression after intense but unsuccessful chemotherapy over a 6-month period.

Although engraftment of irradiated C.B-17 scid/scid (SCID) mice with human progenitor cells occurred after infusion with human pediatric bone marrow cells, significant engraftment of the mouse bone marrow with human cells was dependent upon continuous treatment with exogenous human cytokines. Furthermore, despite cytokine treatment, only minimal peripheral engraftment of these mice with human cells was observed. In the present study, after infusion of irradiated SCID mice with pre-cultured human fetal bone marrow cells (BM-SCID-hu mice), their bone marrow became significantly engrafted with human precursor cells and their peripheral lymphoid compartment became populated with human B cells and monocytes independently of the administration of extraneous human cytokines. Examination of the bone marrow of the BM-SCID-hu mice for human cytokine mRNA gene expression demonstrated human leukemia inhibitory factor mRNA and interleukin 7 mRNA in nine of nine BM-SCID-hu mice and macrophage-colony-stimulating factor mRNA in seven of eight BM-SCID-hu mice. This was an intriguing observation because these cytokines regulate different stages of human hematopoiesis. Since engraftment occurs in the absence of exogenous cytokine treatment, the BM-SCID-hu mouse model described should provide a useful in vivo system for studying factors important in the maturation of human myeloid and lymphoid cells in the bone marrow and the behavior of the mature human cells after dissemination into the peripheral lymphoid tissue.","['Kollmann, T R', 'Kim, A', 'Zhuang, X', 'Hachamovitch, M', 'Goldstein, H']","['Kollmann TR', 'Kim A', 'Zhuang X', 'Hachamovitch M', 'Goldstein H']","['Department of Microbiology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'DNA Primers', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/*immunology']",PMC44539,1994/08/16 00:00,1994/08/16 00:01,['1994/08/16 00:00'],"['1994/08/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/16 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.17.8032 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Aug 16;91(17):8032-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.17.8032.,,"['5P30CA13330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI20671/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI27741/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also used the insulin promoter to coexpress nerve growth factor in the islets, which greatly increased the density of sympathetic innervation and facilitated analysis of the effects of LIF.

This model was tested first by infecting mice (C2K/O) that lack class II major histocompatibility complex molecules required for presentation of antigens to CD4+ T cells. C2K/O mice expressed BM5def at high levels but did not develop MAIDS either when unmanipulated or following transfer of CD4+ T cells. Second, B6 mice reconstituted with C2K/O bone marrow cells had normal frequencies of B cells (class II negative) and CD4+ cells and expressed high levels of BM5def transcripts but did not develop MAIDS; however, MAIDS developed in class II-competent nu/nu mice reconstituted with CD4+ T cells and in C2K/O mice reconstituted with B6 bone marrow to give class II-positive B cells and with purified CD4+ T cells.

The C-2 cyclohexanecarboxylate analog of paclitaxel (15) is also synthesized for comparison. The potency of these new taxoids were examined for their inhibitory activity for microtubule disassembly and also for their cytotoxicity against murine P388 leukemia cell line as well as doxorubicin-resistant P388 leukemia cell line (P388/Dox). It is found that 3'-dephenyl-3'-cyclohexyldocetaxel (11) (0.72T) and 2-(hexahydro)docetaxel (12) (0.85T) possess strong inhibitory activity for microtubule disassembly equivalent to docetaxel (0.7T), which is more potent than paclitaxel (1.0T). The results clearly indicate that phenyl or an aromatic group at C-3' or C-2 is not a requisite for strong binding to the microtubules. This finding has opened an avenue for development of new nonaromatic analogs of docetaxel and paclitaxel. 3'-Dephenyl-3'-cyclohexyl-2-(hexahydro)docetaxel (13) (2T) turns out to be a substantially weaker inhibitor. The cytotoxicities of 11-13 against P388 are, however, in the same range that is 8-12 times weaker than docetaxel and 4-6 times weaker than paclitaxel, i.e., 13 shows equivalent cytotoxicity to that of 11 or 12 in spite of much lower microtubule disassembly inhibitory activity. The cytotoxicities of these new taxoids against the P388/Dox cell line are only 2-2.5 times lower than that of docetaxel.

There were no significant differences between patients who went into complete remission (12/23) compared with those who did not respond for the following pharmacokinetic parameters: DNR and DOL plasma AUC (area under the curve) and DNR plasma half-life and clearance. There was a significant difference in the cellular DNR and DOL AUC between responders and non-responders (P < 0.02). Seven patients were Pgp positive and 18 Pgp negative.

To our knowledge this is the first report examining the relationship between DNR pharmacokinetics, patient response and Pgp expression. Our data indicated that acute leukaemia patients responding to chemotherapy had higher cellular DNR and DOL than non-responders; also, overexpression of Pgp appeared not to be the sole explanation for the lower cellular DNR levels as expected from in vitro studies.","['Galettis, P', 'Boutagy, J', 'Ma, D D']","['Galettis P', 'Boutagy J', 'Ma DD']","['Department of Haematology, Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'YDU8YIP30L (daunorubicinol)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/analogs & derivatives/blood/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Remission Induction']",PMC2033508,1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1994.301 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1994 Aug;70(2):324-9. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1994.301.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A high percentage of blast cells in either bone marrow or peripheral blood predisposes for the transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. The clinical presentation with pancytopenia suggest that all cell lineages are affected by MDS. The first experiments with X-linked restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) indicated that MDS is a stem cell disorder since the clonal deletions could be detected in all cell lineages. During the 1st decade several new molecular biological techniques such as polymerase chain reaction, and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) were applied to study molecular aberrations in subpopulations of cells. Molecular aberrations in all subpopulations would indicate that MDS is a stem cell disorder. The clonal studies in MDS are equivocal. Studies involving the expression of chromosomal abnormalities (standard karyotyping and FISH) in different cell lineages suggest that the pluripotent stem cell is not affected in MDS since the lymphoid cells usually do not express the abnormal karyotype. Results obtained by RFLP vary widely. Some studies indicate that the lymphoid lineage is not involved, while other studies find a polyclonal expression of the polymorphic genes in lymphoid cells. One study using PCR demonstrated mutations in the ras-oncogenes in T-cells as well as myeloid cells, suggesting that a common ancestor of myeloid and lymphoid cells is affected by MDS. This review discusses the different experimental approaches carried out to solve the discussion whether MDS is a stem cell disorder.","['Weimar, I S', 'Bourhis, J H', 'De Gast, G C', 'Gerritsen, W R']","['Weimar IS', 'Bourhis JH', 'De Gast GC', 'Gerritsen WR']","['Department of Immunology, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,,"['Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clone Cells/*pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/genetics/*pathology', 'Oncogenes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length']",,1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199409056284 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Apr;13(3-4):215-21. doi: 10.3109/10428199409056284.,"['Ki-ras', 'N-ras', 'c-abl', 'c-ets', 'c-mos', 'c-myb', 'c-myc', 'ras']",,37,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 'co + post-RMA' treatments (RMA present during both DAU uptake and efflux phases) generally led to higher DAU retention levels than the 'co-RMA' treatments (RMA present during the DAU uptake phase only). The magnitude and persistence of Pgp function inhibition induced by the RMA was further examined by only pulsing the cells with the RMA and growing them in RMA-free medium before the DAU retention assay ('pre-RMA' treatment). While recovery of Pgp function was nearly complete within minutes after a pulse exposure to verapamil, this took increasing times with CsA, SDZ 280-446 and SDZ PSC 833, the latter RMA leaving traces of inhibition of Pgp function even 2 days after the pulse exposure of the MDR-P388 cells. The persistence of Pgp inhibition conferred by some RMAs being much longer than by others, this feature should be taken into account when designing chemotherapy protocols in the clinic.","['Boesch, D', 'Loor, F']","['Boesch D', 'Loor F']","['Preclinical Research, Sandoz Pharma Ltd. 386/643, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '129893-84-1 (SDZ 280 446)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance', 'Extracellular Space/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides, Cyclic/pharmacology', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",,1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-199404000-00015 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1994 Apr;5(2):229-38. doi: 10.1097/00001813-199404000-00015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improvement in outcome will likely require new active drugs capable of eradicating resistant blast cells early in the clinical course. We therefore assessed the cytoreductive potential of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA), a halogenated purine analogue, in 22 consecutive children with newly diagnosed AML. The drug was administered as a single 120-hour continuous infusion (8.9 mg/m2 of body surface area per day) before the introduction of standard remission induction therapy. Six patients (27%) had complete hematologic remissions by a median of 21 days after treatment with the nucleoside (range, 14 to 33 days). Seven others had partial responses, yielding a total response rate of 59%. The drug also eliminated leukemic cells from cerebrospinal fluid in 4 of the 6 patients tested. Concentrations of 2-CdA in cerebrospinal fluid on day 5 after the initiation of treatment ranged from 12.4% to 38.0% (mean, 22.7%) of the steady-state plasma concentrations. Severe but reversible myelosuppression and thrombocytopenia developed in all patients. Analysis of factors that may have influenced the complete remission rate suggested a better outcome in patients with myeloblastic leukemia (M0-M2 subtypes in the revised French-American-British classification system). These results demonstrate clinically significant activity by 2-CdA against previously untreated AML in children, including leukemic blast cells in the central nervous system. Its use in combination chemotherapy may improve the outlook for patients with this often fatal hematologic cancer.","['Santana, V M', 'Hurwitz, C A', 'Blakley, R L', 'Crom, W R', 'Luo, X', 'Roberts, W M', 'Ribeiro, R', 'Mahmoud, H', 'Krance, R A']","['Santana VM', 'Hurwitz CA', 'Blakley RL', 'Crom WR', 'Luo X', 'Roberts WM', 'Ribeiro R', 'Mahmoud H', 'Krance RA']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male']",,1994/08/15 00:00,1994/08/15 00:01,['1994/08/15 00:00'],"['1994/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78722-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Aug 15;84(4):1237-42.,,"['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'FD-R-000349/FD/FDA HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sezary cells function as helper cells, whereas ATL cells are usually suppressor effectors. Although phenotypically similar (CD4+/CD7-/CD8-), these functional differences between the T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders suggest different patterns of cytokine expression. We wished to delineate the cytokine mechanisms potentially underlying the diverse functional characteristics of SzS and ATL. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of interleukins (IL) 2, 4, and 5, gamma-interferon, and transforming growth factor beta 1 in the highly purified leukemic T-cells from 5 SzS and 5 ATL patients. Decreased mRNA and protein levels of IL-2, gamma-interferon, and IL-5 were detected in mitogen-stimulated ATL and SzS cells when compared to similarly cultured normal CD4+ cells. In contrast, IL-4 production was markedly up-regulated in the leukemic cells of 4/5 SzS patients as compared to ATL and normal controls. Finally, fresh ATL cells secreted higher levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 into the culture medium than the malignant T-cells from SzS patients. Collectively these results suggest that, similar to the murine CD4-expressing T-cell subsets Th1 and Th2, different cytokine profiles exist in a human population of CD4+ T-cells. Moreover, the distinct patterns of IL-4 and transforming growth factor beta 1 expression by SzS and ATL cells, respectively, are most consistent with the functional differences (i.e., helper versus suppressor activity) between these T-cell malignancies and thus may play important roles in the pathogenesis of the paraneoplastic features associated with these two leukemias.","['Tendler, C L', 'Burton, J D', 'Jaffe, J', 'Danielpour, D', 'Charley, M', 'McCoy, J P', 'Pittelkow, M R', 'Waldmann, T A']","['Tendler CL', 'Burton JD', 'Jaffe J', 'Danielpour D', 'Charley M', 'McCoy JP', 'Pittelkow MR', 'Waldmann TA']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029-6574.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-5/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Sezary Syndrome/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism']",,1994/08/15 00:00,1994/08/15 00:01,['1994/08/15 00:00'],"['1994/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Aug 15;54(16):4430-5.,,['NICHD 5P30 HD28822/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a specific monoclonal antibody against T-BAM (5C8), we have previously shown that T-BAM expressing T cells are predominantly CD4+CD8- and in normal lymphoid tissue have a unique distribution. However, no information has been obtained regarding the phenotype and functional properties of human neoplastic T cells. Therefore, we investigated T-BAM expression immunohistochemically in 87 well-characterized T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and lymphoid leukemias (LL). We found that 21/81 neoplasms expressed detectable T-BAM and these positive tumors belong almost exclusively to the CD4+CD8- subtype. In addition, to determine whether T-BAM expression could be induced on T-BAM-LL cells, we activated T-BAM-LLs in vitro and showed that T-BAM could be upregulated only in CD4+CD8- tumors. Our studies clearly show that T-BAM is constitutively expressed in a large number of T-cell neoplasms with a relative mature phenotype (CD4+CD8-) and that only CD4+ neoplastic T cells can be induced in vitro to express this molecule.

Based on the recognition that SLPI levels can increase in the presence of airway inflammation, we hypothesized that inflammatory stimuli should modulate the expression of the SLPI gene in airway epithelial cells. To evaluate this, the modulation of SLPI gene expression with various inflammatory stimuli was evaluated in the HS-24 human bronchial epithelial cell line. After preliminary studies showed that several inflammatory mediators enhanced SLPI messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, PMA was used as a model inflammatory stimulus. PMA significantly increased the level of 0.7-kb SLPI mRNA transcripts in HS-24 cells in a dose- and time-dependent fashion and increased the amount of SLPI protein in the culture supernatant. Nuclear run-on analyses showed that the SLPI gene transcription rate increased approximately twofold after PMA stimulation. Transfection studies using fusion genes composed of fragments of up to 1.2 kb of the 5' flanking sequence of the SLPI gene and a luciferase reporter gene demonstrated potent promoter activity in the 131-bp segment (-115 to +16 relative to the transcription start site), and all longer segments up to 1.2 kb, whereas smaller segments showed low promoter activity. An 18-bp element (-98 to -115), in a region with homology to PMA-responsive regions in the Moloney murine leukemia virus enhancer and the IL-8 gene, was shown to be of importance in the level of transcription of the SLPI gene. However, this element was not responsible for the upregulation of SLPI gene expression by PMA. Evaluation of HS-24 cells in the presence of actinomycin D demonstrated that SLPI mRNA transcripts were very stable and became more so in the presence of PMA. Thus, SLPI gene expression in airway epithelial cells can be upregulated by an inflammatory stimulus, and this modulation is regulated at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. These mechanisms of SLPI upregulation likely play a role in defending the epithelial surface in the local milieu of inflammatory lung diseases.","['Maruyama, M', 'Hay, J G', 'Yoshimura, K', 'Chu, C S', 'Crystal, R G']","['Maruyama M', 'Hay JG', 'Yoshimura K', 'Chu CS', 'Crystal RG']","['Pulmonary Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Proteinase Inhibitory Proteins, Secretory)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (SLPI protein, human)', '0 (Secretory Leukocyte Peptidase Inhibitor)', '0 (Serine Proteinase Inhibitors)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Bronchi/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Epithelium/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proteinase Inhibitory Proteins, Secretory', '*Proteins', 'Secretory Leukocyte Peptidase Inhibitor', 'Serine Proteinase Inhibitors/*genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC296318,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI117331 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1994 Jul;94(1):368-75. doi: 10.1172/JCI117331.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical opportunities in diagnosis and circumvention.,383-410,"Increased P-glycoprotein expression has been shown to be the molecular cause of multidrug resistance in tumor cell lines. Sensitive immunohistochemical and molecular biologic techniques have been developed to detect P-glycoprotein/mdr1 mRNA expression in clinical samples of tumors. We have reviewed the tools now available for assessment of P-glycoprotein expression in the clinic, the current evidence for a relevant role of the protein in mediation of resistance to chemotherapy, and one strategy used to overcome therapeutic failures due to multidrug resistance. It is now recognized that low levels of increased P-glycoprotein/mdr1 mRNA can occur at diagnosis and during the course of treatment in some cases of acute myelogenous leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, breast carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and undifferentiated sarcoma of children, neuroblastoma, and retinoblastoma, and these relatively low levels of mdr1 overexpression appear to be associated with poor prognosis. In contrast, it has not been established whether a multidrug resistance mechanism is the rate-limiting factor in response to chemotherapy in carcinomas that arise from tissues normally expressing increased P-glycoprotein. Clinical trials have been initiated to determine whether pharmacologic chemosensitization improves the outcome of chemotherapy-treated malignancies. Preliminary results suggest that chemosensitizers can modulate the effects of increased P-glycoprotein in low-expressing tumors for which effective multiagent chemotherapy is available. Further research is needed for more potent chemosensitizers or combinations of agents that can be used more effectively. The successful circumvention of chemotherapy failure by chemosensitizers will ultimately establish the clinical relevance of the P-glycoprotein efflux mechanism.","['Chan, H S', 'DeBoer, G', 'Thorner, P S', 'Haddad, G', 'Gallie, B L', 'Ling, V']","['Chan HS', 'DeBoer G', 'Thorner PS', 'Haddad G', 'Gallie BL', 'Ling V']","['University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Resistance/physiology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 1994 Apr;8(2):383-410.,,['CA-37130/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],59,,,,,,,,,,,,

The characteristic 'hairy cells', present in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, are the hallmark of this leukaemia. The disease has a chronic, progressive course, and the majority of patients afflicted by it require therapy. The most common reason to initiate treatment is neutropenia with or without associated infectious complications, or the development of severe thrombocytopenia. Therapeutic options in hairy cell leukaemia include splenectomy, interferon administration, or the use of chemotherapeutic agents such as pentostatin (2'-deoxycoformycin) and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine. Splenectomy is still indicated in the treatment of young patients with significant splenomegaly and only minimal bone marrow involvement. Interferon treatment induces remission in approximately 90% of patients with hairy cell leukaemia, but complete remission is obtained in only 5-10%. The development of antibodies against interferon was initially considered a major problem, but longer follow-up of patients who developed antibodies has shown that it is transient and does not have a significant impact on the overall response to treatment. Pentostatin induces complete remission in 60-70% of patients and partial remission in 20-40%. 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine is a very promising drug in the treatment of this rare leukaemia, inducing long-lasting complete remission in approximately 80% of patients. While interferon does not cure the disease, it is possible that a subset of patients treated with pentostatin or 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine are cured. Longer follow-up of these patients will determine whether this is true.","['Platanias, L C', 'Golomb, H M']","['Platanias LC', 'Golomb HM']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Loyola University Chicago-Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, IL 60153.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Cladribine/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/etiology', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', '*Leukemia, Hairy Cell/complications/epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancytopenia/etiology', 'Pentostatin/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Splenectomy', 'Splenomegaly/etiology/surgery', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(05)80182-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1993 Dec;6(4):887-98. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(05)80182-9.,,,68,,,,,,,,,,,,

The response rates are high regardless of prior therapy, and the duration of complete responses (CR) after a single course of treatment is longer than with any other therapeutic agent. We investigated the presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) in ten HCL patients treated in our institution with 2-CdA. The presence of residual leukemic cells was investigated in patients in CR following one course of treatment, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and heavy-chain immunoglobulin genes (IgH), or TCR delta derived clonospecific probes. Eight patients achieved a complete remission after a single course of treatment, as evaluated at 6 months. Among these patients, seven are still in CR with a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 6-20 months) and one has relapsed after 15 months. Using PCR, all the evaluable patients remaining in CR showed persistent evidence of detectable MRD with no sign of decrease over the observation period. From this small series, we conclude that a single course of 2-CdA does not eradicate HCL and that persistence of residual leukemic cells appears to be common in patients in complete morphologic remission. Whether persistence of MRD will have an impact on long-term outcome, or whether HCL patients in morphologic CR with persistent MRD will remain so, is a matter of longer follow-up.","['Filleul, B', 'Delannoy, A', 'Ferrant, A', 'Zenebergh, A', 'Van Daele, S', 'Bosly, A', 'Doyen, C', 'Mineur, P', 'Glorieux, P', 'Driesschaert, P']","['Filleul B', 'Delannoy A', 'Ferrant A', 'Zenebergh A', 'Van Daele S', 'Bosly A', 'Doyen C', 'Mineur P', 'Glorieux P', 'Driesschaert P', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)'],IM,,"['Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cladribine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jul;8(7):1153-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the 20 cases of ALL studied, the number of cells recovered after 7 days of culture on allogeneic stromal layers were 58-192% (median, 95.5%) of those originally seeded. In parallel cultures with 2CdA (100 nM), 74- > 99% (median, 97.5%) of leukemic lymphoblasts were killed. The cytotoxicity of 2CdA extended to all ten samples with either the t(9;22) (q34;q11) or 11q23 chromosomal abnormalities, karyotypes associated with an extremely poor outcome, as well as to two samples collected at the time of relapse. The effects of 2CdA were dose-dependent, and were due to triggering of apoptosis as shown by typical morphologic changes and occurrence of DNA fragmentation. Stromal layers were apparently not affected by 2CdA treatment, even when used at 1000 nM. We also tested 2CdA cytotoxicity to multidrug resistant subclones of the CCRF-CEM ALL cell line. CEM/VLB100 expresses P-glycoprotein, whereas CEM/VM-1 and CEM/VM-1-5 have topoisomerase II mutations that are associated with resistance to topoisomerase II inhibitors. Overexpression of P-glycoprotein or alterations in topoisomerase II did not protect cells from 2CdA cytotoxicity. We conclude that 2CdA is cytotoxic in most cases of ALL. The method used in this study may be applied to evaluate leukemic blast cell sensitivity to compounds with potential anti-leukemic activity, and to select patients for entry into clinical trials.","['Kumagai, M', 'Manabe, A', 'Coustan-Smith, E', 'Blakley, R L', 'Beck, W T', 'Santana, V M', 'Behm, F G', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Campana, D']","['Kumagai M', 'Manabe A', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Blakley RL', 'Beck WT', 'Santana VM', 'Behm FG', 'Raimondi SC', 'Campana D']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Adolescent', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/physiology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cladribine/*toxicity', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jul;8(7):1116-23.,,"['R01-CA30103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA40570/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA58297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunophenotyped leukemic human B-cells from 38 cases of B-CLL were characterized for P-glycoprotein (PGP) content. In all, 30 cases of B-CLL were additionally analyzed for further parameters: accumulation of daunorubicin (DNR, n = 20) and rhodamine 123 (Rh123, n = 30) in both the presence and the absence of verapamil (VRP). Also, 16 cases of B-CLL were analyzed for vincristine (VCR) accumulation with or without VRP. Concerning the relative expression of PGP, these 16 cases of B-CLL were representative for the whole group of 30 cases. Spontaneous accumulation of Rh123 and VCR varied over a wide range: accumulation of Rh123, by a factor of 11.8; accumulation of VCR, by a factor of 9.7; and accumulation of DNR, by a factor of 3.6. VRP modulated the accumulation of RH123 in 16/30 cases (53%), that of VCR in 69% of cases, and that of DNR in 11% of cases. The maximal VRP-mediated increases in accumulation amounted to factors of 1.3 for DNR, 2.3 for Rh123, and 7.8 for VCR. Spontaneous drug accumulation did not correlate with the extent of chemomodulation. The amount of PGP in B-CLL cells (all cases studied were PGP-positive) did not correlate with drug accumulation or with the extent of VRP-mediated chemomodulation. Thus, high expression of PGP is only partially responsible for defective drug accumulation in B-CLL. Only the degree of chemomodulation by VRP is predictive for the extent of the PGP-related functional drug accumulation defect. Thus, in B-CLL, PGP-independent drug accumulation defects seem to be as important as those mediated by PGP. The extent of this drug accumulation defect varies for the different drugs in the following order VCR > Rh123 > DNR. The relevance of PGP-mediated and -independent drug accumulation defects in vivo may depend to a large extent on the drug being used and on the individual cell type. Both types of defect in drug accumulation are of high importance when regimens include VCR a drug commonly used in second-line chemotherapy of B-CLL. Both defects in drug accumulation may be responsible for intrinsic VCR resistance in B-CLL.","['Reichle, A', 'Diddens, H', 'Altmayr, F', 'Rastetter, J', 'Andreesen, R']","['Reichle A', 'Diddens H', 'Altmayr F', 'Rastetter J', 'Andreesen R']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Hematology/Oncology, University of Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics', 'Carrier Proteins/*analysis', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines/pharmacokinetics', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacokinetics']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00686038 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1994;34(4):307-16. doi: 10.1007/BF00686038.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incubation of L1210 leukemia cells with cryptophycin resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation in parallel with increases in the percentage of cells in mitosis (half-maximal effects at < 10 pM). Indirect immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that treatment of A-10 vascular smooth muscle cells with cryptophycin results in marked depletion of cellular microtubules and reorganization of vimentin intermediate filaments, similar to the effects of vinblastine. Cytochalasin B caused the depolymerization of microfilaments in these cells, while neither vinblastine nor cryptophycin affected this cytoskeletal component. Pretreatment of cells with taxol prevented microtubule depolymerization in response to either vinblastine or cryptophycin. While microtubule depolymerization in response to vinblastine was rapidly reversed by removal of the drug, cells treated with cryptophycin remained microtubule depleted for at least 24 h after removal of the compound. Combinational treatments with vinblastine and cryptophycin resulted in additive cytotoxicity. Ovarian carcinoma and breast carcinoma cells which are multiply drug resistant due to overexpression of P-glycoprotein are markedly less resistant to cryptophycin than they are to vinblastine, colchicine, and taxol. Therefore, cryptophycin is a new antimicrotubule compound which appears to be a poorer substrate for P-glycoprotein than are the Vinca alkaloids. This property may confer an advantage to cryptophycin in the chemotherapy of drug-resistant tumors.","['Smith, C D', 'Zhang, X', 'Mooberry, S L', 'Patterson, G M', 'Moore, R E']","['Smith CD', 'Zhang X', 'Mooberry SL', 'Patterson GM', 'Moore RE']","['Cancer Research Center of Hawaii, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu 96813.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '124689-65-2 (cryptophycin)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytochalasin B/pharmacology', 'Depsipeptides', '*Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Microtubules/*drug effects', 'Mitotic Index', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",,1994/07/15 00:00,1994/07/15 00:01,['1994/07/15 00:00'],"['1994/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Jul 15;54(14):3779-84.,,['CA 12623/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

ISPACC. International Study Group on Psychosocial Aspects of Childhood Cancer.,224-7,"Cranial radiation therapy in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia has been associated with adverse neuropsychological effects, such as low intelligence. However, records show that these associations usually occur when the dose of radiation used is 2400 cGy. We investigated whether a lower dose of 1800 cGy had the same adverse effects on long-term survivors and whether high doses of methotrexate but no radiation therapy would have a more beneficial effect. We evaluated 203 children for six years in a multi-centre European study. The patients were divided into two groups: 129 children treated with 1800 cGy of cranial radiation therapy and 74 children who received high-dose methotrexate but no radiation therapy. We used full scale intelligence quotient, verbal, and performance IQ tests to assess the patient's intelligence. We found a significant decline in full scale intelligence quotient in the irradiated group that increased with the length of time from diagnosis. Younger age at diagnosis was associated with lower full scale intelligence quotient in the radiated group. Our results indicate that a radiation dose of 1800 cGy can have negative effects on neurocognitive function and we continue to question the benefit of low-dose cranial radiation therapy.","['Jankovic, M', 'Brouwers, P', 'Valsecchi, M G', 'Van Veldhuizen, A', 'Huisman, J', 'Kamphuis, R', 'Kingma, A', 'Mor, W', 'Van Dongen-Melman, J', 'Ferronato, L']","['Jankovic M', 'Brouwers P', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Van Veldhuizen A', 'Huisman J', 'Kamphuis R', 'Kingma A', 'Mor W', 'Van Dongen-Melman J', 'Ferronato L', 'et al.']","['Department of Paediatrics, S Gerardo Hospital in Monza, University of Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Intelligence/*radiation effects', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Wechsler Scales']",,1994/07/23 00:00,1994/07/23 00:01,['1994/07/23 00:00'],"['1994/07/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/23 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0140-6736(94)92997-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0140-6736(94)92997-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1994 Jul 23;344(8917):224-7. doi: 10.1016/s0140-6736(94)92997-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,['Lancet. 1994 Jul 23;344(8917):210-1.

As a means toward achieving this goal, several new mAbs (hybridomas) have been developed by screening fusions for supernatants that possess T cell-inhibitory properties. Of these new mAbs, one mAb, designated 5H7, has been shown to possess both a unique combination of specificity for a monomorphic determinant of the alpha 3 domain of human class I MHC heavy chains and highly potent T cell inhibitory properties. mAb 5H7 profoundly inhibited T cell proliferation in response to anti-CD3 mAb in primary or secondary allogenic MLR or in primary human anti-mouse xenogenic MLR. mAb 5H7 inhibited expression of an early T cell activation marker, Leu23 (CD69); expression of IL-2Rs; and IL-2 production by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. mAb 5H7 inhibited IL-2 release by the Jurkat (E6-1) human T cell leukemia line in response to immobilized anti-CD3 mAb, thus, providing further evidence that 5H7 can inhibit activation directly at the level of the T cell. 5H7 profoundly blocked CD3-dependent (anti-CD3, anti-CD3 plus PMA, or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28) pathways, but only partially blocked a CD3-independent (anti-CD28 plus PMA) pathway of T cell activation. In conclusion, class I MHC molecules that are expressed on the T cell may regulate early TCR/CD3-dependent signaling events. In addition, 5H7 mAb may provide a reagent for suppression of cellular immunity in vivo.","['Smith, D M', 'Bluestone, J A', 'Jeyarajah, D R', 'Newberg, M H', 'Engelhard, V H', 'Thistlethwaite, J R Jr', 'Woodle, E S']","['Smith DM', 'Bluestone JA', 'Jeyarajah DR', 'Newberg MH', 'Engelhard VH', 'Thistlethwaite JR Jr', 'Woodle ES']","['Department of Surgery, University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, IL 60637.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/metabolism', 'CD28 Antigens/physiology', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*immunology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Lectins, C-Type', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology']",,1994/08/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 Aug 1;153(3):1054-67.,,"['5PO1 AI-29531-03/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'UO1-CA14599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease is characterized by hypergammaglobulinemia, polyclonal B cell activation, lymphadenopathy, and generalized immunosuppression within 5-8 weeks postinfection. The virus has been shown to infect B cells and macrophages and both T and B cells are required for MAIDS development. The manner in which T cells contribute to the disease process is not known. We report here that this retroviral infection leads to induction of a Thy-CD4+T cell subpopulation capable of transferring all the symptoms of MAIDS disease to normal B6 and B6 nu/nu. Essentially 100% of T cells recovered from B6 nu/nu mice, injected with CD4+ T cells from B6 MAIDS animal, is of the Thy-CD4+ phenotype. The proliferation of these T cells in culture and their ability to cause MAIDS in SCID mice is totally dependent on the presence of B cells. These T cells do not exhibit significant V beta restriction of their T cell receptors (TCR) and, by PCR analysis, have defective virus-specific sequences in the cellular genome. By several criteria, however, these cells do not produce the infectious virus. These results suggest that a B-cell-dependent population of CD4+ T cells from MAIDS animals, in the absence of detectable infectious virus production, has the ability to transfer MAIDS-like disease.","['Donaldson, L A', 'Cheng, R', 'Savage, S M', 'Sopori, M L']","['Donaldson LA', 'Cheng R', 'Savage SM', 'Sopori ML']","['Immunotoxicology Section, Lovelace Institutes, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87108.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/etiology', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*microbiology', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Defective Viruses/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Cooperation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*etiology/immunology/microbiology']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0008-8749(84)71191-9 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1994.1191 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1994 Jul;156(2):468-79. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1994.1191.,,['AI131386/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stimulation of these pre-B cells with IL-7 increased their costimulatory function which involved the B7/CD28 pathway. In the present study, we stimulated T cells with Con A, TSST-1, and SEB in the presence of peripheral blood B lineage cells that do not constitutively express B7/BB1 on their surface and investigated whether their costimulatory function could also be enhanced by IL-7. We found that, in the presence of IL-1, stimulation with IL-7 increased the costimulatory function of B cells and their surface expression level of ICAM-1 (CD54). We then investigated whether costimulatory B cell function could be inhibited by blocking the ICAM-1/LFA-1 pathway. Addition of anti-ICAM-1 mAb to the coculture of T and B cells inhibited T cell proliferation by approximately 20%. In contrast, addition of anti-LFA-1 beta (CD18) mAb, directed against the T cell ligand of ICAM-1, inhibited T cell proliferation almost completely. To determine the role of ICAM-1 in costimulatory B cell function, we sorted B cells into ICAM-1low-and ICAM-1high-expressing populations. We found that B cells expressing high levels of surface ICAM-1 elicited significantly higher T cell responses than those with low levels, suggesting that the expression level of ICAM-1 on peripheral blood B cells correlates with their costimulatory function.","['Dennig, D', 'Lacerda, J', 'Yan, Y', 'Gasparetto, C', ""O'Reilly, R J""]","['Dennig D', 'Lacerda J', 'Yan Y', 'Gasparetto C', ""O'Reilly RJ""]","['Department of Pediatrics, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Interleukin-1/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-7/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Cooperation/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0008-8749(84)71186-5 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1994.1186 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1994 Jul;156(2):414-23. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1994.1186.,,"['NCI CA23766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NCI CA33050/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the fluorescent properties of the dye rhodamine 123 (Rh 123) we aimed to develop a functional flow cytometric assay for the detection of MDR-expressing cells. Using drug sensitive cell lines (KB-3-1) and MDR mutants (KB-8-5, KB-C1) experimental conditions were established enabling demonstration of significant differences in Rh 123 accumulation/efflux. Using two-colour flow cytometry we subsequently analysed 42 consecutive patients suffering from B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). 34/42 (81%) cases showed a marked Rh 123 efflux which was completely abolished in the presence of the MDR inhibitor verapamil. The percentage of Rh 123 effluxing cells ranged from 10 to 70% with a median of 32%. In 26 cases extracted RNA was analysed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction to evaluate the expression of MDR 1 mRNA. In 25 of 26 (96%) cases MDR 1 mRNA was detectable. The levels of MDR 1 mRNA expression correlated well with the results of the Rh 123 efflux assay (r = 0.72; p < 0.0001). In addition, 37 cases of acute myeloid leukemia were analysed and demonstrated Rh 123 efflux in 18/37 (49%) cases. In this entity the percentage of Rh 123 effluxing cells ranged from 12 to 80% (median 45%).

Here we describe an acute leukemia patient whose blasts (90-96% in peripheral blood and bone marrow) had a phenotype consistent with putative progenitors of DLC. The patient was treated with ara-C and VP-16 but did not achieve remission. The blasts had lobulated nuclei, no cytoplasmic vacuolation or Auer rods and were weakly positive for acid phosphatase and non-specific esterase and negative for PAS, granzyme A, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV, ATPase/ADPase and lysozyme production. The blasts were positive for CD1a, CD4, CD16, CD35, HLADR, HLADQ, CD11b, CD11c, CD14, CD33, CD34, CD11a, CD71, CD19, CD25, IL-2R beta and negative for CD2, CD7, CD8, CD10, CD22, CD56, CD57, surface or cytoplasmic CD3, TCR delta and TCR beta, HTLV-1p19 and P-glycoprotein. On liquid culture with or without 5 x 10(-9) M 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) for 3 days, the blasts formed aggregates of proliferating and elongating cells on the wall of the flasks with a decline in CD34, numerous dendritic processes appeared on the cells and there was strong positivity for ATPase/ADPase, but no other changes in phenotype. No macrophages were observed, indicating derivation from separate DLCs. Cytogenetic analysis showed chromosomal abnormalities and electron microscopy showed Birbeck granules. Southern blotting of DNA showed rearrangement of one allele for both JH and TCR beta but no HTLV-1 related sequences. Culture supernatants from blasts cultured with or without TPA showed the production of large amounts of IL-8, IL-6, TNF-alpha, MIP-1 alpha, IL-10 and interferon gamma and modest amounts of IL-1 alpha, GM-CSF and stem cell factor. The presence not only of CD1a, HLADR, HLADQ and many other characteristics including Birbeck granules, but also differentiation along the lines of DLC with appearance of dendritic processes on the cells and expression of ATPase/ADPase activity, indicate that the leukemic blasts in our patient represented a leukemic counterpart of normal progenitors of DLC and the leukemia a new entity which could possibly be classified as AML-M8. Lastly, many pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by DLC could contribute to inflammation and IL-10 to immunosuppression.","['Srivastava, B I', 'Srivastava, A', 'Srivastava, M D']","['Srivastava BI', 'Srivastava A', 'Srivastava MD']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/biosynthesis', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Dendritic Cells/*pathology', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Langerhans Cells/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(94)90088-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1994 Jul;18(7):499-511. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)90088-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied P-glycoprotein expression in 40 patients with chronic B-cell leukemias by FACS analysis using MoAb c219, which recognizes both the MDR1 and the MDR3 gene product. We found significantly elevated P-glycoprotein expression in these patients as compared with normal controls. Patients who had received previous chemotherapy regimens containing MDR-related drugs showed significantly higher P-glycoprotein expression with MoAb c219 than those patients who had been untreated. Northern blot analysis of MDR1 and MDR3 gene expression in 32 of the patients gave a similar result: in the analysis of total RNA four of six patients (66%) pretreated with either vinca alkaloids or anthracyclines were MDR1 positive as opposed to 6 of 26 (23%) who had no treatment or treatment without these agents. In contrast, MDR3 expression was found more frequently (63%), but was randomly distributed in the differently treated groups. Increasing the sensitivity level by analysis of enriched mRNA (polyA+RNA) led to the detection of MDR1 and MDR3 expression all B-CLL patients. We conclude that a basic elevated P-glycoprotein expression is intrinsic in CLL cells, which is possibly upregulated under chemotherapy. This might be responsible for initial and acquired chemotherapy resistance in CLL patients. Follow-up of the B-CLL patients over 46 months showed that the median survival time for MDR1+ patients was 19 months as opposed to 46 months for MDR1- patients (p < 0.01). There was no statistical difference in survival between MDR3+ and MDR3- patients. In the MDR1+ group, eight of nine patients had developed resistance to the therapy with MDR-related drugs. The expression of MDR1 might, therefore, predict treatment failure with MDR-related drugs and be a negative prognostic factor.","['Wulf, G', 'Kluding, H', 'Ho, A D', 'Doerner, M', 'Doehner, H', 'Manegold, C', 'Hunstein, W']","['Wulf G', 'Kluding H', 'Ho AD', 'Doerner M', 'Doehner H', 'Manegold C', 'Hunstein W']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, MA 02215.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', '*Drug Resistance', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(94)90085-x [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1994 Jul;18(7):475-84. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)90085-x.,"['MDR1', 'MDR3']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ABMT has become a routine procedure for the treatment of patients with acute leukemias (results very similar to those of BMT), lymphomas, myelomas, as well as some selected tumors (breast and testicular cancers). In parallel to the development of ABMT and BMT, more than 30 cytokines have been individualized. Many of them are presently tested in clinical trials and some (GMCSF, GCSF, Erythropoietin, Interferons) are marketed. One of the most recent development which combines the two fields includes the selection and purification of immature normal stem cells recognized by the CD 34 monoclonal antibodies, their expansion in vitro by liquid culture in presence of multiple cytokines and gene transfer before autografting.

We have recently described a rapid multiparameter sorting procedure for significantly enriching stem cells with competitive long-term lymphomyeloid repopulating ability (CRU) from 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-treated mouse bone marrow. The sorted cells have now been tested as targets for retrovirus-mediated delivery of a marker gene, NeoR. They were cocultured for 4 days with fibroblasts producing a high titer of retrovirus in medium containing combinations of the hematopoietic growth factors interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, c-kit ligand (KL), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and then injected into lethally irradiated recipients, together with sufficient ""compromised"" bone marrow cells to provide short-term support. Over 80% of the transplanted mice displayed high levels (> or = 20%) of donor-derived leukocytes when analyzed 4 to 6 months later. Proviral DNA was detected in 87% of these animals and, in half of them, the majority of the hematopoietic cells were marked. Thus, infection of the stem cells was most effective. The tissue and cellular distribution of greater than 100 unique clones in 55 mice showed that most sorted stem cells had lymphoid as well as myeloid repopulating potential. Secondary transplantation provided strong evidence for infection of very primitive stem cells because, in several instances, different secondary recipients displayed in their marrow, spleen, thymus and day 14 spleen colony-forming cells the same proviral integration pattern as the primary recipient. Neither primary engraftment nor marking efficiency varied for stem cells cultured in IL-3 + IL-6, IL-3 + IL-6 + KL, IL-3 + IL-6 + LIF, or all four factors, but those cultured in IL-3 + IL-6 + LIF appeared to have lower secondary engraftment potential. Provirus expression was detected in 72% of the strongly marked mice, albeit often at low levels. Highly efficient retroviral marking of purified lymphomyeloid repopulating stem cells should enhance studies of stem cell biology and facilitate analysis of genes controlling hematopoietic differentiation and transformation.","['Szilvassy, S J', 'Cory, S']","['Szilvassy SJ', 'Cory S']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Female', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*microbiology/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Proviruses/isolation & purification', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/isolation & purification']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78798-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jul 1;84(1):74-83.,,['CA12421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Primary colony inhibition assays allowed us to characterize two distinct groups of AML, a DNR-resistant group (patients no. 1 through 6), which displayed significantly lower DNR sensitivity than normal CFU-GM (D50 = 11.3 +/- 1.4 ng/mL v 1.8 +/- 0.5 ng/mL, after 7 days of exposure, respectively; P < 0.01) and a DNR-sensitive group (patients no. 7 through 12) with D50 = 2.7 +/- 0.4 ng/mL. This classification remained unaltered when assessed by secondary colony inhibition assay (evaluating the self-renewal fraction of AML-CFU) or by viability assay (evaluating the ultimately differentiated blast cell population), suggesting that the DNR sensitivity profile in maintained throughout AML-CFU differentiation. DNR resistance of the differentiated blast cell population was not correlated with the level of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression but rather with the ability to extrude rhodamine 123 (Rh123). ST used at subtoxic concentrations induced a twofold to threefold enhancement of DNR cytotoxicity, increased Rh123 accumulation, and decreased Rh123 efflux kinetics in resistant AML cells. These effects were observed for ST concentrations much lower than those required to displace the P-gp-binding probe azidoprazosin, suggesting that ST might act through its PKC inhibitory effect and not through P-gp binding. Finally, this study provides evidence that DNR resistance in AML cells is, at least in part, related to the multidrug-resistance (MDR) phenotype. Because P-gp function can be downregulated by ST, it seems likely that the MDR pheno-type can be functionally regulated by cellular signalization in AML cells.","['Laredo, J', 'Huynh, A', 'Muller, C', 'Jaffrezou, J P', 'Bailly, J D', 'Cassar, G', 'Laurent, G', 'Demur, C']","['Laredo J', 'Huynh A', 'Muller C', 'Jaffrezou JP', 'Bailly JD', 'Cassar G', 'Laurent G', 'Demur C']","['Laboratoire de Pharmacologie et de Toxicologie Fondamentales, CNRS, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Child', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines/metabolism', 'Staurosporine', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78816-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jul 1;84(1):229-37.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It could be shown, in comparison to sensitive P388 cells, that the plasma membrane permeability for fluorescent dyes like rhodamine 123 and fura-2 and the biotransformation of xenobiotics are changed in resistant cells. Whereas the transport behaviour for the dyes is similarly induced in resistant cells independent of the drug which made the MDR, the P450 dependent enzyme activities are strongly increased in P388/ADR in comparison to the P388 and P388/VCR. The cell cycle analysis shows the same effect. Many more cells of P388/ADR are in the S-phase in comparison to P388 or P388/VCR. The LI is also increased in this direction.

Three out of the five CD-4-positive, HTLV-1-infected T-cell clones secreted both IFN-gamma and IL-4, similar to murine Th0 clones. The other two clones did not produce such cytokines. ICAM-1 and HLA-DR molecules were induced on cultured normal human keratinocytes and organ-cultured skin specimens by co-cultivation with IFN-gamma-producing T-cell clones or their culture supernatants. Induction of both molecules was markedly inhibited by pretreatment of the supernatants with excess amounts of anti-IFN-gamma monoclonal antibody. The number of cells adherent to the normal cultured keratinocytes was greater in the IFN-gamma-producing clones than in the non-producing ones.

This series included 19 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 11 multiple myeloma, nine ovarian cancer, seven Hodgkin's disease, seven non-lymphocytic leukaemia, one acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, one neuroblastoma. 522 PBSC collections were performed on 55 patients. Following ABSCT, the rate of engraftment was positively related to the dose of CFU-GM infused and negatively to the presence of bone marrow involvement at conditioning. 48 patients out of 55 transplanted (87%) had rapid, complete and sustained engraftment. Three patients (5%) died of transplant-related complications. Considering that 60% of the patients in this series were in partial remission or in progressive disease at the time of ABSCT, we conclude that ABSCT is a safe approach for the use of ablative conditioning therapy in patients with a wide scope of malignancies, provided that a large number of CFU-GM have been collected after mobilizing treatment.","['Pierelli, L', 'Iacone, A', 'Quaglietta, A M', 'Nicolucci, A', 'Menichella, G', 'Benedetti Panici, P', ""D'Antonio, D"", 'De Laurenzi, A', 'De Rosa, L', 'Fioritoni, G']","['Pierelli L', 'Iacone A', 'Quaglietta AM', 'Nicolucci A', 'Menichella G', 'Benedetti Panici P', ""D'Antonio D"", 'De Laurenzi A', 'De Rosa L', 'Fioritoni G', 'et al.']","['Servizio di Ematologia ed Emotransfusione, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', '*Graft Survival', 'Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/blood/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb03254.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1994 Jan;86(1):70-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb03254.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These genes are not expressed in quiescent T cells, except for barely detectable B1 RNA. After the PHA stimulus, HOXB gene activation initiates coordinately as a rapid induction wave in the 3'-->5' cluster direction (i.e., from HOXB1 through B9 genes). Thus, (i) expression of the foremost 3'-located B1 and B2 genes peaks 10 min after PHA addition and then rapidly declines, (ii) activation of B3, B4, and B5 begins 10 min after PHA addition and peaks at later times (i.e., at 120 min for B5), (iii) B6, B7, and B9 are expressed at a low level starting at later times (45 to 60 min), and (iv) B8 remains silent. Treatment of PHA-activated T lymphocytes with antisense oligonucleotides to B2 or B4 mRNA causes a drastic inhibition of T-cell proliferation and a decreased expression of T-cell activation markers (i.e., interleukin 2 and transferrin receptors). Similarly, treatment of CEM-CCRF, Peer, and SEZ627 T acute lymphocytic leukemia cell lines with anti-B4 oligomer markedly inhibits cell proliferation. Finally, T cells stimulated by a low dosage of PHA in the presence of 1 microM retinoic acid show a marked increase of both HOXB expression, particularly B2, and cell proliferation. These studies provide novel evidence on the role of HOX genes in adult cell proliferation. (i) Coordinate, early activation of HOXB genes from the 3'-->5' cluster side apparently underlies T-cell activation. (ii) The expression pattern in adult PHA-activated T cells is strikingly similar to that observed in retinoic acid-induced teratocarcinoma cells (A. Simeone, D. Acampora, L. Arcioni, P. W. Andres, E. Boncinelli, and F. Mavilio, Nature (London) 346:763-766, 1990), thus suggesting that molecular mechanisms underlying HOX gene expression in the earliest stages of development may also operate in activated adult T lymphocytes.","['Care, A', 'Testa, U', 'Bassani, A', 'Tritarelli, E', 'Montesoro, E', 'Samoggia, P', 'Cianetti, L', 'Peschle, C']","['Care A', 'Testa U', 'Bassani A', 'Tritarelli E', 'Montesoro E', 'Samoggia P', 'Cianetti L', 'Peschle C']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (leukoagglutinins, plants)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Primers', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Multigene Family', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'Phytohemagglutinins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*physiology', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",PMC358859,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.14.7.4872-4877.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1994 Jul;14(7):4872-7. doi: 10.1128/mcb.14.7.4872-4877.1994.,"['HOX', 'HOX-11', 'HOX11', 'HOXB', 'HOXB1', 'HOXB2']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This gene is proximal to the primary breakpoint and loss of its function may play a key role in determining the favourable outcome in inversion 16 AML.

Among 13 AML patients with inversion 16 MRP deletion was detected in 5 while 7 had no deletion. Deletion of MRP gene was associated with longer time from diagnosis until death or relapse from complete remission (p = 0.007).

The authors conducted a dose-finding study to define the maximal tolerated dose and toxicities of this agent when given to patients with refractory solid tumors having normal renal, hepatic, and bone marrow function. METHODS: Cladribine was given as a 1-hour intermittent infusion, repeated daily for 5 days, with a cycle length of 28 days. The initial dose was 4 mg/m2, with escalating doses by cohort. Three dosage levels (4, 6, and 8 mg/m2/day) were explored, and patients were observed to determine toxicity. The end points of the study were the definition of the maximally tolerated dose (MTD), toxicity profile, and establishment of a recommended Phase II dose (RPTD) for cladribine. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were treated; the majority were patients with non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. The median Cycle-1 leukocyte nadirs for the 4, 6, and 8 mg/m2/day dosage levels were 3100, 2300, and 950 cells/microliters (range 800-3500), respectively, and the and 950 cells/microliters (range 800-3500), respectively, and the mean nadir absolute neutrophil counts were 1500, 936, and 482 cells/microliters (range 130-2241), respectively. Minimal thrombocytopenia was seen, and no evidence for cumulative myelosuppression was observed. Two patients were hospitalized for neutropenic fevers, both of whom received the 6 mg/m2/day dose. One patient who received the 4 mg/m2/day dose had a transient episode of blindness that occurred during the infusion on Day 3 of Cycle 3. Thorough evaluation of this problem did not reveal an etiology, and it did not recur with further administration of cladribine. No other significant nonhematologic toxicity has been noted.

MRP appeared to be ubiquitously expressed at low levels in all nonmalignant hemopoietic cell types, reflecting its basal constitutive expression. In acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) (n = 16), one of nine untreated patients and two of seven patients with prior chemotherapy showed significant hyperexpression of MRP. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (n = 21), either treated (n = 8) or untreated (n = 13), a high percentage (15 of 21: 71% had relatively high expression levels of the MRP gene. In contrast, low MRP expression levels were detected in acute lymphocytic leukemia (n = 14), and in chronic myelocytic leukemia (n = 9). DNA analysis by Southern blotting did not reveal amplification of the MRP gene in the leukemia samples, including those with elevated MRP mRNA levels. We conclude that relatively high expression of MRP is occasionally observed in AML and at high frequency in CLL, irrespective of treatment, probably due to transcriptional activation and/or increased mRNA stability.","['Burger, H', 'Nooter, K', 'Zaman, G J', 'Sonneveld, P', 'van Wingerden, K E', 'Oostrum, R G', 'Stoter, G']","['Burger H', 'Nooter K', 'Zaman GJ', 'Sonneveld P', 'van Wingerden KE', 'Oostrum RG', 'Stoter G']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Carrier Proteins/*blood/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic System/cytology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/*genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*blood/genetics', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribonucleases/metabolism']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jun;8(6):990-7.,['MDR1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

K562/Vcr30 and K562/Vcr150 were cross resistant to Dau but not to VP16 and RMs had no effect on the cytotoxicity of VP16 in any of cell lines. The results indicate that chemosensitive cells also have a transport mechanism, not mediated by P-glycoprotein, which transports Vcr but not Dau and VP16.

A new member of the cytokine receptor superfamily with strong homology to gp130.,128-36,"A cDNA encoding a human IL-12R subunit was isolated by expression cloning. This subunit is a 662 amino acid type I transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain of 516 amino acids and a cytoplasmic domain of 91 amino acids. It is a member of the hemopoietin receptor superfamily and is most closely related over its entire length to gp130 and the receptors for granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF) and leukemia-inhibitory factor. When expressed in COS cells, this IL-12R subunit binds both human and murine IL-12 with an apparent affinity of 2 to 5 nM. The transfected COS cells express both monomers and disulfide-linked dimers or oligomers of the IL-12R subunit on their surface. However, unlike the IL-6-induced dimerization of gp130, the oligomerization of the IL-12R subunit is not dependent on binding of IL-12. Only the IL-12R subunit dimers/oligomers but not the monomers bind IL-12 with an affinity of 2 to 5 nM. A polyclonal antiserum raised against this receptor subunit specifically inhibits IL-12-induced proliferation of PHA-activated PBMC. The data are consistent with the hypotheses that 1) a dimer/oligomer of the cloned IL-12R subunit (IL-12R-beta) represents the low affinity IL-12 binding site identified on human lymphoblasts, 2) the cloned receptor subunit is involved in IL-12 signal transduction, and 3) an additional, as of yet unidentified subunit is required to generate a high affinity IL-12R complex.","['Chua, A O', 'Chizzonite, R', 'Desai, B B', 'Truitt, T P', 'Nunes, P', 'Minetti, L J', 'Warrier, R R', 'Presky, D H', 'Levine, J F', 'Gately, M K']","['Chua AO', 'Chizzonite R', 'Desai BB', 'Truitt TP', 'Nunes P', 'Minetti LJ', 'Warrier RR', 'Presky DH', 'Levine JF', 'Gately MK', 'et al.']","['Department of Inflammation/Autoimmune Diseases, Roche Research Center, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Nutley, NJ 07110.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-12)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Antigens, CD', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-12', 'Interleukins/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/chemistry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-12', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 Jul 1;153(1):128-36.,"['G-CSF-R', 'GP130', 'IL-12R', 'LIF-R']",,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/U03187'],,,,

The subsequent recovery was quicker for CD8+ and NK cells, leading to a normalization within 3 months, whereas CD20+ and CD4+ cells required 1 or 2 years to enter the normal range. The CD4/CD8 ratio thus decreased after the nadir and remained less than 1. CD45RA+ CD4 cells and CD45RA+/CD45RO+ double-positive cells were less affected by CdA. Activated T cells, ie, HLA-DR+ cells, rarely decreased below the normal range and often recovered with an overshoot. CD10+ cells increased in the bone marrow posttreatment as an indication of normal B-cell regeneration in 16 of 36 (44%) patients.

Unfortunately, suitably HLA-matched related or unrelated donors are not available for the majority of patients. Transplant of stem cells derived from a patient's own marrow or peripheral blood (autologous transplant) avoids the need for an HLA-matched donor, is associated with a less complicated and shorter hospital course than donor transplantation, and has been successful in the treatment of other haematological malignancies. We report results of autologous transplants in 200 patients with CML at eight marrow transplant centres over seven years. This is the first multicentre analysis of autologous transplants for CML and reports on the largest number of patients studied to date.

The aim of the current study was to clarify the mechanisms playing crucial roles in the T cell requirement in the expression of antitumor effects of lentinan. Lentinan treatment of BDF1 mice transplanted intradermally with FBL-3 induced complete tumor regression and a marked increase in survival time. The antitumor action of lentinan was abolished in mice treated simultaneously with antibodies to CD4 and CD8 antigens, whereas antibody to CD4, CD8 or NK1.1 alone was ineffective. The natural killer, cytotoxic T lymphocyte, and helper T cell activities were already augmented in this FBL-3/BDF1 system and thus further augmentation of these activities by lentinan was not observed. These activities did not correlate with the antitumor activity of lentinan, as was confirmed in lymphocyte subset depletion experiments. On the contrary, the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response against tumor-associated antigens was triggered by lentinan and was abrogated only in mice treated simultaneously with antibodies to CD4 and CD8 antigens. Furthermore, a non-cytolytic tumor-associated antigen-specific CD4+ T cell clone able to induce the DTH response in concert with lentinan reconstituted the antitumor effects in B6 nude mice when administered with lentinan. These results suggest that, in addition to the augmentation of immune effector cell activity against tumors, infiltration of these cells into the tumor burden initiated by the DTH responses at tumor sites may be involved in eradication of tumors by lentinan.","['Suzuki, M', 'Iwashiro, M', 'Takatsuki, F', 'Kuribayashi, K', 'Hamuro, J']","['Suzuki M', 'Iwashiro M', 'Takatsuki F', 'Kuribayashi K', 'Hamuro J']","['Basic Research Laboratory, Ajinomoto Co.

We report here that CNTF and LIF increase choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity three- to fourfold in cultures from the ventral mesencephalon (VM) containing cholinergic neurons from cranial motor nuclei and the pedunculopontine nucleus, but decrease tyrosine hydroxylase activity to 50-60% of control values. In contrast, they do not increase cholinergic properties in cultured septal and striatal cholinergic neurons. In order to identify the subpopulations of cholinergic neurons in the mesencephalic cultures responding to CNTF and LIF, embryonic VM was cut into rostral, caudal, central, and laterocaudal portions and cultured separately. CNTF and LIF increased ChAT activity only in the rostral and central VM, which contain cranial motor nuclei, and not in the caudal VM, which contains the rostroventral part of the pedunculopontine nucleus. Together with the previous observations on spinal motoneurons, the present results indicate that only cholinergic motoneurons projecting to peripheral targets, but not cholinergic neurons projecting centrally, may respond to CNTF and LIF by an increase in ChAT activity or by increased neuronal survival.","['Zurn, A D', 'Werren, F']","['Zurn AD', 'Werren F']","['Division Autonome de Recherche Chirurgicale, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', 'EC 1.14.16.2 (Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase)', 'EC 2.3.1.6 (Choline O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Brain/*cytology/embryology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Choline O-Acetyltransferase/metabolism', '*Cholinergic Fibers', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mesencephalon/cytology/embryology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/metabolism']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/dbio.1994.1150 [doi]', 'S0012-1606(84)71150-X [pii]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 1994 Jun;163(2):309-15. doi: 10.1006/dbio.1994.1150.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular interaction responsible for NK cell recognition is poorly understood. It has been frequently suggested that the loss of beta 2 integrin in immune competent cells may lead to dysfunction due to inadequate cell-cell interaction. We examined the role of lymphocyte functional adhesion molecule-1 in the function of a human natural killer leukemia cell line, YT-1. A mutant YT-1(-) cell subclone showed an absence of killing activity against a B lymphoma cell line, compared with that against a CD11a/CD18 positive parental cell line, YT-1(+) cells. We found that this loss of cytotoxicity was correlated with lack of surface expression of CD11a/CD18 molecules due to the mutation of the CD18 gene. Using gene transfer experiments, we provide strong evidence demonstrating that CD18 transfection to this mutant NK cell line, YT-1(-), restored the surface expression of CD11a/CD18, and this restoration was accompanied by reexpression of cytotoxic function.","['Liu, J H', 'Wei, S', 'Blanchard, D K', 'Djeu, J Y']","['Liu JH', 'Wei S', 'Blanchard DK', 'Djeu JY']","['H.

Interferon induces cytogenetic remissions in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and partial remissions in hairy cell leukemia, a disorder in which single courses of 2-CdA induce complete remissions. In vitro clonal growth of immature myeloid progenitors from normal marrow is markedly inhibited by 2-CdA. METHODS: 2-CdA was administered to 12 patients with Philadelphia-chromosome-positive CML, 11 chronic phase, and 1 accelerated phase, at 0.1 mg/kg/day by continuous intravenous infusion for 7 days every 28-35 days, until maximum peripheral hematologic response. RESULTS: Of 12 patients, 10 (83%) achieved complete hematologic responses and 2 (17%) partial hematologic responses after a median of two courses of 2-CdA. The median first hematologic response duration was 3 months. Of the seven patients who relapsed and were retreated with a median of two further courses of 2-CdA, five obtained responses (four complete and one partial) and two did not respond. The median second hematologic response duration was 4 months. No patient had significant Philadelphia-chromosome suppression. Reversible myelosuppression and severe cumulative T-cell immunosuppression associated with opportunistic infections in four patients were the principal toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: 2-CdA is active in CML, inducing complete hematologic responses, but the absence of cytogenetic responses and severe immunosuppression may limit its clinical use.","['Saven, A', 'Piro, L D', 'Lemon, R H', 'Figueroa, M L', 'Kosty, M', 'Ellison, D J', 'Beutler, E']","['Saven A', 'Piro LD', 'Lemon RH', 'Figueroa ML', 'Kosty M', 'Ellison DJ', 'Beutler E']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cecil H. and Ida M.

We have studied the expression of mRNA, polypeptide, and kinase activities of HRI in various tissues from both nonanemic and anemic rabbits. Our results indicate that HRI is expressed in an erythroid cell-specific manner. HRI is present in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of both nonanemic and anemic rabbits but not in any of the other tissues tested. HRI mRNA is present at low levels in uninduced mouse erythroleukemic (MEL) cells and human K562 cells and accumulates to higher levels upon induction. The accumulation of HRI mRNA in differentiating MEL cells is dependent upon the presence of heme. The addition of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (AT), an inhibitor of heme biosynthesis, to the induction medium markedly reduced HRI mRNA accumulation. Simultaneous addition of hemin and AT to the dimethyl sulfoxide induction medium largely prevented the inhibition of HRI mRNA induction by AT. These findings indicate that HRI is expressed in an erythroid cell-specific manner and that the major physiologic role of HRI is in adjusting the synthesis of globins to the availability of heme.","['Crosby, J S', 'Lee, K', 'London, I M', 'Chen, J J']","['Crosby JS', 'Lee K', 'London IM', 'Chen JJ']","['Harvard-M.I.T.

One of the mechanisms of resistance is called the multidrug resistance. Multidrug resistance is a cross-reactive resistance between molecules different in structure and activities. Multidrug resistance is characterized by an active drug efflux through the cell membrane with a decrease in drug cellular accumulation. This efflux out of the cell is due to a membrane glycoprotein called P-glycoprotein or P-gp 170 encoded by the mdr1 gene. In humans, high levels of mdr1 gene expression are observed in normal tissues as adrenal gland, colon and kidney. Tumors derived from these tissues are usually resistant to chemotherapy. By contrast to this intrinsic drug resistance, acquired drug resistance is defined by the mdr1 gene expression in tumors which relapse and become refractory to chemotherapy as acute lymphoid and myeloid leukemia, breast and ovarian cancers, non-Hodgkin lymphomas and multiple myeloma. When the clinical significance of multidrug resistance will be defined, identification of non-responders patients should lead to the use of therapeutic regimens including mdr reversing agents.","['Guerci, A P']",['Guerci AP'],"['Service de medecine A, CHU Brabois, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France.']",['fre'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Rev Med Interne,La Revue de medecine interne,8101383,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/physiology', '*Drug Resistance', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics/physiology']",,1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0248-8663(05)81423-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0248-8663(05)81423-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Med Interne. 1993;14(8):772-9. doi: 10.1016/s0248-8663(05)81423-7.,,,70,,,,,,,Resistance multidrogue induite par la surexpression du gene mdr1.,,,,,

To compare the level of mRNA synthesis with those of gene amplification and oncoprotein synthesis, all tumors were also analyzed by Southern blot analysis, and for ERBB2 also by immunohistochemistry. Expression of ERBB2 mRNA was observed in eight tumors. MYC expression was observed in all tumors studied. Three tumor cell lines expressed both ERBB2 and MYC (SK-BR-3, HeLa, HT-29) and two only MYC (SK-LU-1, HL-60). Only one tumor showed amplification of ERBB2 and two of MYC. In all three cases there was a considerable increase in corresponding mRNA synthesis as detected by in situ hybridization. By immunohistochemistry, four cases showed either patchy areas or uniformly distributed, membrane-bound ERBB2 immunoreactivity. All except one case showed increased ERBB2 mRNA synthesis. There was a clear association between the quantity of ERBB2 mRNA and oncoprotein expression. The results show that in situ hybridization of fine-needle aspiration material is a sensitive method to detect increased expression of the ERBB2 and MYC oncogenes in breast carcinoma. Furthermore, this study indicates that in a majority of cases some other mechanism that gene amplification appears responsible for the increased gene expression. It is also possible that Southern blot analysis is not a sensitive enough method to detect gene amplifications in the heterogeneous breast tumors, which usually also contain stromal tissue. The fact that not all cases with elevated ERBB2 mRNA synthesis were immunohistochemically positive suggests that either immunohistochemistry (after fixation with 10% formalin) is a less sensitive method than in situ hybridization to detect abnormal gene expression or that there are cases in which the oncoprotein synthesis is for some reason depressed, even though there is an increase in gene transcription.","['Soini, Y', 'Mannermaa, A', 'Winqvist, R', 'Kamel, D', 'Poikonen, K', 'Kiviniemi, H', 'Paakko, P']","['Soini Y', 'Mannermaa A', 'Winqvist R', 'Kamel D', 'Poikonen K', 'Kiviniemi H', 'Paakko P']","['Department of Pathology, University of Oulu, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Histochem Cytochem,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,9815334,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Biopsy, Needle/methods', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology/surgery', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'ErbB Receptors/*analysis/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Lymph Node Excision', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Metaphase', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*analysis/biosynthesis', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Receptor, ErbB-2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/42.6.7910618 [doi]'],ppublish,J Histochem Cytochem. 1994 Jun;42(6):795-803. doi: 10.1177/42.6.7910618.,"['ERBB2', 'MYC']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, both cell lines invade through a fibroblastic monolayer, but ESb cells do so much slower than BW-O-Li1. By the use of Fourier analysis of cell outlines, we can relate this difference in invasiveness to a difference in cell motility: ESb cells do not perform any conspicuous shape change, whereas BW-O-Li1 cells are actively protruding and retracting large pseudopodia. However, the low-motile ESb cells become as motile and deformable as BW-O-Li1 cells when they have eventually invaded under a fibroblastic monolayer. This indicates that ESb cells do have inherent capability for shape change. Treatment of ESb cells with the microtubule disrupting agent nocodazole concomitantly increases their shape change intensity, and their invasion rate through fibroblast monolayers. On the contrary, the microtubule stabilizing drug taxol inhibits both motility and invasion of BW-O-Li1 cells.

A population-based case-control study.,1129-37,"OBJECTIVE: Causes of indeterminate results of Western blot testing (IWB) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 include seroconversion, HIV-2 cross-reactivity, and autoimmune disease, but most IWB results remain unexplained. This case-control study assessed risk factors for IWB results, including early HIV infection, other retroviral infection, autoantibodies, and other medical conditions. DESIGN: Prospective study to determine HIV seroconversion rate, with a case-control design to assess other risk factors for IWB. Cases (persons with one or more repeatedly reactive HIV-1 enzyme immunoassay with IWB), their current sexual partners, and controls (persons with negative enzyme immunoassay and Western blot results) were recruited from blood banks, health department and prenatal clinics, and private providers in Washington and Oregon. RESULTS: Of 244 cases enrolled, 206 were followed up for 6 months or longer, and six (3.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7% to 5.3%) with recent HIV risk behaviors seroconverted. The Western blot banding patterns differed among groups; cases usually had p17 or p24 bands, while controls and cases' sexual partners usually had polymerase bands. Conditional logistic regression indicated that independent risk factors for IWB among male cases and controls were a tetanus booster in the past 2 years (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.2 to 8.6) and sexual contact with a prostitute (odds ratio, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.0 to 9.5). Independent risk factors for women were parity (odds ratio, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.4) and autoantibodies, either rheumatoid factor or antinuclear antibodies (odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.03 to 5.6). No cross-reactivity was detected with HIV-2, human T-lymphotrophic virus type 1, feline immunodeficiency or feline leukemia, or bovine immunodeficiency viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of persons with reactive HIV-1 enzyme immunoassays and IWB should include an assessment of HIV risk and other possible risk factors, such as alloimmunization (ie, parity or recent immunization) or autoantibodies (ie, antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor). The relationship of IWB among men who reported sex with prostitutes is intriguing and warrants further study.","['Celum, C L', 'Coombs, R W', 'Jones, M', 'Murphy, V', 'Fisher, L', 'Grant, C', 'Corey, L', 'Inui, T', 'Wener, M H', 'Holmes, K K']","['Celum CL', 'Coombs RW', 'Jones M', 'Murphy V', 'Fisher L', 'Grant C', 'Corey L', 'Inui T', 'Wener MH', 'Holmes KK']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Intern Med,Archives of internal medicine,0372440,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Deltaretrovirus Antibodies)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Autoantibodies/blood', 'Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cross Reactions', 'Deltaretrovirus Antibodies/blood', 'Female', 'HIV Seropositivity/*diagnosis/epidemiology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/diagnosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",,1994/05/23 00:00,1994/05/23 00:01,['1994/05/23 00:00'],"['1994/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/23 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Intern Med. 1994 May 23;154(10):1129-37.,,"['IP30-27757/IP/NCIRD CDC HHS/United States', 'R01CA-43371/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the duration of each is uncertain. We have analyzed a previously reported cohort of 40 patients who had responded to 2-CdA. Eight patients (20%) have relapsed at a median of 16 months (range, 3 to 23 months). The remaining 32 patients were observed for a median of 30 months (range, 7 to 43 months). No patients have died.

The median CD4+ nadir after treatment was 139/microL (range, 25 to 580/microL). There was a single opportunistic infection and no second malignancies observed. Although there was evidence of some improvement in CD4+ lymphocyte counts on sequential testing, CD4+ counts remained significantly lower than baseline (P < .0001) at a median of 23 months after therapy (median, 237/microL; range, 25 to 514/microL), and were also lower than baseline (P < .002) in those patients with more than 1 year of follow-up (median, 27 months; range, 13 to 42 months). The median time to reach an absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count of 365/microL, the lower limit of the normal range, was 40 months.

We treated 12 patients with blast-phase CML with a program of high-dose cytarabine 3.0 g/m2 and melphalan 140 mg/m2, followed by reinfusion of stem cells obtained from peripheral blood during the chronic phase. Seven patients achieved either a partial or complete hematologic remission, while five patients showed no response to therapy. One patient returned to chronic phase features with loss of a chromosomal abnormality acquired at blast phase, restoration of hematopoiesis, and a decrease in the amount of bone marrow blasts to less than 10%. Six patients cleared their peripheral blasts and showed recovery of their myeloid and platelet lineages, but all six required treatment for acceleration within 3 months. Of the five nonresponding patients, three died with aplastic bone marrow, one patient never cleared peripheral blasts after chemotherapy, and one patient had evidence of peripheral blasts 3 weeks after the autologous stem cell reinfusion. None of the patients returned to a normal karyotype. The ablative regimen was effective in eradicating bone marrow blasts to < 10% in 8 of 10 patients in whom interpretable bone marrow samples were performed following chemotherapy. Overall, the median survival for all patients from the time of stem cell reinfusion was 5.5 months. We conclude that autotransplants with peripheral blood can successfully be used to support hematopoiesis during high-dose therapy for CML blast crisis, however, has no role by itself in the curative therapy of blast crisis CML. A small number of patients can be restored to chronic phase features, and this may provide an opportunity to administer subsequent alternative treatments designed to eradicate the malignant stem cell population. Autotransplants with stem cells may also be used as therapy for patients without a histocompatible marrow donor. However, the autotransplant may be more effective when used during the chronic phase of CML, with the use of hematopoietic growth factors, and with reinfusion of stem cells depleted of the malignant Philadelphia chromosome-positive clone.","['Matulonis, U A', 'Griffin, J D', 'Canellos, G P']","['Matulonis UA', 'Griffin JD', 'Canellos GP']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,,"['Adult', '*Blood Transfusion, Autologous', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/standards/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', 'Melphalan/adverse effects/standards/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830450403 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1994 Apr;45(4):283-7. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830450403.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The actuarial relapse-free survival at 5 years was 63% in the below-median group and 84% in the above-median group (difference 21% [95% CI 3-39%], p = 0.0018). Multivariate analysis showed that erythrocyte thioguanine nucleotide concentration was independent of other prognostic variables including age, leukaemia immunophenotype, white-blood-cell count at diagnosis, trial protocol, and sex. Whatever the cause, in childhood ALL variable formation of intracellular mercaptopurine metabolites seems to be clinically important. Therapeutic schedules that include long-term daily oral mercaptopurine might be more effective if such metabolites are monitored.","['Lilleyman, J S', 'Lennard, L']","['Lilleyman JS', 'Lennard L']","[""Department of Haematology, Children's Hospital, Sheffield, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,"['0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythrocytes/*chemistry', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Guanine Nucleotides/*blood', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Regression Analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thionucleotides/*blood']",,1994/05/14 00:00,1994/05/14 00:01,['1994/05/14 00:00'],"['1994/05/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/14 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0140-6736(94)92400-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0140-6736(94)92400-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1994 May 14;343(8907):1188-90. doi: 10.1016/s0140-6736(94)92400-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is absent from or present in only low amounts on resting T cells but it is expressed strongly after activation. Crosslinking of CD26/Tp103 via the monoclonal antibody CB.1 triggers functional activities in preactivated T cells. To study the molecular requirements for T cell activation via CD26 we transfected a cDNA encoding CD26 into several CD26-negative cells. In Jurkat T cell leukemia cells that normally do not express the CD26 antigen, the transfected CD26 molecule is functional because the monoclonal antibody CB.1 induces an increase of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and IL-2 production. For this stimulatory effect a crosslinking of the monoclonal antibody CB.1 is necessary. After modulation of the TCR/CD3 complex the transfected Jurkat cells were insensitive to triggering via CD26. Moreover, a CD26-transfected TCR-negative variant of Jurkat cells did not respond to CD26 triggering despite high levels of expression of the molecule on their surface. These data demonstrate that the function of CD26/Tp103 is dependent on the expression of the T cell receptor complex. In search of a physiological function of CD26 we found a costimulatory effect of mAb CB.1 in combination with the nonstimulatory anti-CD3 antibody BMA030 and an additive effect in the response to the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin E. Transfected Jurkat cells, however, did not show a reproducibly enhanced responsiveness to the superantigen compared to that of untransfected cells.","['Hegen, M', 'Camerini, D', 'Fleischer, B']","['Hegen M', 'Camerini D', 'Fleischer B']","['First Department of Medicine, University of Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.14.- (Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4', 'Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0008-8749(83)71024-5 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1993.1024 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1993 Feb;146(2):249-60. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1993.1024.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The drug promotes the formation of microtubule polymers in a cell, by reversibly and specifically binding the beta-subunit of tubulin. Taxol is administered intravenously by a 3-24-hour infusion at 3-week intervals. Myelosuppression, especially neutropenia, appears to be the dose limiting toxicity in solid tumours at 200-250 mg/m2. Furthermore, side effects such as sensory neurotoxicity (with typical numbness, tingling and painful paraesthesiae in the extremities), diarrhoea and alopecia appear frequently. Mucositis appears to be the non-haematological dose limiting side effect at 390 mg/m2 that has been determined in patients with leukaemia. Hypersensitivity reactions, which have been fatal in individual cases, might be schedule dependent. Furthermore, antiallergic prophylaxis must be given, although this precaution might not be considered to be fully protective. Phase I studies performed with combinations of taxol and cisplatin, doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide have indicated the feasibility of these regimens and show promise for future investigations. Addition of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), aimed at modulating myelosuppressive toxicity, showed in Phase I studies that the taxol dose could be increased to 250 mg/m2, with peripheral neuropathy as the dose limiting toxicity. In Phase II studies, taxol has been shown to be effective, including producing complete tumour remission, in advanced drug refractory ovarian carcinoma (19%-36% response rate), previously treated patients with metastatic breast carcinoma (27%-62% response rate), advanced non-small lung cancer (21%-24% response rate), advanced small cell lung cancer (37% response rate) and advanced head and neck cancer (34% response rate).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Guchelaar, H J', 'ten Napel, C H', 'de Vries, E G', 'Mulder, N H']","['Guchelaar HJ', 'ten Napel CH', 'de Vries EG', 'Mulder NH']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol),Clinical oncology (Royal College of Radiologists (Great Britain)),9002902,['P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)'],IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Paclitaxel/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use/toxicity']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0936-6555(05)80367-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0936-6555(05)80367-x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol). 1994;6(1):40-8. doi: 10.1016/s0936-6555(05)80367-x.,,,81,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this clinical trial we assessed 2-CDA toxicity and response rate in patients with various haematological malignancies who were heavily pre-treated and mostly refractory to standard treatment regimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two refractory patients, 51 relapsing after standard chemotherapy and seven non-pre-treated patients were treated in a non-randomized prospective phase II multicentric study. Their median age was 54 years (range 18-84) and 56 of them were male. Thirty-one had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 11 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), 1 prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL), 13 hairy-cell leukaemia (HCL), 2 mycosis fungoides (MF), 3 multiple myeloma, 7 acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML), 2 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), 6 chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in blast crisis, 2 Hodgkin's disease, 1 Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and 1 Langerhans histiocytosis. 2-CDA 0.1 mg/kg/day was given as a continuous intravenous infusion for 7 days and recycled every 4 weeks. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-two courses of 2-CDA were administered to 80 patients, 76 of whom were evaluable for response. A) Toxicity: Myelosuppression: Neutropenia to over 50% of initial value occurred in 46% of patients, thrombocytopenia in 8%, and lymphopenia < 0.5 x 10(9)/l was seen in 41%. Infections occurred in 34/80 patients (43%). The risk of severe infections (WHO grades 3-4) correlated with increasing number of years after first diagnosis (p = 0.01) and low lymphocyte counts on days 1 and/or 14 (p = 0.04); 21 infections were opportunistic. B) Response: 70% patients with lymphoproliferative disorders of low malignancy attained complete or partial response (low-grade NHL 12/16, CLL + PLL 9/12, HCL 13/13, MF 2/2, myeloma 0/3); in patients with AML, ALL, CML in myeloid (n = 4) or lymphoid (n = 2) blast crisis and high-grade lymphoma responses were seen in only 11%. Response was inversely related to the number of pretreatments (p = 0.045). In responding NHL patients the mean lymphocyte count on day 14 of cycle 1 was significantly lower (median 0.6 x 10(9)/l) than that of non-responders (1.2 x 10(9)/l, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: 2-CDA had a high activity even in heavily pretreated and refractory patients with low-grade lymphoproliferative disorders. In contrast to previously published studies, infections, mainly opportunistic, were a serious side effect in our study. In patients with severe lymphopenia at therapy initiation, the value of prophylactic anti-infective treatment should be studied.","['Betticher, D C', 'Fey, M F', 'von Rohr, A', 'Tobler, A', 'Jenzer, H', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Lohri, A', 'Pugin, P', 'Hess, U', 'Pagani, O']","['Betticher DC', 'Fey MF', 'von Rohr A', 'Tobler A', 'Jenzer H', 'Gratwohl A', 'Lohri A', 'Pugin P', 'Hess U', 'Pagani O', 'et al.']","['Institute of Medical Oncology, University of Berne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,['47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)'],IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/chemically induced', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cladribine/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Opportunistic Infections/*etiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a058693 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)62928-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1994 Jan;5(1):57-64. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a058693.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dexamethasone potentiated the immunophenotypic and functional parameters associated with the granulocytic differentiation induced by RA, including changes in CD11b and CD71 expression, inhibition of cell proliferation, enhancement of secretory and oxidative responses and increase of the phospholipase C (PLC), phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and phospholipase D (PLD) activities. However, dexamethasone had selective effects on several parameters of DMSO-induced cell differentiation. Dexamethasone inhibited the DMSO-induced increase of CD11b cell surface expression as well as the oxidative response and PLD activation triggered by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Nevertheless, dexamethasone potentiated the receptor-mediated PLC activation and the receptor-mediated secretory and oxidative responses in DMSO-treated cells. Unlike RA-treated HL-60 cells, the DMSO-treated cells contained high values of activatable PLA2 activity which were not affected by dexamethasone. Thus dexamethasone affected differently functional parameters and effector systems of granulocytic HL-60 cells, depending on the differentiation agent used. Dexamethasone by itself did not induce HL-60 cell differentiation, but enhanced the receptor- and non-receptor-mediated secretory responses and induced the appearance of stimulated PLA2 activity in undifferentiated HL-60 cells. These data provide evidence for the selective modulation of functional responses by dexamethasone through alterations in signalling processes.","['Collado-Escobar, D', 'Mollinedo, F']","['Collado-Escobar D', 'Mollinedo F']","['Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, C.S.I.C., Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (CD71 antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis', 'CD11 Antigens', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Phospholipase D/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism']",PMC1138307,1994/04/15 00:00,1994/04/15 00:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2990553 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1994 Apr 15;299 ( Pt 2):553-9. doi: 10.1042/bj2990553.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This MDR phenotype is commonly associated with the high expression of levels of 170 kDa P-glycoprotein, encoded by MDR genes. In the present study, the uptake kinetics of polyamines and their biosynthesis were studied in wild and multidrug resistant (MDR) K 562 cells in culture. The rate (Vmax) of polyamine uptake was significantly lower in MDR cells than that in wild type cells, whereas the Km for the uptake was not significantly different in these cells, suggesting that polyamine transporter is not modified in MDR cells, though their different physiological state influences the uptake process. In a 32 h chase, the transported radioactive polyamines were gradually interconverted. [14C]putrescine was converted into [14C]spermidine following between 15 min and 32 h of culture, and into [14C]-spermine after 16 h of culture, in both the cell types; however, the levels of interconverted radioactive polyamines were always lower in MDR cells as compared with wild type cells. Similarly, internalized [14C]spermidine was converted into [14C]spermine, but not into [14C]putrescine in both the cells types. [14C]spermidine is metabolized into [14C]spermine after 4 h of culture in wild type cells, whereas in MDR cells the interconversion of [14C]spermidine into [14C]spermine is seen only after 16 h of culture. Blocking of the transmembrane drug efflux pump, expressed in the MDR cells, by preincubation in the presence of verapamil, did not influence the uptake of either of the two polyamines (putrescine and spermidine) by MDR cells.

The appearance of cell populations, resistant to multidrug-based chemotherapy, constitutes the major problem to achieve cures in these patients. Advances in cell biology have partly contributed to the elucidation of different multidrug resistance (MDR) mechanisms, which enable cells to survive the cytotoxic effects of multiple chemotherapeutic agents. Of these resistance mechanisms, the one that is referred to as classical MDR is the most extensively studied, both in the laboratory as well as in patients, and here we will focus on its clinical relevance in haematological malignancies. The classical MDR phenotype is caused by enhanced cellular drug efflux due to increased activity of a membrane-bound glycoprotein (P-glycoprotein) drug pump, that can pump out anthracyclines, anthracenediones, vinca alkaloids and epipodophyllotoxins, thereby actively lowering the intracellular drug concentrations to sublethal levels. As soon as molecular probes for the detection of MDR cells became available, clinical studies were initiated to answer three main questions. Do human tumor cells express P-glycoprotein? If so, is the expression indicative of a bad prognosis, c.q. resistant disease? And last but not least, can we interfere with the P-glycoprotein drug pump in the patient? Clinical data indicate that classical MDR may be involved in the development of drug resistance, especially in some haematological malignancies, such as acute myelocytic leukaemia (AML), non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), and multiple myelomas (MM). In almost all types of haematological malignancies, either untreated or treated, elevated P-glycoprotein levels have been reported, ranging from low to high. However, the acquisition of clinical MDR associated with P-glycoprotein expression occurs only in those diseases (for example, AML and MM) that are heavily treated with MDR-related drugs, probably by selection of pre-existing P-glycoprotein-expressing malignant cells. Since P-glycoprotein is found to be expressed on the membrane of normal haemopoietic progenitor cells as well, it seems likely that P-glycoprotein-positive haematological tumours develop by malignant transformation of P-glycoprotein-expressing normal haemopoietic counterparts. Especially for AML, convincing data have been reported in the literature to show that P-glycoprotein expression at diagnosis is a bad prognostic factor that predicts refractoriness. Using in vitro model systems for classical MDR, a large number of agents have been identified that can circumvent P-glycoprotein-mediated drug resistance, the so-called resistance modifying agents (RMA).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Nooter, K', 'Sonneveld, P']","['Nooter K', 'Sonneveld P']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Rotterdam Cancer Institute, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Drug Resistance', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Prognosis']",,1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(94)90025-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1994 Apr;18(4):233-43. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)90025-6.,['MDR'],,90,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, cultured AML, ALL, and CLL cells grown with and without 12-0-tetra-decanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) were tested for IL-2R (CD25) expression by indirect immunofluorescence. Supernatants of these cultures were also tested for sIL-2R by ELISA. Elevated sIL-2R levels were found in HCL patients at initial diagnosis and relapse, in AMMoL, in AML, in the accelerated and non-accelerated phases of B-CLL, in PLL, in non-T/non-B ALL, in B-ALL in mixed lineage ALL, in T-CLL, in T-ALL, and in active MF. Reduced levels of sIL-2R were encountered in HCL patients in remission, in pre-T-ALL, and in MF patients in remission. Also, in non-accelerated CLL sIL-2R levels were less elevated than in later stages of the disease. In T-CLL, sIL-2R was only slightly elevated. Thus, we believe sIL-2R could prove to be a useful marker of disease stage, subtype, and prognosis in several hematologic malignancies. The cultures with and without TPA suggested that the undetermined source of sIL-2R in HCL, ALL and AML could indeed be the malignant cells but perhaps not so in the case of B-CLL. Plasma sCD8 was found to be below normal control levels in HCL, and lowest in relapsing cases. In addition, sCD8 levels were below normal in pre-T-ALL, and in MF. Levels in the non-accelerated phase of B-CLL approximated those of controls. Elevated levels of sCD8 were observed in AML, AMMoL, accelerated stage B-CLL, PLL, non-T/non-B ALL, B-ALL, mixed lineage ALL, T-ALL, T-CLL, and ATL. Thus, in a few instances, sCD8 may also correlate with disease subtype, as well as stage. Although sICAM-1 levels were elevated in all leukemias, its levels in CLL did not appear to be related to disease activity. Whether this is true or not for other leukemias would require additional work on sICAM-1 levels and its relationship to disease activity and prognosis.","['Srivastava, M D', 'Srivastava, A', 'Srivastava, B I']","['Srivastava MD', 'Srivastava A', 'Srivastava BI']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/*blood', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'CD8 Antigens/*blood', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*blood', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/blood', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/blood', 'Mycosis Fungoides/*blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*analysis/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Recurrence', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199409059595 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Jan;12(3-4):241-51. doi: 10.3109/10428199409059595.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The influence of the Mhc on malignant development in these models is to shorten the latency after virus inoculation. Here, we present evidence that a similar phenomenon results in early-onset of human leukemia. A molecular analysis of the MHC in 112 CML patients showed that those who developed the disease when aged less than 35 years (early-onset group) had higher homozygosity rates for the DOA1, HSP70 and C4 alleles of the DR53 group of ancestral haplotypes, for a subtype of HLA-A3, and a higher allele frequency of BfFb compared to the late-onset group. The oldest patient (n = 13) homozygous for DR53 was 52-years-old (p = 0.004), and all HLA-A3 homozygous patients (n = 4) were in the early-onset group (p = 0.01). The relative risk for early-onset CML yielded by HLA-A3 homozygosity was 17.6. The well-known serological HLA-Cw4 association was not confirmed at the DNA level and thought to be due to linkage disequilibrium with BfFb. The factor B association was sex-limited. The DR52 group haplotypes appeared to be protective. The HLA-identical sibling frequency was increased only in the early-onset group (p < 0.01). Our findings agree with the concept of an MHC influence on the development of malignancies. The similarity in the location of the susceptibility loci and the serological cross-reaction between H-2Ek and DR53 raise the possibility that the mouse and human MHC share the same leukemia susceptibility genes.","['Dorak, M T', 'Chalmers, E A', 'Gaffney, D', 'Wilson, D W', 'Galbraith, I', 'Henderson, N', 'Worwood, M', 'Mills, K I', 'Burnett, A K']","['Dorak MT', 'Chalmers EA', 'Gaffney D', 'Wilson DW', 'Galbraith I', 'Henderson N', 'Worwood M', 'Mills KI', 'Burnett AK']","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-D Antigens)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Susceptibility/immunology', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'H-2 Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-A Antigens/genetics', 'HLA-B Antigens/genetics', 'HLA-D Antigens/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/immunology', '*Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/genetics/immunology', 'Nuclear Family', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199409059592 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Jan;12(3-4):211-22. doi: 10.3109/10428199409059592.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The difficulty in dissociating GVHD-promoting from graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects of alloreactive donor T cells currently prevents clinical bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from fulfilling its full potential. To test the capacity of IL-2 treatment to promote such a dissociation, we have developed a new murine transplantable acute myelogenous leukemia model using a class II major histocompatibility complex-positive BALB/c Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced promonocytic leukemia, 2B-4-2. BALB/c mice receiving 2.5 x 10(5) 2B-4-2 cells intravenously 1 week before irradiation and syngeneic BMT died from leukemia within 2 to 4 weeks after BMT. Administration of syngeneic spleen cells and/or a 2.5-day course of IL-2 treatment alone did not inhibit leukemic mortality. In contrast, administration of non-T-cell-depleted fully allogeneic B10 (H-2b) spleen cells and T-cell-depleted B10 marrow led to a significant delay in leukemic mortality in IL-2-treated mice. In these animals GVHD was inhibited by IL-2 treatment. GVL effects were mediated entirely by donor CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Remarkably, IL-2 administration did not diminish the magnitude of the GVL effect of either T-cell subset. This was surprising, because CD4-mediated GVHD was inhibited in the same animals in which CD4-mediated GVL effects were not reduced by IL-2 treatment. These results suggest a novel mechanism by which GVHD and GVL effects of a single unprimed alloreactive T-cell subset can be dissociated; different CD4 activities promote GVHD and GVL effects, and the former, but not the latter activities are inhibited by treatment with IL-2.","['Sykes, M', 'Harty, M W', 'Szot, G L', 'Pearson, D A']","['Sykes M', 'Harty MW', 'Szot GL', 'Pearson DA']","['Transplantation Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston 02129.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8 Antigens/*immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*immunology/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation Chimera']",,1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)70032-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 May 1;83(9):2560-9.,,['R01CA55290/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We detected the expansion of an unusual T-cell subpopulation expressing lower CD4 or CD8 levels (CD4lo, CD8lo) than classic T cells (CD4hi, CD8hi). This subpopulation also expressed low levels of the CD3/TCR alpha/beta complex and was CD19-CD13-CD14-. A phenotypic analysis probing the activation level of CD4lo, CD8lo, CD4hi, and CD8hi cells showed that they comprised increased counts of HLA-DR+, CD11b+, CD45R0+, and CD45RA+ cells. Subset expansion ranged from 2.1- to 13.6-fold. Statistical analysis showed that the size of some of these subsets was correlated to intrinsic features of the tumor. First, CD4loHLA-DR+ cell counts were higher in patients with stage A than those with stages B and C disease. Second, CD8loHLA-DR+ cell counts were higher in patients in stable remission than in those at diagnosis. Third, CD4loHLA-DR+, CD4loCD45R0+, CD4loCD45RA+, and CD4hiCD11b+ cell counts were higher in patients whose tumor cells expressed high levels of surface immunoglobulin (sIg) than in those expressing low levels. The involvement of CD4lo and CD8lo cells in most of these correlations suggests that they may be tumor-reactive cells. Similar cells described in human and murine autoimmune disease have been shown to be autoreactive anergic cells, which may derive from nonclassic pathways of T-cell development.","['Dianzani, U', 'Omede, P', 'Marmont, F', 'DiFranco, D', 'Fusaro, A', 'Bragardo, M', 'Redoglia, V', 'Giaretta, F', 'Mairone, L', 'Boccadoro, M']","['Dianzani U', 'Omede P', 'Marmont F', 'DiFranco D', 'Fusaro A', 'Bragardo M', 'Redoglia V', 'Giaretta F', 'Mairone L', 'Boccadoro M', 'et al.']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche, Universita di Torino, Novara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'CD11 Antigens', 'CD4 Antigens/*analysis', 'CD8 Antigens/*analysis', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology']",,1994/04/15 00:00,1994/04/15 00:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73227-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Apr 15;83(8):2198-205.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of appropriate primers in a nested PCR allowed the detection of both viruses simultaneously. Viruses were differentiated by restriction fragment length analysis of amplified DNA fragments. Both BKV and JCV DNA were detected in the urine of an AIDS patient with progressive multifocal leukencephalopathy. In autopsy materials from this patient, JCV- but not BKV-DNA was found in brain and kidney tissue, whereas lung tissue was negative for both virus DNAs. To evaluate the methodology further, hybridization-positive urines from three recipients of bone marrow transplants and a positive urine of an acute myeloid leukemia patient were analyzed by this PCR method. One case was positive both for BKV and JCV, two cases were positive only for BKV, and one was negative for both. Parts of the control regions of JCV and BKV were sequenced directly from PCR-derived fragments. The JCV sequence from urine of the AIDS patient compared to sequences from a bone marrow transplant recipient and to archetypical reference strains showed two nucleotide (nt) exchanges out of 250 nt. The BKV sequences from the AML and the AIDS patients showed five nt exchanges out of 265 nt in the control region and were identified as BKV WW or WWT3 strains. In the agnogene region five exchanges were detected, two of them resulting in non-conservative amino acid exchanges. The possibility of testing clinical specimens of different origins by this PCR method is important for elucidating often unclear clinical courses in immunocompromised patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Schatzl, H M', 'Sieger, E', 'Jager, G', 'Nitschko, H', 'Bader, L', 'Ruckdeschel, G', 'Jager, G']","['Schatzl HM', 'Sieger E', 'Jager G', 'Nitschko H', 'Bader L', 'Ruckdeschel G', 'Jager G']","['Max von Pettenkofer Institute, University of Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications', 'Adult', 'BK Virus/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/urine', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'JC Virus/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal/complications', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Papillomavirus Infections/complications/*immunology/urine', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Virus Infections/complications/*immunology/urine']",,1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jmv.1890420208 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Virol. 1994 Feb;42(2):138-45. doi: 10.1002/jmv.1890420208.,,,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/S72998', 'GENBANK/S72999']",,,,

Morphologically defined apoptotic cells started to emerge at 10 h after irradiation and the frequency reached a peak at around 48 h being similar to the frequency of other abnormal cells, i.e. micronucleated, multinucleated and giant cells. Necrotic cells were rarely seen. The frequency of apoptosis and other abnormal cells depended on the radiation dose. The typical DNA ladder pattern for apoptosis was observed in the agarose gel electrophoretic analysis of the cells at 24-96 h postirradiation. A decline in the frequency of apoptotic cells occurred with longer incubation, which was associated with a sharp increase in cloning efficiency. Changes in the growth rate of the irradiated cell population during the postirradiation period could be reasonably well described by a simple model using the frequencies of apoptosis and other abnormal cells. The results suggest that apoptosis is the ultimate form of cell death via mitotic failure caused by relatively small doses of radiation in L5178Y cells.","['Tauchi, H', 'Sawada, S']","['Tauchi H', 'Sawada S']","['Department of Radiation Biology, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells/radiation effects', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Cell Cycle/radiation effects', 'Cell Death/physiology/radiation effects', 'Cell Division/radiation effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/radiation effects', 'Leukemia L5178/*pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitosis/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/radiation effects']",,1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['MJVFH2WCD8R0W8DG [pii]', '10.1080/09553009414550521 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 1994 Apr;65(4):449-55. doi: 10.1080/09553009414550521.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

K562/TPA was found to be a non-P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug-resistant cell line, in which intracellular drug accumulation was not reduced. In K562/TPA, adriamycin (ADM) was distributed mainly in the cytoplasm and was scarcely observed in the nucleus. We determined the relative levels of multidrug-resistance-associated protein (MRP), which was recently identified as the novel transporter. The relative levels of MRP in K562/TPA were the same as in K562. Although the catalytic activity of K562/TPA topoisomerase II was about half that of the parental cells, resistance to other drugs could not be explained by topoisomerase-II activity. To elucidate the mechanism of drug resistance in K562/TPA, we tried to find chemicals that would reverse the drug resistance. Tyrosine-kinase inhibitors enhanced the cytotoxicity of anti-neoplastic drugs against K562/TPA. Therefore we examined the modification of nuclear ADM accumulation in K562/TPA by one of these tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, genistein. Although the amount of ADM was decreased in the nuclei of K562/TPA cells, it was significantly increased after incubation in the presence of genistein. The formation of DNA single-strand breaks by ADM, etoposide, and ACNU was significantly lower in K562/TPA than in K562, but was significantly increased in the presence of genistein. These results suggest that genistein could overcome drug resistance by enhancing the accumulation of drug into the nuclear fraction of K562/TPA.","['Takeda, Y', 'Nishio, K', 'Niitani, H', 'Saijo, N']","['Takeda Y', 'Nishio K', 'Niitani H', 'Saijo N']","['Pharmacology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/physiology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Genistein', 'Humans', 'Isoflavones/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/04/15 00:00,1994/04/15 00:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910570217 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1994 Apr 15;57(2):229-39. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910570217.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These resistance cell lines originated from human or rodent have been characterized by increased expression of MDR (Multidrug-resistance) gene and P-glycoprotein which plays as efflux pump of drugs from cells. These multidrug-resistance sublines also have been reported increased activities of protein kinases and glutathione S-transferase-pi. Although there have been extensive biophysical and biochemical characterization of the differences between parental lines and MDR tumor cell sublines, morphologic observations have been limited. In this study, filamentous cytoskeletons which involve many biological phenomena such as maintenance of cell morphology, mitosis, cellular movement, transport, and adhesion, were observed by confocal laser microscopy. To compare the expression of each cytoskeletons, fluorescent intensities of cells stained for each cytoskeletons were measured by confocal laser microscopic system. Utilizing this methodology, higher microtubular expression was observed in HL-60/ADR and K562/ADR than in their parental lines, but no significant differences of actin and vimentin were observed. Phosphorylation by protein kinases has been established as a key factor in the regulation of cytoskeletal function. But little is known about the role of protein phosphorylation in cytoskeletal function. Since increased activities of PKC and PTK were detected in HL-60/ADR, the effect of PKC inhibitor, staurosporine (STR), or PTK inhibitor, genistein (GNS), on cell growth was detected. STR and GNS reduced the resistance to Adriamycin in HL-60/ADR. Furthermore, STR and GNS disrupted the filamentous structure of microtubules in HL-60/ADR, and suppressed the expression of microtubules to 37%, and 49%, respectively. In contrast, PKC activator, phorbol ester (TPA), caused stronger microtubular assembling in HL-60/ADR, and increased the expression of microtubules to 134%. Resulting from this study, it is likely that acquired MDR of HL-60 and K562 was associated with increased expression of microtubules, and microtubular assembling or disassembling was considered to be regulated in part by PKC and PTK.","['Kawamura, K']",['Kawamura K'],"['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi,[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science,17410290R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cytoskeleton/*physiology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi. 1994 Mar;69(2):354-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cremophor EL was shown to reverse multidrug resistant phenotypes of various cell lines as well as to reverse cross-resistance to paclitaxel of a multidrug resistant cell line in vitro. Thus, a study was carried out to determine the modifying activity of Cremophor EL on the antitumor activity of paclitaxel against P388 leukemia, adriamycin-resistant subline (P388/ADM) and vincristine-resistant subline (P388/VCR) in vivo. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as a counterpart solvent. The results showed that, although no significant antitumor activity was observed by paclitaxel in both solvents against P388/ADM, a significantly higher antitumor activity was induced by paclitaxel dissolved in Cremophor EL-based solvent compared with DMSO-based solvent against P388/VCR. However, more significant difference in the antitumor activity of paclitaxel against P388 parental line was observed between two solvents and both resistant sublines showed an obvious cross-resistance to paclitaxel. Therefore, it appeared that cross-resistance reversing activity of Cremophor EL is not so high as to be detectable at in vivo level.","['Fujimoto, S']",['Fujimoto S'],"['Division of Chemotherapy, Chiba Cancer Center Research Institute.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

In the seronegatives, gag related sequences were detected in some tumors, whereas LTR related sequences were detected in only uterus carcinoma and tax related sequences in none of tumors examined. These sequences were detected in tumor cells as well as lymphoid cells by in situ hybridization. Some of these sequences were also detected in cultured fibroblasts derived from ATL patients. Cultured normal human lymphocytes grew continuously in conditioned media following HTLV-I infection, and transformed on exposure to carcinogens. Chromosome changes in transformed cells appeared clustering to chromosomes abnormalized on HTLV-I infection. The frequency of abnormal chromosomes in lymphocytes was significantly higher in the seropositives and in their family members than in seronegative normal donors. The frequency increased with advancement of host age in the seropositives but not in the seronegatives.

The molecular correlate of the t(4;11) has been identified as a fusion transcript of HRX, a gene on 11q23 with homology to drosophila trithorax gene, and FEL, a serine-proline-rich gene on 4q21 of unknown function. The aim of the current study was to establish a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach for the rapid and sensitive detection of the HRX-FEL fusion transcript associated with the t(4;11). For this purpose, two groups of patients were studied: group A comprised cases with cytogenetically proven t(4;11) including three infant and four adult pre-pre-B-ALL, as well as the two cell lines RS4;11 and MV4;11. Group B consisted of ten adult pre-pre-B-ALL with the identical phenotype, but without cytogenetic confirmation of t(4;11). Using primers complementary to HRX and FEL cDNA sequences 300 to 500 bp 5' and 3' of published breakpoints, respectively, specific amplification products were obtained in all nine cases of group A and in nine of the ten cases of group B. Three different types of fusion transcripts were identified by sequence analysis with HRX breakpoints at nucleotides 4086 and 4218 and FEL breakpoints at nucleotides 1413, 1416, and 1458. These data indicate that RT-PCR allows the detection of HRX-FEL fusion transcripts in the vast majority of cytogenetically proven and immunophenotypically suspected t(4;11) ALL.

These data suggest that in these in vitro models, combinations of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists and phosphodiesterase inhibitors can increase intracellular cAMP and affect gene activation.","['Kotecha, S', 'Wilson, L', 'Sutcliffe, S', 'Wangoo, A', 'Shaw, R J']","['Kotecha S', 'Wilson L', 'Sutcliffe S', 'Wangoo A', 'Shaw RJ']","[""St Mary's Hospital Medical School, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Pulm Pharmacol,Pulmonary pharmacology,9007551,"['0 (Adrenergic beta-Agonists)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '27Y3KJK423 (Aminophylline)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'L628TT009W (Isoproterenol)']",IM,,"['Adrenergic beta-Agonists/pharmacology', 'Aminophylline/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genes, fos/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Histiocytes/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Isoproterenol/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0952-0600(83)71036-7 [pii]', '10.1006/pulp.1993.1036 [doi]']",ppublish,Pulm Pharmacol. 1993 Dec;6(4):269-77. doi: 10.1006/pulp.1993.1036.,['c-fos'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was undertaken to determine the inhibitory effect of polyanionic compounds, dextran sulfate and heparin, on HTLV-I-induced syncytium formation, as demonstrated by the fusion of HTLV-I-infected cells with target cells. These two compounds almost completely blocked syncytium formation in the early phase of the reaction at a concentration of 125 micrograms/ml, but dextran, as a control, did not inhibit it at concentrations up to 625 micrograms/ml. 50% inhibition of syncytium formation was detected at a concentration of 2 micrograms/ml of dextran sulfate 5000, 3 micrograms/ml of dextran sulfate 8000 and 8 micrograms/ml of heparin. The binding of radiolabeled HTLV-I-infected cells (HCT-1) to the target cells was inhibited by addition of dextran sulfate and heparin, and the inhibitory effects were concentration-dependent. No marked changes were detected in the expression of adhesion molecules on the virus-infected cells and target cells, and in the expression of envelope proteins on the virus-infected cells after exposing them to the polyanionic compounds. These results suggest that the blocking of cell-to-cell contact by polyanionic compounds, probably independent of surface adhesion molecules, is important for their inhibitory effect on HTLV-I-induced syncytium formation.","['Ida, H', 'Kurata, A', 'Eguchi, K', 'Yamashita, I', 'Nakashima, M', 'Sakai, M', 'Kawabe, Y', 'Nakamura, T', 'Nagataki, S']","['Ida H', 'Kurata A', 'Eguchi K', 'Yamashita I', 'Nakashima M', 'Sakai M', 'Kawabe Y', 'Nakamura T', 'Nagataki S']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Antiviral Res,Antiviral research,8109699,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '4C905MSK4W (Hexadimethrine Bromide)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', '9042-14-2 (Dextran Sulfate)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis', 'Cell Communication/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Fusion/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Dextran Sulfate/*pharmacology', 'Gene Products, env/analysis', 'Gene Products, gag/analysis', 'Giant Cells/*drug effects', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/blood', 'HTLV-I Antigens/analysis', 'Heparin/*pharmacology', 'Hexadimethrine Bromide/pharmacology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0166-3542(94)90041-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0166-3542(94)90041-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Antiviral Res. 1994 Feb;23(2):143-59. doi: 10.1016/0166-3542(94)90041-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: English-language medical literature review of more than 70 articles. DATA SYNTHESIS: 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine is unique compared with traditional antimetabolite drugs in that it is equally active against dividing and resting lymphocytes, which may be especially important in indolent lymphoid malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, because most cells in these disorders are in the resting phase. In patients with alkylator-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia who were treated with 2-CdA, 44% achieved a response (4% complete responses, 40% partial responses), and 54%, scored as nonresponders, had a sustained reduction in their peripheral lymphocytosis. Patients with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia had an 85% response rate (25% complete responses, 60% partial responses). Patients with previously treated low-grade lymphoma achieved an overall response rate of 43%. The most striking clinical effects of this drug have been seen in hairy cell leukemia, in which a single course of therapy induces complete remissions in 85% of partial remissions in 12%. Activity has also been shown in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and the myeloid leukemias. CONCLUSIONS: 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine is a newer purine analog with potent activity in the treatment of indolent lymphoproliferative diseases and illustrates the model for rational drug development.","['Saven, A', 'Piro, L D']","['Saven A', 'Piro LD']","['Ida M. and Cecil H.

The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) conducted a randomized adjuvant-chemotherapy trial (CALGB 8541) comparing three doses (high, moderate, and low) of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil in 1572 women with node-positive breast cancer. This study (CALGB 8869) was designed to determine whether the DNA index, the S-phase fraction, c-erbB-2 expression, or p53 accumulation could be used as a marker to identify a subgroup of patients more likely than others to benefit from high doses of chemotherapy. METHODS: Tissue blocks were obtained from 442 patients randomly selected from the larger CALGB trial. Paraffin sections from the primary lesions were analyzed for DNA content, S-phase fraction, c-erbB-2 expression, and p53 accumulation. RESULTS: Patients randomly assigned to the high-dose regimen of adjuvant chemotherapy had significantly longer disease-free and overall survival if their tumors had c-erbB-2 overexpression. No further information was gained by adding the data on S-phase fraction or p53 accumulation to the analysis. There was no clear evidence of a dose-response effect in patients with minimal or no c-erbB-2 expression. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant dose-response effect of adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil in patients with overexpression of c-erbB-2 but not in patients with no c-erbB-2 expression or minimal c-erbB-2 expression. Overexpression of c-erbB-2 may be a useful marker to identify the patients who are most likely to benefit from high doses of adjuvant chemotherapy.","['Muss, H B', 'Thor, A D', 'Berry, D A', 'Kute, T', 'Liu, E T', 'Koerner, F', 'Cirrincione, C T', 'Budman, D R', 'Wood, W C', 'Barcos, M']","['Muss HB', 'Thor AD', 'Berry DA', 'Kute T', 'Liu ET', 'Koerner F', 'Cirrincione CT', 'Budman DR', 'Wood WC', 'Barcos M', 'et al.']","['Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, N.C.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'CAF protocol']",IM,['N Engl J Med 1994 Jul 21;331(3):211'],"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'ErbB Receptors/*analysis', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis', 'Receptor, ErbB-2', 'S Phase', 'Survival Analysis']",,1994/05/05 00:00,1994/05/05 00:01,['1994/05/05 00:00'],"['1994/05/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/05 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199405053301802 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1994 May 5;330(18):1260-6. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199405053301802.,,"['CA-03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-44768/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,['N Engl J Med. 1994 May 5;330(18):1308-9.

Phorbol diesters were observed to be potent stimulators of NKSF/IL-12 production from the B-cell lines. Although monocytes were found to be the major producers of NKSF/IL-12 in peripheral blood (PB) in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or to Staphylococcus aureus, several myeloid leukemia cell lines tested did not produce detectable NKSF/IL-12 either constitutively or upon stimulation with phorbol diesters. However, three lines, ML-3, HL-60, and THP-1, responded to LPS with significant levels of NKSF/IL-12 production, whereas S aureus was effective only on THP-1 cells. When the cell lines were preincubated with compounds known to induce them to differentiate, production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and IL-1 beta was in most cases maximal in cells with differentiated characteristics, whereas NKSF/IL-12 production in response to LPS in all three producing cell lines was significantly enhanced only by pretreatment with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) for 24 hours, or by costimulation with interferon gamma (IFN gamma). The efficiency of DMSO enhancement of NKSF/IL-12 production decreased after 2 to 5 days of incubation, when the cells acquired differentiated characteristics. Unlike DMSO, IFN gamma enhanced NKSF/IL-12 production, and IL-10 and dexamethasone inhibited it in cell lines and PB mononuclear cells stimulated by either LPS or S aureus. The ability of the cell lines to respond to these mediators of possibly physiologically relevant function provides a tissue-culture model for studying their mechanism of action.","['Kubin, M', 'Chow, J M', 'Trinchieri, G']","['Kubin M', 'Chow JM', 'Trinchieri G']","['Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-10/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-12', 'Interleukins/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis']",,1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73826-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Apr 1;83(7):1847-55.,,"['CA 10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 20833/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32898/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

STLV-I exhibited greater overall sequence variation between strains (1 to 18% compared with 0 to 9% for HTLV-I), supporting the simian origin of the modern viruses in all species. Three HTLV-I phylogenetic clusters or clades (cosmopolitan, Zaire, and Melanesia) were resolved with phenetic, parsimony, and likelihood analytical procedures. Seven phylogenetic clusters of STLV-I were resolved with the most primitive (deeply rooted) divergence involving several STLV-I strains from Asian primate species. Combined analysis of HTLV-I and STLV-I revealed that neither STLV-I clusters nor HTLV-I clusters recapitulated host species specificity; rather, multiple clades from the same species were closer to clades from other species than to each other. We interpret these evolutionary associations as support for the occurrence of multiple discrete interspecies transmissions of ancestral viruses between primate species (including human) that led to recognizable phylogenetic clades that persist in modern species. Geographic concordance of divergent host species that harbor closely related viruses reinforces that physical feasibility for hypothesized interspecies virus transmission in the past and in the present.","['Koralnik, I J', 'Boeri, E', 'Saxinger, W C', 'Monico, A L', 'Fullen, J', 'Gessain, A', 'Guo, H G', 'Gallo, R C', 'Markham, P', 'Kalyanaraman, V']","['Koralnik IJ', 'Boeri E', 'Saxinger WC', 'Monico AL', 'Fullen J', 'Gessain A', 'Guo HG', 'Gallo RC', 'Markham P', 'Kalyanaraman V', 'et al.']","['Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cercopithecidae', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/blood/*transmission', 'Genes, env/*genetics', 'Haplorhini/*microbiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*classification/genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pan troglodytes', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/*classification/genetics', 'Species Specificity']",PMC236747,1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.4.2693-2707.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Apr;68(4):2693-707. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.4.2693-2707.1994.,,,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/U03122', 'GENBANK/U03124', 'GENBANK/U03126', 'GENBANK/U03160']",,,,

We have determined aminopeptidase activity with 4-methyl-7-coumarylamide (NMec) derivatives of alanine, leucine, lysine and arginine in Jurkat cells (a human T-cell lymphoma line) and in HL60 cells (a CD-13-positive myeloid leukaemia line) and compared the activities with those of purified pig AP-N and human renal microvillar membranes. Jurkat cell aminopeptidase activity doubled on disrupting the cells and the sensitivity to amastatin increased. When the cells were fractionated only 4% of the activity was recovered in the membrane fraction, compared with 87% recovery for alkaline phosphatase. The profile of activities for intact Jurkat cells was Leu > Ala > Lys > Arg, changing in the cytosolic fraction to Lys > or = Arg > Leu = Ala; the profiles for intact HL60 cells and AP-N were identical, namely Ala > Leu > Arg > Lys. The Km values for the hydrolysis of Ala-NMec and Leu-NMec by Jurkat cells were 65 microM and 11 microM, in each case some 6-fold lower than those for AP-N. The pH-activity curves for the hydrolysis of Ala-NMec by Jurkat cells and human renal microvillar membranes were displaced by almost 1 pH unit and the activity was not sensitive to the anionic composition of the buffers. However, a 3-fold activation of the cytosolic activity by 0.1 M NaCl was observed with Arg-NMec as substrate. With Ala-NMec as substrate, the sensitivity of the aminopeptidase activity to inhibitors increased markedly after disrupting the cells, but still differed from that observed with purified pig AP-N; the concentrations giving 50% inhibition were as follows (values for AP-N in parentheses): amastatin. 28 nM (150 nM); bestatin, 12 microM (43 microM), probestin, 100 nM (< 10 nM), puromycin, 30 microM (> 1 mM). Anion exchange chromatography on Mono Q revealed two activities: that of peak I preferentially hydrolysed Arg-NMec, was activated by NaCl and was insensitive to amastatin; while that of peak II was strongly inhibited by amastatin and had a broad specificity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Murray, H', 'Turner, A J', 'Kenny, A J']","['Murray H', 'Turner AJ', 'Kenny AJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Leeds, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '58822-25-6 (Enkephalin, Leucine)', 'EC 3.4.11.- (Aminopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,,"['Amides/metabolism', 'Aminopeptidases/antagonists & inhibitors/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD13 Antigens', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Enkephalin, Leucine/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Kidney/enzymology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell', 'Swine', 'T-Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC1137947,1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2980353 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1994 Mar 1;298 ( Pt 2):353-60. doi: 10.1042/bj2980353.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These taxol-resistant myeloid leukemia cells may serve as in vitro experimental models for examinating strategies which may have potential applicability for overcoming taxol resistance.","['Bhalla, K', 'Huang, Y', 'Tang, C', 'Self, S', 'Ray, S', 'Mahoney, M E', 'Ponnathpur, V', 'Tourkina, E', 'Ibrado, A M', 'Bullock, G']","['Bhalla K', 'Huang Y', 'Tang C', 'Self S', 'Ray S', 'Mahoney ME', 'Ponnathpur V', 'Tourkina E', 'Ibrado AM', 'Bullock G', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/genetics', 'Microtubules/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",,1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Mar;8(3):465-75.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In adults, testicular relapses of ALL are very rare. A similar age-difference in the frequency of the testicular infiltration exists also in the rat T-cell leukaemia. In the present investigation, the effect of various hormonal treatments and unilateral cryptorchidism on the form of testicular infiltrates by the rat T-cell leukaemia was studied. Inhibition of testicular activity by estradiol treatment (E2) of early pubertal rats injected i.p. with rat T-leukaemic lymphoblasts significantly decreased the proportion of the testis occupied by leukaemic infiltrates. The proportion of the testis occupied by leukaemic infiltrates was significantly higher in the abdominal testes of both early and late pubertal unilaterally cryptorchid rats, than in the scrotal testes of leukaemic control rats. Daily treatment of early pubertal rats with human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), or human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG), did not have an effect on testicular leukaemic infiltration.

The panel of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) was selected to identify differentiation-associated antigens of both the myeloid and the lymphoid lineages (CD13, CD33, CD14, CD15, CD7, CD34, CD10, HLA-DR, CD19, CD2, CD5, TdT). The expression of multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (P-170) was also evaluated in 117 patients. Differences in antigenic expression was observed among the various French-American-British (FAB) subgroups. HLA-DR was poorly expressed on the blasts of acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3), and was always found in FAB M5. CD34 was detectable in all M0 cases and only in one M3 (p < 0.001). Lymphoid-associated antigens were positive in 74 cases (48.1%). In particular, CD7 was found in 49 patients (31.8%), and TdT in 30 (21.3%), 15 samples displaying coexpression of these two antigens. The incidence of CD7+ cases was particularly elevated in M0 and M5 AML (p = 0.005). It significantly correlated with the expression of CD34, HLA-DR, P-170 (p < 0.001, p = 0.018 and p = 0.034 respectively), and with a leukocyte count > 50 x 10(9)/l (p = 0.038). Sixty-nine (59%) samples demonstrated P-170 positivity. Again, this phenotype was particularly expressed in the poorly differentiated forms (M5, M0 and M1) and showed significant correlation with the immaturity markers CD34, CD7 and HLA-DR (p = 0.013, p = 0.022 and p = 0.001, respectively). Expression of individual antigens correlated with prognosis. Refractoriness to first line therapy was associated with CD7 expression (p = 0.002) and P-170 (p = 0.001). The CD7 marker was also significantly associated with a very low overall survival (p < 0.001) and continuous complete remission (p < 0.001). CD14 expression also significantly predicted lower survival rates (p = 0.033). The combination (CD7+ CD14+) identified a subset of patients with a particularly adverse outcome. The prognostic value of CD7 expression, alone or in combination with other markers, was confirmed in multivariate analysis.","['Del Poeta, G', 'Stasi, R', 'Venditti, A', 'Suppo, G', 'Aronica, G', 'Bruno, A', 'Masi, M', 'Tabilio, A', 'Papa, G']","['Del Poeta G', 'Stasi R', 'Venditti A', 'Suppo G', 'Aronica G', 'Bruno A', 'Masi M', 'Tabilio A', 'Papa G']","['Division of Hematology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Ospedale S.

Since clinical trials on the circumvention of multidrug resistance (MDR) with chemosensitizers report disparate results, we investigated whether tumor cells of the MDR phenotype can develop additional resistance to the cytostatic chemosensitizer combination. Thus, the Adriamycin(ADR)-selected, P-glycoprotein-positive MDR Friend leukemia cell line F4-6RADR was exposed to stepwise increased concentrations of CsA at a constant level of 0.05 microgram/ml ADR. The initial CsA concentration (plus 0.05 microgram/ml ADR) to inhibit cell growth of F4-6RADR cells by 50% (IC50) was 0.04 microgram/ml. By continuous incubation for more than 6 months, the IC50 for CsA (at constant ADR) was elevated to 3.6 micrograms/ml (90-fold), thus generating the variant F4-6RADR-CsA. The F4-6RADR-CsA cells were cross-resistant for cyclosporin H (CsH), a non-immunosuppressive derivative of CsA. As shown by immunocytochemistry as well as by the polymerase chain reaction and by Western blotting including densitometry, P-glycoprotein was preserved in the F4-6RADR-CsA variant and was expressed at a 4-fold higher level than in F4-6RADR cells. Sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis could detect no new proteins in F4-6RADR-CsA as compared to F4-6RADR. Interestingly, resistance of F4-6RADR-CsA cells remained reversible for the calcium antagonists verapamil and dihydropyridine B859-35 (dexniguldipine-HCl), indicating that CsA and these compounds interfere with the P glycoprotein function by different pharmacodynamic mechanisms. Transport studies with [14C]ADR, performed in the presence and absence of chemosensitizers, confirmed the good correlation of P-glycoprotein function with the pattern of resistance found in proliferation assays. Cellular accumulation of [3H]cyclosporin was reduced to 71% of that of the F4-6 controls in F4-6RADR-CsA cells, but remained at the level of controls in F4-6RADR cells. Results indicate that increased amounts of the P-glycoprotein--besides other, perhaps more important mechanisms that are as yet unknown--partially mediate CsA resistance in F4-6RADR-CsA cells. We have designated this new form of resistance ""secondary combined resistance"" (SCR). The results suggest that at least some clinical cases of insensitivity to chemosensitizers or of relapse after reversing therapy could be explained by SCR, and that resensitizing treatment of tumor patients should be based on the consideration of several chemosensitizers of different pharmacodynamics.","['Dietel, M', 'Herzig, I', 'Reymann, A', 'Brandt, I', 'Schaefer, B', 'Bunge, A', 'Heidebrecht, H J', 'Seidel, A']","['Dietel M', 'Herzig I', 'Reymann A', 'Brandt I', 'Schaefer B', 'Bunge A', 'Heidebrecht HJ', 'Seidel A']","['Institut of Pathology, Christian-Albrechts-Universitat zu Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis/physiology', 'Clone Cells', 'Cyclosporine/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance/*physiology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/physiology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/drug effects']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01236382 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1994;120(5):263-71. doi: 10.1007/BF01236382.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, human K562 cell mutants defective in GPI anchoring were derived by anti-decay-accelerating factor (CD55) based negative fluorescent cell sorting of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine pretreated cells. Homologous cell fusions of six clones that complemented a previously described K562 mutant corresponding to one of the Thy-1- mutant classes (Hirose, S., Mohney, R. P., Mutka, S. C., Ravi, L., Singleton, D. R., Perry, G., Tartakoff, A., and Medof, M. E. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 5272-5278) showed that they segregated into two complementation groups. In heterologous cell fusions, representative clones of each group complemented Thy-1 expression by all of the previously described GPI anchor pathway-defective Thy-1- murine lymphoma classes (A, B, C, E, F, and H) but not class(es) D (and I) defective in the Thy-1 structural gene. Analyses of putative GPI anchor precursors synthesized by the two lines revealed that one mutant exhibited a complete block in deacetylation of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-inositol phospholipid to glucosamine (GlcN)-inositol phospholipid, whereas the other mutant assembled GlcN-inositol phospholipid and subsequent mannose (Man)-containing intermediates but showed markedly increased amounts of the terminal ethanolamine (EthN)-phosphate (P)-substituted putative anchor precursors, EthN-P-6ManMan(EthN-P-->)ManGlcN- and EthN-P-6Man(EthN-P-6)Man(EthN- P-->)ManGlcN-acylinositol phospholipid (H7 and H8). We designate these new complementation classes J, harboring a defect in N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-inositol phospholipid deacetylation, and K, deficient in a step preliminary to or associated with protein transfer of assembled anchor precursors. The availability of these new mutant classes should aid in characterization of the GPI anchor pathway enzymes providing for these reactions.","['Mohney, R P', 'Knez, J J', 'Ravi, L', 'Sevlever, D', 'Rosenberry, T L', 'Hirose, S', 'Medof, M E']","['Mohney RP', 'Knez JJ', 'Ravi L', 'Sevlever D', 'Rosenberry TL', 'Hirose S', 'Medof ME']","['Institute of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)', '12H3O2UGSF (Methylnitronitrosoguanidine)', '528-04-1 (Uridine Diphosphate N-Acetylglucosamine)', 'V50K1D7P4Y (Uridine Diphosphate Glucose)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Methylnitronitrosoguanidine/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Phosphatidylinositols/biosynthesis', 'Thy-1 Antigens', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uridine Diphosphate Glucose/metabolism', 'Uridine Diphosphate N-Acetylglucosamine/metabolism']",,1994/03/04 00:00,1994/03/04 00:01,['1994/03/04 00:00'],"['1994/03/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/04 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)37405-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Mar 4;269(9):6536-42.,,"['AI23598/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01DK38181/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the basis of metabolic studies, the primary target of this drug's action appears to be IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH). Incubation of human myelogenous leukemia K562 cells with an IC50 concentration of benzamide riboside resulted in an expansion of IMP pools (5.9-fold), with a parallel reduction in the concentration of GMP (90%), GDP (63%), GTP (55%) and dGTP (40%). On kinetic grounds, it was deduced that benzamide riboside (whose Ki versus IMPDH is 6.4 mM, while that of its 5'-monophosphate is 3.9 mM) or its 5'-monophosphate were unlikely to be responsible for inhibition of this target enzyme, IMPDH, since only micromolar concentrations of benzamide riboside were needed to exert potent inhibition of tumor-cell growth. Studies on the metabolism of this C-nucleoside have revealed the presence of a new peak eluting in the nucleoside diphosphate area on HPLC. Treatment of this peak with venom phosphodiesterase degraded it and concurrently nullified its inhibitory activity versus IMPDH; alkaline phosphatase, on the other hand, totally failed to digest the anabolite. These results suggest that the metabolite in question is the phosphodiester, benzamide adenine dinucleotide (BAD). Evidence that the inhibitor was an analog of NAD, wherein the nicotinamide moiety has been replaced by benzamide, was provided by both NMR and mass spectrometric analysis and confirmed by enzymatic synthesis. Further insight into the nature of the active principle was obtained from kinetic studies, which established that BAD competitively inhibited NAD utilization by partially purified IMPDH from K562 cells with a Ki of 0.118 microM. In concert, these studies establish that benzamide riboside exhibits potent antiproliferative activity by inhibiting IMPDH through BAD.","['Gharehbaghi, K', 'Paull, K D', 'Kelley, J A', 'Barchi, J J Jr', 'Marquez, V E', 'Cooney, D A', 'Monks, A', 'Scudiero, D', 'Krohn, K', 'Jayaram, H N']","['Gharehbaghi K', 'Paull KD', 'Kelley JA', 'Barchi JJ Jr', 'Marquez VE', 'Cooney DA', 'Monks A', 'Scudiero D', 'Krohn K', 'Jayaram HN']","['Laboratory for Experimental Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5200.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '138385-29-2 (3-(1-deoxyribofuranosyl)benzamide)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)']",IM,,"['Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Guanosine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Nucleosides/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Ribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/03/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/03/15 00:00'],"['1994/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910560623 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1994 Mar 15;56(6):892-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910560623.,,"['NCI CA 51770/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NCI NO1CO-23910/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, expression of this activity in mesodermal cell lineages is demonstrated. First, expression of the mesodermal marker Brachyury correlates with expression of Pax-3-inducing activity. Second, the ability of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to block mesoderm differentiation at two different points is demonstrated and correlated with the inhibition of Pax-3-inducing activity. Finally, two mesodermal cell lines that express Pax-3-inducing activity were derived from P19 EC cells. Each of these lines expresses high levels of the mesodermal marker Brachyury and high levels of Oct-3/4 (which is down-regulated at early times during mesoderm differentiation) suggesting that these lines are early mesodermal derivatives. Unlike EC or embryonic stem cell lines, each of the two mesodermal derivatives autoinduces Hox gene expression on aggregation even in the presence of LIF. Following aggregation, anterior-specific genes are expressed more rapidly than more posterior genes. These observations directly demonstrate the ability of murine mesodermal derivatives to autoinduce Hox gene expression in the absence of signals from other cell lineages. Similar to the Pax-3-inducing activity, signals from mesodermal cell lines were sufficient to induce HOX expression in adjacent P19 stem cells in cell mixing assays. These observations are consistent with the previous suggestion (Blum, M., Gaunt, S. J., Cho, K. W. Y., Steinbeisser, H., Blumberg, B., Bittner, D. and De Robertis, E. M.

We have studied the pharmacokinetics of this drug in 25 pediatric patients with acute leukemia treated with cladribine as a single agent, 8.9 mg/m2/24 h, for 5 days by continuous i.v. infusion. Twelve patients were in relapse, and acute myeloid leukemia was newly diagnosed in 13 patients. Plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid cladribine concentrations were determined by a radioimmunoassay with a limit of detection of 1 nM. An open two-compartment model was fit to the plasma concentration data. The mean (SD) clearance was 39.4 (12.4) liters/h/m2 and ranged from 14.4-55.4 liters/h/m2. When clearance was normalized to body weight (liters/h/kg) it was negatively correlated with age, with older patients having slower clearances per unit of body weight. However, when clearance was normalized to body surface area, no significant correlation with age was observed. The mean (SD) steady-state plasma concentration (predicted 120-h concentration) was 37.7 (17.3) nM and ranged from 23.2-84.5 nM. The terminal phase half-life in 22 patients ranged from 14.3-25.8 h, with a mean (SD) of 19.7 (3.4) h. The volume of distribution at steady state was highly variable, with a mean (SD) of 356.6 (225.2) liters/m2. None of these parameters was significantly different between patients in relapse and patients with newly diagnosed disease. Renal clearance was determined in 7 patients and ranged from 34.6-643.6 ml/min/m2, with a mean (SD) of 317.9 (208.7) ml/min/m2. Renal clearance as a percentage of total systemic clearance ranged from 11.0-85.1%, with a mean of 51.0%. In 11 patients, the mean (SD) cerebrospinal fluid concentration was 6.1 (3.97) nM, a mean of 18.2% of the steady-state plasma concentration. The CSF:plasma concentration ratio was significantly higher on day 5 (22.7% in 7 patients) than on day 4 (7.6% in 3 patients; P = 0.03). Additional studies are needed to further define the metabolic fate of cladribine.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: CT was performed on 43 consecutive patients with HCL before and 3 months after a single cycle of 2-CdA. Twenty-four patients were previously diagnosed and 19 were newly diagnosed. Adenopathy was considered bulky if the greatest dimension of any confluent mass was between 5 and 10 cm and massive if greater than 10 cm. RESULTS: Internal adenopathy was present in six of 43 patients (14%). Three of the six patients had massive abdominal adenopathy and one had bulky abdominal adenopathy. All six patients with adenopathy were previously diagnosed, while none of the 19 newly diagnosed patients had internal adenopathy. In those patients previously diagnosed, the six with adenopathy had a median disease duration of 68 months, while the 18 patients without adenopathy had a median disease duration of 24 months (P = .01). Adenopathy was more common in splenectomized patients. In previously diagnosed patients, adenopathy occurred in five of 10 (50%) splenectomized patients and one of 14 (7%) nonsplenectomized patients (P = .05). However, the 10 splenectomized patients had a median disease duration of 56 months, while the 14 nonsplenectomized patients had a median disease duration of 16 months (P = .004). All six patients had significant reduction in adenopathy 3 months after 2-CdA and were without residual HCL in the bone marrow. CONCLUSION: Significant internal adenopathy in patients with HCL is more frequent than previously recognized. Adenopathy is rare at diagnosis and appears to be related to disease duration. As patients treated with 2-CdA have long disease-free survival durations, detection of significant adenopathy by CT scan may be important; however, routine CT scans are not recommended at the time of diagnosis.","['Hakimian, D', 'Tallman, M S', 'Hogan, D K', 'Rademaker, A W', 'Rose, E', 'Nemcek, A A Jr']","['Hakimian D', 'Tallman MS', 'Hogan DK', 'Rademaker AW', 'Rose E', 'Nemcek AA Jr']","['Department of Medicine, Robert H.

For this purpose, an elaborate double-immunostaining technique was applied. This included a monoclonal antibody (PC10) that is directed against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), followed by an antibody against glycophorin C (Ret40f), to identify all nucleated erythroid precursor cells. Additionally, morphometric data were derived from immunostaining of megakaryocytes (CD61) and macrophages (PG-M1), including its hemosiderin-laden subpopulation. Finally the determination of argyrophilic (reticulin) fiber density was carried out. In comparison with a control group (15 patients) without any hematologic disorder, in CML patients morphometric evaluation showed a significant reduction in the number of erythroblasts and normoblasts. This feature was associated with a PCNA-labeling index within the normal range and a decreased stainable marrow iron (number of hemosiderin-storaging macrophages). Several parameters were established to exert a predictive value on survival. A worsening of prognosis was associated with a decrease in the number of erythroid precursors (< 460/mm2), a low hemoglobin level (< 10 g/dl), a high megakaryocyte count (> 50 cells/mm2), an increased density of reticulin fibers (> 30 i x 10(2)/mm2) and splenomegaly (> 15 cm below costal margin). Our findings are in keeping with results obtained from in vitro studies of cell proliferation in CML, which is not significantly altered in comparison with the normal bone marrow. Finally, the present data, although derived from a small group of patients, emphasize the impact of histologic variables to be included in one of the major clinical trials on prognosis in CML.","['Thiele, J', 'Hoefer, M', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Bertsch, H P', 'Zankovich, R', 'Fischer, R']","['Thiele J', 'Hoefer M', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Bertsch HP', 'Zankovich R', 'Fischer R']","['Institute of Pathology University of Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hematol Pathol,Hematologic pathology,8707764,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Reticulin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Erythropoiesis/immunology/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iron/analysis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/mortality/pathology', 'Macrophages/chemistry', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/chemistry', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen', 'Reticulin/analysis']",,1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Pathol. 1993;7(4):239-49.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To gain further insight into activation-dependent regulation of integrin function, we have analyzed integrin activity on three different T-leukemic cell lines: Jurkat, CEM, and H9. This analysis shows important mechanistic differences in integrin regulation. First, phorbol ester treatment results in increased beta 1 integrin-dependent adhesion of both Jurkat and CEM cells to fibronectin, but decreased adhesion of H9 cells. Second, certain activation stimuli that upregulate beta 1 integrin activity in peripheral T cells are nonfunctional in these T-cell lines. Third, analysis of a panel of Jurkat mutants lacking surface expression of CD2 and/or CD3 shows that CD2-mediated upregulation of beta 1 integrin activity is dependent on expression of CD3, whereas CD28-mediated upregulation is not dependent on either CD2 or CD3 expression. Fourth, all T-cell lines tested show an inability to adhere to purified ICAM-1 via LFA-1. The selective alterations in integrin regulation in these cell lines relative to peripheral blood T cells provide important insights into the intracellular processes involved in integrin activation.","['Mobley, J L', 'Ennis, E', 'Shimizu, Y']","['Mobley JL', 'Ennis E', 'Shimizu Y']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor 48109-0620.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis', 'CD2 Antigens', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Integrins/biosynthesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/02/15 00:00,1994/02/15 00:01,['1994/02/15 00:00'],"['1994/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75734-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Feb 15;83(4):1039-50.,,['AI31126/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

P-glycoprotein, which transports various antitumor agents outside the resistant tumor cells, plays a key role in multidrug resistance. We found that MRK-16, a monoclonal antibody against P-glycoprotein, and cyclosporine, synergistically enhanced the antitumor effects of vincristine and adriamycin in multidrug-resistant K562/ADM cells. On the other hand, the combined use of MRK-16 with verapamil or FK-506 did not show such synergistic effects. Drug accumulation studies revealed that MRK-16 remarkably increased the accumulation of cyclosporine, but not verapamil, in K562/ADM cells. This increased accumulation of cyclosporine by MRK-16 in K562/ADM cells directly resulted in the enhanced accumulation of vincristine and adriamycin in the cells. The synergistic effect of MRK-16 and cyclosporine was further confirmed by isobologram analysis in three different highly multidrug-resistant tumor cells. Moreover, while MRK-16 alone did not enhance the sensitivity of the KB-8-5 cells moderately resistant to vincristine, it increased two-fold the reversing effect of cyclosporine at 1 microM, an achievable blood concentration. Since MRK-16 alone showed therapeutic effects against multidrug-resistant tumors, the combined use of MRK-16, cyclosporine and antitumor agents would provide therapeutic benefits for the treatment of resistant tumors.","['Naito, M', 'Tsuruo, T']","['Naito M', 'Tsuruo T']","['Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, University of Tokyo.']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

The pathogenesis of infection in HTLV-I-associated myopathy-tropical spastic paraparesis is not well understood with respect to the cell tropism of HTLV-I and its relationship to the destruction of neural elements. In this study, neuroblastoma cells were infected with HTLV-I by coculturing with HUT-102 cells to demonstrate that cells of neuronal origin are susceptible to this retroviral infection. HTLV-I infection of the neuroblastoma cells was confirmed by verifying the presence of HTLV-I gp46 surface antigens by flow cytometry and by verifying the presence of HTLV-I pX RNA by Northern (RNA) blotting and in situ hybridization techniques. To determine whether HTLV-I infection could potentially lead to changes in cell surface recognition by the immune system, the infected neuroblastoma cells were analyzed for altered HLA expression. The HTLV-I-infected, cocultured neuroblastoma cells were shown, through cell surface antigen expression and RNA transcripts, to express HLA classes I and II. In contrast, cocultured neuroblastoma cells that did not become infected with HTLV-I expressed only HLA class I. HLA class I expression was enhanced by the cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha and gamma interferon and in the presence of HUT-102 supernatant. In this system, expression of HLA class I and II molecules appeared to be regulated by different mechanisms. HLA class I expression was probably induced by cytokines present in the HUT-102 supernatant and was not dependent on HTLV-I infection. HLA class II expression required HTLV-I infection of the cells. The observation of HTLV-I infection leading to HLA induction in these neuroblastoma cells provides a possible mechanism for immunologic recognition of infected neuronal cells.","['Lehky, T J', 'Cowan, E P', 'Lampson, L A', 'Jacobson, S']","['Lehky TJ', 'Cowan EP', 'Lampson LA', 'Jacobson S']","['Neuroimmunology Branch, NINDS, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Deltaretrovirus Antigens)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)']",IM,,"['Cell Communication', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Deltaretrovirus Antigens/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Products, env/biosynthesis', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Neuroblastoma/immunology/microbiology', 'Neurons/*immunology/*microbiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/biosynthesis', 'Sympathetic Nervous System/immunology/microbiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/microbiology']",PMC236648,1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.3.1854-1863.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Mar;68(3):1854-63. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.3.1854-1863.1994.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of verapamil was reversible, and Pgp expression reached the level of untreated controls 24 hr after discontinuation of verapamil. Similar results were obtained with the human vinblastine-resistant cell line, CEM VLB100. On the contrary, no effect on Pgp expression was observed when the cells were treated with nifedipine or diltiazem (2 other calcium-channel blockers), even at doses that inhibited cell proliferation. The level of Pgp mRNA in the presence of verapamil was measured by Northern blot and was also decreased 2-fold (with the maximum reached within 24 hr), suggesting a transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanism for verapamil. We further established that the effect of verapamil on Pgp expression led to an increase in DNR and VLB accumulation and cytotoxicity.

RESULTS: Positive cells were found in 11/14 cases at relapse and in 18/27 cases at onset. All cases with a high WBC, FAB L3, B-mature phenotype, and t(9; 22) were positive. In the 27 patients who were studied at onset and were treated with the same protocol, the overall failure rate was 44% in negative cases and 83% in positive cases.

The integrin VLA-4 is preferentially expressed by B cell precursors and mediates adhesion of B cell precursors to bone marrow derived fibroblasts (BM-FB), which express a VLA-4 counter/receptor, VCAM-1. The functional importance of this adhesion interaction is suggested by the inhibition by anti-VLA-4 antibody of in vitro proliferation of B cell progenitor colonies grown with a BM-FB adherent layer. In order to compare adhesion requirements of normal versus neoplastic human B cell precursors, quantitative expression of adhesion proteins by primary human B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) cells was studied by flow cytometry. BCP-ALL cells expressed VLA-4 and VLA-5 at similar levels as normal immature B cell precursors. However, other adhesion molecules, particularly CD44, were overexpressed by the leukemic cells relative to their normal counterparts. Similar to normal B cell precursors, adhesion of BCP-ALL cells to BM-FB was inhibited by antibodies to VLA-4 and VCAM-1. These results suggest that the ordered program of adhesion protein expression and functional activation during B cell development is at least partially intact in BCP-ALL cells, and may play a role in tissue localization and growth of the neoplastic cells. The focal pattern of spreading of adherent BCP-ALL cell lines on individual cells in the BM-FB adherent layer suggests functional heterogeneity in the bone marrow microenvironment that may be essential in regulating normal and neoplastic lymphopoiesis.","['Ryan, D H']",['Ryan DH'],"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, New York 14642.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', '0 (Receptors, Very Late Antigen)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibroblasts/immunology/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Models, Biological', 'Receptors, Fibronectin/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Very Late Antigen/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Skin/immunology/pathology']",,1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood Cells. 1993;19(2):225-41; discussion 241-4.,,"['CA39569/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S7RR05403-27/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many different methods have been used to evaluate mdr1 expression in these studies. This paper compares four methods for determination of mdr1 expression. We studied the mdr1 gene expression in 36 freshly established cell lines from 28 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (16 T-ALL, six BCP-ALL, two B-ALL (L3), two biphenotypic leukemias, two Burkitt's lymphomas). Leukemic specimens were obtained at the time of diagnosis in 16 cases, and after chemotherapy in 20 cases. In all the samples, mdr1 mRNA was measured by slot blotting and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR), and the presence of the mdr1 product, P-glycoprotein, was detected by immunohistochemistry with the MRK-16 monoclonal antibody. In situ mdr1 RNA hybridization was performed in 30 cases. Complete agreement was noted between all the techniques in 14 cases (39%). Results differed on a single test result in another 39% of the cases. These 78% of cases were considered assessable, and the consensus result was presumed to be correct. By this consensus criterion, immunohistochemistry yields both false negative (11%), and false positive (11%) results. RNA slot blotting has a high (21%) false positive rate. In situ mRNA hybridization and rt-PCR have the highest concordance, 80%. The 28 patients from whom these cell lines were derived appear to represent a very poor prognosis group, since there are only two patients (with Burkitt's lymphoma) who are long-term survivors. Nonetheless, a complete clinical response to therapy was correlated with absence of mdr1 expression in assessable cases (p = 0.04). These four methods of determining mdr1 expression often yield discordant results. Therefore, the use of at least two methods for evaluating mdr1 expression is advisable. Rt-PCR is recommended because of its relative simplicity and specificity. This should be supplemented by a technique (immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry) able to detect heterogeneity of P-glycoprotein expression among cells.","['Brophy, N A', 'Marie, J P', 'Rojas, V A', 'Warnke, R A', 'McFall, P J', 'Smith, S D', 'Sikic, B I']","['Brophy NA', 'Marie JP', 'Rojas VA', 'Warnke RA', 'McFall PJ', 'Smith SD', 'Sikic BI']","['Department of Medicine Oncology, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Feb;8(2):327-35.,,['R01 CA 52168/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The discovery that this phenomenon is associated with the overexpression of a membrane glycoprotein, P-glycoprotein, which acts as a drug efflux pump, has provided a new target for drug development. To develop a model for identifying new compounds which can block the function of P-glycoprotein, we infected P388 mouse leukemic cells with a retrovirus containing a cloned human MDR1 complementary DNA. The new cell line, P388/VMDRC.04, incorporated and overexpressed the human gene as evidenced by Southern blots, increased mRNA and protein synthesis, and recognition by the MRK16 monoclonal antibody. P388/VMDRC.04 was cross-resistant to colchicine, vincristine, and doxorubicin, and the degree of resistance correlated with a reduction in cellular drug accumulation. Unlike many cell lines selected for resistance by growth in increasing concentrations of drug for prolonged periods of time, these cells did not show alternative mechanisms of resistance such as increased synthesis of glutathione or alterations in topoisomerase II. In addition, the sensitivity of P388/VMDRC.04 cells was completely restored by cyclosporin A and trans-flupenthixol. P388/VMDRC.04 cells were subcloned and 10 clones were picked for in vivo evaluation. One subclone grew similarly to parental cells in female BALB/c x DBA/2 F1 mice and showed no responsiveness to therapeutic doses of vincristine or etoposide. The combination of vincristine with cyclosporin A significantly increased the survival of mice inoculated with P388/VMDRC.04 cells. The availability of a cell line that displays the MDR phenotype, overexpresses human P-glycoprotein, but does not contain alterations in at least two well-defined alternative mechanisms of resistance, and that can be grown in simple animal models should facilitate the development of new agents active against this form of chemotherapeutic drug resistance.","['Yang, J M', 'Goldenberg, S', 'Gottesman, M M', 'Hait, W N']","['Yang JM', 'Goldenberg S', 'Gottesman MM', 'Hait WN']","['Department of Medicine, Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway 08854.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '7BA5G9Y06Q (Terfenadine)', 'FA0UYH6QUO (Flupenthixol)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Drug Resistance/genetics/*physiology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Flupenthixol/pharmacology', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', '*Models, Biological', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Terfenadine/pharmacology', 'Transformation, Genetic/genetics']",,1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Feb 1;54(3):730-7.,['MDR1'],"['CA 08341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 43888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To better understand the pathogenetic role of HOX11 in leukemogenesis, post 5-fluorouracil-treated murine bone marrow cells were infected with a replication-defective retrovirus bearing the gene. Constitutive expression of HOX11 in hematopoietic precursors yielded cell lines at high frequency consisting of immature cells belonging to the myeloid lineage. HOX11-transformed cell lines displayed a strict dependence on IL-3 for their survival and proliferation in culture and were not leukemogenic. The results support the hypothesis that the transforming capacity of HOX11 derives from its ability to alter the expression of genes regulating hematopoietic differentiation and that secondary mutations promoting cell survival or stimulating proliferation are required for progression to malignancy. The findings further suggest that the oncogenic activity of HOX11 might not be restricted to T-cell leukemias in humans.","['Hawley, R G', 'Fong, A Z', 'Lu, M', 'Hawley, T S']","['Hawley RG', 'Fong AZ', 'Lu M', 'Hawley TS']","['Division of Cancer Research, Sunnybrook Health Science Centre, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,['0 (Interleukin-3)'],IM,,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*etiology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1994 Jan;9(1):1-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before treatment, two groups of patients were identified in respect to NK activity: the first (12/22) had a normal number of T and NK cells and a normal NK activity, the second (10/22) showed a severe reduction of CD3+, CD4+, CD16+, and CD56+ cells, together with impaired NK activity. All patients had increased serum levels of the soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL-2R). Along with a high complete remission rate (77%), treatment with 2-CdA produced a significant reduction (p = 0.001) of total lymphocytes (from 1.59 x 10(9)/l to 0.72 x 10(9)/l), and particularly of CD4+ cells (from 0.68 x 10(9)/l to 0.23 x 10(9)/l), while CD8+, CD16+ and CD56+ cells were less affected. Despite the dramatic reduction of lymphocytes which lasted for more than 6 months, 7/10 patients with impaired NK function before starting 2-CdA therapy normalized the cytotoxic function within 2 months. In conclusion, 2-CdA produces a severe reduction of lymphocytes in general, and of CD4 lymphocytes in particular, whilst it may produce a significant increase in the proportion of NK cells leading, together with a normalization of the sIL-2R serum levels, to a rapid restoration of the NK cytotoxic function in the majority of patients.","['Lauria, F', 'Rondelli, D', 'Raspadori, D', 'Benfenati, D', 'Tura, S']","['Lauria F', 'Rondelli D', 'Raspadori D', 'Benfenati D', 'Tura S']","['Institute of Science Medicine, University of Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cladribine/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1994.tb01279.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1994 Jan;52(1):16-20. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1994.tb01279.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to eliminate or minimize the Ph-positive clone to see whether a status of minimal residual or Ph-negative disease could be maintained for a longer period of time. After diagnosis, patients received interferon (IFN-a-2b) and hydroxyurea (HU) to keep the white blood cell (WBC) and platelet count below 2-4 and 100-150 x 10(9)/l, respectively. After six months of treatment, Ph-analysis was performed. Patients with Ph-positive cells in bone marrow then received 1-3 courses of intensive chemotherapy. In patients Ph-negative after two courses, bone marrow was harvested and used for ABMT. After a third course, patients with up to 50% Ph-positive metaphases were accepted for ABMT. As of January 1, 1993, 97 patients were registered in the study. Six months of IFN+HU reduced the percentage of Ph-positive metaphases in 57% of the patients (7% became Ph-negative).

Leukemic LTC-IC are typically less numerous in the marrow of these patients but are found in elevated numbers in the peripheral blood which, on average, in total contains more leukemic LTC-IC than the marrow when the WBC count rises above 10(11) per liter. However, a very marked heterogeneity in all of these parameters exists among individual patients. Some of the properties of leukemic LTC-IC are indistinguishable from those of their normal counterparts. Others, particularly those typically associated with an activated state, are altered, although frequently in only 90% (or less) of the leukemic LTC-IC. A more marked disparity between primitive normal and leukemic LTC-IC is seen in terms of their relative abilities to maintain their numbers in vitro. At the level of primitive clonogenic cells, the leukemic population has been shown to exhibit an increased rate of turnover. This appears to be due to an inability of these cells to respond to the cytostatic effects of macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha). These findings provide new insights into the biology of CML and highlight the power of quantitative assays to guide the development of more generally applicable curative therapies.","['Eaves, C J', 'Cashman, J D', 'Zoumbos, N C', 'Barnett, M J', 'Eaves, A C']","['Eaves CJ', 'Cashman JD', 'Zoumbos NC', 'Barnett MJ', 'Eaves AC']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,,IM,,"['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count']",,1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530110924 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1993 Oct;11 Suppl 3:109-21. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530110924.,,,53,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, the procedure is associated with severe complications and is limited to the minority of potential recipients with suitably matched donors. Autologous marrow transplantation using negative selection approaches such as incubation with gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) can produce cytogenetic and clinical remissions, but they are often associated with recurrent evidence of leukemia. A primitive progenitor population can be separated from normal human marrow on the basis of morphologic characteristics and cell surface antigen expression. Cell populations with similar morphologic and phenotypic characteristics obtained by positive selection from the marrow of patients with CML appear to be benign. Benign primitive and committed progenitors selected in this fashion can be expanded ex vivo when cultured in a ""Transwell"" system which physically separates hematopoietic cells from stromal feeder layers. Positive selection and ex vivo cultivation of benign progenitors from CML marrow may provide a source of hematopoietic stem cells suitable for autologous marrow transplantation. Autologous natural killer (NK) cells obtained from the peripheral blood of patients with CML are of benign origin and have antileukemia activity. Interleukin 2 (IL-2) activated autologous NK cells may be used in post-transplant cellular therapy to prevent recurrence of CML.","['McGlave, P', 'Verfaillie, C', 'Miller, J']","['McGlave P', 'Verfaillie C', 'Miller J']","['University of Minnesota Marrow Transplant Program, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,,IM,,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/therapy']",,1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530110905 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1993 Oct;11 Suppl 3:10-3. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530110905.,,,13,,,,,,,,,,,,

That MDR-CEM cell subline had been previously selected for MDR by actinomycin D and displayed a very high resistance phenotype: 3700-fold for actinomycin D, 3900-fold for vincristine, 1200-fold for taxol, 1000-fold for daunomycin (DAU) and 400-fold for colchicine. Interestingly, these MDR-CEM cells displayed little chemosensitization by resistance-modulating agents (RMA) which presumably work by inhibiting Pgp function. These MDR-CEM cells displayed virtually no chemosensitization by 1 microM verapamil or 1 microgram/ml (about 0.8 microM) CsA, whereas their chemosensitization for different anti-cancer drugs (ACD) was rather stable (from 51- to 82-fold) with 1 microgram/ml (about 0.8 microM) SDZ 280-446, while being very unbalanced (from 5- to 38-fold) with 1 microgram/ml (about 0.8 microM) SDZ PSC 833. Exposure of the MDR-CEM cells to Pgp-directed RMAs, during their loading with DAU (DAU-loading phase), hardly restored DAU retention: SDZ 280-446 being as poorly active as SDZ PSC 833, and about only 3- and 4-fold more active than CsA and verapamil. In contrast, SDZ PSC 833 treatment of human MDR-KB and MDR-LoVo cell lines under the same conditions could restore most or all the DAU retention shown by the parental (Par) cells, in spite of their high level of resistance. By keeping the MDR-CEM cells in the presence of RMA throughout the experiment (both DAU-loading and DAU-efflux phases), a better DAU retention could be restored by the different RMAs used, their order of relative restoration activity being SDZ 280-446 3- to 4-fold > SDZ PSC 833 3- to 10-fold > CsA 2- to 4-fold > verapamil. Nevertheless, the level of DAU retention restored in the MDR-CEM cells reached a plateau at 50% of the Par-CEM cell level. Therefore, although the MDR-CEM cells expressed easily detectable membranous Pgp molecules and probably used them for DAU efflux, they displayed an additional efflux mechanism that was not sensitive to the Pgp inhibitors.","['Jachez, B', 'Loor, F']","['Jachez B', 'Loor F']","['Sandoz Pharma Ltd, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '129893-84-1 (SDZ 280 446)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Peptides, Cyclic/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",,1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1993 Dec;4(6):605-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P-glycoprotein encoded by the MDR-1 gene has been implicated as a potential drug resistance mechanism in leukaemic cells. In recent years, many data have been accrued concerning the expression of P-glycoprotein in leukaemia, and several studies have been published which have related MDR status to outcome in AML. Conclusions as to the effect of P-glycoprotein expression on prognosis in AML have varied widely. The studies are not immediately comparable, since they differ in methodology, treatment regimens, demographic profile and, perhaps most importantly, criteria for positivity of MDR status. The technique of statistical overview (meta-analysis) can be used to pool observational studies. Application of this statistical method to existing studies suggests an estimated relative risk of 0.68 for P-glycoprotein expression with respect to complete remission in AML.

Drug-resistant L1210/65 cells (65-fold resistance), overexpress pgp, and display decreased intracellular accumulation of DNM and identical intracellular pH as compared to the parental drug-sensitive L1210 cell line. On the other hand, moderately drug-resistant P388/20 cells (20-fold resistance), which also exhibit a decreased intracellular drug accumulation with respect to drug-sensitive P388/S cells, display only moderate pgp-encoding mdr1 gene transcription without detectable levels of pgp protein, and undergo cytoplasmic alkalinisation (up to approximately 0.2 pH units). A further increase in the level of drug resistance (P388/100 cells, 100-fold resistance), results in a more pronounced decrease in drug accumulation, significant pgp expression and slightly higher intracellular alkalinisation. Alterations in the degree of protonation of DNM have been shown previously to influence processes such as the rate of uptake and the intracellular accumulation of the drug. On this basis, we propose that the changes in intracellular pH, observed at low levels of drug resistance (P388/20 cells), could constitute an early cellular response aimed at decreasing the intracellular accumulation of ionisable anti-neoplastics. As the level of resistance increases (P388/100), the cells seem to require more efficient mechanisms of defense against the drug, such as that represented by the expression of pgp. Since there is no apparent correlation between the extent of the changes in intracellular pH and the level of pgp expression in DNM-resistant P388 cell sublines, it is suggested that these two cellular responses contributing to drug resistance could operate independently.","['Soto, F', 'Planells-Cases, R', 'Canaves, J M', 'Ferrer-Montiel, A V', 'Aleu, J', 'Gamarro, F', 'Castanys, S', 'Gonzalez-Ros, J M', 'Ferragut, J A']","['Soto F', 'Planells-Cases R', 'Canaves JM', 'Ferrer-Montiel AV', 'Aleu J', 'Gamarro F', 'Castanys S', 'Gonzalez-Ros JM', 'Ferragut JA']","['Department of Neurochemistry, University of Alicante, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis', 'Daunorubicin/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance/genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/physiology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0959-8049(93)90050-P [pii]', '10.1016/0959-8049(93)90050-p [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1993;29A(15):2144-50. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(93)90050-p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
