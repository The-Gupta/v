ATL is a rare malignancy and is a single HTLV-1-mediated disease entity with diverse molecular features. Additionally, ATL clinical features and prognosis are diverse, leading to subtype classification into acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering types according to organ involvement and LDH and calcium levels. For the acute, lymphomatous, or unfavorable chronic subtypes (aggressive ATL) and favorable chronic or smoldering ATL (indolent ATL), intensive chemotherapy followed by allo-HSCT and careful observation until disease progression has been recommended in Japan, respectively. Maintenance of a medical treatment system for ATL, a rare leukemic lymphoma with diverse clinical features and poor prognosis, is required in Japan and other endemic areas in the world.","['Tsukasaki, Kunihiro']",['Tsukasaki K'],"['Dept. of Hematology, National Cancer Center Hospital East.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

This guideline was supported by studies from 2010 to 2013. Since 2013, new key studies have been published and key cancer cohorts have been updated, which we have evaluated and compared with the WHO guideline. FA is genotoxic, causing DNA adduct formation, and has a clastogenic effect; exposure-response relationships were nonlinear. Relevant genetic polymorphisms were not identified. Normal indoor air FA concentrations do not pass beyond the respiratory epithelium, and therefore FA's direct effects are limited to portal-of-entry effects. However, systemic effects have been observed in rats and mice, which may be due to secondary effects as airway inflammation and (sensory) irritation of eyes and the upper airways, which inter alia decreases respiratory ventilation. Both secondary effects are prevented at the guideline level. Nasopharyngeal cancer and leukaemia were observed inconsistently among studies; new updates of the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) cohort confirmed that the relative risk was not increased with mean FA exposures below 1 ppm and peak exposures below 4 ppm. Hodgkin's lymphoma, not observed in the other studies reviewed and not considered FA dependent, was increased in the NCI cohort at a mean concentration >/=0.6 mg/m(3) and at peak exposures >/=2.5 mg/m(3); both levels are above the WHO guideline.

Continued advancements are expected given the attention to precision medicine and the resulting growth in development and adoption of risk-stratified, personalized therapies. While precision medicine has great potential to improve acute leukemia outcomes, there remain significant barriers to ensuring equitable access to these technologies and receipt of these prescribed targeted, personalized therapies. Over the past 3 years, studies report persistent outcome disparities among patients from specific racial and ethnic backgrounds, insurance and socioeconomic status, and other socio-demographic factors after a diagnosis of acute leukemia. A few recent studies examine etiologies for acute leukemia disparities and highlight the importance of ensuring access and equitable delivery of scientific advancements. In the context of continued scientific progress, future strategies require thoughtfully considered improvements in the delivery of care that can overcome the current challenges our patients face.","['Patel, Manali I']",['Patel MI'],"['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, 875 Blake Wilbur Drive, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA. manalip@stanford.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Healthcare Disparities/economics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/economics/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/economics/therapy', 'Precision Medicine/economics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/economics/therapy']",2016/05/23 06:00,2017/09/26 06:00,['2016/05/23 06:00'],"['2016/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2016 Aug;11(4):265-70. doi: 10.1007/s11899-016-0329-y.,10.1007/s11899-016-0329-y [doi],,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute leukemia', '*Disparities', '*Precision medicine', '*Survival']",,"['10.1007/s11899-016-0329-y [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-016-0329-y [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blinatumomab showed anti-leukemia activity in clinical trials and was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r ALL). The objectives of this work were to characterize blinatumomab pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and to evaluate dosing regimens. METHODS: Data from six phase I and II trials in patients with r/r ALL, minimal residual disease-positive ALL, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) were analyzed. Blinatumomab pharmacokinetics was characterized by non-compartmental and population pharmacokinetic analyses and pharmacodynamics was described graphically. RESULTS: Blinatumomab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics under continuous intravenous infusion for 4-8 weeks per cycle over a dose range of 5-90 microg/m(2)/day, without target-mediated disposition. Estimated mean (standard deviation) volume of distribution, clearance, and elimination half-life were 4.52 (2.89) L, 2.72 (2.71) L/h, and 2.11 (1.42) h, respectively. Pharmacokinetics was similar in patients with ALL and NHL and was not affected by patient demographics, supporting fixed dosing in adults. Although creatinine clearance was a significant covariate of drug clearance, no dose adjustment was required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Incidence of neutralizing antidrug antibodies was <1 %. Blinatumomab pharmacodynamics featured T-cell redistribution and activation, B-cell depletion, and transient dose-dependent cytokine elevation. Blinatumomab did not affect cytochrome P450 enzymes directly; cytokines may trigger transient cytochrome P450 suppression with low potential for inducing drug interactions. CONCLUSIONS: Blinatumomab has unique pharmacokinetic and immunological features that require indication-dependent dosing regimens. Stepped dosing is required to achieve adequate efficacy and minimize cytokine release in diseases with high tumor burden.","['Zhu, Min', 'Wu, Benjamin', 'Brandl, Christian', 'Johnson, Jessica', 'Wolf, Andreas', 'Chow, Andrew', 'Doshi, Sameer']","['Zhu M', 'Wu B', 'Brandl C', 'Johnson J', 'Wolf A', 'Chow A', 'Doshi S']","['Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, 91320, USA. min.zhu@amgen.com.', 'Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, 91320, USA.', 'Amgen Research Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, 91320, USA.', 'Amgen Research Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, 91320, USA.', 'Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, 91320, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Body Weight', 'Cytokines/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Renal Insufficiency/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",2016/05/23 06:00,2017/09/12 06:00,['2016/05/23 06:00'],"['2016/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 2016 Oct;55(10):1271-1288. doi: 10.1007/s40262-016-0405-4.,10.1007/s40262-016-0405-4 [doi],,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)']",,,,,"['10.1007/s40262-016-0405-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s40262-016-0405-4 [pii]']","['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00274742', 'ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00560794', 'ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01207388', 'ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01209286', 'ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01741792', 'ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01466179']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether accidentally exposed to a single, whole-body dose in an act of terrorism or purposefully exposed to fractionated doses as part of a therapeutic regimen, radiation exposure carries the consequence of elevated cancer risk. The long-term impact of both intentional and unintentional exposure could potentially be mitigated by treatments specifically developed to limit the mutations and precancerous replication that ensue in the wake of irradiation The development of such agents would undoubtedly require a substantial degree of in vitro testing, but in order to accurately recapitulate the complex process of radiation-induced carcinogenesis, well-understood animal models are necessary. Inbred strains of the laboratory mouse, Mus musculus, present the most logical choice due to the high number of molecular and physiological similarities they share with humans. Their small size, high rate of breeding and fully sequenced genome further increase its value for use in cancer research. This chapter will review relevant m. musculus inbred and F1 hybrid animals of radiation-induced myeloid leukemia, thymic lymphoma, breast and lung cancers.

Here, we sought to define the mutational landscape of MPAL by performing whole-exome sequencing on samples from 23 adult and pediatric MPAL patients. We identified frequent mutations of epigenetic modifiers, most notably mutations of DNMT3A, in 33% of adult MPAL patients. Mutations of activated signaling pathways, tumor suppressors, and transcription factors were also frequent. Importantly, many of the identified mutations are potentially therapeutically targetable, with agents currently available or in various stages of clinical development.

These neoplasms can have very different clinical behaviors, from highly aggressive to indolent, and therefore require diverse treatment strategies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the profile of 93 patients diagnosed with mature B-cell neoplasms monitored between 2011 and 2014. METHODS: A review of patients' charts was performed and laboratory results were obtained using the online system of the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina. RESULTS: The study included 93 adult patients with mature B-cell neoplasms. The most frequent subtypes were multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and Burkitt's lymphoma. The median age at diagnosis was 58 years with a male-to-female ratio of 1.3:1. There were statistical differences in terms of age at diagnosis, lactate dehydrogenase activity and Ki-67 expression among the subtypes of B-cell lymphoma. According to the prognostic indexes, the majority of multiple myeloma patients were categorized as high risk, while the majority of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients were classified as low risk. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the profile of patients diagnosed with mature B-cell neoplasms in a south Brazilian university hospital. Of the B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma presented particular features regarding lactate dehydrogenase activity levels, Ki-67 expression, age at diagnosis, and human immunodeficiency virus infection.","['Cardoso, Chandra Chiappin', 'de Moraes, Ana Carolina Rabello', 'Del Moral, Joanita Angela Gonzaga', 'Santos-Silva, Maria Claudia']","['Cardoso CC', 'de Moraes AC', 'Del Moral JA', 'Santos-Silva MC']","['Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC), Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC), Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC), Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC), Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.

OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to describe the results of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with advanced indolent lymphoproliferative disorders. METHODS: This article reports on 29 adult patients submitted to allogeneic transplantations from 1997 to 2010. RESULTS: Most had follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n=14) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=12). The median age was 44 years (range: 24-53 years) and 65% of patients were male. Only 21% had had access to rituximab and 45% to fludarabine. All had advanced disease (stage IV) with partial response or stable disease. Most underwent myeloablative conditioning n=17-59%). In this scenario, refractory disease was observed in seven (24%) patients, the 100-day mortality rate was 17% (n=5) and relapse occurred in four patients (18%). The main cause of death throughout the follow up was refractory disease in six of the 12 patients who died. Moderate and severe chronic graft-versus-host disease was frequent; about 41% of 24 patients analyzed. The overall survival rates and disease free survival at 42 months were 56.7% and 45.4%, respectively. According to Kaplan-Meyer analysis, the median time from diagnosis to transplant predicted the overall survival; however age, gender and conditioning regimen did not predict the prognosis. It was impossible to reach other conclusions because of the small sample size in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The role of allogeneic transplantations should be re-evaluated in the era of targeted therapy.","['Fonseca-Hial, Ana Marcela Rojas', 'Parisio, Katya', 'Oliveira, Jose Salvador Rodrigues']","['Fonseca-Hial AM', 'Parisio K', 'Oliveira JS']","['Hospital Sao Paulo, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; Hospital Santa Marcelina, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.

Methane was shown to exert a protective effect against IRI in many organs. This study aims to explore the possible protective effects of methane-rich saline against retinal IRI in rat. Retinal IRI was performed on the right eyes of male Sprague-Dawley rats, which were immediately injected intraperitoneally with methane-saturated saline (25ml/kg). At one week after surgery, the number of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), total retinal thickness, visual function were measured by hematoxylin and eosin staining, FluoroGold anterograde labeling and flash visual evoked potentials. The levels of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), caspase-3, caspase-9, B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) in retinas were assessed by immunofluorescence staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. As expected, methane treatment significantly improved the retinal IRI-induced RGC loss, total retinal layer thinning and visual dysfunction. Moreover, methane treatment significantly reduced the levels of oxidative stress biomarkers (8-OHdG, 4-HNE, MDA) and increased the antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT, GPx) in the retinas with IRI. Meanwhile, methane treatment significantly increased the anti-apoptotic gene (Bcl-2) expression and decreased the pro-apoptotic gene (Bax) expression, accompanied by the suppression of caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity. Thus, these data demonstrated that methane can exert a neuroprotective role against retinal IRI through anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic pathways.","['Liu, Lin', 'Sun, Qinglei', 'Wang, Ruobing', 'Chen, Zeli', 'Wu, Jiangchun', 'Xia, Fangzhou', 'Fan, Xian-Qun']","['Liu L', 'Sun Q', 'Wang R', 'Chen Z', 'Wu J', 'Xia F', 'Fan XQ']","[""Department of Ophthalmology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China; Department of Ophthalmology, The Ninth People's Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", 'Department of Ophthalmology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China.', ""Department of Ophthalmology, The Ninth People's Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.

Known genetic loci influencing blood cell production account for <10% of platelet and red blood cell variability, and thrombopoietin/cellular myeloproliferative leukemia virus liganding is dispensable for definitive thrombopoiesis, establishing that fundamentally important modifier loci remain unelucidated. In this study, platelet transcriptome sequencing and extended thrombocytosis cohort analyses identified a single loss-of-function mutation (BLVRB(S111L)) causally associated with clonal and nonclonal disorders of enhanced platelet production. BLVRB(S111L) encompassed within the substrate/cofactor [alpha/beta dinucleotide NAD(P)H] binding fold is a functionally defective redox coupler using flavin and biliverdin (BV) IXbeta tetrapyrrole(s) and results in exaggerated reactive oxygen species accumulation as a putative metabolic signal leading to differential hematopoietic lineage commitment and enhanced thrombopoiesis. These data define the first physiologically relevant function of BLVRB and implicate its activity and/or heme-regulated BV tetrapyrrole(s) in a unique redox-regulated bioenergetic pathway governing terminal megakaryocytopoiesis; these observations also define a mechanistically restricted drug target retaining potential for enhancing human platelet counts.","['Wu, Song', 'Li, Zongdong', 'Gnatenko, Dmitri V', 'Zhang, Beibei', 'Zhao, Lu', 'Malone, Lisa E', 'Markova, Nedialka', 'Mantle, Timothy J', 'Nesbitt, Natasha M', 'Bahou, Wadie F']","['Wu S', 'Li Z', 'Gnatenko DV', 'Zhang B', 'Zhao L', 'Malone LE', 'Markova N', 'Mantle TJ', 'Nesbitt NM', 'Bahou WF']","['Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics.', 'Department of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY; and.', 'Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics.', 'Department of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Department of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Medicine, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Alleles', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Blood Platelets/metabolism', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cohort Studies', 'Erythroid Cells/cytology/enzymology', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Heme/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/enzymology', '*Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Risk Factors', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Thrombocytosis/genetics', 'Thrombopoiesis/*genetics']",2016/05/22 06:00,2017/08/02 06:00,['2016/05/22 06:00'],"['2016/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Aug 4;128(5):699-709. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-02-696997.

Herein, we establish that a distinct subset of the earliest CD19(+) B-cell progenitors emerging in the E13.5 mouse fetal liver express the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R), previously thought to be expressed, and play a lineage-restricted role in development of myeloid lineages, and macrophages in particular. These early embryonic CSF1R(+)CD19(+) ProB cells also express multiple other myeloid genes and, in line with this, possess residual myeloid as well as B-cell, but not T-cell lineage potential. Notably, these CSF1R(+) myeloid-primed ProB cells are uniquely present in a narrow window of embryonic fetal liver hematopoiesis and do not persist in adult bone marrow. Moreover, analysis of CSF1R-deficient mice establishes a distinct role of CSF1R in fetal B-lymphopoiesis.

Their spontaneous cytotoxicity was first demonstrated in vitro against leukemia cell lines, and NK cells might play a crucial role in the therapy of leukemia. NK cell activity is controlled by an array of germ line-encoded activating and inhibitory receptors, as well as modulating coreceptors. This biologic feature can be exploited in allogeneic cell therapy, and the recognition of ""missing-self"" on target cells is crucial for promoting NK cell-mediated graft-versus-leukemia effects. In this regard, NK cells that express an inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (iKIR) for which the respective major histocompatibility complex class I ligand is absent on leukemic target cells can exert alloreactivity in vitro and in vivo. Several models regarding potential donor-patient constellations have been described that have demonstrated the clinical benefit of such alloreactivity of the donor-derived NK cell system in patients with adult acute myeloid leukemia and pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Moreover, adoptive transfer of mature allogeneic NK cells in the nontransplant or transplant setting has been shown to be safe and feasible, whereas its effectivity needs further evaluation. NK cell therapy can be further improved by optimal donor selection based on phenotypic and genotypic properties, by adoptive transfer of NK cells with ex vivo or in vivo cytokine stimulation, by the use of antibodies to induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or to block iKIRs, or by transduction of chimeric antigen receptors.","['Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Lang, Peter', 'Andre, Maya C']","['Handgretinger R', 'Lang P', 'Andre MC']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany; and."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany; and."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany; and Department of Pediatric Intensive Care, University Children's Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adoptive Transfer/*methods', 'Allografts', 'Animals', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Cellular', '*Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/transplantation', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/therapy', 'Living Donors', '*Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/therapy', 'Receptors, KIR/immunology', 'Tissue Donors']",2016/05/22 06:00,2017/07/28 06:00,['2016/05/22 06:00'],"['2015/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jun 30;127(26):3341-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-12-629055.

Benzene is an established myeloid leukemogen and probable lymphomagen. FA is classified as a myeloid leukemogen but has not been associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), whereas TCE has been associated with NHL but not myeloid leukemia. Epidemiologic associations between FA and myeloid leukemia, and between benzene, TCE and NHL are, however, still debated. Previously, we showed that these chemicals are associated with hematotoxicity in cross-sectional studies of factory workers in China, which included extensive personal monitoring and biological sample collection. Here, we compare and contrast patterns of hematotoxicity, monosomy 7 in myeloid progenitor cells (MPCs), and B-cell activation biomarkers across these studies to further evaluate possible mechanisms of action and consistency of effects with observed hematologic cancer risks. Workers exposed to benzene or FA, but not TCE, showed declines in cell types derived from MPCs, including granulocytes and platelets. Alterations in lymphoid cell types, including B cells and CD4+ T cells, and B-cell activation markers were apparent in workers exposed to benzene or TCE. Given that alterations in myeloid and lymphoid cell types are associated with hematological malignancies, our data provide biologic insight into the epidemiological evidence linking benzene and FA exposure with myeloid leukemia risk, and TCE and benzene exposure with NHL risk.","['Bassig, Bryan A', 'Zhang, Luoping', 'Vermeulen, Roel', 'Tang, Xiaojiang', 'Li, Guilan', 'Hu, Wei', 'Guo, Weihong', 'Purdue, Mark P', 'Yin, Songnian', 'Rappaport, Stephen M', 'Shen, Min', 'Ji, Zhiying', 'Qiu, Chuangyi', 'Ge, Yichen', 'Hosgood, H Dean', 'Reiss, Boris', 'Wu, Banghua', 'Xie, Yuxuan', 'Li, Laiyu', 'Yue, Fei', 'Freeman, Laura E Beane', 'Blair, Aaron', 'Hayes, Richard B', 'Huang, Hanlin', 'Smith, Martyn T', 'Rothman, Nathaniel', 'Lan, Qing']","['Bassig BA', 'Zhang L', 'Vermeulen R', 'Tang X', 'Li G', 'Hu W', 'Guo W', 'Purdue MP', 'Yin S', 'Rappaport SM', 'Shen M', 'Ji Z', 'Qiu C', 'Ge Y', 'Hosgood HD', 'Reiss B', 'Wu B', 'Xie Y', 'Li L', 'Yue F', 'Freeman LE', 'Blair A', 'Hayes RB', 'Huang H', 'Smith MT', 'Rothman N', 'Lan Q']","['Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Guangdong Poison Control Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China.', 'Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China.', 'Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Guangdong Poison Control Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Poison Control Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA and.', 'Guangdong Poison Control Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Poison Control Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Poison Control Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Poison Control Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'Division of Epidemiology, Department of Environmental Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Guangdong Poison Control Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,IM,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'China', 'Female', 'Formaldehyde/*toxicity', 'Hemolytic Agents/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*chemically induced/epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Trichloroethylene/*toxicity']",2016/05/22 06:00,2017/05/20 06:00,['2016/05/22 06:00'],"['2015/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2016 Jul;37(7):692-700. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgw053.

In addition to somatic mutations, germline polymorphisms in telomere maintenance genes impact telomere length. Whether these telomere-associated polymorphisms affect risk of childhood malignancies remains largely unexplored. We collected genome-wide data from three groups with pediatric malignancies [neuroblastoma (N = 1516), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (N = 958) and osteosarcoma (N = 660)] and three control populations (N = 6892). Using case-control comparisons, we analyzed eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes definitively associated with interindividual variation in leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in prior genome-wide association studies: ACYP2, TERC, NAF1, TERT, OBFC1, CTC1, ZNF208 and RTEL1 Six of these SNPs were associated (P < 0.05) with neuroblastoma risk, one with leukemia risk and one with osteosarcoma risk. The allele associated with longer LTL increased cancer risk for all these significantly associated SNPs. Using a weighted linear combination of the eight LTL-associated SNPs, we observed that neuroblastoma patients were predisposed to longer LTL than controls, with each standard deviation increase in genotypically estimated LTL associated with a 1.15-fold increased odds of neuroblastoma (95%CI = 1.09-1.22; P = 7.9x10(-7)). This effect was more pronounced in adolescent-onset neuroblastoma patients (OR = 1.46; 95%CI = 1.03-2.08). A one standard deviation increase in genotypically estimated LTL was more weakly associated with osteosarcoma risk (OR = 1.10; 95%CI = 1.01-1.19; P = 0.017) and leukemia risk (OR = 1.07; 95%CI = 1.00-1.14; P = 0.044), specifically for leukemia patients who relapsed (OR = 1.19; 95%CI = 1.01-1.40; P = 0.043).

Low survival rate of esophageal carcinoma is partially due to the presence of stem-like cancer cells with chemotherapy resistance. In the current study, we aimed to determine the effects of auraptene, an interesting dietary coumarin with various biological activities, on malignant properties of stem-like esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, in terms of sensitivity to anticancer drugs and expression of specific markers. To do so, the half maximal inhibitory concentration values of auraptene, cisplatin, paclitaxel, and 5-fluorouracil were determined on esophageal carcinoma cells (KYSE30 cell line). After administrating combinatorial treatments, including nontoxic concentrations of auraptene + cisplatin, paclitaxel, or 5-fluorouracil, sensitivity of cells to chemical drugs and also induced apoptosis were assessed. In addition, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to study changes in the expression of tumor suppressor proteins 53 and 21 ( P53 and P21), cluster of differentiation 44 ( CD44), and B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 ( BMI-1) upon treatments. Results of thiazolyl blue assay revealed that auraptene significantly ( P < .05) increased toxicity of cisplatin, paclitaxel, and 5-fluorouracil in KYSE30 cells, specifically 72 hours after treatment. Conducting an apoptosis assay using flow cytometry also confirmed the synergic effects of auraptene. Results of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed significant ( P < .05) upregulation of P53 and P21 upon combinatorial treatments and also downregulation of CD44 and BMI-1 after auraptene administration.

This retrospective chart review aimed to quantify hospitalizations and reimbursement in this patient population in France. METHODS: Patients aged >/=18 years and with at least one hospitalization for Ph(-) R/R B-precursor ALL were included in the study. They were relapsed with first remission lasting <12 months, relapsed after first salvage therapy, relapsed any time after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), or were refractory to initial or salvage therapy. Data were collected from the index date (first diagnosis of R/R ALL) until death or loss to follow-up. The chemotherapy period was defined as the first chemotherapy date after the index date to the earliest of death, loss to follow-up, last chemotherapy dose plus 30 days, or initiation of HSCT. The primary outcome was the percentage of time hospitalized during the chemotherapy period. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were included, with a mean age of 49 years. The mean proportion of time spent in the hospital during the chemotherapy period was 46% (95% CI =34-57%). Patients had a mean of 2.2 (SD =1.5) inpatient hospitalizations and the mean length of stay per hospitalization was 16.8 (SD =14.8) days. During the chemotherapy period, the mean amount reimbursed per hospitalization was euro31 067 (SD = euro4850) and the total hospitalization reimbursement per patient was euro68 344. From the index date to death, excluding HSCT, the total reimbursement per patient was euro108 873. LIMITATIONS: The sample size was small, although this was expected given the rarity of the patient population. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with Ph(-) R/R B-precursor ALL had repeated and prolonged hospitalizations during salvage chemotherapy. Approximately half the follow-up period was spent in the hospital, and this time was associated with high economic burden in France.","['Dombret, Herve', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Nivot, Edwige', 'Reitan, John', 'Barber, Beth', 'Barlev, Arie', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Dombret H', 'Thomas X', 'Chevallier P', 'Nivot E', 'Reitan J', 'Barber B', 'Barlev A', 'Mohty M']","['a Hopital Saint-Louis , Paris , University Paris Diderot , France.', 'b Hopital Lyon-Sud , Lyon , France.', 'c CHU de Nantes , Nantes , France.', 'd Amgen Health Economics , Boulogne-Billancourt , France.', 'e RJM Group , Crown Point , IN , USA.', 'f Amgen Global Health Economics , Thousand Oaks , CA , USA.', 'f Amgen Global Health Economics , Thousand Oaks , CA , USA.', 'g Hopital Saint-Antoine , Paris , France.', 'h Universite Pierre & Marie Curie , Paris , France.', 'i INSERM U938 , Paris , France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Med Econ,Journal of medical economics,9892255,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', '*Cost of Illness', 'Female', 'France', 'Hospitalization/*economics', 'Humans', '*Insurance, Health, Reimbursement', 'Male', 'Medical Audit', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', '*Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2016/10/18 06:00,2017/07/01 06:00,['2016/05/22 06:00'],"['2016/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/22 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Econ. 2016 Nov;19(11):1034-1039. doi: 10.1080/13696998.2016.1192549.

However, tumor cell lines fail to engage in complete senescence upon PML activation. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying resistance to PML-induced senescence. Here, we report that activation of the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 are essential and sufficient to impair senescence induced by PML expression. Disrupting CDK function by RNA interference or pharmacological inhibition restored senescence in tumor cells and diminished their tumorigenic potential in mouse xenograft models. Complete senescence correlated with an increase in autophagy, repression of E2F target genes, and an gene expression signature of blocked DNA methylation. Accordingly, treatment of tumor cells with inhibitors of DNA methylation reversed resistance to PML-induced senescence. Further, CDK inhibition with palbociclib promoted autophagy-dependent degradation of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1. Lastly, we found that CDK4 interacted with and phosphorylated DNMT1 in vitro, suggesting that CDK activity is required for its stabilization. Taken together, our findings highlight a potentially valuable feature of CDK4/6 inhibitors as epigenetic modulators to facilitate activation of senescence programs in tumor cells.

Despite significant improvement in the treatment of T-ALL, approximately 20% of children and most adults undergo relapse. Previous findings demonstrated that loss of T-cell quiescence due to a mutation in the Slfn2 gene (elektra) leads to acquisition of an aberrant developmental program by which T-cells lose their renewal capabilities and undergo apoptosis. Here we show that the elektra mutation in Slfn2 completely prevents a severe lymphoproliferative disease caused by overexpression of BCL2 in combination with Fas deficiency in mice. Moreover, Slfn2 impaired-function protects mice from experimental disease similar to human T-ALL by severely impairing the proliferation potential and survival of leukemic T-cells, partially by activation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Our study suggest that in certain malignancies, such as T-ALL, a novel therapeutic strategy may be applied by imposing aberrant development of leukemic cells. Furthermore, as the elektra mutation in Slfn2 seems to impair only T-cells and monocytes, targeting Slfn2 is expected to be harmless to other cell types, and thereby could be a promising target for treating malignancies. Together our results demonstrate the potential of targeting Slfn2 and its human paralog for T-ALL treatment.","['Goldshtein, Aviya', 'Zerbib, Shani Mistriel', 'Omar, Ibrahim', 'Cohen-Daniel, Leonor', 'Popkin, Daniel', 'Berger, Michael']","['Goldshtein A', 'Zerbib SM', 'Omar I', 'Cohen-Daniel L', 'Popkin D', 'Berger M']","['The Lautenberg Center for Immunology and Cancer Research, The Biomedical Research Institute Israel-Canada of the Faculty of Medicine, The Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'The Lautenberg Center for Immunology and Cancer Research, The Biomedical Research Institute Israel-Canada of the Faculty of Medicine, The Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'The Lautenberg Center for Immunology and Cancer Research, The Biomedical Research Institute Israel-Canada of the Faculty of Medicine, The Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'The Lautenberg Center for Immunology and Cancer Research, The Biomedical Research Institute Israel-Canada of the Faculty of Medicine, The Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Dermatology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'The Lautenberg Center for Immunology and Cancer Research, The Biomedical Research Institute Israel-Canada of the Faculty of Medicine, The Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Loss of Function Mutation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Monocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology/therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/metabolism', '*Resting Phase, Cell Cycle', 'Thymocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'fas Receptor/genetics']",2016/05/22 06:00,2018/01/05 06:00,['2016/05/22 06:00'],"['2016/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/22 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jul 26;7(30):46835-46847. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9390.,10.18632/oncotarget.9390 [doi],,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Fas protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '0 (schlafen-2 protein, mouse)', '114100-40-2 (Bcl2 protein, mouse)']",PMC5216906,['NOTNLM'],"['Notch1', 'Schalfen2', 'T-ALL', 'T-cell quiescence', 'p53']",['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],"['9390 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9390 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies link posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) with immunosuppressants used for patients undergoing transplantation, as well as select tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and other targeted therapies used in patients with cancer. PRES is a reversible condition with early recognition and management; however, permanent neurologic toxicities have been reported. OBJECTIVES: This article aims to educate oncology nurses on signs, symptoms, and management of PRES in patients receiving TKIs. METHODS: The literature was reviewed to develop an educational session about causes, manifestations, pathophysiology, and management of PRES. Using a case study and flipped classroom model, staff participated in an online lecture and concept engagement exercise. Education for nurses included frequent neurologic and mental status assessments, blood pressure monitoring with mean arterial blood pressure goal, and seizure precautions. Nursing knowledge was evaluated with pre- and post-testing. FINDINGS: Evaluation revealed improved knowledge in recognizing and managing patients with PRES related to TKIs.

Fundamental to this approach is the observation that the amount of drug released from the Au-NP is proportional to both the presence and abundance of the cancer cell specific mRNA in a cell. As proof-of-principle, we demonstrate both the efficient delivery and selective release of the multi-kinase inhibitor dasatinib from Au-NPs in leukemia cells with resulting efficacy in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, these Au-NPs reduce toxicity against hematopoietic stem cells and T-cells. This approach has the potential to improve the therapeutic efficacy of a drug and minimize toxicity while being highly customizable with respect to both the cancer cell specific mRNAs targeted and drugs activated.","['Gossai, Nathan P', 'Naumann, Jordan A', 'Li, Nan-Sheng', 'Zamora, Edward A', 'Gordon, David J', 'Piccirilli, Joseph A', 'Gordon, Peter M']","['Gossai NP', 'Naumann JA', 'Li NS', 'Zamora EA', 'Gordon DJ', 'Piccirilli JA', 'Gordon PM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dasatinib/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Carriers/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Gold/administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Metal Nanoparticles/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2016/10/23 06:00,2018/02/27 06:00,['2016/05/21 06:00'],"['2016/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jun 21;7(25):38243-38256. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9430.,10.18632/oncotarget.9430 [doi],,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",PMC5122386,['NOTNLM'],"['anti-sense', 'drug delivery', 'gold nanoparticles', 'leukemia', 'molecularly targeted therapy']",['The authors disclose no potential conflicts of interest.'],"['9430 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9430 [doi]']",,,"['K08 CA154782/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA077598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most commonly studied preclinical model of retinitis pigmentosa called the ""rodless"" (rd1) mouse is homozygous for two mutations: a nonsense point mutation (Y347X) and an intronic insertion of a leukemia virus (Xmv-28). Distinguishing which mutation causes retinal degeneration is still under debate nearly a century after the discovery of this model organism. Here, we performed gene editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and demonstrated that the Y347X mutation is the causative variant of disease. Genome editing in the first generation produced animals that were mosaic for the corrected allele but still showed neurofunction preservation despite low repair frequencies. Furthermore, second-generation CRISPR-repaired mice showed an even more robust rescue and amelioration of the disease. This predicts excellent outcomes for gene editing in diseased human tissue, as Pde6b, the mutated gene in rd1 mice, has an orthologous intron-exon relationship comparable with the human PDE6B gene. Not only do these findings resolve the debate surrounding the source of neurodegeneration in the rd1 model, but they also provide the first example of homology-directed recombination-mediated gene correction in the visual system.","['Wu, Wen-Hsuan', 'Tsai, Yi-Ting', 'Justus, Sally', 'Lee, Ting-Ting', 'Zhang, Lijuan', 'Lin, Chyuan-Sheng', 'Bassuk, Alexander G', 'Mahajan, Vinit B', 'Tsang, Stephen H']","['Wu WH', 'Tsai YT', 'Justus S', 'Lee TT', 'Zhang L', 'Lin CS', 'Bassuk AG', 'Mahajan VB', 'Tsang SH']","['Barbara and Donald Jonas Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Laboratory and Bernard and Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, Institute of Human Nutrition, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.', 'Barbara and Donald Jonas Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Laboratory and Bernard and Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Laboratory, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Institute of Human Nutrition, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.', 'Edward S.

We observed that circulating chromogranin A (CgA) and its N-terminal fragment (called vasostatin-1, CgA1-76), two neuroendocrine secretory polypeptides that enhance the endothelial barrier function, are present in variable amounts in the blood of CLL patients. Studies in animal models showed that daily administration of full-length human CgA1-439 (0.3 mug, i.v., or 1.5 mug/mouse, i.p.) can reduce the BM/blood ratio of leukemic cells in Emu-TCL1 mice, a transgenic model, and decrease BM, lung and kidney infiltration in Rag2-/-gammac-/- mice engrafted with human MEC1 CLL cells, a xenograft model. This treatment also reduced the loss of body weight and improved animal motility. In vitro, CgA enhanced the endothelial barrier integrity and the trans-endothelial migration of MEC1 cells, with a bimodal dose-response curve. Vasostatin-1, but not a larger fragment consisting of N-terminal and central regions of CgA (CgA1-373), inhibited CLL progression in the xenograft model, suggesting that the C-terminal region is crucial for CgA activity and that the N-terminal domain contains a site that is activated by proteolytic cleavage. These findings suggest that circulating full-length CgA and its fragments may contribute to regulate leukemic cell trafficking and reduce tissue infiltration in CLL.","['Bianco, Mimma', 'Gasparri, Anna', 'Generoso, Luca', 'Assi, Emma', 'Colombo, Barbara', 'Scarfo, Lydia', 'Bertilaccio, Maria T S', 'Scielzo, Cristina', 'Ranghetti, Pamela', 'Dondossola, Eleonora', 'Ponzoni, Maurilio', 'Caligaris-Cappio, Federico', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Corti, Angelo']","['Bianco M', 'Gasparri A', 'Generoso L', 'Assi E', 'Colombo B', 'Scarfo L', 'Bertilaccio MT', 'Scielzo C', 'Ranghetti P', 'Dondossola E', 'Ponzoni M', 'Caligaris-Cappio F', 'Ghia P', 'Corti A']","['Tumor Biology and Vascular Targeting Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'Tumor Biology and Vascular Targeting Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'Tumor Biology and Vascular Targeting Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'Tumor Biology and Vascular Targeting Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'Tumor Biology and Vascular Targeting Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'B Cell Neoplasia Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'Clinical Lymphoma Unit, Department of Onco-Hematology, San Raffaele Hospital, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Vita-Salute University, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'Tumor Biology and Vascular Targeting Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'Clinical Lymphoma Unit, Department of Onco-Hematology, San Raffaele Hospital, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'Clinical Lymphoma Unit, Department of Onco-Hematology, San Raffaele Hospital, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Vita-Salute University, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'B Cell Neoplasia Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'Clinical Lymphoma Unit, Department of Onco-Hematology, San Raffaele Hospital, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Vita-Salute University, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'Tumor Biology and Vascular Targeting Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan 20132, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Vita-Salute University, Milan 20132, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromogranin A/blood/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptide Fragments/*pharmacology', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/*methods']",2016/05/21 06:00,2018/01/16 06:00,['2016/05/21 06:00'],"['2016/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/16 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jul 5;7(27):41725-41736. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9407.,10.18632/oncotarget.9407 [doi],,"['0 (Chromogranin A)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proton Pump Inhibitors)']",PMC5173091,['NOTNLM'],"['chromogranin A', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'endothelial barrier function', 'tumor cell trafficking', 'vasostatin-1']",['No competing financial interest.'],"['9407 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9407 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A national population-based survey was undertaken of survivors of high-risk NBL (N = 99), diagnosed between 1991 and 2010 and treated with HSCT. Parents completed a proxy questionnaire incorporating two HRQL measures, Health Utilities Index (HUI) 2 and 3. Children >12 years of age provided self-assessments. Clinical and demographic data were collected. Independent t-test and one-way analysis of variance were used to assess differences. Comparative data were obtained from previously published work and Statistics Canada's 1998 National Population Health Survey. RESULTS: On a scale of 0 (being dead) to 1.0 (perfect health), mean HRQL utility scores were 0.89 (SD = 0.11) in HUI2 and 0.84 (SD = 0.18) in HUI3. Parents reported morbidity in sensation (52.5%), pain (30.3%), cognition (28.0%), and emotion (24.2%) in HUI2 and in hearing (38.4%), pain (30.3%), cognition (27.3%), and speech (23.2%) in HUI3. HRQL was not significantly different compared to NBL survivors treated without HSCT, but was less than in nontransplanted survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Wilms tumor, and children in the general population, yet higher than in survivors of brain tumors. CONCLUSIONS: HRQL is compromised in high-risk NBL survivors treated with and without HSCT. A differential effect on hearing reflects additional exposure to platinum-based chemotherapy. These results should inform long-term care and the development of new therapeutic interventions.","['Portwine, Carol', 'Rae, Charlene', 'Davis, Jeff', 'Teira, Pierre', 'Schechter, Tal', 'Lewis, Victor', 'Mitchell, David', 'Wall, Donna A', 'Pullenayegum, Eleanor', 'Barr, Ronald D']","['Portwine C', 'Rae C', 'Davis J', 'Teira P', 'Schechter T', 'Lewis V', 'Mitchell D', 'Wall DA', 'Pullenayegum E', 'Barr RD']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."", 'Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', ""BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."", 'Hopital Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', ""Alberta Children's Hospital, Calgary, Alberta, Canada."", 'McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Pediatrics and Child Health, University of Manitoba/CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."", 'Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition', 'Female', 'Hearing', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neuroblastoma/mortality/*psychology/therapy', '*Quality of Life', '*Survivors']",2016/05/21 06:00,2017/06/22 06:00,['2016/05/21 06:00'],"['2016/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/16 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Sep;63(9):1615-21. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26063.

Here, we demonstrated that DS/copper (Cu) complex effectively eliminated adult B-ALL cells in vitro and in vivo in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) humanized mouse models, reflected by inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, suppression of colony formation, and reduction of PDX tumor growth, while sparing normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Mechanistically, these events were associated with disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Further analysis on B-ALL patients' clinical characteristics revealed that the ex vivo efficacy of DS/Cu in primary samples was significantly correlated to p16 gene deletion and peripheral blood WBC counts at diagnosis, while age, LDH level, extramedullary infiltration, status post intensive induction therapy, immune phenotype, risk category, and Ph chromosome had no effect.

However, children and older adults seem to have experienced more significant clinical benefits than adolescents and young adults (AYAs). Previous studies suggest a prolonged diagnostic pathway in AYAs, but little is known about their pre-diagnostic healthcare use. This study investigates the use of primary care among AYAs during the two years preceding a cancer diagnosis. METHODS: The study is a retrospective population-based matched cohort study using Danish nationwide registry data. All persons diagnosed with cancer during 2002-2011 in the age group 15-39 years were included (N = 12,306); each participant was matched on gender, age and general practice with 10 randomly selected references (N = 123,060). The use of primary healthcare services (face-to-face contacts, blood tests and psychometric tests) was measured during the two years preceding the diagnosis (index date), and collected data were analysed in a negative binomial regression model. RESULTS: The cases generally increased their use of primary care already from 8 months before a cancer diagnosis, whereas a similar trend was not found for controls. The increase was observed for all cancer types, but it started at different times: 17 months before a diagnosis of CNS tumour, 12 months before a diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma, 9 months before a diagnosis of lymphoma, 5-6 months before a diagnosis of leukaemia, bone tumour or GCT, and 3 months before a diagnosis of malignant melanoma. CONCLUSION: The use of primary care among AYAs increase several months before a cancer diagnosis. The diagnostic intervals are generally short for malignant melanomas and long for brain tumours. A prolonged diagnostic pathway may indicate non-specific or vague symptomatology and low awareness of cancer among AYAs primary-care personnel. The findings suggest potential of faster cancer diagnosis in AYAs.","['Ahrensberg, Jette Moller', 'Fenger-Gron, Morten', 'Vedsted, Peter']","['Ahrensberg JM', 'Fenger-Gron M', 'Vedsted P']","['Research Unit for General Practice, Department of Public Health, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Research Centre for Cancer Diagnosis in Primary Care, Department of Public Health, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Research Unit for General Practice, Department of Public Health, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Research Centre for Cancer Diagnosis in Primary Care, Department of Public Health, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Research Unit for General Practice, Department of Public Health, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Research Centre for Cancer Diagnosis in Primary Care, Department of Public Health, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'General Practice/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis', 'Primary Health Care/*statistics & numerical data', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",2016/05/21 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2016/05/21 06:00'],"['2015/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 May 20;11(5):e0155933. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0155933. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0155933 [doi],20160520,,PMC4874574,,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0155933 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-17458 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We review how their integrated actions with each other, shared co-factors and other transcription factors are disrupted in cancer. Steroid hormone nuclear receptors are oncogenic drivers in breast and prostate cancer and blockade of signaling is a major therapeutic goal. By contrast to blockade of receptors, in other cancers enhanced receptor function is attractive, as illustrated initially with targeting of retinoic acid receptors in leukemia. In the post-genomic era large consortia, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, have developed a remarkable volume of genomic data with which to examine multiple aspects of nuclear receptor status in a pan-cancer manner. Therefore to extend the review of NR function we have also undertaken bioinformatics analyses of NR expression in over 3000 tumors, spread across six different tumor types (bladder, breast, colon, head and neck, liver and prostate). Specifically, to ask how the NR expression was distorted (altered expression, mutation and CNV) we have applied bootstrapping approaches to simulate data for comparison, and also compared these NR findings to 12 other transcription factor families. Nuclear receptors were uniquely and uniformly downregulated across all six tumor types, more than predicted by chance. These approaches also revealed that each tumor type had a specific NR expression profile but these were most similar between breast and prostate cancer. Some NRs were down-regulated in at least five tumor types (e.g. NR3C2/MR and NR5A2/LRH-1)) whereas others were uniquely down-regulated in one tumor (e.g. NR1B3/RARG). The downregulation was not driven by copy number variation or mutation and epigenetic mechanisms maybe responsible for the altered nuclear receptor expression.","['Long, Mark D', 'Campbell, Moray J']","['Long MD', 'Campbell MJ']","['Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm & Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm & Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Egypt,Nucl Receptor Res,Nuclear receptor research,101633889,,,2016/05/21 06:00,2016/05/21 06:01,['2016/05/21 06:00'],"['2016/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/21 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Nucl Receptor Res. 2015 Dec;2. doi: 10.11131/2015/101182.

Initially, we were not successful in catheterizing the splenic artery from the celiac trunk due to significant atherosclerotic disease. Therefore, we successfully managed to access the distal splenic artery through patent gastro-epiploic collateral circulation along the greater curvature of the stomach. Partial splenic embolization was successfully performed and resulted in improvement of the patient's peripheral blood cell count as well as 60-70% reduction in the size of the spleen on follow up. Our case highlights an alternative pathway for splenic artery embolization when catheterization of the splenic artery is not feasible. To our knowledge, the use of gastro-epiploic collaterals to embolize the spleen has not been previously reported in literature.","['Saddekni, Souheil', 'Moustafa, Amr Soliman', 'Tahoon, Hany A', 'Setita, Mostafa', 'Abdel-Aal, Ahmed Kamel']","['Saddekni S', 'Moustafa AS', 'Tahoon HA', 'Setita M', 'Abdel-Aal AK']","['Department of Radiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), Birmingham, Alabama, USA; Department of Radiology, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.', 'Department of Radiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), Birmingham, Alabama, USA; Department of Radiology, University of Cairo, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Radiol Case Rep,Journal of radiology case reports,101494925,IM,"['Aged', 'Collateral Circulation', 'Embolization, Therapeutic/*methods', 'Humans', 'Hypersplenism/*diagnostic imaging/etiology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications', 'Male', 'Stomach/*blood supply', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2016/05/21 06:00,2017/04/30 06:00,['2016/05/21 06:00'],"['2016/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,J Radiol Case Rep. 2016 Mar 31;10(3):28-35. doi: 10.3941/jrcr.v10i3.2581. eCollection 2016 Mar.,10.3941/jrcr.v10i3.2581 [doi],20160331,,PMC4861616,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*Gastro-epiploic collaterals', '*Hypersplenism', '*Splenic artery calcification', '*Splenic embolization']",,"['10.3941/jrcr.v10i3.2581 [doi]', 'jrcr-10-3-28 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using whole-exome and deep-targeted sequencing, we dissect evolution of ibrutinib resistance in serial samples from five chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients. In two patients, we detect BTK-C481S mutation or multiple PLCG2 mutations. The other three patients exhibit an expansion of clones harbouring del(8p) with additional driver mutations (EP300, MLL2 and EIF2A), with one patient developing trans-differentiation into CD19-negative histiocytic sarcoma. Using droplet-microfluidic technology and growth kinetic analyses, we demonstrate the presence of ibrutinib-resistant subclones and estimate subclone size before treatment initiation. Haploinsufficiency of TRAIL-R, a consequence of del(8p), results in TRAIL insensitivity, which may contribute to ibrutinib resistance. These findings demonstrate that the ibrutinib therapy favours selection and expansion of rare subclones already present before ibrutinib treatment, and provide insight into the heterogeneity of genetic changes associated with ibrutinib resistance.","['Burger, Jan A', 'Landau, Dan A', 'Taylor-Weiner, Amaro', 'Bozic, Ivana', 'Zhang, Huidan', 'Sarosiek, Kristopher', 'Wang, Lili', 'Stewart,

Preclinical data was integrated in a PK/PD model which included (1) a plasma PK model characterizing disposition and clearance of inotuzumab ozogamicin and its released payload N-Ac-gamma-calicheamicin DMH, (2) a tumor disposition model describing ADC diffusion into the tumor extracellular environment, (3) a cellular model describing inotuzumab ozogamicin binding to CD22, internalization, intracellular N-Ac-gamma-calicheamicin DMH release, binding to DNA, or efflux from the tumor cell, and (4) tumor growth and inhibition in mouse xenograft models. The preclinical model was translated to the clinic by incorporating human PK for inotuzumab ozogamicin and clinically relevant tumor volumes, tumor growth rates, and values for CD22 expression in the relevant patient populations. The resulting stochastic models predicted progression-free survival (PFS) rates for inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients comparable to the observed clinical results. The model suggested that a fractionated dosing regimen is superior to a conventional dosing regimen for ALL but not for NHL. Simulations indicated that tumor growth is a highly sensitive parameter and predictive of successful outcome. Inotuzumab ozogamicin PK and N-Ac-gamma-calicheamicin DMH efflux are also sensitive parameters and would be considered more useful predictors of outcome than CD22 receptor expression. In summary, a multiscale, mechanism-based model has been developed for inotuzumab ozogamicin, which can integrate preclinical biomeasures and PK/PD data to predict clinical response.","['Betts, Alison M', 'Haddish-Berhane, Nahor', 'Tolsma, John', 'Jasper, Paul', 'King, Lindsay E', 'Sun, Yongliang', 'Chakrapani, Subramanyam', 'Shor, Boris', 'Boni, Joseph', 'Johnson, Theodore R']","['Betts AM', 'Haddish-Berhane N', 'Tolsma J', 'Jasper P', 'King LE', 'Sun Y', 'Chakrapani S', 'Shor B', 'Boni J', 'Johnson TR']","['Department of Pharmacokinetics Dynamics and Metabolism, Pfizer Global Research and Development, Groton, Connecticut, 06340, USA. alison.betts@pfizer.com.', 'Department of Pharmacokinetics Dynamics and Metabolism - NBE, Pfizer Global Research and Development, Eastern Point Road, Groton, Connecticut, 06340, USA. alison.betts@pfizer.com.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, Quantitative Sciences, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Spring House, Pennsylvania, 19002, USA.', 'RES Group, Inc., 75 Second Avenue, Needham, Massachusetts, 02494, USA.', 'RES Group, Inc., 75 Second Avenue, Needham, Massachusetts, 02494, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacokinetics Dynamics and Metabolism, Pfizer Global Research and Development, Groton, Connecticut, 06340, USA.', 'Clinical Translational Technologies & Operations, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Pennington, New Jersey, 08534, USA.', 'Department of World Wide Medicinal Chemistry, Pfizer Global Research and Development, Groton, Connecticut, 06340, USA.', 'Immune Pharmaceuticals Inc., 430 East 29th Street, Suite 940, New York, New York, 10016, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Pfizer Global Research and Development, Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacokinetics, Dynamics and Metabolism, Pfizer Global Research and Development, La Jolla, California, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,AAPS J,The AAPS journal,101223209,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/methods', '*Computer Simulation', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', 'Inotuzumab Ozogamicin', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Translational Research, Biomedical/*methods', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/*methods']",2016/05/21 06:00,2017/01/21 06:00,['2016/05/21 06:00'],"['2016/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/21 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,AAPS J. 2016 Sep;18(5):1101-1116. doi: 10.1208/s12248-016-9929-7.

By combining data on recurrent gene mutations (BIRC3, MYD88, NOTCH1, SF3B1 and TP53) and cytogenetic aberrations, we reveal a subset-biased acquisition of gene mutations. More specifically, the frequency of NOTCH1 mutations was found to be enriched in subsets expressing unmutated immunoglobulin genes, i.e. #1, #6, #8 and #59 (22-34%), often in association with trisomy 12, and was significantly different (P<0.001) to the frequency observed in subset #2 (4%, aggressive disease, variable somatic hypermutation status) and subset #4 (1%, indolent disease, mutated immunoglobulin genes). Interestingly, subsets harboring a high frequency of NOTCH1 mutations were found to carry few (if any) SF3B1 mutations. This starkly contrasts with subsets #2 and #3 where, despite their immunogenetic differences, SF3B1 mutations occurred in 45% and 46% of cases, respectively. In addition, mutations within TP53, whilst enriched in subset #1 (16%), were rare in subsets #2 and #8 (both 2%), despite all being clinically aggressive. All subsets were negative for MYD88 mutations, whereas BIRC3 mutations were infrequent. Collectively, this striking bias and skewed distribution of mutations and cytogenetic aberrations within specific chronic lymphocytic leukemia subsets implies that the mechanisms underlying clinical aggressiveness are not uniform, but rather support the existence of distinct genetic pathways of clonal evolution governed by a particular stereotyped B-cell receptor selecting a certain molecular lesion(s).","['Sutton, Lesley-Ann', 'Young, Emma', 'Baliakas, Panagiotis', 'Hadzidimitriou, Anastasia', 'Moysiadis, Theodoros', 'Plevova, Karla', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Kminkova, Jana', 'Stalika,

A study from the Swedish Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Group.,1573-1580,"Ibrutinib, a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor is approved for relapsed/refractory and del(17p)/TP53 mutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Discrepancies between clinical trials and routine health-care are commonly observed in oncology. Herein we report real-world results for 95 poor prognosis Swedish patients treated with ibrutinib in a compassionate use program. Ninety-five consecutive patients (93 chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 2 small lymphocytic leukemia) were included in the study between May 2014 and May 2015. The median age was 69 years. 63% had del(17p)/TP53 mutation, 65% had Rai stage III/IV, 28% had lymphadenopathy >/=10cm. Patients received ibrutinib 420 mg once daily until progression. At a median follow-up of 10.2 months, the overall response rate was 84% (consistent among subgroups) and 77% remained progression-free. Progression-free survival and overall survival were significantly shorter in patients with del(17p)/TP53 mutation (P=0.017 and P=0.027, log-rank test); no other factor was significant in Cox proportional regression hazards model. Ibrutinib was well tolerated. Hematomas occurred in 46% of patients without any major bleeding. Seven patients had Richter's transformation. This real-world analysis on consecutive chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients from a well-defined geographical region shows the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib to be similar to that of pivotal trials. Yet, del(17p)/TP53 mutation remains a therapeutic challenge. Since not more than half of our patients would have qualified for the pivotal ibrutinib trial (RESONATE), our study emphasizes that real-world results should be carefully considered in future with regards to new agents and new indications in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Winqvist, Maria', 'Asklid, Anna', 'Andersson, P O', 'Karlsson, Karin', 'Karlsson, Claes', 'Lauri, Birgitta', 'Lundin, Jeanette', 'Mattsson, Mattias', 'Norin, Stefan', 'Sandstedt, Anna', 'Hansson, Lotta', 'Osterborg, Anders']","['Winqvist M', 'Asklid A', 'Andersson PO', 'Karlsson K', 'Karlsson C', 'Lauri B', 'Lundin J', 'Mattsson M', 'Norin S', 'Sandstedt A', 'Hansson L', 'Osterborg A']","['Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, South Alvsborg Hospital, Boras, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology and Vascular Disorders, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Sunderby Hospital, Sunderbyn Lulea, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Linkoping University Hospital, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden lotta.hansson@karolinska.se.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Compassionate Use Trials', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Piperidines', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Retreatment', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sweden', 'Treatment Outcome']",2016/05/21 06:00,2017/07/01 06:00,['2016/05/21 06:00'],"['2016/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2016 Dec;101(12):1573-1580. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.144576.

Insight into this association may inform the development of HER2-targeted therapies that penetrate the blood-brain barrier. We examined HER2 overexpression and gene amplification in 708 patients with EAC who underwent curative-intent surgery during a time period (1980-1997) when no patient received HER2-targeted therapy. We identified patients whose site of first cancer recurrence was CNS and those who had a CNS relapse at any time. After a median follow-up of 61.2 months, 3.4% (24/708) of patients developed CNS relapse (all involved the brain). Patients with HER2-positive (vs -negative) primary tumors showed a higher 5-year cumulative incidence of CNS relapse as first recurrence (5.8% vs. 1.2%; p = 0.0058) and at any time (8.3% vs. 2.4%; p = 0.0062). In a multivariable model that included covariates previously associated with HER2 or with CNS relapse in breast cancer, HER2 positivity was the only variable that was statistically significantly associated with shorter time to CNS relapse as first recurrence (p = 0.0026) or at any time (hazard ratio 4.3 [95% confidence interval 1.8 to 10.3]; p = 0.001). These are the first data in a non-breast cancer to demonstrate an association between HER2 positivity and higher CNS relapse risk after surgery, and suggest that HER2-positive EACs have a predilection for CNS metastases.","['Yoon, Harry H', 'Lewis, Mark A', 'Foster, Nathan R', 'Sukov, William R', 'Khan, Maliha', 'Sattler, Christopher A', 'Wiktor, Anne E', 'Wu, Tsung-Teh', 'Jenkins, Robert B', 'Sinicrope, Frank A']","['Yoon HH', 'Lewis MA', 'Foster NR', 'Sukov WR', 'Khan M', 'Sattler CA', 'Wiktor AE', 'Wu TT', 'Jenkins RB', 'Sinicrope FA']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Department of Cytogenetics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Department of Leukemia Department, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Cytogenetics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Mayo Collaborative Services, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Anatomic Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Department of Cytogenetics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Esophagogastric Junction/enzymology/*pathology', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*enzymology/genetics/pathology']",2016/05/21 06:00,2017/06/24 06:00,['2016/05/21 06:00'],"['2016/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2016 Oct 1;139(7):1626-31. doi: 10.1002/ijc.30200.

We studied echocardiographic tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) and velocity vector imaging (VVI) in long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) before and after an exercise intervention. METHODS: Twenty-one asymptomatic, anthracycline-treated, long-term childhood ALL survivors with matched controls were studied at baseline. Seventeen of the survivors participated in a 3-month home-based exercise program. Echocardiography with TDI and VVI was performed. RESULTS: At baseline, ejection fraction (60.7 +/- 4.7% vs. 62.3 +/- 3.7%, P = 0.22) and fractional shortening (32.6 +/- 3.1% vs. 34.0 +/- 2.8%, P = 0.13) were similar in survivors and controls. Lateral early diastolic mitral annulus velocity E' (32.81 +/- 5.71 cm/sec vs. 38.03 +/- 6.21 cm/sec, P = 0.01), E'/A' (1.60 +/- 0.48 vs. 2.07 +/- 0.63, P = 0.01), and E/E' (2.78 +/- 0.35 vs. 2.42 +/- 0.62, P = 0.04) were impaired compared to controls. Peak circumferential strain and strain rate were attenuated at apex (-24.50 +/- 3.46% vs. -28.06 +/- 4.39%, P = 0.01 and -1.47 +/- 0.22 sec(-1) vs. -1.68 +/- 0.33 sec(-1) , P = 0.02) compared to controls. After the intervention, early diastolic mitral inflow velocity E (87.76 +/- 12.54 cm/s vs. 95.28 +/- 10.48 cm/s, P = 0.04) and E' increased (31.78 +/- 5.50 cm/s vs. 34.96 +/- 5.41 cm/s, P < 0.01). Peak circumferential systolic and diastolic strain rates at mid-level (-1.22 +/- 0.21 sec(-1) vs. -1.35 +/- 0.24 sec(-1) , P = 0.04 and 1.25 +/- 0.25 sec(-1) vs. 1.48 +/- 0.35 sec(-1) , P < 0.01) improved after the exercise program. CONCLUSIONS: A simple home-based exercise program improved cardiac function in asymptomatic childhood ALL survivors. Adding TDI in routine echocardiographic examination may improve the recognition of early signs of ACT, and VVI may bring additional information. The improvements in cardiac function after the exercise program emphasize the importance of physical activity in this population.","['Jarvela, Liisa S', 'Saraste, Markku', 'Niinikoski, Harri', 'Hannukainen, Jarna C', 'Heinonen, Olli J', 'Lahteenmaki, Paivi M', 'Arola, Mikko', 'Kemppainen, Jukka']","['Jarvela LS', 'Saraste M', 'Niinikoski H', 'Hannukainen JC', 'Heinonen OJ', 'Lahteenmaki PM', 'Arola M', 'Kemppainen J']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University of Turku and Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.', 'Department of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine, University of Turku and Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University of Turku and Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.', 'Turku PET Centre, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.', 'Paavo Nurmi Centre, Department of Health and Physical activity, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University of Turku and Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.', 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Tampere and Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland.', 'Department of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine, University of Turku and Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.', 'Turku PET Centre, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Diastole/*physiology', '*Echocardiography, Doppler', 'Exercise', '*Exercise Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnostic imaging/mortality/*physiopathology/therapy', '*Survivors', '*Ventricular Function, Left']",2016/05/21 06:00,2017/06/22 06:00,['2016/05/21 06:00'],"['2015/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Sep;63(9):1629-35. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26051.

We demonstrated that expression of the Ik6 transcript, which lacked exons 3-6, was observed exclusively in BCR-ABL1(+) B ALL and lymphoid blast crisis CML (BC-CML) patients harbouring the IKZF1 Delta3-6 deletion. To confirm the hypothesis that illegitimate recombination activating gene protein (RAG)-mediated recombination events are involved in IKZF1 Delta3-6 deletion in BCR-ABL1 lymphoblastic leukaemia, we first demonstrated that the expression rates of RAG1 and RAG2, collectively called RAG, were higher in ALL and BC-CML (lymphoid). Notably, analysis of relationships among RAG, BCR-ABL1 and Ikaros 6 (Ik6) showed that Ik6 can be generated only if RAG and BCR-ABL1 are co-existing. The sequencing data showed that the deleted segments of introns 2 and 6 contained cryptic recombination signal sequences (cRSSs) and frequently had non-template nucleotides inserted between breakpoints. Furthermore, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) technology and demonstrated that the sequences directly flanking IKZF1 Delta3-6 deletion breakpoints have significantly higher levels of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) modifications. Overall, RAG expression, good-quality cRSS and a specific chromatin modification, H3K4me3, satisfy the conditions of RAG's off-target effects on IKZF1. Our work provides evidence for RAG-mediated IKZF1 Delta3-6 deletion. Our results raise the prospect that RAG is a valuable biomarker in disease surveillance. Dissecting the contribution of RAG should not only provide valuable mechanistic insights, but will also lead to a new therapeutic direction.","['Dong, Y', 'Liu, F', 'Wu, C', 'Li, S', 'Zhao, X', 'Zhang, P', 'Jiao, J', 'Yu, X', 'Ji, Y', 'Zhang, M']","['Dong Y', 'Liu F', 'Wu C', 'Li S', 'Zhao X', 'Zhang P', 'Jiao J', 'Yu X', 'Ji Y', 'Zhang M']","[""Department of Pathogenic Biology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center."", ""Ministry of Education of China, Key Laboratory of Environment and Genes Related to Diseases (Xi'an Jiaotong University)."", ""Department of Hematology, Xi'an Central Hospital."", ""Department of Pathogenic Biology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center."", ""Ministry of Education of China, Key Laboratory of Environment and Genes Related to Diseases (Xi'an Jiaotong University)."", ""Department of Pathogenic Biology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center."", ""Ministry of Education of China, Key Laboratory of Environment and Genes Related to Diseases (Xi'an Jiaotong University)."", ""Department of Pathogenic Biology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center."", ""Ministry of Education of China, Key Laboratory of Environment and Genes Related to Diseases (Xi'an Jiaotong University)."", ""Department of Pathogenic Biology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center."", ""Ministry of Education of China, Key Laboratory of Environment and Genes Related to Diseases (Xi'an Jiaotong University)."", ""Department of Pathogenic Biology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center."", ""Ministry of Education of China, Key Laboratory of Environment and Genes Related to Diseases (Xi'an Jiaotong University)."", ""Department of Pathogenic Biology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center."", ""Ministry of Education of China, Key Laboratory of Environment and Genes Related to Diseases (Xi'an Jiaotong University)."", ""Department of Pathogenic Biology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center."", ""Ministry of Education of China, Key Laboratory of Environment and Genes Related to Diseases (Xi'an Jiaotong University)."", ""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Shaanxi, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/blood/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/blood/genetics', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/blood/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",2016/05/21 06:00,2017/05/02 06:00,['2016/05/21 06:00'],"['2016/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/14 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/02 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2016 Sep;185(3):320-31. doi: 10.1111/cei.12812.

Clonal relationship in DLBCL relapses so far is mostly addressed by the investigation of immunoglobulin (IG) rearrangements, therefore, lacking deeper insights into genome-wide lymphoma evolution. We studied mutations and copy number aberrations in 20 paired relapsing and 20 non-relapsing DLBCL cases aiming to test the clonal relationship between primaries and relapses to track tumors' genetic evolution and to investigate the genetic background of DLBCL recurrence. Three clonally unrelated DLBCL relapses were identified (15%). Also, two distinct patterns of genetic evolution in clonally related relapses were detected as follows: (1) early-divergent/branching evolution from a common progenitor in 6 patients (30%), and (2) late-divergent/linear progression of relapses in 11 patients (65%). Analysis of recurrent genetic events identified potential early drivers of lymphomagenesis (KMT2D, MYD88, CD79B and PIM1). The most frequent relapse-specific events were additional mutations in KMT2D and alterations of MEF2B. SOCS1 mutations were exclusive to non-relapsing DLBCL, whereas primaries of relapsing DLBCL more commonly displayed gains of 10p15.3-p12.1 containing the potential oncogenes PRKCQ, GATA3, MLLT10 and ABI1. Altogether, our study expands the knowledge on clonal relationship, genetic evolution and mutational basis of DLBCL relapses.","['Juskevicius, D', 'Lorber, T', 'Gsponer, J', 'Perrina, V', 'Ruiz, C', 'Stenner-Liewen, F', 'Dirnhofer, S', 'Tzankov, A']","['Juskevicius D', 'Lorber T', 'Gsponer J', 'Perrina V', 'Ruiz C', 'Stenner-Liewen F', 'Dirnhofer S', 'Tzankov A']","['Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Oncology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Clone Cells', '*DNA Copy Number Variations', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Oncogenes', 'Recurrence']",2016/05/21 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2016/05/21 06:00'],"['2015/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/29 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Dec;30(12):2385-2395. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.135.

This pilot study in acute leukemia uses a restrictive compared to a liberal transfusion strategy. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized (2:1) study was conducted of restrictive (LOW) hemoglobin (Hb) trigger (7 g/dL) compared to higher (HIGH) Hb trigger (8 g/dL). The primary outcome was feasibility of conducting a larger trial. The four requirements for success required that more than 50% of the eligible patients could be consented, more than 75% of the patients randomized to the LOW arm tolerated the transfusion trigger, fewer than 15% of patients crossed over from the LOW arm to the HIGH arm, and no indication for the need to pause the study for safety concerns. Secondary outcomes included fatigue, bleeding, and RBCs and platelets transfused. RESULTS: Ninety patients were consented and randomly assigned to LOW to HIGH. The four criteria for the primary objective of feasibility were met. When the number of units transfused was compared, adjusting for baseline Hb, the LOW arm was transfused on average 8.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.9-9.1) units/patient while the HIGH arm received 11.7 (95% CI, 10.1-13.2) units (p = 0.0003). There was no significant difference in bleeding events or neutropenic fevers between study arms. CONCLUSION: This study establishes feasibility for trial of Hb thresholds in leukemia through demonstration of success in all primary outcome metrics and a favorable safety profile. This population requires further study to evaluate the equivalence of liberal and restrictive transfusion thresholds in this unique clinical setting.","['DeZern, Amy E', 'Williams, Katherine', 'Zahurak, Marianna', 'Hand, Wesley', 'Stephens, R Scott', 'King, Karen E', 'Frank, Steven M', 'Ness, Paul M']","['DeZern AE', 'Williams K', 'Zahurak M', 'Hand W', 'Stephens RS', 'King KE', 'Frank SM', 'Ness PM']","['The Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'The Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'The Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'The Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'The Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'The Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Division of Transfusion Medicine, Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Division of Transfusion Medicine, Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', '*Erythrocyte Transfusion', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic/standards']",2016/05/21 06:00,2017/06/24 06:00,['2016/05/21 06:00'],"['2016/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/02 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2016 Jul;56(7):1750-7. doi: 10.1111/trf.13658.

Identifying AML patients with t(8;21) who have a poor prognosis despite achieving remission is important for determining the best subsequent therapy. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of Wilm tumor gene-1 (WT1) transcript levels and cellular homolog of the viral oncogene v-KIT receptor tyrosine kinase (C-KIT) mutations at diagnosis, and RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels after the second consolidation chemotherapy cycle on outcomes. METHODS: Eighty-eight AML patients with t(8;21) who received chemotherapy only or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) were included. Patients who achieved remission, received two or more cycles of consolidation chemotherapy, and had a positive measureable residual disease (MRD) test result (defined as <3-log reduction in RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels compared to baseline) after 2-8 cycles of consolidation chemotherapy were recommended to receive allo-HSCT. Patients who had a negative MRD test result were recommended to receive further chemotherapy up to only 8 cycles. WT1 transcript levels and C-KIT mutations at diagnosis, and RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels after the second consolidation chemotherapy cycle were tested. RESULTS: Patients who had a C-KIT mutation had significantly lower WT1 transcript levels than patients who did not have a C-KIT mutation (6.7% +/- 10.6% vs. 19.5% +/- 19.9%, P < 0.001). Low WT1 transcript levels (</=5.0%) but not C-KIT mutation at diagnosis, a positive MRD test result after the second cycle of consolidation chemotherapy, and receiving only chemotherapy were independently associated with high cumulative incidence of relapse in all patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.53, 2.30, and 11.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.64-7.62, 1.82-7.56, and 4.43-29.82; P = 0.002, 0.034, and <0.001, respectively); these conditions were also independently associated with low leukemia-free survival (HR = 3.71, 2.33, and 5.85; 95% CI 1.82-7.56, 1.17-4.64, and 2.75-12.44; P < 0.001, 0.016, and <0.001, respectively) and overall survival (HR = 3.50, 2.32, and 4.34; 95% CI 1.56-7.82, 1.09-4.97, and 1.98-9.53; P = 0.002, 0.030, and <0.001, respectively) in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Testing for WT1 transcript levels at diagnosis in patients with AML and t(8;21) may predict outcomes in those who achieve remission. A randomized study is warranted to determine whether allo-HSCT can improve prognosis in these patients.","['Qin, Ya-Zhen', 'Wang, Yu', 'Zhu, Hong-Hu', 'Gale, Robert Peter', 'Zhang, Mei-Jie', 'Jiang, Qian', 'Jiang, Hao', 'Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Chen, Huan', 'Zhang, Xiao-Hui', 'Liu, Yan-Rong', 'Lai, Yue-Yun', 'Jiang, Bin', 'Liu, Kai-Yan', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Qin YZ', 'Wang Y', 'Zhu HH', 'Gale RP', 'Zhang MJ', 'Jiang Q', 'Jiang H', 'Xu LP', 'Chen H', 'Zhang XH', 'Liu YR', 'Lai YY', 'Jiang B', 'Liu KY', 'Huang XJ']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, No. 11 Xizhimen South Street, Beijing, P.

These mutations can be the basis for the detection of leukemic cells in follow-up samples. The aim of this study was to identify leukemia-specific mutations in cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia and to use these mutations as markers for minimal residual disease. Leukemic cells and normal lymphocytes were simultaneously isolated at diagnosis from 17 patients with acute myeloid leukemia using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Exome sequencing of these cells identified 240 leukemia-specific single nucleotide variations and 22 small insertions and deletions. Based on estimated allele frequencies and their accuracies, 191 of these mutations qualified as candidates for minimal residual disease analysis. Targeted deep sequencing with a significance threshold of 0.027% for single nucleotide variations and 0.006% for NPM1 type A mutation was developed for quantification of minimal residual disease. When tested on follow-up samples from a patient with acute myeloid leukemia, targeted deep sequencing of single nucleotide variations as well as NPM1 was more sensitive than minimal residual disease quantification with multiparameter flow cytometry. In conclusion, we here describe how exome sequencing can be used for identification of leukemia-specific mutations in samples already at diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia. We also show that targeted deep sequencing of such mutations, including single nucleotide variations, can be used for high-sensitivity quantification of minimal residual disease in a patient-tailored manner.","['Malmberg, Erik B R', 'Stahlman, Sara', 'Rehammar, Anna', 'Samuelsson, Tore', 'Alm, Sofie J', 'Kristiansson, Erik', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Garelius, Hege', 'Pettersson, Louise', 'Ehinger, Mats', 'Palmqvist, Lars', 'Fogelstrand, Linda']","['Malmberg EB', 'Stahlman S', 'Rehammar A', 'Samuelsson T', 'Alm SJ', 'Kristiansson E', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Garelius H', 'Pettersson L', 'Ehinger M', 'Palmqvist L', 'Fogelstrand L']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Mathematical Sciences, Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Mathematical Sciences, Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology and Coagulation, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Pathology, Hallands Hospital Halmstad, Halmstad, Sweden.', 'Division of Oncology and Pathology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Exome', 'Female', 'Genetic Testing', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Young Adult']",2016/05/21 06:00,2017/02/07 06:00,['2016/05/21 06:00'],"['2016/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2017 Jan;98(1):26-37. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12780.

We implemented a novel method (""medical condition-wide association study,"" MedWAS) to comprehensively evaluate medical risk factors for NHL documented in administrative health claims. METHODS: Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data, we conducted a case-control study comparing NHL cases [N = 52,691, age 66+ years, with five subtypes: chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), T-cell lymphoma (TCL)] to controls (N = 200,000). We systematically screened for associations with 5,926 medical conditions documented in Medicare claims more than 1 year before selection. RESULTS: Fifty-five conditions were variously associated with NHL. Examples include well-established associations of human immunodeficiency virus, solid organ transplantation, and hepatitis C virus with increased DLBCL risk (ORs 3.83, 4.27, and 1.74, respectively), and autoimmune conditions with DLBCL and MZL (e.g., ORs of 2.10 and 4.74, respectively, for Sjogren syndrome). Risks for all NHL subtypes were increased after diagnoses of nonmelanoma skin cancer (ORs 1.19-1.55), actinic keratosis (1.12-1.25), or hemolytic anemia (1.64-4.07). Nine additional skin conditions increased only TCL risk (ORs 2.20-4.12). Diabetes mellitus was associated with increased DLBCL risk (OR 1.09). Associations varied significantly across NHL subtypes for 49 conditions (89%). CONCLUSION: Using an exploratory method, we found numerous medical conditions associated with NHL risk, and many associations varied across NHL subtypes. IMPACT: These results point to etiologic heterogeneity among NHL subtypes. MedWAS is a new method for assessing the etiology of cancer and other diseases.

Shorter mean telomere length in leukemic cells has been associated with more aggressive disease. Germline polymorphisms in telomere maintenance genes affect telomere length and may contribute to CLL susceptibility. METHODS: We collected genome-wide data from two groups of patients with CLL (N = 273) and two control populations (N = 5,725). In ancestry-adjusted case-control comparisons, we analyzed eight SNPs in genes definitively associated with inter-individual variation in leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in prior genome-wide association studies: ACYP2, TERC, NAF1, TERT, OBFC1, CTC1, ZNF208, and RTEL1 RESULTS: Three of the eight LTL-associated SNPs were associated with CLL risk at P < 0.05, including those near: TERC [OR, 1.46; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.15-1.86; P = 1.8 x 10(-3)], TERT (OR = 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02-1.48; P = 0.030), and OBFC1 (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.08-1.71; P = 9.6 x 10(-3)). Using a weighted linear combination of the eight LTL-associated SNPs, we observed that CLL patients were predisposed to longer LTL than controls in both case-control sets (P = 9.4 x 10(-4) and 0.032, respectively). CLL risk increased monotonically with increasing quintiles of the weighted linear combination. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variants in TERC, TERT, and OBFC1 are associated with both longer LTL and increased CLL risk. Because the human CST complex competes with shelterin for telomeric DNA, future work should explore the role of OBFC1 and other CST complex genes in leukemogenesis. IMPACT: A genetic predisposition to longer telomere length is associated with an increased risk of CLL, suggesting that the role of telomere length in CLL etiology may be distinct from its role in disease progression.

The identification of several TERT epitopes in tumor cells has elevated the status of TERT as a potential universal target for selective and broad adoptive immunotherapy. TERT-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) have been detected in the peripheral blood of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients, but display low functional avidity, which limits their clinical utility in adoptive cell transfer approaches. To overcome this key obstacle hindering effective immunotherapy, we isolated an HLA-A2-restricted T-cell receptor (TCR) with high avidity for human TERT from vaccinated HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice. Using several relevant humanized mouse models, we demonstrate that TCR-transduced T cells were able to control human B-CLL progression in vivo and limited tumor growth in several human, solid transplantable cancers. TERT-based adoptive immunotherapy selectively eliminated tumor cells, failed to trigger a self-MHC-restricted fratricide of T cells, and was associated with toxicity against mature granulocytes, but not toward human hematopoietic progenitors in humanized immune reconstituted mice. These data support the feasibility of TERT-based adoptive immunotherapy in clinical oncology, highlighting, for the first time, the possibility of utilizing a high-avidity TCR specific for human TERT.

Decreased expression of RKIP has been described in several human malignancies, including acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). As the mechanisms leading to RKIP loss in AML are still unclear, we aimed to analyze the potential involvement of miRNAs within this study. miRNA microarray and qPCR data of more than 400 AML patient specimens revealed correlation between decreased expression of RKIP and increased expression of miR-23a, a member of the miR-23a/27a/24-2 cluster. In functional experiments, overexpression of miR-23a decreased RKIP mRNA and protein expression, whereas miR-23a inhibition caused the opposite effect. By using an RKIP 3'-untranslated region luciferase reporter construct with and without mutation or deletion of the putative miR-23a-binding site, we could show that RKIP modulation by miR-23a is mediated via direct binding to this region. Importantly, miR-23a overexpression induced a significant increase of proliferation in hematopoietic cells. Simultaneous transfection of an RKIP expression construct lacking the miR-23a-binding sites reversed this phenotype, indicating that this effect is truly mediated via downregulation of RKIP. Finally, by analyzing more than 4,300 primary patient specimens via database retrieval from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we could highlight the importance of the miR-23a/RKIP axis in a broad range of human cancer entities. In conclusion, we have identified miR-23a as a negative regulator of RKIP expression in AML and have provided data that suggest the importance of our observation beyond this tumor entity.

We reported previously that the ribosomal protein Rpl22 is a tumor suppressor in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL), and that loss of just one Rpl22 allele accelerates T-cell lymphomagenesis by activating NF-kappaB and inducing the stem cell factor Lin28B. Here, we show that, paradoxically, loss of both alleles of Rpl22 restricts lymphoma progression through a distinct effect on migration of malignant cells out of the thymus. Lymphoma-prone AKT2-transgenic or PTEN-deficient mice on an Rpl22(-/-) background developed significantly larger and markedly more vascularized thymic tumors than those observed in Rpl22(+/+) control mice. But, unlike Rpl22(+/+) or Rpl22(+/-) tumors, Rpl22(-/-) lymphomas did not disseminate to the periphery and were retained in the thymus. We traced the defect in the Rpl22(-/-) lymphoma migratory capacity to downregulation of the KLF2 transcription factor and its targets, including the key migratory factor sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1). Indeed, reexpression of S1PR1 in Rpl22-deficient tumor cells restores their migratory capacity in vitro The regulation of KLF2 and S1PR1 by Rpl22 appears to be proximal as Rpl22 reexpression in Rpl22-deficient lymphoma cells restores expression of KLF2 and S1P1R, while Rpl22 knockdown in Rpl22-sufficient lymphomas attenuates their expression. Collectively, these data reveal that, while loss of one copy of Rpl22 promotes lymphomagenesis and disseminated disease, loss of both copies impairs responsiveness to migratory cues and restricts malignant cells to the thymus.

Here, we report the definition of miR-339-3p as a novel tumor suppressive microRNA that blocks melanoma cell invasion without affecting cell survival. miR-339-3p was identified by a comprehensive functional screen of a human miRNA mimetic library in a cell-based assay for invasion by the melanoma cell line A375. miR-339-3p was determined as a strong inhibitor of invasion differentially expressed in melanoma cells and healthy melanocytes. MCL1 was defined as a target for downregulation by miR-339-3p, functioning through direct interaction with the 3' untranslated region of MCL1 mRNA. Blocking miR-339-3p by an antagomiR was sufficient to increase melanoma cell invasion, an effect that could be phenocopied by RNAi-mediated silencing of MCL1. In vivo studies established that miR-339-3p overexpression was sufficient to decrease lung colonization by A375 melanoma cells in NSG mice, relative to control cells. Overall, our results defined miR-339-3p as a melanoma tumor suppressor, the levels of which contributes to invasive aggressiveness. Cancer Res; 76(12); 3562-71.

In cell culture, MTAs exert their anticancer effects primarily by causing mitotic arrest and cell death. However, accumulating indirect evidence suggests that MTAs may exert their cytotoxicity in human tumors by interfering with interphase microtubules. In this study, we sought to develop and characterize an experimental system in which to test the hypothesis that MTAs induce cell death during interphase. Primary adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells treated with vincristine only weakly exhibited colocalization between mitotic and apoptotic markers and major characteristics of mitotic death, such as an increase in cells with 4N DNA content before the appearance of cells with <2N DNA content, suggesting a mixed response. Therefore, we separated ALL cells into distinct phases of the cell cycle by centrifugal elutriation, labeled cells with 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), and then treated each population with vincristine. Cells isolated during G1 underwent cell death without evidence of EdU uptake, indicating that the cytotoxic effects of vincristine took place during G1 Conversely, cells isolated during S or G2-M phases underwent death following mitotic arrest. Thus, vincristine induces distinct death programs in primary ALL cells depending on cell-cycle phase, and cells in G1 are particularly susceptible to perturbation of interphase microtubules. Primary ALL cells may therefore provide a powerful model system in which to study the multimodal mechanisms underlying MTA-induced cell death. Cancer Res; 76(12); 3553-61.

MBL (monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis) is considered a precursor state of the disease. Although CLL is incurable it is an indolent disorder and often detected incidentally on routine blood counts. Until now little information has been available on CLL in Iceland, including the incidence, diagnosis, symptoms or MBL precursor state. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective, descriptive study including CLL patients diagnosed in Iceland over the years 2003-2013. Registries of patients with a CLL diagnosis were obtained from the Icelandic Cancer Registry, Landspitali National University Hospital and the Medical Center in Mjodd. Medical records were reviewed for information on symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. Survival data and causes of death were obtained from national registries. RESULTS: The number of patients diagnosed with CLL over the study period was 161 (109 males, 52 females). The calculated incidence was 4.55/100,000, and the age-standardized incidence was 3.00/100,000. Mean age at diagnosis was 70.9 years (range 35-96 years). The Icelandic Cancer Registry lacked information on 28 patients (17.4%). The initial diagnosis of CLL was obtained exclusively with flow cytometry in 47.2% of cases. Symptoms were present at diagnosis in 67 of 151 patients (44.4%). One third of the group received chemotherapy and the average time to treatment was 1.3 years. Five-year survival was 70% and median survival was 9.4 years. Elevated lymphocyte counts (>/=4,0x109/L) in peripheral blood prior (0.1 to 13.4 years) to diagnosis of CLL was identified in 85 of 99 CLL patients (85.9%). CONCLUSION: The incidence of CLL in Iceland is similar to other Western countries. The registration of CLL cases in the Icelandic Cancer Registry must be improved, especially in cases where diagnosis is based solely on flow cytometry. Elevated lymphocyte counts were present in a large proportion of cases prior to the diagnosis of CLL.

Recent evidence indicates that altered crosstalk between CML and mesenchymal stromal cells may affect leukaemia survival; moreover, vesicles released by both tumour and non-tumour cells into the microenvironment provide a suitable niche for cancer cell growth and survival. We previously demonstrated that leukaemic and stromal cells establish an exosome-mediated bidirectional crosstalk leading to the production of IL8 in stromal cells, thus sustaining the survival of CML cells. Human cell lines used are LAMA84 (CML cells), HS5 (stromal cells) and bone marrow primary stromal cells; gene expression and protein analysis were performed by real-time PCR and Western blot. IL8 and MMP9 secretions were evaluated by ELISA. Exosomes were isolated from CML cells and blood samples of CML patients. Here, we show that LAMA84 and CML patients' exosomes contain amphiregulin (AREG), thus activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling in stromal cells. EGFR signalling increases the expression of SNAIL and its targets, MMP9 and IL8. We also demonstrated that pre-treatment of HS5 with LAMA84 exosomes increases the expression of annexin A2 that promotes the adhesion of leukaemic cells to the stromal monolayer, finally supporting the growth and invasiveness of leukaemic cells. Leukaemic and stromal cells establish a bidirectional crosstalk: exosomes promote proliferation and survival of leukaemic cells, both in vitro and in vivo, by inducing IL8 secretion from stromal cells. We propose that this mechanism is activated by a ligand-receptor interaction between AREG, found in CML exosomes, and EGFR in bone marrow stromal cells.","['Corrado, Chiara', 'Saieva, Laura', 'Raimondo, Stefania', 'Santoro, Alessandra', 'De Leo, Giacomo', 'Alessandro, Riccardo']","['Corrado C', 'Saieva L', 'Raimondo S', 'Santoro A', 'De Leo G', 'Alessandro R']","['Dipartimento di Biopatologia e Biotecnologie Mediche, Universita degli studi di Palermo, sezione di Biologia e Genetica, Palermo, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biopatologia e Biotecnologie Mediche, Universita degli studi di Palermo, sezione di Biologia e Genetica, Palermo, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biopatologia e Biotecnologie Mediche, Universita degli studi di Palermo, sezione di Biologia e Genetica, Palermo, Italy.', 'Divisione di Ematologia, A.O.

As a result, there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies that target hypoxic cells within the tumor microenvironment. The Proviral Integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM) kinases represent a prosurvival pathway that is upregulated in response to hypoxia, in a HIF-1-independent manner. We demonstrate that pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of PIM kinases is significantly more toxic toward cancer cells in hypoxia as compared with normoxia. Xenograft studies confirm that PIM kinase inhibitors impede tumor growth and selectively kill hypoxic tumor cells in vivo Experiments show that PIM kinases enhance the ability of tumor cells to adapt to hypoxia-induced oxidative stress by increasing the nuclear localization and activity of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which functions to increase the expression of antioxidant genes. Small molecule PIM kinase inhibitors prevent Nrf2 from accumulating in the nucleus, reducing the transcription of cytoprotective genes and leading to the build-up of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) to toxic levels in hypoxic tumor cells. This toxic effect of PIM inhibitors can be successfully blocked by ROS scavengers, including N-acetyl cystine and superoxide dismutase. Thus, inhibition of PIM kinases has the potential to oppose hypoxia-mediated therapeutic resistance and induce cell death in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Mol Cancer Ther; 15(7); 1637-47.

Unfortunately, this therapeutic approach has limited efficacy and significant toxicity and the majority of AML patients still die of their disease. In contrast to the poor prognosis of most AML patients, most individuals with a rare subtype of AML, acute promyelocytic leukemia, can be cured by differentiation therapy using regimens containing all-trans retinoic acid. GSK3 has been previously identified as a therapeutic target in AML where its inhibition can lead to the differentiation and growth arrest of leukemic cells. Unfortunately, existing GSK3 inhibitors lead to suboptimal differentiation activity making them less useful as clinical AML differentiation agents. Here, we describe the discovery of a novel GSK3 inhibitor, GS87. GS87 was discovered in efforts to optimize GSK3 inhibition for AML differentiation activity. Despite GS87's dramatic ability to induce AML differentiation, kinase profiling reveals its high specificity in targeting GSK3 as compared with other kinases. GS87 demonstrates high efficacy in a mouse AML model system and unlike current AML therapeutics, exhibits little effect on normal bone marrow cells. GS87 induces potent differentiation by more effectively activating GSK3-dependent signaling components including MAPK signaling as compared with other GSK3 inhibitors. GS87 is a novel GSK3 inhibitor with therapeutic potential as a differentiation agent for non-promyelocytic AML. Mol Cancer Ther; 15(7); 1485-94.

We endeavored to determine whether this approach would be efficacious in glioblastoma. To diminish nucleoside biosynthesis, we utilized compound DI-39, which selectively targets NSP, in combination with thymidine (dT), which selectively targets DNP. We employed in vitro and ex vivo models to determine the effects of pretreatment with dT + DI-39 on brain tumor stem cells (BTSC). Here, we demonstrate that this combinatorial therapy elicits a differential response across a spectrum of human patient-derived glioblastoma cultures. As determined by apoptotic markers, most cultures were relatively resistant to treatment, although a subset was highly sensitive. Sensitivity was unrelated to S-phase delay and to DNA damage induced by treatment. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that response across cultures was associated with the transcription factor PAX3 (associated with resistance) and with canonical pathways, including the nucleotide excision repair pathway, PTEN (associated with resistance), PI3K/AKT (associated with sensitivity), and ErbB2-ErbB3. Our in vitro assays demonstrated that, in sensitive cultures, clonal sphere formation was reduced upon removal from pretreatment. In contrast, in a resistant culture, clonal sphere formation was slightly increased upon removal from pretreatment. Moreover, in an intracranial xenograft model, pretreatment of a sensitive culture caused significantly smaller and fewer tumors. In a resistant culture, tumors were equivalent irrespective of pretreatment. These results indicate that, in the subset of sensitive glioblastoma, BTSCs are targeted by inhibition of pyrimidine synthesis. Mol Cancer Ther; 15(6); 1271-8.

Although castration therapy is initially effective, prostate cancers progress to hormone-refractory disease and in this case taxane-based chemotherapy is widely used. Castration-resistant prostate cancer cells often develop resistance to chemotherapy agents and the search for new therapeutic strategies is necessary. In this article, we demonstrate that PKCdelta silencing favors mitotic arrest after paclitaxel treatment in PC3 and LNCaP cells; however, this is associated with resistance to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. In prostate cancer cells, PKCdelta seems to exert a proapoptotic role, acting as a negative regulator of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. PKCdelta silencing induces activation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and the expression of its target genes, including Aurora kinase A, which is involved in activation of Akt and both factors play a key role in GSK3beta inactivation and consequently in the stabilization of beta-catenin and antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1. We also show that combined treatments with paclitaxel and Wnt/beta-catenin or Akt inhibitors improve the apoptotic response to paclitaxel, even in the absence of PKCdelta. Finally, we observe that high Gleason score prostate tumors lose PKCdelta expression and this correlates with higher activation of beta-catenin, inactivation of GSK3beta, and higher levels of Aurora kinase A and Mcl-1 proteins. These findings suggest that targeting Wnt/beta-catenin or Akt pathways may increase the efficacy of taxane chemotherapy in advanced human prostate cancers that have lost PKCdelta expression.

In our study, we investigated whether osimertinib (AZD9291), a third-generation irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor of both activating EGFR mutations and resistance-associated T790M point mutation, could reverse MDR induced by ABCB1 and ABCG2 in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo Our results showed that osimertinib significantly increased the sensitivity of ABCB1- and ABCG2-overexpressing cells to their substrate chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and in the model of ABCB1-overexpressing KBv200 cell xenograft in nude mice. Mechanistically, osimertinib increased the intracellular accumulations of doxorubicin (DOX) and Rhodamine 123 (Rho 123) by inhibiting the efflux function of the transporters in ABCB1- or ABCG2-overexpressing cells but not in their parental sensitive cells. Furthermore, osimertinib stimulated the ATPase activity of both ABCB1 and ABCG2 and competed with the [(125)I] iodoarylazidoprazosin photolabeling bound to ABCB1 or ABCG2, but did not alter the localization and expression of ABCB1 or ABCG2 in mRNA and protein levels nor the phosphorylations of EGFR, AKT, and ERK. Importantly, osimertinib also enhanced the cytotoxicity of DOX and intracellular accumulation of Rho 123 in ABCB1-overexpressing primary leukemia cells. Overall, these findings suggest osimertinib reverses ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated MDR via inhibiting ABCB1 and ABCG2 from pumping out chemotherapeutic agents and provide possibility for cancer combinational therapy with osimertinib in the clinic.

Although timely anticoagulation resolves SVT, unrecognized SVT frequently leads to portal hypertension and, potentially, variceal bleeding, which may render anticoagulation difficult. Thus, early identification of SVT development is clinically relevant in MPN patients.In this retrospective analysis, we included 126 patients with MPN and/or SVT referred to our hospital between 2009 and 2014. A total of 86 patients diagnosed with MPN formed the first cohort (PV n = 18, ET n = 16, and MF n = 40), whereas 40 patients who had SVT without adjunct MPN formed a control cohort. Median follow-up period was 960 days. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed for the identification of potential biomarkers applying descriptive statistics, nonparametric testing, Kaplan-Meier, and logistic regression analysis. The relevance of the identified biomarkers was evaluated in an independent 2nd cohort of 181 patients from the MPN registry of the Study Alliance of Leukemia (SAL-MPN).Thirty-three MPN patients (38%) in the 1st cohort had SVT. Elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, serum bilirubin, or gamma-GT were significantly correlated to the presence of SVT. In multivariate testing, CRP and aspartate aminotransferase were predictors for survival and gamma-GT remained the only significant variable associated with SVT in MPN patients (P < 0.05). These findings were confirmed in the 2nd cohort comprising 42% of patients with MPN suffering from SVT.Elevated gamma-GT levels indicate SVT in MPN patients, whereas CRP levels are independent predictors of patient survival.","['Gortzen, Jan', 'Hunka, Lena M', 'Vonnahme, Maria', 'Praktiknjo, Michael', 'Kaifie, Andrea', 'Fimmers, Rolf', 'Jansen, Christian', 'Heine, Annkristin', 'Lehmann, Jennifer', 'Goethert, Joachim R', 'Gattermann, Norbert', 'Goekkurt, Eray', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Brossart, Peter', 'Strassburg, Christian P', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Koschmieder, Steffen', 'Wolf, Dominik', 'Trebicka, Jonel']","['Gortzen J', 'Hunka LM', 'Vonnahme M', 'Praktiknjo M', 'Kaifie A', 'Fimmers R', 'Jansen C', 'Heine A', 'Lehmann J', 'Goethert JR', 'Gattermann N', 'Goekkurt E', 'Platzbecker U', 'Brossart P', 'Strassburg CP', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Koschmieder S', 'Wolf D', 'Trebicka J']","['From the Department of Internal Medicine I (GJ, HLM, PM, JC, LJ, SC, TJ); Department of Medical Clinic III, University of Bonn, Bonn (VM, HA, BP, WD); Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and SCT, Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital of the RWTH Aachen University, Aachen (KA, BTH, KS); Department of Biometrics, Informatics and Epidemiology, University of Bonn, Bonn (FR); Department for Hematology, University Hospital Essen, Essen (GJ); Department for Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf (GN); Practice for Hematology-Oncology Eppendorf, Hamburg (GE); and Department for Hematology, University Hospital Dresden, Dresden, Germany (PU).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood', 'Bilirubin/blood', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'C-Reactive Protein/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polycythemia Vera/*blood', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*blood', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Splanchnic Circulation', 'Survival Rate', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*blood', 'Venous Thrombosis/*blood/diagnosis/enzymology', 'Young Adult', 'gamma-Glutamyltransferase/*blood']",2016/05/20 06:00,2017/02/18 06:00,['2016/05/20 06:00'],"['2016/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2016 May;95(20):e3355. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000003355.,10.1097/MD.0000000000003355 [doi],,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.2 (gamma-Glutamyltransferase)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)', 'RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)']",PMC4902387,,,,"['10.1097/MD.0000000000003355 [doi]', '00005792-201605170-00006 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Standard therapy for FN includes hospital admission and empiric antibiotics. Strict adherence to this practice leads to prolonged hospitalizations that may be unnecessary for patients at low risk of having an underlying significant infection. PROCEDURE: Children admitted with FN could be discharged after a minimum of 48 hr with no further antibiotic therapy once they had been afebrile for 24 hr with negative blood cultures from initial presentation, regardless of their neutrophil count. We performed a retrospective review with regard to readmissions and subsequent documented infections in FN patients discharged with an ANC of </=500 cells/mm(3) . RESULTS: There were 299 FN admissions in 188 patients who were discharged prior to achieving an ANC of >/=500 cells/mm(3) . Readmission to the hospital during the same period of neutropenia occurred in 50 cases (16.7%) with 27 infections diagnosed in 21 patients. Patients discharged with an ANC of </=100 cells/mm(3) (odds ratio 3.7) and patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (odds ratio 2.6) were more likely to be readmitted for fever. All patients that developed a significant infection had an ANC of </=100 cells/mm(3) at admission and discharge. In patients that developed a significant infection, only one required admission to the intensive care unit with no deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The practice of discharging patients with persistent neutropenia who are afebrile with negative blood cultures produces acceptable rates of readmission and subsequent infection and does not lead to increased morbidity and mortality.","['Villanueva, Melanie A', 'August, Keith J']","['Villanueva MA', 'August KJ']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Febrile Neutropenia/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Patient Discharge', 'Patient Readmission/*statistics & numerical data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",2016/05/20 06:00,2017/06/24 06:00,['2016/05/20 06:00'],"['2016/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Oct;63(10):1829-33. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26072.

Herein, we sought to elucidate the molecular background of GC resistance in B-ALL and characterize the therapeutic potential of targeted intervention in these mechanisms. Using exploratory bioinformatic approaches, we found that resistant cells exhibited significantly higher expression of MEK/ERK (MAPK) pathway components. We found that GC-resistant ALL cell lines had markedly higher baseline activity of MEK and small-molecule MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib increased GCs-induced cell death. MEK inhibitor similarly increased in vitro dexamethasone activity in primary ALL blasts from 19 of 22 tested patients. To further confirm these observations, we overexpressed a constitutively active MEK mutant in GC-sensitive cells and found that forced MEK activity induced resistance to dexamethasone. Since recent studies highlight the role GC-induced autophagy upstream of apoptotic cell death, we assessed LC3 processing, MDC staining and GFP-LC3 relocalization in cells incubated with either DEX, SEL or combination of drugs. Unlike either drug alone, only their combination markedly increased these markers of autophagy. These changes were associated with decreased mTOR activity and blocked 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. In cells with silenced beclin-1 (BCN1), required for autophagosome formation, the synergy of DEX and SEL was markedly reduced. Taken together, we show that MEK inhibitor selumetinib enhances dexamethasone toxicity in GC-resistant B-ALL cells. The underlying mechanism of this interaction involves inhibition of mTOR signaling pathway and modulation of autophagy markers, likely reflecting induction of this process and required for cell death. Thus, our data demonstrate that modulation of MEK/ERK pathway is an attractive therapeutic strategy overcoming GC resistance in B-ALL patients.","['Polak, Anna', 'Kiliszek, Przemyslaw', 'Sewastianik, Tomasz', 'Szydlowski, Maciej', 'Jablonska, Ewa', 'Bialopiotrowicz, Emilia', 'Gorniak, Patryk', 'Markowicz, Sergiusz', 'Nowak, Eliza', 'Grygorowicz, Monika A', 'Prochorec-Sobieszek, Monika', 'Nowis, Dominika', 'Golab, Jakub', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Lech-Maranda, Ewa', 'Warzocha, Krzysztof', 'Juszczynski, Przemyslaw']","['Polak A', 'Kiliszek P', 'Sewastianik T', 'Szydlowski M', 'Jablonska E', 'Bialopiotrowicz E', 'Gorniak P', 'Markowicz S', 'Nowak E', 'Grygorowicz MA', 'Prochorec-Sobieszek M', 'Nowis D', 'Golab J', 'Giebel S', 'Lech-Maranda E', 'Warzocha K', 'Juszczynski P']","['Dept. of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Diagnostic Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Immunology, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center-Institute of Oncology, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Immunology, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center-Institute of Oncology, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Immunology, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center-Institute of Oncology, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Diagnostic Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Genomic Medicine, Dept. of General, Transplant and Liver Surgery, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Medicine, Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Immunology, Center of Biostructure Research, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Hematology-Oncology, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology, Gliwice Branch, Gliwice, Poland.', 'Dept. of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Centre of Postgraduate Medical Education, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Dept. of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Apoptosis', '*Autophagy', 'Benzimidazoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Computational Biology', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism']",2016/05/20 06:00,2017/07/15 06:00,['2016/05/20 06:00'],"['2015/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 May 19;11(5):e0155893. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0155893. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0155893 [doi],20160519,"['0 (AZD 6244)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1)']",PMC4872998,,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0155893 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-48947 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The treatment was complicated by a transient increase in creatinine (from a baseline of 1.2 to 1.5 mg/dl) and potassium (reaching a peak of 6.5 mEq/l). Uric acid and calcium levels were normal. The patient developed hypophosphatemia (prior to initiation of therapy the serum phosphorus was 2.9 mg/dl). No metabolic acidosis was noted. Urinalysis showed no glucosuria or proteinuria. Urinary fraction of excretion of phosphate was found to be 345% (normal <5%). Because of these changes, ibrutinib was held, and the patient was given kayexalate. Serum potassium normalized. Serum phosphorus was checked a couple of weeks later and also normalized. A lower dose of ibrutinib (140 mg/day) was restarted. Upon follow-up, the phosphorus level has been between 2.9 and 3.2 mg/dl. No further evidence of hyperkalemia has been noted. Renal function has remained at baseline.

ZSTK474 is a specific phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor that we identified. In the present study, the efficacy of ZSTK474, alone or in combination with Imatinib, on K562 CML cells as well as on its multidrug resistance counterpart K562/A02 cells, was investigated. ZSTK474 inhibited the cell proliferation with an IC50 of 4.69 muM for K562 and 7.57 muM for K562/A02 cells, respectively. Treatment by ZSTK474 resulted in cell cycle arrest in G1 phase, which might be associated with upregulation of p27, and downregulation of cyclin D1. ZSTK474 also inhibited phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3beta, which might be involved in the effect on the above cell cycle-related proteins. Moreover, combination of ZSTK474 and Imatinib indicated synergistic effect on both cell lines. In conclusion, ZSTK474 exhibited antileukemia activity alone, and showed synergistic effect when combined with Imatinib, on CML K562 cells as well as the multidrug resistant ones, providing a potential therapeutic approach for CML patients.","['Zhou, Qianxiang', 'Chen, Yali', 'Chen, Xi', 'Zhao, Wennan', 'Zhong, Yuxu', 'Wang, Ran', 'Jin, Meihua', 'Qiu, Yuling', 'Kong, Dexin']","['Zhou Q', 'Chen Y', 'Chen X', 'Zhao W', 'Zhong Y', 'Wang R', 'Jin M', 'Qiu Y', 'Kong D']","['1.

This process is mediated by cellular proteins that interact first with the reverse transcription complex and later with the preintegration complex (PIC), allowing it to reach and enter the nucleus. For simple retroviruses, such as murine leukemia virus (MLV), the identities of the cellular proteins involved in trafficking of the PIC in infection are unknown. To identify cellular proteins that interact with the MLV PIC, we developed a replication-competent MLV in which the integrase protein was tagged with a FLAG epitope. Using a combination of immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we established that the microtubule motor dynein regulator DCTN2/p50/dynamitin interacts with the MLV preintegration complex early in infection, suggesting a direct interaction between the incoming viral particles and the dynein complex regulators. Further experiments showed that RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of either DCTN2/p50/dynamitin or another dynein regulator, NudEL, profoundly reduced the efficiency of infection by ecotropic, but not amphotropic, MLV reporters. We propose that the cytoplasmic dynein regulators are a critical component of the host machinery needed for infection by the retroviruses entering the cell via the ecotropic envelope pathway. IMPORTANCE: Retroviruses must access the chromatin of host cells to integrate the viral DNA, but before this crucial event, they must reach the nucleus. The movement through the cytoplasm-a crowded environment where diffusion is slow-is thought to utilize retrograde transport along the microtubule network by the dynein complex. Different viruses use different components of this multisubunit complex. We found that the preintegration complex of murine leukemia virus (MLV) interacts with the dynein complex and that regulators of this complex are essential for infection. Our study provides the first insight into the requirements for retrograde transport of the MLV preintegration complex.","['Valle-Tenney, Roger', 'Opazo, Tatiana', 'Cancino, Jorge', 'Goff, Stephen P', 'Arriagada, Gloria']","['Valle-Tenney R', 'Opazo T', 'Cancino J', 'Goff SP', 'Arriagada G']","['Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Andres Bello, Vina del Mar, Chile.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Andres Bello, Vina del Mar, Chile.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Andres Bello, Vina del Mar, Chile.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Andres Bello, Vina del Mar, Chile gloria.arriagada@unab.cl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Dyneins/*metabolism', 'Genome, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism/*virology', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Retroviridae Infections/metabolism/*virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/metabolism/*virology']",2016/05/20 06:00,2017/06/03 06:00,['2016/05/20 06:00'],"['2016/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,J Virol. 2016 Jul 11;90(15):6896-6905. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00863-16.

We used ex vivo drug response profiling of high-risk, relapsed, or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases and identified a subset with exquisite sensitivity to small-molecule mimetics of the second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) protein. Potent ex vivo activity of the SMAC mimetic (SM) birinapant correlated with marked in vivo antileukemic effects, as indicated by delayed engraftment, decreased leukemia burden, and prolonged survival of xenografted mice. Antileukemic activity was dependent on simultaneous execution of apoptosis and necroptosis, as demonstrated by functional genomic dissection with a multicolored lentiCRISPR approach to simultaneously disrupt multiple genes in patient-derived ALL. SM specifically targeted receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1)-dependent death, and CRISPR-mediated disruption of RIP1 completely blocked SM-induced death yet had no impact on the response to standard antileukemic agents. Thus, SM compounds such as birinapant circumvent escape from apoptosis in leukemia by activating a potent dual RIP1-dependent apoptotic and necroptotic cell death, which is not exploited by current therapy. Ex vivo drug activity profiling could provide important functional diagnostic information to identify patients who may benefit from targeted treatment with birinapant in early clinical trials.","['McComb, Scott', 'Aguade-Gorgorio, Julia', 'Harder, Lena', 'Marovca, Blerim', 'Cario, Gunnar', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'von Stackelberg, Arend', 'Bourquin, Jean-Pierre', 'Bornhauser, Beat C']","['McComb S', 'Aguade-Gorgorio J', 'Harder L', 'Marovca B', 'Cario G', 'Eckert C', 'Schrappe M', 'Stanulla M', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Bourquin JP', 'Bornhauser BC']","[""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland."", 'Department of General Pediatrics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, 24105 Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Charite Medical University Berlin, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of General Pediatrics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, 24105 Kiel, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Charite Medical University Berlin, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland. beat.bornhauser@kispi.uzh.ch.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Sci Transl Med,Science translational medicine,101505086,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dipeptides/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/metabolism', 'Necrosis/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2016/05/20 06:00,2017/12/08 06:00,['2016/05/20 06:00'],"['2015/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/08 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Sci Transl Med. 2016 May 18;8(339):339ra70. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aad2986.,10.1126/scitranslmed.aad2986 [doi],,"['0 (AGFG1 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '6O4Z07B57R (birinapant)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (RIPK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,,,,"['8/339/339ra70 [pii]', '10.1126/scitranslmed.aad2986 [doi]']",,"['Copyright (c) 2016, American Association for the Advancement of Science.']",['CIHR/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Birinapant, a clinical SMAC mimetic, had been designed to mimic the interaction between inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and SMAC/Diablo, thereby relieving IAP-mediated caspase inhibition and promoting apoptosis of cancer cells. We show that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are sensitive to birinapant-induced death and that the clinical caspase inhibitor emricasan/IDN-6556 augments, rather than prevents, killing by birinapant. Deletion of caspase-8 sensitized AML to birinapant, whereas combined loss of caspase-8 and the necroptosis effector MLKL (mixed lineage kinase domain-like) prevented birinapant/IDN-6556-induced death, showing that inhibition of caspase-8 sensitizes AML cells to birinapant-induced necroptosis. However, loss of MLKL alone did not prevent a caspase-dependent birinapant/IDN-6556-induced death, implying that AML will be less likely to acquire resistance to this drug combination. A therapeutic breakthrough in AML has eluded researchers for decades. Demonstrated antileukemic efficacy and safety of the birinapant/emricasan combination in vivo suggest that induction of necroptosis warrants clinical investigation as a therapeutic opportunity in AML.","['Brumatti, Gabriela', 'Ma, Chunyan', 'Lalaoui, Najoua', 'Nguyen, Nhu-Y', 'Navarro, Mario', 'Tanzer, Maria C', 'Richmond, Jennifer', 'Ghisi, Margherita', 'Salmon, Jessica M', 'Silke, Natasha', 'Pomilio, Giovanna', 'Glaser, Stefan P', 'de Valle, Elisha', 'Gugasyan, Raffi', 'Gurthridge, Mark A', 'Condon, Stephen M', 'Johnstone, Ricky W', 'Lock, Richard', 'Salvesen, Guy', 'Wei, Andrew', 'Vaux, David L', 'Ekert, Paul G', 'Silke, John']","['Brumatti G', 'Ma C', 'Lalaoui N', 'Nguyen NY', 'Navarro M', 'Tanzer MC', 'Richmond J', 'Ghisi M', 'Salmon JM', 'Silke N', 'Pomilio G', 'Glaser SP', 'de Valle E', 'Gugasyan R', 'Gurthridge MA', 'Condon SM', 'Johnstone RW', 'Lock R', 'Salvesen G', 'Wei A', 'Vaux DL', 'Ekert PG', 'Silke J']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria 3052, Australia.

We describe this first case of IGD in association with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). A 66-year-old woman with a 6-year history of untreated CLL/SLL, presented with a 2-month history of progressively worsening eruption of the left thigh, along with fatigue, lymphadenopathy and night sweats. Skin biopsy showed findings consistent with IGD and infiltration of CLL. The eruption was non-responsive to treatment with antibiotics and local steroids. There was a significant improvement in the rash after an initial cycle of chemotherapy (combination therapy with bendamustine and rituximab) and complete resolution by the third cycle, for the treatment of her CLL. We suggest that the possibility of an underlying haematological malignancy should be investigated in patients with a skin rash non-responsive to conventional therapy.","['Riaz, Irbaz Bin', 'Kamal, Muhammad Umar', 'Segal, Robert J', 'Anwer, Faiz']","['Riaz IB', 'Kamal MU', 'Segal RJ', 'Anwer F']","['Department of General Internal Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,BMJ Case Rep,BMJ case reports,101526291,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Dermatitis/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Rituximab/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2016/05/20 06:00,2017/02/01 06:00,['2016/05/20 06:00'],"['2016/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,BMJ Case Rep. 2016 May 18;2016. pii: bcr-2016-215108. doi: 10.1136/bcr-2016-215108.,10.1136/bcr-2016-215108 [doi] bcr2016215108 [pii],20160518,"['4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",PMC4885353,,,,"['bcr-2016-215108 [pii]', '10.1136/bcr-2016-215108 [doi]']",,['2016 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to comprehensively assess the frequency of gastrointestinal and liver late effects among childhood cancer survivors and compare this frequency with the general population. Our population-based cohort study included all 1-year survivors of childhood and adolescent cancer in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden diagnosed from the 1940s and 1950s. Our outcomes of interest were hospitalization rates for gastrointestinal and liver diseases, which were ascertained from national patient registries. We calculated standardized hospitalization rate ratios (RRs) and absolute excess rates comparing hospitalizations of any gastrointestinal or liver disease and for specific disease entities between survivors and the general population. The study included 31,132 survivors and 207,041 comparison subjects. The median follow-up in the hospital registries were 10 years (range: 0-42) with 23% of the survivors being followed at least to the age of 40 years. Overall, survivors had a 60% relative excess of gastrointestinal or liver diseases [RR: 1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6-1.7], which corresponds to an absolute excess of 360 (95% CI: 330-390) hospitalizations per 100,000 person-years. Survivors of hepatic tumors, neuroblastoma and leukemia had the highest excess of gastrointestinal and liver diseases. In addition, we observed a relative excess of several specific diseases such as esophageal stricture (RR: 13; 95% CI: 9.2-20) and liver cirrhosis (RR: 2.9; 95% CI: 2.0-4.1). Our findings provide useful information about the breadth and magnitude of late complications among childhood cancer survivors and can be used for generating hypotheses about potential exposures related to these gastrointestinal and liver late effects.","['Asdahl, Peter Haubjerg', 'Winther, Jeanette Falck', 'Bonnesen, Trine Gade', 'De Fine Licht, Sofie', 'Gudmundsdottir, Thorgerdur', 'Holmqvist, Anna Sallfors', 'Malila, Nea', 'Tryggvadottir, Laufey', 'Wesenberg, Finn', 'Dahlerup, Jens Frederik', 'Olsen, Jorgen Helge', 'Hasle, Henrik']","['Asdahl PH', 'Winther JF', 'Bonnesen TG', 'De Fine Licht S', 'Gudmundsdottir T', 'Holmqvist AS', 'Malila N', 'Tryggvadottir L', 'Wesenberg F', 'Dahlerup JF', 'Olsen JH', 'Hasle H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Skane University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'The Finnish Cancer Registry, Helsinki, Finland.', 'The Icelandic Cancer Registry, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Cancer Registry of Norway, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Hepatology and Gastroenterology, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Liver Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries/epidemiology', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",2016/05/20 06:00,2017/06/24 06:00,['2016/05/20 06:00'],"['2015/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2016 Oct 1;139(7):1501-11. doi: 10.1002/ijc.30198.

MATERIALS & METHODS: Nilotinib and the internal standard dasatinib were separated using a mobile phase of 0.5% Na2 PO4 H2 O (pH 2.5)-acetonitrile-methanol (55:25:20, v/v/v) on a Capcell Pak C18 MG II column (250 x 4.6 mm) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and ultraviolet measurement at 250 nm. RESULTS: The calibration curve exhibited linearity over the nilotinib concentration range of 50-2,500 ng/ml at 250 nm, with relative standard deviations (n = 5) of 7.1%, 2.5%, and 2.9% for 250, 1,500, and 2,500 ng/ml, respectively. The detection limit for nilotinib was 5 ng/ml due to three blank determinations (rho = 3). CONCLUSION: This method was successfully applied to assaying nilotinib in human plasma samples from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. In addition, we compared the results with those measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) at BML, Inc. (a commercial laboratory). A strong correlation was observed between the nilotinib concentrations measured by our high-performance liquid chromatographic method and those obtained by LC/MS-MS (r(2) = 0.988, P < 0.01).","['Nakahara, Ryosuke', 'Satho, Yuhki', 'Itoh, Hiroki']","['Nakahara R', 'Satho Y', 'Itoh H']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Oita University Hospital, Yufu City, Japan. ryosuke-n@oita-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Oita University Hospital, Yufu City, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Oita University Hospital, Yufu City, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Lab Anal,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,8801384,IM,"['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood', 'Limit of Detection', 'Pyrimidines/analysis/*blood', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet/*methods', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry/*methods']",2016/10/30 06:00,2017/04/07 06:00,['2016/05/20 06:00'],"['2015/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Lab Anal. 2016 Nov;30(6):1028-1030. doi: 10.1002/jcla.21975.

Treatment options for acute ATL patients include chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation, and recently the anti-chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 4 antibody, although most patients still have a poor prognosis and there is a clear need for additional options. HBI-8000 is a novel oral histone deacetylase inhibitor with proven efficacy for treatment of T-cell lymphomas that recently received approval in China. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of HBI-8000 on ATL-derived cell lines and primary cells obtained from Japanese ATL patients. In most cases HBI-8000 induced apoptosis in both primary ATL cells and cell lines. In addition, findings obtained with DNA microarray suggested Bim activation and, interestingly, the contribution of the NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome pathway in HBI-8000-induced ATL cell death. Further investigations using siRNAs confirmed that Bim contributes to HBI-8000-induced apoptosis. Our results provide a rationale for a clinical investigation of the efficacy of HBI-8000 in patients with ATL. Although the role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in ATL cell death remains to be verified, HBI-8000 may be part of a novel therapeutic strategy for cancer based on the NLRP3 pathway.","['Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Bissonnette, Reid P', 'Gillings, Mireille', 'Sasaki, Daisuke', 'Taniguchi, Hiroaki', 'Kitanosono, Hideaki', 'Tsuruda, Kazuto', 'Kosai, Kousuke', 'Uno, Naoki', 'Morinaga, Yoshitomo', 'Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Yanagihara, Katsunori']","['Hasegawa H', 'Bissonnette RP', 'Gillings M', 'Sasaki D', 'Taniguchi H', 'Kitanosono H', 'Tsuruda K', 'Kosai K', 'Uno N', 'Morinaga Y', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Yanagihara K']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'HUYA Bioscience International, San Diego, California, USA.', 'HUYA Bioscience International, San Diego, California, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Atomic Bomb Disease and Hibakusha Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antibodies', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/*metabolism', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Histones/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammasomes/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Protein Array Analysis', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2016/05/20 06:00,2017/02/02 06:00,['2016/05/20 06:00'],"['2015/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/09 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/02 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2016 Aug;107(8):1124-33. doi: 10.1111/cas.12971.

In this study, mammea E/BB, an active compound from Saraphi (Mammea siamensis) seed extract was examined for its effect on down-regulatory mechanism of WT1 gene expression, WT1 protein and mRNA stability, and cell proliferation in K562 cell line. METHODS: M. siamensis seeds were obtained from the region of Chiang Mai (North of Thailand). Mammea E/BB was extracted from seeds of M. siamensis. WT1 protein expression and stability were evaluated by Western blot analysis. WT1 mRNA stability was assessed by qRT-PCR. WT1-DNA binding and WT1 promoter activity were assayed by ChIP assay and luciferase-reporter assay, respectively. Cell cycle arrest was studied by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Treatment with mammea E/BB led to down-regulation of WT1 expression. The suppression of WT1 expression did not involve protein and mRNA degradation. Rather, WT1 protein was down-regulated through disruption of transcriptional auto-regulation of the WT1 gene. Mammea E/BB inhibited WT1-DNA binding at the WT1 promoter and decreased luciferase activity. It also disrupted c-Fos/AP-1 binding to the WT1 promoter via ERK1/2 signaling pathway and induced S phase cell cycle arrest in K562 cells. CONCLUSION: Mammea E/BB had pleotropic effects on kinase signaling pathways, resulting in inhibition of leukemia cell proliferation.","['Rungrojsakul, Methee', 'Katekunlaphan, Trinnakorn', 'Saiai, Aroonchai', 'Ampasavate, Chadarat', 'Okonogi, Siriporn', 'Sweeney, Colleen A', 'Anuchapreeda, Songyot']","['Rungrojsakul M', 'Katekunlaphan T', 'Saiai A', 'Ampasavate C', 'Okonogi S', 'Sweeney CA', 'Anuchapreeda S']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Chandrakasem Rajabhat University, Bangkok, 10900, Thailand.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, UC Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, 95817, USA. casweeney@ucdavis.edu.', 'UC Davis Cancer Center, Research Building III, Room 1100A, 4645 2nd Avenue, Sacramento, CA, 95817, USA. casweeney@ucdavis.edu.', 'Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand. sanuchapreeda@gmail.com.', 'Division of Clinical Microscopy, Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand. sanuchapreeda@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Complement Altern Med,BMC complementary and alternative medicine,101088661,IM,"['Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Coumarins/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mammea/*chemistry', 'Molecular Structure', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'RNA Stability/drug effects', 'RNA, Neoplasm', 'WT1 Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2016/05/20 06:00,2017/01/18 06:00,['2016/05/20 06:00'],"['2016/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/18 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,BMC Complement Altern Med. 2016 May 18;16:130. doi: 10.1186/s12906-016-1107-z.,10.1186/s12906-016-1107-z [doi],20160518,"['0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Mammea E-BB compound)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",PMC4870773,['NOTNLM'],"['AP-1', 'Cell cycle arrest', 'ERK1/2', 'K562 cells', 'Mammea E/BB', 'Mammea siamensis', 'WT1']",,"['10.1186/s12906-016-1107-z [doi]', '10.1186/s12906-016-1107-z [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present an improved system for unbiased detection of lymphoblastic clones in bone marrow aspirates of T-ALL patients. The system based on multiplex PCR of rearranged T-cell receptor locus (TRB) and straightforward sequencing of the resulted PCR fragments. Testing of the system on genomic DNA from Jurkat cell line and four clinical bone marrow aspirates revealed a set of unique TRB rearrangements that precisely characterize each of tested samples.

This is particularly true of the hematopoietic system, where demands on host defenses can call for an acute increase in cell production. Hematopoietic stem cells receive the regulatory signals for cell production in adult mammals in the bone marrow, a tissue with higher-order architectural and functional organization than previously appreciated. Here, we review the data defining particular structural components and heterologous cells in the bone marrow that participate in hematopoietic stem cell function. Further, we explore the case for stromal-hematopoietic cell interactions contributing to neoplastic myeloid disease. As the hematopoietic regulatory networks in the bone marrow are revealed, it is anticipated that strategies will emerge for how to enhance or inhibit production of specific blood cells. In that way, the control of hematopoiesis will enter the domain of therapies to modulate broad aspects of hematopoiesis, both normal and malignant.","['Hoggatt, Jonathan', 'Kfoury, Youmna', 'Scadden, David T']","['Hoggatt J', 'Kfoury Y', 'Scadden DT']","['Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138.', 'Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02114; email: dscadden@mgh.harvard.edu.', 'Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138.', 'Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02114; email: dscadden@mgh.harvard.edu.', 'Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138.', 'Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02114; email: dscadden@mgh.harvard.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Annu Rev Pathol,Annual review of pathology,101275111,IM,"['Adult Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', '*Stem Cell Niche']",2016/05/20 06:00,2017/08/16 06:00,['2016/05/20 06:00'],"['2016/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Annu Rev Pathol. 2016 May 23;11:555-81. doi: 10.1146/annurev-pathol-012615-044414.,10.1146/annurev-pathol-012615-044414 [doi],,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*bone marrow', '*hematopoiesis', '*hypoxia', '*leukemia', '*malignancy', '*mesenchymal cell']",,['10.1146/annurev-pathol-012615-044414 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is absorbed principally through the respiratory system and metabolized by several enzymes rendering 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB), which has the highest genotoxic potency of all metabolites of 1,3-butadiene. DEB is considered a carcinogen mainly due to its high potential as clastogen, which induces structural chromosome aberrations such as sister chromatid exchanges, chromosomal breaks, and micronuclei. Due to its clastogenic effect, DEB is one of the most used agents for diagnostic studies of Fanconi anemia, a recessively inherited disease related to mutations affecting several genes involved in a common DNA repair pathway. When performing Fanconi anemia diagnostic tests in our laboratory, we have observed occasional multipolar mitosis (MM) in lymphocyte cultures exposed to 0.1 mug/ml of DEB and harvested in the absence of any mitotic spindle inhibitor. Although previous studies reported an aneugenic effect (i.e. it induces aneuploidy) of DEB, no mechanism was suggested to explain such observations. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether exposure to 0.1 mug/ml of DEB is significantly associated with the occurrence of MM. We blindly assessed the frequency of MM in lymphocyte cultures from 10 nonsmoking healthy individuals. Two series of 3 cultures were performed from each sample under different conditions: A, without DEB; B, with 0.1 mug/ml of DEB, and C, with 25 muM of mitomycin C as positive control. Cultures exposed to DEB showed higher frequencies of MM (23 of 2,000 cells) than did the unexposed ones (3 of 2,000 cells).","['Barajas Torres, Reyna Lucia', 'Dominguez Cruz, Martin Daniel', 'Borjas Gutierrez, Cesar', 'Ramirez Duenas, Maria de Lourdes', 'Magana Torres, Maria Teresa', 'Gonzalez Garcia, Juan Ramon']","['Barajas Torres RL', 'Dominguez Cruz MD', 'Borjas Gutierrez C', 'Ramirez Duenas Mde L', 'Magana Torres MT', 'Gonzalez Garcia JR']","['Divisix00F3;n de Genx00E9;tica, Centro de Investigacix00F3;n Biomx00E9;dica de Occidente, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Guadalajara, Mx00E9;xico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Cytogenet Genome Res,Cytogenetic and genome research,101142708,IM,"['Aneuploidy', 'Butadienes/metabolism/toxicity', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epoxy Compounds/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Mitomycin/toxicity', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Mutagens/metabolism/toxicity', 'Toxicity Tests']",2016/05/20 06:00,2017/01/20 06:00,['2016/05/20 06:00'],"['2016/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Cytogenet Genome Res. 2016;148(2-3):179-84. doi: 10.1159/000445858.

Ten of the patients were heterozygous for the variant allele in NUDT15. In patients under 7 years old with NUDT15 variant allele, the average administered dose of 6-MP was lower than that for the patients homozygous for the wild-type allele (P=0.04).

Nineteen percent of patients continued on study treatment, with a greater proportion in the 100 mg once daily arm remaining on therapy. Seven-year rates for major molecular response (MMR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were similar across doses; MMR, PFS, and OS results were 46, 42, and 65% at 100 mg once daily, respectively. Improved PFS and OS rates were reported in patients who achieved BCR-ABL1 </=10% at 3 and 6 months. No new safety signals were identified. The incidence of drug-related pleural effusion was 28% at 100 mg once daily and 35% at the other three dose groups. Incidence of drug-related pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary arterial hypertension remained low (</=3% across all doses). Arterial ischemic events occurred in </=4% of patients across all doses.

However, the oncogenic effect of WDR5 in leukemia remains largely unknown. Here, we found WDR5 expression is increased in leukemia patients. High expression of WDR5 is associated with high risk leukemia; Patients with WDR5 and MLL1 high expression have poor complete remission rate. We further identified the global genomic binding of WDR5 in leukemic cells and found the genomic co-localization of WDR5 binding with H3K4me3 enrichment. Moreover, WDR5 knockdown by shRNA suppresses cell proliferation, induces apoptosis, inhibits the expression of WDR5 targets, and blocks the H3K4me3 enrichment on the promoter of its targets. We also observed the positive correlation of WDR5 expression with these targets in the cohort study of leukemia patients. Our data reveal that WDR5 may have oncogenic effect and WDR5-mediated H3K4 methylation plays an important role in leukemogenesis.","['Ge, Zheng', 'Song, Evelyn J', 'Kawasawa, Yuka Imamura', 'Li, Jianyong', 'Dovat, Sinisa', 'Song, Chunhua']","['Ge Z', 'Song EJ', 'Kawasawa YI', 'Li J', 'Dovat S', 'Song C']","['Department of Hematology (Key Department of Jiangsu Medicine), Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Provincial Hospital, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.', 'Pennsylvania State Hershey Genome Sciences Facility, Pennsylvania State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Provincial Hospital, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",2016/10/23 06:00,2018/01/18 06:00,['2016/05/19 06:00'],"['2016/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jun 21;7(25):37740-37754. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9312.,10.18632/oncotarget.9312 [doi],,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (WDR5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",PMC5122345,['NOTNLM'],"['H3K4me3', 'MLL', 'WDR5', 'leukemia']",['The authors declare no competing financial interests.'],"['9312 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9312 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EZH2 overexpression has been reported in many types of cancer and associated with poor prognosis. Here we investigated the expression and functionality of EZH2 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Aggressive cases with unmutated IGHV genes (U-CLL) displayed significantly higher EZH2 expression compared to indolent CLL cases with mutated IGHV genes (M-CLL); furthermore, in U-CLL EZH2 expression was upregulated with disease progression. Within U-CLL, EZH2high cases harbored significantly fewer (p = 0.033) TP53 gene abnormalities compared to EZH2low cases. EZH2high cases displayed high H3K27me3 levels and increased viability suggesting that EZH2 is functional and likely confers a survival advantage to CLL cells. This argument was further supported by siRNA-mediated downmodulation of EZH2 which resulted in increased apoptosis. Notably, at the intraclonal level, cell proliferation was significantly associated with EZH2 expression. Treatment of primary CLL cells with EZH2 inhibitors induced downregulation of H3K27me3 levels leading to increased cell apoptosis. In conclusion, EZH2 is overexpressed in adverse-prognosis CLL and associated with increased cell survival and proliferation. Pharmacologic inhibition of EZH2 catalytic activity promotes apoptosis, highlighting EZH2 as a novel potential therapeutic target for specific subgroups of patients with CLL.","['Papakonstantinou, Nikos', 'Ntoufa, Stavroula', 'Chartomatsidou, Elisavet', 'Kotta, Konstantia', 'Agathangelidis, Andreas', 'Giassafaki, Lefki', 'Karamanli, Tzeni', 'Bele, Panagiota', 'Moysiadis, Theodoros', 'Baliakas, Panagiotis', 'Sutton, Lesley Ann', 'Stavroyianni, Niki', 'Anagnostopoulos, Achilles', 'Makris, Antonios M', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas']","['Papakonstantinou N', 'Ntoufa S', 'Chartomatsidou E', 'Kotta K', 'Agathangelidis A', 'Giassafaki L', 'Karamanli T', 'Bele P', 'Moysiadis T', 'Baliakas P', 'Sutton LA', 'Stavroyianni N', 'Anagnostopoulos A', 'Makris AM', 'Ghia P', 'Rosenquist R', 'Stamatopoulos K']","['Institute of Applied Biosciences, Center for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Center for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Center for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Center for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology and Department of Onco-Hematology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Center for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Center for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Center for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Center for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Hematology Department and HCT Unit, G.

Exosomes are microvesicles secreted by many types of cells that contain protein and RNA and mediate intercellular communication. The involvement of exosomes has been demonstrated in the crosstalk between leukemic cells, stromal cells and endothelial cells, consequently promoting the survival of leukemic cells, protection of leukemic cells from the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs, angiogenesis and cell migration. At the same time, exosomes can be used for the detection and monitoring of leukemia, with some advantage over current methods of detection and surveillance. As they are involved in immune response towards leukemic cells, exosomes can also potentially be exploited to augment immunotherapy in leukemia. In this review, we first describe the general characteristics of exosomes and biogenesis of exosomes. We then highlight the emerging role of exosomes in different types of leukemia. Finally, the clinical value of exosomes as biomarkers, in vivo drug carriers and novel exosome-based immunotherapy are discussed.","['Zhou, Jianbiao', 'Wang, Sam', 'Sun, Kangyun', 'Chng, Wee-Joo']","['Zhou J', 'Wang S', 'Sun K', 'Chng WJ']","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Centre for Translational Medicine, Singapore, Republic of Singapore.', 'Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Republic of Singapore.', 'Faculty of Arts and Sciences, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Suzhou Municipal Hospital, Affiliate of Nanjing Medical University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, PR China.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Centre for Translational Medicine, Singapore, Republic of Singapore.', 'Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Republic of Singapore.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute of Singapore (NCIS), The National University Health System (NUHS), Singapore, Republic of Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Endosomes/metabolism', 'Exosomes/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Prognosis', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",2016/05/19 06:00,2018/01/23 06:00,['2016/05/19 06:00'],"['2016/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 2;7(31):50698-50707. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9333.,10.18632/oncotarget.9333 [doi],,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",PMC5226614,['NOTNLM'],"['biomarker', 'exosome', 'immunotherapy', 'leukemia', 'miRNA']",['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],"['9333 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9333 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human TAL1-driven T-ALL cell lines, Trib2 is proposed to function as an important survival factor, but there is limited information about the role of Trib2 in primary T-ALL. In this study, we investigated the role of Trib2 in the initiation and maintenance of Notch-dependent T-ALL. Trib2 had no effect on the growth and survival of murine T-ALL cell lines in vitro when expression was blocked by shRNAs. To test the function of Trib2 on leukemogenesis in vivo, we generated Trib2 knockout mice. Mice were born at the expected Mendelian frequencies without gross developmental anomalies. Adult mice did not develop pathology or shortened survival, and hematopoiesis, including T cell development, was unperturbed. Using a retroviral model of Notch-induced T-ALL, deletion of Trib2 unexpectedly decreased the latency and increased the penetrance of T-ALL development in vivo. Immunoblotting of primary murine T-ALL cells showed that the absence of Trib2 increased C/EBPalpha expression, a known regulator of cell proliferation, and did not alter AKT or ERK phosphorylation. Although Trib2 was suggested to be highly expressed in T-ALL, transcriptomic analysis of two independent T-ALL cohorts showed that low Trib2 expression correlated with the TLX1-expressing cortical mature T-ALL subtype, whereas high Trib2 expression correlated with the LYL1-expressing early immature T-ALL subtype. These data indicate that Trib2 has a complex role in the pathogenesis of Notch-driven T-ALL, which may vary between different T-ALL subtypes.","['Stein, Sarah J', 'Mack, Ethan A', 'Rome, Kelly S', 'Pajcini, Kostandin V', 'Ohtani, Takuya', 'Xu, Lanwei', 'Li, Yunlei', 'Meijerink, Jules P P', 'Faryabi, Robert B', 'Pear, Warren S']","['Stein SJ', 'Mack EA', 'Rome KS', 'Pajcini KV', 'Ohtani T', 'Xu L', 'Li Y', 'Meijerink JP', 'Faryabi RB', 'Pear WS']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Institute of Medicine and Engineering, Institute for Immunology, Center for Personalized Diagnostics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Institute of Medicine and Engineering, Institute for Immunology, Center for Personalized Diagnostics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Institute of Medicine and Engineering, Institute for Immunology, Center for Personalized Diagnostics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Institute of Medicine and Engineering, Institute for Immunology, Center for Personalized Diagnostics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Institute of Medicine and Engineering, Institute for Immunology, Center for Personalized Diagnostics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Institute of Medicine and Engineering, Institute for Immunology, Center for Personalized Diagnostics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.', 'The Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'The Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Institute of Medicine and Engineering, Institute for Immunology, Center for Personalized Diagnostics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Institute of Medicine and Engineering, Institute for Immunology, Center for Personalized Diagnostics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Loci', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Penetrance', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2016/05/19 06:00,2017/07/25 06:00,['2016/05/19 06:00'],"['2015/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 May 18;11(5):e0155408. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0155408. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0155408 [doi],20160518,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (tribbles 2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",PMC4871414,,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0155408 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-54731 [pii]']",,,"['R01 AI047833/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HD007516/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 CA189661/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA119070/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MFC is the standard method, but may be unreliable. Therefore, MFC-based determination of MRD with an RQ-PCR-based approach targeting the nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) type A mutation was set out to compare. Since most current NPM1 RQ-PCR MRD protocols suffer from clear definitions of quantifiability, we sought to define quantifiability in a reproducible and standardized manner. The limit of quantifiability of our RQ-PCR protocol for the NPM1 type A mutation varied between 0.002% and 0.04% residual leukemic cells depending on the features of the standard curve for each PCR experiment. The limit of detection was close to 0.001% leukemic cells. The limit of detection by MFC ranged from 0.01% to 1% depending on the phenotype of the leukemic cells as compared with non-leukemic bone marrow cells. Forty-five MRD samples from 15 patients using both NPM1 mutation specific RQ-PCR and MFC were analyzed. In 32 of the 45 samples (71%), an MRD-signal could be detected with RQ-PCR. A quantifiable NPM1 mutation signal was found in 15 samples (33%) (range 0.003%-2.6% leukemic cells).

Human T-ALL xeno-transplantation in immunodeficient mice is a gold standard approach to study leukemia biology and we recently uncovered that the leukemia development is more or less rapid depending on T-ALL sample. The resulting human leukemia may arise through genetic selection and we previously showed that human T-ALL development in immune-deficient mice is significantly enhanced upon CD7+/CD34+ leukemic cell transplantations. Here we investigated the genetic characteristics of CD7+/CD34+ and CD7+/CD34- cells from newly diagnosed human T-ALL and correlated it to the speed of leukemia development. We observed that CD7+/CD34+ or CD7+/CD34- T-ALL cells that promote leukemia within a short-time period are genetically similar, as well as xenograft-derived leukemia resulting from both cell fractions. In the case of delayed T-ALL growth CD7+/CD34+ or CD7+/CD34- cells were either genetically diverse, the resulting xenograft leukemia arising from different but branched subclones present in the original sample, or similar, indicating decreased fitness to mouse micro-environment. Altogether, our work provides new information relating the speed of leukemia development in xenografts to the genetic diversity of T-ALL cell compartments.","['Poglio, Sandrine', 'Lewandowski, Daniel', 'Calvo, Julien', 'Caye, Aurelie', 'Gros, Audrey', 'Laharanne, Elodie', 'Leblanc, Thierry', 'Landman-Parker, Judith', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Soulier, Jean', 'Ballerini, Paola', 'Clappier, Emmanuelle', 'Pflumio, Francoise']","['Poglio S', 'Lewandowski D', 'Calvo J', 'Caye A', 'Gros A', 'Laharanne E', 'Leblanc T', 'Landman-Parker J', 'Baruchel A', 'Soulier J', 'Ballerini P', 'Clappier E', 'Pflumio F']","[""Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives (CEA), DSV-IRCM-SCSR-LSHL, UMR 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France."", 'INSERM, U967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud, UMR 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'INSERM, U967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud, UMR 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'CEA, DSV-IRCM-SCSR-LRTS, UMR 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', ""Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives (CEA), DSV-IRCM-SCSR-LSHL, UMR 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France."", 'INSERM, U967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud, UMR 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Departement de Genetique, UF de Genetique Moleculaire, Hopital Robert Debre Paris, France.', 'INSERM, UMR1053 Bordeaux Research in Translational Oncology (BaRITOn), Bordeaux, France.', 'Universite de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'INSERM, UMR1053 Bordeaux Research in Translational Oncology (BaRITOn), Bordeaux, France.', 'Universite de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', ""AP-HP, Service d'hematologie Pediatrique, Hopital Robert Debre, Paris, France."", ""AP-HP, Service d'hematologie Pediatrique, Hopital Armand Trousseau, Paris, France."", ""AP-HP, Service d'hematologie Pediatrique, Hopital Robert Debre, Paris, France."", 'Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', ""AP-HP, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France."", 'Team Genome and Cancer, U944 INSERM, Paris, France.', ""Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives (CEA), DSV-IRCM-SCSR-LSHL, UMR 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France."", 'INSERM, U967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud, UMR 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', ""AP-HP, Service d'hematologie Pediatrique, Hopital Armand Trousseau, Paris, France."", 'Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', ""AP-HP, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France."", 'Team Genome and Cancer, U944 INSERM, Paris, France.', ""Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives (CEA), DSV-IRCM-SCSR-LSHL, UMR 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France."", 'INSERM, U967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud, UMR 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Disease Progression', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', '*Genetic Variation', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Time Factors', '*Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Young Adult']",2016/05/19 06:00,2018/01/18 06:00,['2016/05/19 06:00'],"['2015/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jul 5;7(27):41599-41611. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9313.,10.18632/oncotarget.9313 [doi],,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",PMC5173081,['NOTNLM'],"['CD34', 'T-ALL', 'clonal selection', 'leukemia initiating cells', 'xenograft']",['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],"['9313 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9313 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated the effects of CuD and a B-cell lymphoma extra-large (Bcl-xL) inhibitor on autophagy in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) isolated from adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) patients. CuD induced PBL cell death in patients but not in healthy donors. This effect was not significantly inhibited by treatment with rapamycin or 3-methyladenine (3-MA). The Bcl-xL inhibitor Z36 induced death in primary cells from ATL patients including that induced by CuD treatment, effects that were partly inhibited by 3-MA. Similarly, cell death induced by the steroid prednisolone was enhanced in the presence of Z36. A western blot analysis revealed that Z36 also promoted CuD-induced poly(ADP ribose) polymerase cleavage. Interestingly, the effects of CuD and Z36 were attenuated in primary ATL patient cells obtained upon recurrence after umbilical cord blood transplantation, as compared to those obtained before chemotherapy. Furthermore, cells from this patient expressed a high level of caspase-1, and treatment with caspase-1 inhibitor-enhanced CuD-induced cell death. Taken together, these results suggest that rescue from resistance to steroid drugs can enhance chemotherapy, and that caspase-1 is a good marker for drug resistance in ATL patients.","['Nakanishi, Tsukasa', 'Song, Yuan', 'He, Cuiying', 'Wang, Duo', 'Morita, Kentaro', 'Tsukada, Junichi', 'Kanazawa, Tamotsu', 'Yoshida, Yasuhiro']","['Nakanishi T', 'Song Y', 'He C', 'Wang D', 'Morita K', 'Tsukada J', 'Kanazawa T', 'Yoshida Y']","['Department of Immunology and Parasitology, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Parasitology, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Department of Immunology and Parasitology, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Parasitology, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Parasitology, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Parasitology, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Parasitology, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PeerJ,PeerJ,101603425,,,2016/05/18 06:00,2016/05/18 06:01,['2016/05/19 06:00'],"['2016/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/18 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,PeerJ. 2016 May 12;4:e2026. doi: 10.7717/peerj.2026. eCollection 2016.,10.7717/peerj.2026 [doi],20160512,,PMC4868592,['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'Caspase-1', 'Cucurbitacin D']",,"['10.7717/peerj.2026 [doi]', '2026 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, there is a need to develop novel FLT3 inhibitors that overcome these mutations. Here we report the development of a novel type I ATP competitive inhibitor, JH-IX-179, that is extremely potent and selective for FLT3. JH-IX-179 also has the highest affinity for three constitutively active isoforms of FLT3 (FLT3-ITD, FLT3-N841I, and FLT3-D835V) compared to a panel 456 other kinases.

Indeed, treatment of CLL B-cells with Tris-DBA induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner irrespective of IgVH mutational status. Further analyses suggest that Tris-DBA-induced apoptosis involves reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL, and XIAP with an upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein BIM in CLL B-cells. Our findings also indicate that Tris-DBA targets the ribosomal protein (rp)-S6, an essential component of the Akt/mTOR signaling axis in CLL B-cells. Of interest, CLL bone marrow stromal cells were unable to protect the leukemic B cells from Tris-DBA-induced apoptosis in an in vitro co-culture system. Finally, co-administration of Tris-DBA and the purine nucleoside analog fludarabine (F-ara-A) augmented CLL B-cell apoptosis levels in vitro showing synergistic effects. In total, Tris-DBA is effective at inducing apoptosis in CLL B-cells even in the presence of stromal cells likely by targeting directly the signal mediator, rpS6.","['Kay, Neil E', 'Sassoon, Traci', 'Secreto, Charla', 'Sinha, Sutapa', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Ghosh, Asish K', 'Arbiser, Jack L']","['Kay NE', 'Sassoon T', 'Secreto C', 'Sinha S', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Ghosh AK', 'Arbiser JL']","['a Division of Hematology , Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN , USA ;', 'a Division of Hematology , Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN , USA ;', 'a Division of Hematology , Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN , USA ;', 'a Division of Hematology , Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN , USA ;', 'a Division of Hematology , Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN , USA ;', 'b Stephenson Cancer Center, Department of Pathology , University of Oklahoma , Oklahoma , OK , USA ;', 'c Department of Dermatology , Emory University, Winship Cancer Institute , Atlanta , GA , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Organometallic Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein S6/genetics/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2016/05/18 06:00,2017/12/23 06:00,['2016/05/19 06:00'],"['2016/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2016 Oct;57(10):2409-16. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2016.1161186.

Methods: Pharmacological measures (i.e., metabolite concentrations) assessed 6MP intake. Behavioral measures (e.g., electronic monitoring) described adherence patterns over time. Results: Three metabolite profiles were identified across 15 months: one group demonstrated low levels of both metabolites (40.8%) consistent with nonadherence and/or suboptimal therapy; two other groups demonstrated metabolite clusters indicative of adequate adherence (59.2%). Those patients whose metabolite profile demonstrated low levels of both metabolites had consistently lower behavioral adherence rates. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this was the first study to prospectively validate a pharmacological measure of medication adherence with a behavioral adherence measure in a relatively large sample of pediatric patients with cancer. Using multiple methods of adherence measurement could inform clinical care and target patients in need of intervention.","['Rohan, Jennifer M', 'Fukuda, Tsuyoshi', 'Alderfer, Melissa A', 'Wetherington Donewar, Crista', 'Ewing, Linda', 'Katz, Ernest R', 'Muriel, Anna C', 'Vinks, Alexander A', 'Drotar, Dennis']","['Rohan JM', 'Fukuda T', 'Alderfer MA', 'Wetherington Donewar C', 'Ewing L', 'Katz ER', 'Muriel AC', 'Vinks AA', 'Drotar D']","['Department of Psychology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', ""Center for Adherence and Self-Management, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, OH, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati School of Medicine, OH, USA.', ""Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Cente, OH, USA."", ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, PA, USA."", 'Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvani, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', ""Center for Pediatric Psychiatry, Children's Medical Center Dallas, Texas, USA."", 'UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', ""Division of General Pediatrics, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, CA, USA."", 'Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', ""Division of Psychosocial Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati School of Medicine, OH, USA.', ""Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Cente, OH, USA."", 'Department of Psychology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Validation Study']",United States,J Pediatr Psychol,Journal of pediatric psychology,7801773,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Medication Adherence/*statistics & numerical data', 'Mercaptopurine/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Young Adult']",2016/05/18 06:00,2017/11/10 06:00,['2016/05/19 06:00'],"['2015/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/10 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Psychol. 2017 Mar 1;42(2):232-244. doi: 10.1093/jpepsy/jsw039.,10.1093/jpepsy/jsw039 [doi],,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",PMC7594168,['NOTNLM'],"['*adherence', '*cancer', '*metabolites', '*pediatrics', '*pharmacology']",,"['jsw039 [pii]', '10.1093/jpepsy/jsw039 [doi]']",,"['(c) The Author 2016.

Numerical utilities of all elementary events are elicited to quantify their desirabilities. These numerical values are used to map the categorical outcome probability vector of each treatment to a mean utility, which is used as a one-dimensional criterion for constructing comparative tests. Bayesian tests are presented, including fixed sample and group sequential procedures, assuming Dirichlet-multinomial models for the priors and likelihoods. Guidelines are provided for establishing priors, eliciting utilities, and specifying hypotheses. Efficient posterior computation is discussed, and algorithms are provided for jointly calibrating test cutoffs and sample size to control overall type I error and achieve specified power. Asymptotic approximations for the power curve are used to initialize the algorithms. The methodology is applied to re-design a completed trial that compared two chemotherapy regimens for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, in which an ordinal efficacy outcome was dichotomized, and toxicity was ignored to construct the trial's design. The Bayesian tests also are illustrated by several types of categorical outcomes arising in common clinical settings. Freely available computer software for implementation is provided.

METHODS: The USIDNET Registry was queried for HIGM patient data collected from October 1992 to July 2015. Data fields included demographics, criteria for diagnosis, pedigree analysis, mutations, clinical features, treatment and transplant records, laboratory findings, and mortality. RESULTS: Fifty-two physicians entered data from 145 patients of ages 2 months to 62 years (median 12 years); 131 were males. Using patients' age at last entry, data from 2072 patient years are included. Mutations were recorded for 85 subjects; 82 were in CD40LG. Eighteen subjects had non-X-linked HIGM. 40 % had a normal serum IgM and 15 %, normal IgA. Infections were reported for 91 %, with pulmonary, ear, and sinus infections being the most common. 42 % had Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia; 6 % had Cryptosporidium. 41 % had neutropenia. 78 % experienced non-infectious complications: chronic diarrhea (n = 22), aphthous ulcers (n = 28), and neoplasms (n = 8) including colon cancer, adrenal adenoma, liver adenocarcinoma, pancreatic carcinoid, acute myeloid leukemia, hepatoma, and, in a female with an autosomal dominant gain of function mutation in PIK3CD, an ovarian dysgerminoma. Thirteen patients had a hematopoietic marrow or stem cell transplant; three had solid organ transplants. Thirteen were known to have died (median age = 14 years). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the USIDNET Registry provides data on the common clinical features of this rare syndrome, and in contrast with previously published data, demonstrates longer survival times and reduced gastrointestinal manifestations.","['Leven, Emily A', 'Maffucci, Patrick', 'Ochs, Hans D', 'Scholl, Paul R', 'Buckley, Rebecca H', 'Fuleihan, Ramsay L', 'Geha, Raif S', 'Cunningham, Coleen K', 'Bonilla, Francisco A', 'Conley, Mary Ellen', 'Ferdman, Ronald M', 'Hernandez-Trujillo, Vivian', 'Puck, Jennifer M', 'Sullivan, Kathleen', 'Secord, Elizabeth A', 'Ramesh, Manish', 'Cunningham-Rundles, Charlotte']","['Leven EA', 'Maffucci P', 'Ochs HD', 'Scholl PR', 'Buckley RH', 'Fuleihan RL', 'Geha RS', 'Cunningham CK', 'Bonilla FA', 'Conley ME', 'Ferdman RM', 'Hernandez-Trujillo V', 'Puck JM', 'Sullivan K', 'Secord EA', 'Ramesh M', 'Cunningham-Rundles C']","['Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', ""Seattle Children's Hospital Seattle, Seattle, WA, USA."", 'Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ridgefield, CT, USA.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, USA.', ""Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL, USA."", ""Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, USA.', ""Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA.', ""Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."", ""Miami Children's Hospital, Miami, FL, USA."", 'University of California San Francisco School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA, USA.', ""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", ""Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, MI, USA."", 'Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. charlotte.cunningham-rundles@mssm.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Clin Immunol,Journal of clinical immunology,8102137,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'CD40 Ligand/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diarrhea', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Hyper-IgM Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neutropenia', '*Registries', 'Survival Analysis', 'United States', 'Young Adult']",2016/05/18 06:00,2017/11/02 06:00,['2016/05/19 06:00'],"['2016/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/02 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,J Clin Immunol. 2016 Jul;36(5):490-501. doi: 10.1007/s10875-016-0291-4.

Our study evaluated the risk factors for persistent SCH in survivors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Survivors (n=423) were defined as patients who survived at least 2 years after cancer treatment completion. Thyroid function was assessed at this time and several years thereafter. Two groups of survivors with SCH were compared: those who regained normal thyroid function during the follow-up period (normalized group) and those who did not (persistent group). RESULTS: Overall, 104 of the 423 survivors had SCH. SCH was observed in 26% of brain or nasopharyngeal cancer survivors (11 of 43) and 21.6% of leukemia survivors (35 of 162). Sixty-two survivors regained normal thyroid function, 30 remained as persistent SCH, and 12 were lost to follow-up. The follow-up duration was 4.03 (2.15-5.78) years. Brain or nasopharyngeal cancer and Hodgkin disease were more common in the persistent group than in the normalized group (p=0.002). More patients in the persistent group received radiation (p=0.008). Radiation to the head region was higher in this group (2394+/-2469 cGy) than in the normalized group (894+/-1591 cGy; p=0.003). On multivariable analysis, lymphoma (p=0.011), brain or nasopharyngeal cancer (p=0.039), and head radiation dose >/=1800 cGy (p=0.039) were significant risk factors for persistent SCH.

METHODS: The rates of cell proliferation following treatment with vorinostat with or without ATO were measured. Flow cytometry of Annexin-V/propidium iodide double-stained cells was used to measure apoptosis. Acridine Orange and ethidium bromide staining was used to observe morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Western blot analysis was used to measure protein levels. RESULTS: Vorinostat and ATO, alone and in combination, inhibited the proliferation of NB4 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner and the effect was additive. NB4 cells treated with vorinostat + ATO demonstrated greater levels of apoptosis compared with cells treated with either drug alone. Both vorinostat and ATO alone and in combination resulted in lower levels of promyelocytic leukaemia/retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion protein and increased levels of acetyl-histone H3 and acetyl-histone H4 proteins compared with controls. Vorinostat + ATO resulted in lower levels of Akt protein compared with either drug alone. CONCLUSION: The combination of vorinostat and ATO inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and enhanced the chemosensitivity of NB4 cells. The mechanism might be associated with increasing histone acetylation levels as well as downregulation of the Akt signalling pathway.","['Li, Xiaofan', 'Guan, Xiaoyan', 'Li, Fang', 'Chen, Yuanzhong', 'Li, Nainong']","['Li X', 'Guan X', 'Li F', 'Chen Y', 'Li N']","['Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Haematology, Department of Haematology, Fujian Institute of Haematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian Province, China.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Fujian Provincial Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian Province, China.', 'Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Haematology, Department of Haematology, Fujian Institute of Haematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian Province, China.', 'Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Haematology, Department of Haematology, Fujian Institute of Haematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian Province, China.', 'Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Haematology, Department of Haematology, Fujian Institute of Haematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian Province, China nainli@aliyun.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Int Med Res,The Journal of international medical research,0346411,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Vorinostat']",2016/05/18 06:00,2017/04/11 06:00,['2016/05/19 06:00'],"['2015/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,J Int Med Res. 2016 Aug;44(4):882-92. doi: 10.1177/0300060516646238.

Successful therapeutic outcome depends on long-term expression of CAR transgene in T cells, which is achieved by delivering transgene using integrating gamma retrovirus (RV) or lentivirus (LV). However, uncontrolled RV/LV integration in host cell genomes has the potential risk of causing insertional mutagenesis. Herein, we describe a novel episomal long-term cell engineering method using non-integrating lentiviral (NILV) vector containing a scaffold/matrix attachment region (S/MAR) element, for either expression of transgenes or silencing of target genes. The insertional events of this vector into the genome of host cells are below detection level. CD19 CAR T cells engineered with a NILV-S/MAR vector have similar levels of CAR expression as T cells engineered with an integrating LV vector, even after numerous rounds of cell division. NILV-S/MAR-engineered CD19 CAR T cells exhibited similar cytotoxic capacity upon CD19(+) target cell recognition as LV-engineered T cells and are as effective in controlling tumor growth in vivo We propose that NILV-S/MAR vectors are superior to current options as they enable long-term transgene expression without the risk of insertional mutagenesis and genotoxicity.","['Jin, Chuan', 'Fotaki, Grammatiki', 'Ramachandran, Mohanraj', 'Nilsson, Berith', 'Essand, Magnus', 'Yu, Di']","['Jin C', 'Fotaki G', 'Ramachandran M', 'Nilsson B', 'Essand M', 'Yu D']","['Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden magnus.essand@igp.uu.se di.yu@igp.uu.se.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden magnus.essand@igp.uu.se di.yu@igp.uu.se.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO Mol Med,EMBO molecular medicine,101487380,IM,"['Adoptive Transfer/*methods', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Cell Engineering/*methods', 'Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy/*methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Plasmids', 'Receptors, Antigen/biosynthesis/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', '*Transgenes', 'Treatment Outcome']",2016/05/18 06:00,2017/09/14 06:00,['2016/05/19 06:00'],"['2016/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/14 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,EMBO Mol Med. 2016 Jul 1;8(7):702-11. doi: 10.15252/emmm.201505869.

Here, we investigated the potential of CD33/CD3-directed tandem diabodies (TandAbs) as novel treatment approach for AML. These tetravalent bispecific antibodies provide two binding sites for each antigen to maintain the avidity of a bivalent antibody and have a molecular weight exceeding the renal clearance threshold, thus offering a longer half-life compared to smaller antibody constructs. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We constructed a series of TandAbs composed of anti-CD33 and anti-CD3 variable domains of diverse binding affinities and profiled their functional properties in CD33(+) human leukemia cell lines, xenograft models, and AML patient samples. RESULTS: Our studies demonstrated that several CD33/CD3 TandAbs could induce potent, dose-dependent cytolysis of CD33(+) AML cell lines. This effect was modulated by the effector-to-target cell ratio and strictly required the presence of T cells. Activation and proliferation of T cells and maximal AML cell cytolysis correlated with high avidity to both CD33 and CD3. High-avidity TandAbs were broadly active in primary specimens from patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory AML in vitro, with cytotoxic properties independent of CD33 receptor density and cytogenetic risk. Tumor growth delay and inhibition were observed in both prophylactic and established HL-60 xenograft models in immunodeficient mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show high efficacy of CD33/CD3 TandAbs in various preclinical models of human AML. Together, these findings support further study of CD33/CD3 TandAbs as novel immunotherapeutics for patients with AML. Clin Cancer Res; 22(23); 5829-38.

Using areas with high and low naturally occurring fluoride, as well as areas with optimal fluoridation, we examined a wide range of fluoride levels in public drinking water. METHODS: This was a population-based case-control study, with both cases and controls obtained from the Texas Cancer Registry. Eligible cases were Texas children and adolescents <20 years old diagnosed with osteosarcoma between 1996 and 2006. Controls were sampled from children and adolescents diagnosed with either central nervous system (CNS) tumors or leukemia during the same time frame. Using geocoded patient addresses at the time of diagnosis, we estimated patients' drinking water fluoride exposure levels based on the fluoride levels of their residence's public water system (PWS). Unconditional logistic regression models were used to assess the association between osteosarcoma and public drinking water fluoride level, adjusting for several demographic risk factors. RESULTS: Three hundred and eight osteosarcoma cases, 598 leukemia controls, and 604 CNS tumor controls met selection criteria and were assigned a corresponding PWS fluoride level. PWS fluoride level was not associated with osteosarcoma, either in a univariable analysis or after adjusting for age, sex, race, and poverty index. Stratified analyses by sex were conducted; no association between PWS fluoride level and osteosarcoma was observed among either males or females. CONCLUSIONS: No relationship was found between fluoride levels in public drinking water and childhood/adolescent osteosarcoma in Texas.","['Archer, Natalie P', 'Napier, Thomas S', 'Villanacci, John F']","['Archer NP', 'Napier TS', 'Villanacci JF']","['Office of Program Decision Support, Texas Department of State Health Services, P.O.

In this study, we propose a new allergy model system for studying potential allergen epitopes using nanoallergens, liposomes modified to effectively display IgE binding epitopes/haptens. By utilizing the covalently conjugated lipid tails on two hapten molecules (dinitrophenol and dansyl), hapten molecules were successfully incorporated into liposomes with high precision to form nanoallergens. Nanoallergens, with precisely controlled high-particle valency, can trigger degranulation with much greater sensitivity than commonly used bovine serum albumin conjugates. In rat basophil leukemia cell experiments, nanoallergens with only 2% hapten loading were able to trigger degranulation in vitro at concentrations as low as 10 pM. Additionally, unlike bovine serum albumin-hapten conjugates, nanoallergens allow exact control over particle size and valency. By varying the nanoallergen parameters such as size, valency, monovalent affinity of hapten, and specific IgE ratios, we exposed the importance of these variables on degranulation intensity while demonstrating nanoallergens' potential for evaluating both high- and low-affinity epitopes. The data presented in this article establish nanoallergen platform as a reliable and versatile allergy model to study and evaluate allergen epitopes in mast cell degranulation.","['Deak, Peter E', 'Vrabel, Maura R', 'Pizzuti, Vincenzo J', 'Kiziltepe, Tanyel', 'Bilgicer, Basar']","['Deak PE', 'Vrabel MR', 'Pizzuti VJ', 'Kiziltepe T', 'Bilgicer B']","['Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA.', 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA.', 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA.', 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA Advanced Diagnostics and Therapeutics, University of Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA.', 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA Advanced Diagnostics and Therapeutics, University of Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA bbilgicer@nd.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Exp Biol Med (Maywood),"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",100973463,IM,"['2,4-Dinitrophenol/immunology', 'Allergens/*chemistry/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Cell Degranulation/*immunology', 'Cell Line', '*Epitopes', 'Haptens/immunology', 'Immunoconjugates/chemistry', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism', 'Lipids/chemistry', 'Mast Cells/immunology', 'Nanostructures/chemistry', 'Particle Size', 'Phosphatidylcholines/immunology', 'Rats']",2016/05/18 06:00,2017/06/08 06:00,['2016/05/19 06:00'],"['2016/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2016 May;241(9):996-1006. doi: 10.1177/1535370216644533.

Since more than one defective cellular component is often involved during oncogenesis, combination therapy is gaining prominence in the field of cancer therapeutics. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the combinatorial effects of a novel PARP inhibitor, P10, and HDAC inhibitor, SAHA, in leukemic cells. METHODS: Combinatorial effects of P10 and SAHA were tested using propidium iodide staining in different leukemic cells. Further, flowcytometry-based assays such as calcein-AM/ethidium homodimer staining, annexin-FITC/PI staining, and JC-1 staining were carried out to elucidate the mechanism of cell death. In addition, cell-cycle analysis, immunocytochemistry studies, and western blotting analysis were conducted to check the combinatorial effect in Nalm6 cells. RESULTS: Propidium iodide staining showed that P10 in combination with SAHA induced cell death in Nalm6 cells, in which PARP expression and activity is high with a combination index of <0.2. Annexin-FITC/PI staining, JC-1 staining, and other biochemical assays revealed that P10 in combination with SAHA induced apoptosis by causing a change in mitochondrial membrane potential in >65 % cells. Importantly, combinatorial treatment induced S phase arrest in 40-45 % cells due to DNA damage and plausible replicative stress. Finally, we demonstrated that treatment with P10 led to DNA strand breaks, which were further potentiated by SAHA (p < 0.01), leading to activation of apoptosis and increased cell death in PARP-positive leukemic cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that coadministration of PARP inhibitor with SAHA could be used as a combination therapy against leukemic cells that possess high levels of intrinsic PARP activity.","['Hegde, Mahesh', 'Mantelingu, Kempegowda', 'Pandey, Monica', 'Pavankumar, Chottanahalli S', 'Rangappa, Kanchugarakoppal S', 'Raghavan, Sathees C']","['Hegde M', 'Mantelingu K', 'Pandey M', 'Pavankumar CS', 'Rangappa KS', 'Raghavan SC']","['Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560012, India.', 'Department of Studies in Chemistry, Manasagangotri, University of Mysore, Mysuru, 570006, India.', 'Department of Studies in Chemistry, Manasagangotri, University of Mysore, Mysuru, 570006, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560012, India.', 'Department of Studies in Chemistry, Manasagangotri, University of Mysore, Mysuru, 570006, India.', 'Department of Studies in Chemistry, Manasagangotri, University of Mysore, Mysuru, 570006, India. rangappaks@chemistry.uni-mysore.ac.in.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560012, India. sathees@biochem.iisc.ernet.in.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Target Oncol,Targeted oncology,101270595,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2016/05/18 06:00,2017/10/31 06:00,['2016/05/19 06:00'],"['2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/31 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Target Oncol. 2016 Oct;11(5):655-665. doi: 10.1007/s11523-016-0441-x.,,,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)']",,,,,"['10.1007/s11523-016-0441-x [doi]', '10.1007/s11523-016-0441-x [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their main drawback, their low stability in plasma, has recently been partially overcome by exchanging the aldimine hydrogen for an unbranched alkyl group. In this study, ten analogs of methyl- and ethyl-substituted SIH derivatives with modified hydrazide scaffolds were synthesized to further explore their structure-activity relationships. Their iron-chelation efficiencies, anti- or pro-oxidant potentials, abilities to induce protection against model oxidative injury on the H9c2 cell line derived from rat embryonic cardiac tissue, cytotoxicities on the same H9c2 cells and antiproliferative activities on MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma and HL-60 human promyelotic leukemia cell lines were evaluated. Compounds derived from lipophilic naphthyl and biphenyl hydrazides displayed highly selective antiproliferative activities against both MCF-7 and HL-60 cell lines, and they showed markedly improved stabilities in plasma compared to SIH. Of particular interest is a hydrazone prepared from 2-hydroxypropiophenone and pyridazin-4-carbohydrazide that showed a considerable antiproliferative effect and protected cardiomyoblasts against oxidative stress with a five-fold higher selectivity compared to the parent compound SIH. Thus, this work highlighted new structure-activity relationships among antiproliferative and antioxidant aroylhydrazones and identified new lead compounds for further development.","['Hruskova, Katerina', 'Potuckova, Eliska', 'Hergeselova, Tereza', 'Liptakova, Lucie', 'Haskova, Pavlina', 'Mingas, Panagiotis', 'Kovarikova, Petra', 'Simunek, Tomas', 'Vavrova, Katerina']","['Hruskova K', 'Potuckova E', 'Hergeselova T', 'Liptakova L', 'Haskova P', 'Mingas P', 'Kovarikova P', 'Simunek T', 'Vavrova K']","['Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Pharmacy in Hradec Kralove, Heyrovskeho 1203, 500 05 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Pharmacy in Hradec Kralove, Heyrovskeho 1203, 500 05 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Pharmacy in Hradec Kralove, Heyrovskeho 1203, 500 05 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Pharmacy in Hradec Kralove, Heyrovskeho 1203, 500 05 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Pharmacy in Hradec Kralove, Heyrovskeho 1203, 500 05 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Pharmacy in Hradec Kralove, Heyrovskeho 1203, 500 05 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Pharmacy in Hradec Kralove, Heyrovskeho 1203, 500 05 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Pharmacy in Hradec Kralove, Heyrovskeho 1203, 500 05 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.

The signature cross-conjugated dienone structural motif of 1 was forged by an aldol reaction/dehydration sequence from key building blocks enone 13 and aldehyde 14, whose lone stereocenters were generated by an asymmetric Tsuji-Trost reaction and an asymmetric Mukaiyama aldol reaction, respectively. During this program, a substituent-governed regioselectivity pattern for the Rh-catalyzed C-H functionalization of cyclopentenes and related olefins was discovered. The evolution of the synthesis of 1 from the original strategy to the final streamlined process proceeded through improvements in the construction of both fragments 13 and 14, exploration of the chemistry of the hitherto underutilized chiral lactone synthon 57, and a diastereoselective alkylation of a cyclopentenone intermediate. The described chemistry sets the stage for large-scale production of Delta(12) -PGJ3 and designed analogues for further biological and pharmacological studies.","['Nicolaou, K C', 'Pulukuri, Kiran Kumar', 'Yu, Ruocheng', 'Rigol, Stephan', 'Heretsch, Philipp', 'Grove, Charles I', 'Hale, Christopher R H', 'ElMarrouni, Abdelatif']","['Nicolaou KC', 'Pulukuri KK', 'Yu R', 'Rigol S', 'Heretsch P', 'Grove CI', 'Hale CR', 'ElMarrouni A']","['Department of Chemistry, BioScience Research Collaborative, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, TX, 77005, USA. kcn@rice.edu.', 'Department of Chemistry, BioScience Research Collaborative, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, TX, 77005, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, BioScience Research Collaborative, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, TX, 77005, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, BioScience Research Collaborative, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, TX, 77005, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, BioScience Research Collaborative, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, TX, 77005, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, BioScience Research Collaborative, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, TX, 77005, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, BioScience Research Collaborative, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, TX, 77005, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, The Scripps Research Institute, 10550 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA, 92037, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, BioScience Research Collaborative, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, TX, 77005, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Chemistry,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",9513783,IM,"['Aldehydes', 'Alkenes/chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'Catalysis', 'Cyclopentanes/chemistry', 'Prostaglandins/*chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'Rhodium/chemistry', 'Stereoisomerism']",2016/05/18 06:00,2017/12/20 06:00,['2016/05/18 06:00'],"['2016/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Chemistry. 2016 Jun 13;22(25):8559-70. doi: 10.1002/chem.201601449.

Thus, there is a compelling need for new intervention strategies with an improved therapeutic profile. Immunogenic cell death (ICD) represents an innovative anticancer strategy where dying cancer cells release damage-associated molecular patterns promoting tumor-specific immune responses. The roots of Withania somnifera (W. somnifera) are used in the Indian traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating, neuroprotective, and anticancer activities. The present study is designed to explore the antileukemic activity of the dimethyl sulfoxide extract obtained from the roots of W. somnifera (WE). We studied its cytostatic and cytotoxic activity, its ability to induce ICD, and its genotoxic potential on a human T-lymphoblastoid cell line by using different flow cytometric assays. Our results show that WE has a significant cytotoxic and cytostatic potential, and induces ICD. Its proapoptotic mechanism involves intracellular Ca(2+) accumulation and the generation of reactive oxygen species. In our experimental conditions, the extract possesses a genotoxic potential. Since the use of Withania is suggested in different contexts including anti-infertility and osteoarthritis care, its genotoxicity should be carefully considered for an accurate assessment of its risk-benefit profile.","['Turrini, Eleonora', 'Calcabrini, Cinzia', 'Sestili, Piero', 'Catanzaro, Elena', 'de Gianni, Elena', 'Diaz, Anna Rita', 'Hrelia, Patrizia', 'Tacchini, Massimo', 'Guerrini, Alessandra', 'Canonico, Barbara', 'Papa, Stefano', 'Valdre, Giovanni', 'Fimognari, Carmela']","['Turrini E', 'Calcabrini C', 'Sestili P', 'Catanzaro E', 'de Gianni E', 'Diaz AR', 'Hrelia P', 'Tacchini M', 'Guerrini A', 'Canonico B', 'Papa S', 'Valdre G', 'Fimognari C']","[""Department for Life Quality Studies, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Corso d'Augusto 237, 47921 Rimini, Italy. eleonora.turrini@unibo.it."", ""Department for Life Quality Studies, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Corso d'Augusto 237, 47921 Rimini, Italy. cinzia.calcabrini@unibo.it."", 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Via Saffi 2, 61029 Urbino, Italy. piero.sestili@uniurb.it.', ""Department for Life Quality Studies, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Corso d'Augusto 237, 47921 Rimini, Italy. elena.catanzaro2@unibo.it."", ""Department for Life Quality Studies, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Corso d'Augusto 237, 47921 Rimini, Italy. elena.degianni2@unibo.it."", 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Via Saffi 2, 61029 Urbino, Italy. anna.diaz@uniurb.it.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Via Irnerio 48, 40126 Bologna, Italy. patrizia.hrelia@unibo.it.', ""Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology (SVeB)-LT Terra &amp; Acqua Tech RU, University of Ferrara, Corso Ercole I d'Este 32, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy. massimo.tacchini@unife.it."", ""Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology (SVeB)-LT Terra &amp; Acqua Tech RU, University of Ferrara, Corso Ercole I d'Este 32, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy. grrlsn@unife.it."", 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Via Saffi 2, 61029 Urbino, Italy. barbara.canonico@uniurb.it.', 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Via Saffi 2, 61029 Urbino, Italy. stefano.papa@uniurb.it.', 'Department of Biological, Geological and Environmental Sciences (BiGeA), Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Piazza di Porta S.

In this study, we have analyzed the morphology and Gag stoichiometry of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-like particles and authentic, mature HTLV-1 particles by using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). HTLV-1-like particles mimicked the morphology of immature authentic HTLV-1 virions. Importantly, we have observed for the first time that the morphology of these virus-like particles (VLPs) has the unique local feature of a flat Gag lattice that does not follow the curvature of the viral membrane, resulting in an enlarged distance between the Gag lattice and the viral membrane. Other morphological features that have been previously observed with other retroviruses include: (1) a Gag lattice with multiple discontinuities; (2) membrane regions associated with the Gag lattice that exhibited a string of bead-like densities at the inner leaflet; and (3) an arrangement of the Gag lattice resembling a railroad track. Measurement of the average size and mass of VLPs and authentic HTLV-1 particles suggested a consistent range of size and Gag copy numbers in these two groups of particles. The unique local flat Gag lattice morphological feature observed suggests that HTLV-1 Gag could be arranged in a lattice structure that is distinct from that of other retroviruses characterized to date.","['Maldonado, Jose O', 'Cao, Sheng', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Mansky, Louis M']","['Maldonado JO', 'Cao S', 'Zhang W', 'Mansky LM']","['Institute for Molecular Virology &amp; DDS-PhD Dual Degree Program, 18-242 Moos Tower, 515 Delaware Street SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. jmaldo@umn.edu.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, 18-242 Moos Tower, 515 Delaware Street SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. caosheng@wh.iov.cn.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology &amp; Characterization Facility, 18-242 Moos Tower, 515 Delaware Street SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. zhangwei@umn.edu.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, 18-242 Moos Tower, 515 Delaware Street SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. mansky@umn.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,IM,"['Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Gene Products, gag/analysis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/chemistry/*ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Virion/chemistry/*ultrastructure']",2016/05/18 06:00,2017/09/14 06:00,['2016/05/18 06:00'],"['2016/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/14 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Viruses. 2016 May 11;8(5). pii: v8050132. doi: 10.3390/v8050132.,10.3390/v8050132 [doi] E132 [pii],20160511,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)']",PMC4885087,['NOTNLM'],"['*deltaretrovirus', '*lentivirus', '*virus assembly']",,"['v8050132 [pii]', '10.3390/v8050132 [doi]']",,,"['F30 DE022286/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM098550/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI083196/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major source of vitamin D in the organism is skin production upon exposure to ultra violet-B. The very first observation of an inverse correlation between exposure of individuals to the sun and the likelihood of cancer was reported as early as 1941. In 1980, Garland and Garland hypothesised, from findings from epidemiological studies of patients in the US with colon cancer, that vitamin D produced in response to sun exposure is protective against cancer as opposed to sunlight per se. Later studies revealed inverse correlations between sun exposure and the occurrence of prostate and breast cancers. These observations prompted laboratory investigation of whether or not vitamin D had an effect on cancer cells. Vitamin D is not active against cancer cells, but the most active metabolite 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D) has profound biological effects. Here, we review the anticancer action of 1,25D, clinical trials of 1,25D to date and the prospects of the future therapeutic use of new and low calcaemic analogues.","['Marcinkowska, Ewa', 'Wallace, Graham R', 'Brown, Geoffrey']","['Marcinkowska E', 'Wallace GR', 'Brown G']","['Laboratory of Protein Biochemistry, Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Wroclaw, Joliot-Curie 14a, 50-383 Wroclaw, Poland. ema@cs.uni.wroc.pl.', 'Institute of Inflammation and Aging, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK. g.r.wallace@bham.ac.uk.', 'Institute of Clinical Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK. g.brown@bham.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Calcitriol/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma/*drug therapy', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Vitamins/*therapeutic use']",2016/05/18 06:00,2017/03/10 06:00,['2016/05/18 06:00'],"['2016/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/22 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2016 May 13;17(5). pii: ijms17050729. doi: 10.3390/ijms17050729.,10.3390/ijms17050729 [doi] E729 [pii],20160513,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Vitamins)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",PMC4881551,['NOTNLM'],"['1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D', 'analogues', 'cancer']",,"['ijms17050729 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms17050729 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of leukapheresis in these children treated with contemporary therapy remains controversial. PROCEDURE: We analyzed clinical data from patients enrolled onto frontline protocols for ALL (Total Therapy XV and XVI) between 2003 and 2014. We documented adverse events within the first 14 days in patients with a white blood cell (WBC) count >/=200 x 10(9) /l and reviewed their management. RESULTS: Fifty-three (7.8%) of 678 consecutive pediatric patients with newly diagnosed ALL presented with hyperleukocytosis (median WBC count 393 x 10(9) /l; range 200-1,014). Two deaths in patients without initial hyperleukocytosis occurred within the first 2 weeks from diagnosis secondary to bacterial sepsis. A total of 21 (40%) patients with ALL and hyperleukocytosis developed grade 3 or 4 adverse events regardless of the use of leukapheresis (P > 0.99 and P = 0.19). Sixteen of 53 (30%) patients with ALL received low-dose chemotherapy for leukocytoreduction initially. One-third of patients received urate oxidase, and none of the patients with hyperleukocytosis required hemodialysis.

The goal of the present study was to determine whether GLP-2-induced crypt cell proliferation requires a full complement of B-cell lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region-1 homolog (Bmi-1), using the Bmi-1(eGFP/+) mouse model in comparison with age- and sex-matched Bmi-1(+/+) littermates. Bmi-1 is a member of the polycomb-repressive complex family that promotes stem cell proliferation and self-renewal and is expressed by both stem cells and transit-amplifying (TA) cells in the crypt. The acute (6 h) and chronic (11 d) proliferative responses to long-acting human (Gly(2))GLP-2 in the crypt TA zone, but not in the active or reserve stem cell zones, were both impaired by Bmi-1 haploinsufficiency. Similarly, GLP-2-induced crypt regeneration after 10-Gy irradiation was reduced in the Bmi-1(eGFP/+) animals. Despite these findings, chronic GLP-2 treatment enhanced overall intestinal growth in the Bmi-1(eGFP/+) mice, as demonstrated by increases in small intestinal weight per body weight and in the length of the crypt-villus axis, in association with decreased apoptosis and an adaptive increase in crypt epithelial cell migration rate. The results of these studies therefore demonstrate that a full complement of Bmi-1 is required for the intestinal proliferative effects of GLP-2 in both the physiological and pathological setting, and mediates, at least in part, the proliferation kinetics of cells in the TA zone.","['Smither, Bradley R', 'Pang, Hilary Y M', 'Brubaker, Patricia L']","['Smither BR', 'Pang HY', 'Brubaker PL']","['Departments of Physiology (B.R.S., H.Y.M.P., P.L.B.) and Medicine (P.L.B.), University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 1A8.', 'Departments of Physiology (B.R.S., H.Y.M.P., P.L.B.) and Medicine (P.L.B.), University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 1A8.', 'Departments of Physiology (B.R.S., H.Y.M.P., P.L.B.) and Medicine (P.L.B.), University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 1A8.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Glucagon-Like Peptide 2/*pharmacology', 'Intestinal Mucosa/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Intestine, Small/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2016/05/18 06:00,2017/06/06 06:00,['2016/05/18 06:00'],"['2016/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2016 Jul;157(7):2660-70. doi: 10.1210/en.2016-1127.

In haematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), immune evasion due to the poor immunogenicity of leukemic cells is a major hurdle in generating an effective immune response. Transfection of synthetic dsRNA, poly I:C, into leukemic cells to trigger tumour cell death and enhance immunogenicity of the tumour is a promising immunotherapeutic approach. However, the temporal cell death kinetics of poly I:C-electroporated AML cells has not been thoroughly investigated. Electroporation of U937 cells, a human AML cell line, with a high dose of poly I:C resulted in cytotoxicity as early as 1 h post-transfection. Flow cytometric analysis revealed the temporal switch from early apoptosis to late apoptosis/secondary necrosis in poly I:C-electroporated cells in which the nuclear morphology at later time points was consistent with necrotic cell death. Our brief findings demonstrated the temporal cell death kinetics of dsRNA-transfected leukemic cells. This finding is an important development in the field of dsRNA immunotherapy for leukaemia as understanding the type of cell death elicited by transfected dsRNA will dictate the type of immune response to be directed against leukemic cells.","['Mahmud, S M', 'Mek, K J', 'Idris, A']","['Mahmud SM', 'Mek KJ', 'Idris A']","['PAPRSB Institute of Health Sciences, Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Brunei Darussalam.', 'PAPRSB Institute of Health Sciences, Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Brunei Darussalam.', 'PAPRSB Institute of Health Sciences, Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Brunei Darussalam.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Czech Republic,Folia Biol (Praha),Folia biologica,0234640,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'RNA/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2016/05/18 06:00,2017/03/09 06:00,['2016/05/18 06:00'],"['2016/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/09 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Folia Biol (Praha). 2016;62(2):90-4.,,,['63231-63-0 (RNA)'],,,,,['FB2016A0011 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of antiproliferative, cytotoxic, and DNA-damaging activity, and the effect on expressions of cell cycle regulatory proteins were investigated using a WST-1-based proliferation assay, lactate dehydrogenase leakage assay, comet assay, flow cytometry, and western blot analysis. In-vivo anticancer activity was evaluated using Ehrlich tumor-bearing NMRI mice. Diruthenium-2 inhibited the growth of all cancer cell lines used, the most sensitive being gastric (AGS), breast cancer (BT-549, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231), and leukemic (HL-60, MOLT-4) cells. In MCF-7 cells, it caused a G1/S cell cycle arrest, along with an increase in the expression of protein p21 and cyclin B1. We also observed increased levels of MRN complex proteins, which, together with the results from the comet assay, indicate the formation of DNA double-strand breaks. In tumor-bearing mice, diruthenium-2 at doses of 3 and 5 mg/kg inhibits the growth of solid Ehrlich tumor, although weaker than cisplatin. However, it did not prolong the post-therapeutic survival. Our results suggest the in-vitro potential of diruthenium-2 should be further evaluated in studies using other in-vivo models.","['Muthna, Darina', 'Tomsik, Pavel', 'Havelek, Radim', 'Kohlerova, Renata', 'Kasilingam, Vidhya', 'Cermakova, Eva', 'Stibal, David', 'Rezacova, Martina', 'Suss-Fink, Georg']","['Muthna D', 'Tomsik P', 'Havelek R', 'Kohlerova R', 'Kasilingam V', 'Cermakova E', 'Stibal D', 'Rezacova M', 'Suss-Fink G']","['aDepartment of Medical Biochemistry bDepartment of Medical Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, Charles University in Prague, Hradec Kralove cDepartment of Biological and Biochemical Sciences, Faculty of Chemical Technology, University of Pardubice, Pardubice, Czech Republic dInstitute of Chemistry, University of Neuchatel, Neuchatel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coordination Complexes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mice', 'Ruthenium/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2016/05/18 06:00,2017/10/21 06:00,['2016/05/18 06:00'],"['2016/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2016 Aug;27(7):643-50. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000374.,10.1097/CAD.0000000000000374 [doi],,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Coordination Complexes)', '7UI0TKC3U5 (Ruthenium)']",,,,,['10.1097/CAD.0000000000000374 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently published data suggested that high-dose dexamethasone might be equally effective as HDMP despite a lower cumulative dose. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed retrospective analysis of 60 patients with relapsed/refractory CLL (median age: 66 years; range: 37-86) treated with rituximab plus dexamethasone (R-dex) at a single tertiary center between September 2008 and October 2012. The schedule of R-dex consisted of rituximab 500 mg/m(2) i.v. day 1 (375 mg/m(2) in cycle 1) and dexamethasone 40 mg orally on days 1-4 and 10-13 repeated every 3 weeks for a maximum of 8 cycles. Unfavorable prognostic features were frequent (Rai stages III/IV in 67%, unmutated IgVH 82%, del 11q 43%, TP53 mutation/deletion 23%, bulky lymphadenopathy 58% of patients). RESULTS: Overall response (OR)/complete remission (CR) was achieved in 75/3%. At the median follow-up of 21 months, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8 months, median time to next treatment 12.9 months and median overall survival 25.5 months. Refractoriness to fludarabine (p = 0.04) and age >/= 65 years (p = 0.03) were significant predictors of shorter PFS.

Mutation of the internal tandem duplication (ITD) region of fms-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3) is considered high risk for decreased response and overall survival. Midostaurin is a Type III receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor found to inhibit FLT3 and other receptor tyrosine kinases, including platelet-derived growth factor receptors, cyclin-dependent kinase 1, src, c-kit, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. In preclinical studies, midostaurin exhibited broad-spectrum antitumor activity toward a wide range of tumor xenografts, as well as an FLT3-ITD-driven mouse model of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Midostaurin is orally administered and generally well tolerated as a single agent; hematologic toxicity increases substantially when administered in combination with standard induction chemotherapy. Clinical trials primarily have focused on relapsed/refractory AML and MDS and included single- and combination-agent studies. Administration of midostaurin to relapsed/refractory MDS and AML patients confers a robust anti-blast response sufficient to bridge a minority of patients to transplant. In combination with histone deacetylase inhibitors, responses appear comparable to historic controls, while the addition of midostaurin to standard induction chemotherapy may prolong survival in FLT3-ITD mutant patients. The response of some wild-type (WT)-FLT3 patients to midostaurin therapy is consistent with midostaurin's ability to inhibit WT-FLT3 in vitro, and also may reflect overexpression of WT-FLT3 in those patients and/or off-target effects such as inhibition of kinases other than FLT3. Midostaurin represents a well-tolerated, easily administered oral agent with the potential to bridge mutant and WT-FLT3 AML patients to transplant and possibly deepen response to induction chemotherapy. Ongoing studies are investigating midostaurin's role in pretransplant induction and posttransplant consolidation therapy.","['Gallogly, Molly Megan', 'Lazarus, Hillard M']","['Gallogly MM', 'Lazarus HM']","['Department of Medicine, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,J Blood Med,Journal of blood medicine,101550884,,,2016/05/18 06:00,2016/05/18 06:01,['2016/05/18 06:00'],"['2016/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/18 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,J Blood Med. 2016 Apr 19;7:73-83. doi: 10.2147/JBM.S100283. eCollection 2016.,10.2147/JBM.S100283 [doi],20160419,,PMC4848023,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3', 'acute leukemia', 'clinical trial', 'midostaurin', 'myelodysplastic syndrome']",,"['10.2147/JBM.S100283 [doi]', 'jbm-7-073 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therapy of systemic sclerosis is still not convincing and is mainly restricted to the management of organ complications. A wide choice of immunosuppressive and antifibrotic drugs has been used to try to modify the course of the disease, but significant breakthroughs are still lacking. Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor known to regulate growth, proliferation, and differentiation as well as apoptosis of cells and is already widely used for several malignancies, eg, chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. It has been used in preclinical as well as clinical studies to modulate the fibrotic process in patients with systemic sclerosis. This is based on its activity to interfere selectively with both the transforming growth factor-beta and platelet-derived growth factor signaling pathway. Preclinical studies in mouse models of scleroderma showed significant anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects; however, several clinical, proof-of-concept trials have not yet confirmed these initially promising results.","['Moinzadeh, Pia', 'Hunzelmann, Nicolas', 'Krieg, Thomas']","['Moinzadeh P', 'Hunzelmann N', 'Krieg T']","['Department of Dermatology and Venerology, University of Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology and Venerology, University of Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology and Venerology, University of Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,J Exp Pharmacol,Journal of experimental pharmacology,101530345,,,2013/01/01 00:00,2013/01/01 00:01,['2016/05/18 06:00'],"['2016/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",epublish,J Exp Pharmacol. 2013 Apr 4;5:15-22. doi: 10.2147/JEP.S26894. eCollection 2013.,10.2147/JEP.S26894 [doi],20130404,,PMC4863537,['NOTNLM'],"['SSc', 'imatinib', 'scleroderma', 'systemic sclerosis', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,"['10.2147/JEP.S26894 [doi]', 'jep-5-015 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We established an international consortium with the aim to create an international prognostic index for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL-IPI) that integrates the major prognostic parameters. METHODS: We used results from a systematic search of the Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group of MEDLINE, Embase, and Central databases for prospective, clinical phase 2 and 3 trials of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, published between Jan 1, 1950, and Dec 31, 2010, which identified 13 trials. We contacted the principal investigators of these 13 trials, of which eight agreed to include individual patient data. We used the individual patient data from these phase 3 trials from France, Germany, Poland, the UK, and the USA to create the full analysis dataset. The full analysis dataset was randomly divided, using a random sample procedure, into training and internal-validation datasets. We did a univariate analysis and multivariate analyses using 27 baseline factors and overall survival as an endpoint. We assigned weighted risk scores to each factor included in the final multivariable model. We assessed the discriminatory value using C-statistics and also the validity and reproducibility of the CLL-IPI by subgroup analysis. We used two additional datasets from the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN, USA; MAYO cohort) and the SCALE Scandinavian population-based case-control study (SCAN cohort) as the external-validation datasets. FINDINGS: 3472 treatment-naive patients were included in the full analysis dataset; 2308 were randomly segregated into the training dataset and 1164 into the internal-validation dataset. 838 patients were included in the MAYO cohort and 416 in the SCAN cohort. Median age of patients in the full analysis dataset was 61 years (range 27-86). Five independent prognostic factors were identified in the training dataset: TP53 status (no abnormalities vs del[17p] or TP53 mutation or both), IGHV mutational status (mutated vs unmutated), serum beta2-microglobulin concentration (</=3.5 mg/L vs >3.5 mg/L), clinical stage (Binet A or Rai 0 vs Binet B-C or Rai I-IV), and age (</=65 years vs >65 years). Using a weighted grading of the independent factors, a prognostic index was derived that identified four risk groups within the training dataset with significantly different overall survival at 5 years: low (93.2% [95% CI 90.5-96.0]), intermediate (79.3% [75.5-83.2]), high (63.3% [57.9-68.8]), and very high risk (23.3% [12.5-34.1]; log-rank test comparing survival across the four risk groups p<0.0001; C-statistic, c=0.723 [95% CI 0.684-0.752]). These risk groups were confirmed in the internal-validation and external-validation datasets. INTERPRETATION: The CLL-IPI combines genetic, biochemical, and clinical parameters into a prognostic model, discriminating four prognostic subgroups. The CLL-IPI will allow a more targeted management of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in clinical practice and in trials testing novel drugs.

The platelet dose (PLADO) trial, as the largest prospective randomized trial of prophylactic platelet therapy to date, afforded an opportunity to analyse these two issues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PLADO patient records were examined for evidence of platelet alloimmunization, defined as an increase in HLA Class I panel-reactive antibodies (PRA) to >/=20%, and clinical refractoriness, defined as two consecutive </=4 h posttransfusion corrected platelet count increments (CCI) of <5000. Multivariate logistic regression, restricted to platelet-transfused subjects who received exclusively either in-process leucoreduction apheresis or whole blood-derived (WBD) leucocyte-reduced platelets, compared the frequency of these outcomes by platelet unit and patient characteristics. RESULTS: Forty of 816 evaluable platelet-transfused patients (5%) became alloimmunized during the trial. Prior pregnancy, chemotherapy only compared to progenitor cell transplant, and low platelet dose - all were associated with significantly higher rates of alloimmunization. Among 35 alloimmunized patients evaluated for refractoriness, 8 (23%) had two consecutive CCI < 5000/mul. Regardless of alloimmunization status, CCIs < 5000/mul were observed following 17% of platelet transfusions. Among 734 patients receiving at least two platelet transfusions, two consecutive CCIs of </=5000 occurred in 102 (14%). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of new platelet alloimmunization was low in the PLADO study, but follow-up was at most 30 days. Alloimmunization was present in only 8 of 102 (8%) of observed cases of refractoriness, suggesting that other causes of poor posttransfusion increments are frequent.","['Hess, J R', 'Trachtenberg, F L', 'Assmann, S F', 'Triulzi, D J', 'Kaufman, R M', 'Strauss, R G', 'Granger, S', 'Slichter, S J']","['Hess JR', 'Trachtenberg FL', 'Assmann SF', 'Triulzi DJ', 'Kaufman RM', 'Strauss RG', 'Granger S', 'Slichter SJ']","['University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. hessj3@uw.edu.', 'New England Research Institutes, Watertown, MA, USA.', 'New England Research Institutes, Watertown, MA, USA.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', ""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA, USA.', 'New England Research Institutes, Watertown, MA, USA.', 'University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Bloodworks Northwest (formerly the Puget Sound Blood Center), Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Vox Sang,Vox sanguinis,0413606,IM,"['Antibodies/blood', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*etiology', 'Blood Component Removal', 'Blood Platelets/cytology/*immunology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Logistic Models', 'Platelet Count', 'Platelet Transfusion/*adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2016/10/22 06:00,2017/01/10 06:00,['2016/05/18 06:00'],"['2015/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/10 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vox Sang. 2016 Oct;111(3):281-291. doi: 10.1111/vox.12411.

The mechanisms of treatment failure of AML-M5 are still unclear. In this study, we generated iPSC from THP-1 cells from a patient with AML-M5, using retroviruses encoding the pluripotency-associated genes (OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC). These AML-M5-derived iPSC showed features similar with those of human embryonic stem cells in terms of the morphology, gene expression, protein/antigen expression and differentiation capability. Parental-specific markers were down-regulated in these AML-M5-derived iPSCs. Expression of MLL-AF9 fusion gene (previously identified to be associated with pathogenesis of AML-M5) was observed in all iPSC clones as well as parental cells. We conclude that AML-M5-specific iPSC clones have been successfully developed.

They express an array of surface receptors that mediate NK cell function. The human leukocytes antigen (HLA) class I-specific inhibitory receptors allow NK cells to detect and kill cells that have lost or under-express HLA class I antigens, a typical feature of tumor or virally infected cells. However, NK cell activation and induction of cytolytic activity and cytokine production depends on another important checkpoint, namely the expression on target cells of ligands recognized by activating NK receptors. Despite their potent cytolytic activity, NK cells frequently fail to eliminate tumors. This is due to mechanisms of tumor escape, determined by the tumor cells themselves or by tumor-associated cells (i.e. the tumor microenvironment) via the release of soluble suppressive factors or the induction of inhibitory loops involving induction of regulatory T cells, M2-polarized macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. The most important clinical application involving NK cells is the cure of high-risk leukemias in the haplo-identical hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) setting. NK cells originated from hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) of HLA-haploidentical donors may express Killer Immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) that are mismatched with the HLA class I alleles of the recipient. This allows NK cells to kill leukemia blasts residual after the conditioning regimen, while sparing normal cells (that do not express ligands for activating NK receptors). More recent approaches based on the specific removal of TCR alpha/beta(+) T cells and of CD19(+) B cells, allow the infusion, together with CD34(+) HSC, of mature KIR(+) NK cells and of TCR gamma/delta(+) T cells, both characterized by a potent anti-leukemia activity. This greatly reduces the time interval necessary to obtain alloreactive, KIR(+) NK cells derived from donor HSC. Another promising approach is based on the use of anti-KIR blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), rendering alloreactive any KIR(+) NK cells.","['Moretta, Lorenzo', 'Pietra, Gabriella', 'Vacca, Paola', 'Pende, Daniela', 'Moretta, Francesca', 'Bertaina, Alice', 'Mingari, Maria Cristina', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Moretta, Alessandro']","['Moretta L', 'Pietra G', 'Vacca P', 'Pende D', 'Moretta F', 'Bertaina A', 'Mingari MC', 'Locatelli F', 'Moretta A']","[""Department of Immunology, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy.

In this study, we have integrated a set of systems-biology tools and databases and have analysed more than 8000 molecular pathways on published global gene expression datasets of human cells in microgravity. Hundreds of new pathways have been identified with statistical confidence for each dataset and despite the difference in cell types and experiments, around 100 of the new pathways are appeared common across the datasets. They are related to reduced inflammation, autoimmunity, diabetes and asthma. We have identified downregulation of NfkappaB pathway via Notch1 signalling as new pathway for reduced immunity in microgravity. Induction of few cancer types including liver cancer and leukaemia and increased drug response to cancer in microgravity are also found. Increase in olfactory signal transduction is also identified. Genes, based on their expression pattern, are clustered and mathematically stable clusters are identified. The network mapping of genes within a cluster indicates the plausible functional connections in microgravity. This pipeline gives a new systems level picture of human cells under microgravity, generates testable hypothesis and may help estimating risk and developing medicine for space missions.","['Mukhopadhyay, Sayak', 'Saha, Rohini', 'Palanisamy, Anbarasi', 'Ghosh, Madhurima', 'Biswas, Anupriya', 'Roy, Saheli', 'Pal, Arijit', 'Sarkar, Kathakali', 'Bagh, Sangram']","['Mukhopadhyay S', 'Saha R', 'Palanisamy A', 'Ghosh M', 'Biswas A', 'Roy S', 'Pal A', 'Sarkar K', 'Bagh S']","['Biophysics and Structural Genomics Division, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Kolkata, 700064, India.', 'Biophysics and Structural Genomics Division, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Kolkata, 700064, India.', 'Biophysics and Structural Genomics Division, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Kolkata, 700064, India.', 'Biophysics and Structural Genomics Division, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Kolkata, 700064, India.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Presidency University, Kolkata, 700073, India.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Presidency University, Kolkata, 700073, India.', 'Biophysics and Structural Genomics Division, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Kolkata, 700064, India.', 'Biophysics and Structural Genomics Division, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Kolkata, 700064, India.', 'Biophysics and Structural Genomics Division, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Kolkata, 700064, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Asthma/genetics', 'Autoimmunity', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Diabetes Mellitus/genetics', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/genetics', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systems Biology/*methods', '*Weightlessness']",2016/05/18 06:00,2018/03/28 06:00,['2016/05/18 06:00'],"['2015/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/28 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 May 17;6:25975. doi: 10.1038/srep25975.,10.1038/srep25975 [doi],20160517,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",PMC4868995,,,,"['srep25975 [pii]', '10.1038/srep25975 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The secondary objective was to identify determinants linked with employment stability after childhood leukemia. METHODS: All survivors aged 15 and over enrolled in the French LEA Cohort (Childhood and Adolescent Leukemia) were included. Occupational data were self-reported. The occupational distributions expected in the cohort for each age range were established based on the distribution in France as reference, and comparisons between observed and expected distributions were performed. Logistic regression model was used to explore determinants of stability of survivors' employment. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 845 eligible survivors (response rate 87.8 %), with a mean age of 22.3 +/- 5.4 years and a mean follow-up duration of 14.3 +/- 6.3 years. Among the 361 survivors currently in the labor market, 36 (10.0 %) were seeking a job, which is significantly lower than expected (19.3 %) compared to French population. Conversely, among those currently employed, the number of survivors in unstable employment (43.9 %) was significantly higher than expected (33.5 %). Younger age and higher number of late effects were risk factors for unstable employment. CONCLUSIONS: While the employment rate of the young French adult population of childhood leukemia survivors seems rather positive, access to a steady job appears to be compromised for some survivors. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: A strategy to better identify particular subgroups of survivors at greatest risk for difficulties in their professional achievement will help ensure the development of specific intervention strategies and support procedures.","['Berbis, Julie', 'Reggio, Celine', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Chastagner, Pascal', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Kanold, Justyna', 'Sirvent, Nicolas', 'Plantaz, Dominique', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Tabone, Marie-Dominique', 'Garnier, Floriane', 'Lehucher-Michel, Marie-Pascale', 'Auquier, Pascal']","['Berbis J', 'Reggio C', 'Michel G', 'Chastagner P', 'Bertrand Y', 'Kanold J', 'Sirvent N', 'Plantaz D', 'Baruchel A', 'Tabone MD', 'Garnier F', 'Lehucher-Michel MP', 'Auquier P']","['EA 3279 - Public Health, Chronic Diseases and Quality of Life - Research Unit, Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, 13284, France.

Diagnosis is based on the presence of persistent (>3 months) peripheral blood monocytosis (>1 x 10(9) /L), along with bone marrow dysplasia. Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities occur in approximately 20-30% of patients, while >90% have gene mutations. Mutations involving TET2 ( approximately 60%), SRSF2 ( approximately 50%), ASXL1 ( approximately 40%), and RAS ( approximately 30%) are frequent; with only ASXL1 mutations negatively impacting overall survival. Two molecularly integrated, CMML-specific prognostic models include; the Groupe Francais des Myelodysplasies (GFM) and the Molecular Mayo Model (MMM). The GFM model segregates patients into 3 groups based on: age >65 years, WBC >15 x 10(9) /L, anemia, platelets <100 x 10(9) /L, and ASXL1 mutation status, with respective median survivals of 56 (low), 27.4 (intermediate), and 9.2 (high) months. The MMM is based on ASXL1 mutational status, absolute monocyte count >10 x 10(9) /L, hemoglobin <10 g/dL, platelets <100 x 109/L and circulating immature myeloid cells. This model stratifies patients into four groups; high (>/=3 risk factors), intermediate-2 (2 risk factors), intermediate-1 (1 risk factor) and low (no risk factors), with median survivals of 16, 31, 59, and 97 months, respectively. Hypomethylating agents such as 5-azacitidine and decitabine are commonly used, with overall response rates of approximately 30-40% and complete remission rates of approximately 7-17%.

These studies may not have reflected the actual number of newly diagnosed cases (incidence) strictly, or the true LL/L subtype frequencies. We searched all cases of newly diagnosed LL/L in Miyagi Prefecture over a 5-year period, including those that were discovered as LL/L sorely after autopsy. We registered the actual number of 2098 cases in the prefecture and calculated an accurate incidence rate (17.8 per 100,000 persons). Additionally, we identified more realistic and detailed frequencies of LL/L subtypes including the leukemic phase of some lymphomas. As Miyagi Prefecture is an area in which the population dynamics are relatively stable and representative of Japan, the result of our epidemiological study can be used as the first representative index of LL/L for Japan.","['Katsushima, Hiroki', 'Fukuhara, Noriko', 'Ichikawa, Satoshi', 'Ota, Yasunori', 'Takeuchi, Kengo', 'Ishizawa, Kenichi', 'Sasano, Hironobu', 'Harigae, Hideo', 'Ichinohasama, Ryo']","['Katsushima H', 'Fukuhara N', 'Ichikawa S', 'Ota Y', 'Takeuchi K', 'Ishizawa K', 'Sasano H', 'Harigae H', 'Ichinohasama R']","['a Division of Hematopathology , Tohoku University Hospital , Sendai , Japan.', 'b Department of Anatomic Pathology , Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine , Sendai , Japan.', 'c Department of Hematology and Rheumatology , Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine , Sendai , Japan.', 'c Department of Hematology and Rheumatology , Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine , Sendai , Japan.', 'd Department of Pathology , Research Hospital, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo , Tokyo , Japan.', 'e Division of Pathology , Cancer Institute Hospital, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research , Tokyo , Japan.', 'f Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy , Yamagata University Faculty of Medicine , Yamagata , Japan.', 'b Department of Anatomic Pathology , Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine , Sendai , Japan.', 'c Department of Hematology and Rheumatology , Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine , Sendai , Japan.', 'a Division of Hematopathology , Tohoku University Hospital , Sendai , Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Registries']",2016/05/18 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2016/05/18 06:00'],"['2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2017 Jan;58(1):80-88. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2016.1183254.

Here, we present the development and characterization of two gold nanobeacons combined with Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) based spectral codification for dual mode sequence discrimination. This is the combination of two powerful technologies onto a single nanosystem. RESULTS: We proved this concept to detect the most common fusion sequences associated with the development of chronic myeloid leukemia, e13a2 and e14a2. The detection is based on spectral shift of the donor signal to the acceptor, which allows for corroboration of the hybridization event. The Au-nanobeacon acts as scaffold for detection of the target in a homogenous format whose output capability (i.e. additional layer of information) is potentiated via the spectral codification strategy. CONCLUSIONS: The spectral coded Au-nanobeacons permit the detection of each of the pathogenic fusion sequences, with high specificity towards partial complementary sequences. The proposed BioCode Au-nanobeacon concept provides for a nanoplatform for molecular recognition suitable for cancer diagnostics.","['Cordeiro, M', 'Giestas, L', 'Lima, J C', 'Baptista, P M V']","['Cordeiro M', 'Giestas L', 'Lima JC', 'Baptista PM']","['LAQV, REQUIMTE, Departamento de Quimica, Faculdade de Ciencias e Tecnologia, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Campus de Caparica, 2829-516, Caparica, Portugal.', 'CIGMH, UCIBIO, Departamento de Ciencias da Vida, Faculdade de Ciencias e Tecnologia, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Campus de Caparica, 2829-516, Caparica, Portugal.', 'LAQV, REQUIMTE, Departamento de Quimica, Faculdade de Ciencias e Tecnologia, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Campus de Caparica, 2829-516, Caparica, Portugal.', 'CIGMH, UCIBIO, Departamento de Ciencias da Vida, Faculdade de Ciencias e Tecnologia, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Campus de Caparica, 2829-516, Caparica, Portugal.', 'LAQV, REQUIMTE, Departamento de Quimica, Faculdade de Ciencias e Tecnologia, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Campus de Caparica, 2829-516, Caparica, Portugal.', 'CIGMH, UCIBIO, Departamento de Ciencias da Vida, Faculdade de Ciencias e Tecnologia, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Campus de Caparica, 2829-516, Caparica, Portugal. pmvb@fct.unl.pt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Nanobiotechnology,Journal of nanobiotechnology,101152208,IM,"['Biosensing Techniques/methods', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer/*methods', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gold/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Metal Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/methods']",2016/05/18 06:00,2017/02/12 06:00,['2016/05/18 06:00'],"['2016/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/12 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,J Nanobiotechnology. 2016 May 17;14(1):38. doi: 10.1186/s12951-016-0192-y.,10.1186/s12951-016-0192-y [doi],20160517,"['7440-57-5 (Gold)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",PMC4869199,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL fusion', 'Biosensor', 'FRET', 'Gold nanoparticles', 'Hybridization', 'Leukemia']",,"['10.1186/s12951-016-0192-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12951-016-0192-y [pii]']",,,,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5255-7095'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nowadays, with the rapid response to chemotherapy and the diffuse nature of BL, there is no established role for radiation therapy (RT) even in localized disease. Regarding the relapsed/refractory BL, the treatment recommendations remain undefined. We present a 56-year-old woman, diagnosed with BL refractory to 6 cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone), who had disease progression on R-DHAP (rituximab, dexamethasone, high dose cytarabine and cisplatin) with intrathecal methotrexate, then a partial response on RICE (rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide). Patient received high dose chemotherapy and autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Then, she was treated with hyperfractionated involved-field RT regimen. Currently, the patient remains disease free for around 2 years after remission. We acknowledge that RT is not a standard treatment of BL, especially in patients who attain complete response (CR) after first-line multi-agent chemotherapy or even in those who have a CR after second-line chemotherapy pre-transplant. Yet, the use of a superfractionated regimen of consolidative radiation could be justified in the treatment of recurrent/refractory localized BL who do not achieve a CR even with second-line salvage chemotherapy. Radiation therapy in this context, given that it is a well-tolerated treatment, is a modality worthy of being re-considered in relapsed/refractory BL.

These studies have been conducted in European and Thai populations, and it is unclear whether these observations generalize to other populations with a lower incidence of pediatric ALL. In order to explore the impact of these variants on pediatric ALL risk in the Tunisian population, we genotyped 58 cases of pediatric ALL and 150 controls for SNPs rs4132601 (7p12.2), rs7089424 (10q21.2), rs3731217 (9p21.3), and rs2239633 (14q11.2). Our results, which are consistent with findings in European populations, show that 3 SNPs, i.e., rs4132601 (P = .00116, odds ratio [OR] = 2.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.42, 5.87]), rs7089424 (P = .0022, OR = 0.49, 95% CI = [0.31, 0.79]), and rs2239633 (P = .0010, OR = 0.47, 95% CI = [0.29, 0.75]) are significantly associated with a higher risk of developing pediatric ALL (P < .05). Furthermore, we show differences in allele frequencies in SNPs between Tunisian and Caucasian and/or Thai populations (e.g., CEBPE, rs2239633; population attributable risk [PAR] approximately 15-fold the PAR of Thai population). These differences, combined with differences in linkage disequilibrium structure between populations and differences in size between populations, may contribute to racial differences in pediatric ALL incidence.","['Gharbi, Hanene', 'Ben Hassine, Islem', 'Soltani, Ismail', 'Safra, Ines', 'Ouerhani, Slah', 'Bel Haj Othmen, Hind', 'Teber, Mouheb', 'Farah, Ahlem', 'Amouri, Hassiba', 'Toumi, Nourel Houda', 'Abdennebi, Salima', 'Abbes, Salem', 'Menif, Samia']","['Gharbi H', 'Ben Hassine I', 'Soltani I', 'Safra I', 'Ouerhani S', 'Bel Haj Othmen H', 'Teber M', 'Farah A', 'Amouri H', 'Toumi NH', 'Abdennebi S', 'Abbes S', 'Menif S']","['a Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology , Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisia.', 'a Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology , Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisia.', 'a Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology , Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisia.', 'a Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology , Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisia.', 'a Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology , Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisia.', 'a Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology , Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisia.', 'a Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology , Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisia.', 'a Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology , Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisia.', 'a Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology , Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisia.', 'b Laboratory of Hematology Bechir Hamza Hospital , Tunis , Tunisia.', 'c Hematology Service Hospital Aziza Othmana , Tunis , Tunisia.', 'a Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology , Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisia.', 'a Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology , Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,IM,"['Adolescent', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/ethnology/etiology/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2016/05/18 06:00,2017/04/08 06:00,['2016/05/18 06:00'],"['2016/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2016 Apr;33(3):157-67. doi: 10.3109/08880018.2016.1161685.,10.3109/08880018.2016.1161685 [doi],,"['0 (ARID5B protein, human)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CDKN2A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '142805-41-2 (CEBPE protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'ARID5B', 'CDKN2A', 'CEBPE', 'IKZF1', 'racial differences']",,['10.3109/08880018.2016.1161685 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the establishment of appropriate xenograft models is increasing worldwide we aim to share our experiences to contribute toward minimizing loss of mice and following the ""right"" approach. Here, modified HSCs were intrafemorally transplanted into NSG and/or NSGS mice: (1) RPS14-haploinsufficiency, (2) TP53-deficiency, (3) TP53 hotspot mutations (R248W, R175H, R273H, R249S). Engraftment was achieved and cytogenetic analyses showed human cells with normal karyotypes. However, in all experiments with NSG mice, mainly control cells or GFP-negative cells were engrafted, not allowing observation of modified HSCs. In NSGS mice, engraftment rate was higher, but mice developed graft-versus-host disease. In summary, engraftment of HSCs is promising and could be used to analyze the induction of CIN. However, the analysis of modified HSCs is limited and further experiments are required to improve this model.","['Salari, Azam', 'Thomay, Kathrin', 'Himmler, Kirsten', 'Vajen, Beate', 'Schienke, Andrea', 'Hagedorn, Maike', 'Ebersold, Juliane', 'Kreipe, Hans-Heinrich', 'Kruger, Andreas', 'Schambach, Axel', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Gohring, Gudrun']","['Salari A', 'Thomay K', 'Himmler K', 'Vajen B', 'Schienke A', 'Hagedorn M', 'Ebersold J', 'Kreipe HH', 'Kruger A', 'Schambach A', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Gohring G']","['Institute of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine.

Administrative claims data provide an opportunity to examine service utilization and costs, particularly from the payer's perspective. However, because administrative claims data are primarily designed for reimbursement purposes, challenges arise when using it for research. We use a case study with data derived from the 2007 to 2011 Truven Health MarketScan Research database to discuss opportunities and challenges for the use of administrative claims data to examine the costs and service utilization of allogeneic HCT and chemotherapy alone for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Starting with a cohort of 29,915 potentially eligible patients with a diagnosis of AML, we were able to identify 211 patients treated with HCT and 774 treated with chemotherapy alone where we were sufficiently confident of the diagnosis and treatment path to allow analysis. Administrative claims data provide an avenue to meet the need for health care costs, resource utilization, and outcome information. However, when using these data, a balance between clinical knowledge and applied methods is critical to identifying a valid study cohort and accurate measures of costs and resource utilization.","['Preussler, Jaime M', 'Mau, Lih-Wen', 'Majhail, Navneet S', 'Meyer, Christa L', 'Denzen, Ellen M', 'Edsall, Kristen C', 'Farnia, Stephanie H', 'Silver, Alicia', 'Saber, Wael', 'Burns, Linda J', 'Vanness, David J']","['Preussler JM', 'Mau LW', 'Majhail NS', 'Meyer CL', 'Denzen EM', 'Edsall KC', 'Farnia SH', 'Silver A', 'Saber W', 'Burns LJ', 'Vanness DJ']","['National Marrow Donor Program/Be The Match, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'National Marrow Donor Program/Be The Match, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Treatment options in this population remain limited, with concern for both increased toxicity and further relapse. We treated 18 patients with acute leukemia for marrow +/- extramedullary relapse after a previous alloHSCT with a myeloablative cytoreductive regimen including clofarabine, melphalan, and thiotepa followed by a second or third transplantation from the same or a different donor. All patients were in remission at the time of the second or third transplantation. All evaluable patients engrafted. The most common toxicity was reversible transaminitis associated with clofarabine. Two patients died from transplantation-related causes. Seven patients relapsed after their second or third transplanation and died of disease. Nine of 18 patients are alive and disease free, with a 3-year 49% probability of overall survival (OS). Patients whose remission duration after initial alloHSCT was >6 months achieved superior outcomes (3-year OS, 74%, 95% confidence interval, 53% to 100%), compared with those relapsing within 6 months (0%) (P < .001). This new cytoreductive regimen has yielded promising results with acceptable toxicity for second or third transplantations in patients with high-risk acute leukemia who relapsed after a prior transplantation, using various graft and donor options. This approach merits further evaluation in collaborative group studies.","['Spitzer, Barbara', 'Perales, Miguel-Angel', 'Kernan, Nancy A', 'Prockop, Susan E', 'Zabor, Emily C', 'Webb, Nicholas', 'Castro-Malaspina, Hugo', 'Papadopoulos, Esperanza B', 'Young, James W', 'Scaradavou, Andromachi', 'Kobos, Rachel', 'Giralt, Sergio A', ""O'Reilly, Richard J"", 'Boulad, Farid']","['Spitzer B', 'Perales MA', 'Kernan NA', 'Prockop SE', 'Zabor EC', 'Webb N', 'Castro-Malaspina H', 'Papadopoulos EB', 'Young JW', 'Scaradavou A', 'Kobos R', 'Giralt SA', ""O'Reilly RJ"", 'Boulad F']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.

To optimize counseling regarding future ovarian function in survivors of adolescent cancer, we describe anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels in female adolescents at diagnosis, during, and shortly after completion of chemotherapy. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTIONS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: This was a prospective single-institution study. Participants were a mixed population of newly diagnosed postmenarchal female adolescents with malignancy. AMH was performed at diagnosis (T1), 6 months from diagnosis (T2), at end of therapy or 12 months [T3, whichever came first], 1 year after the end of therapy or 24 months from diagnosis [T4, whichever came first], and 18 months from the time of diagnosis (T5). All patients had baseline pelvic ultrasound examinations. Presence of menses and hot flashes were recorded at each time point. RESULTS: Sixteen participants with a median age at diagnosis of 14.3 years (range 12-17 years) were followed for 18.2 months (range, 14-24 months). Oncology diagnoses included leukemia, lymphoma, and sarcoma. Ten patients (62.5%) received alkylating agents with a median cumulative dose of 3041 mg/m(2) (range, 2639-6478 mg/m(2)) of cyclophosphamide. Almost half (n = 7; 44%) experienced amenorrhea during treatment with resumption of menses in 6 of 7 patients (85%). Fifteen of 16 (94%) participants showed a decline in mean AMH levels by 6 months (T2) from diagnosis (15.8 IU/mL at T1 vs 6.5 IU/mL at T2; P = .003) and 12 of 15 (80%) showed at least some recovery of AMH (mean AMH at T4 = 13.2 IU/mL compared with 6.5 IU/mL at T2; P = .02). There was no difference in the mean decline nor recovery of AMH in those who did, vs did not receive cyclophosphamide. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the largest series to date in adolescents showing that AMH is uniformly suppressed during cancer therapy and short-term recovery occurs in just more than half of the patients by 18-24 months. The contribution of short-term AMH measurements in predicting long-term ovarian function remains to be defined. Long-term follow-up with serial AMH levels is required to help predict those at risk for premature ovarian insufficiency.","['Gupta, Abha A', 'Lee Chong, Amy', 'Deveault, Catherine', 'Traubici, Jeffrey', 'Maloney, Anne Marie', 'Knight, Samantha', 'Lorenzo, Armando', 'Allen, Lisa']","['Gupta AA', 'Lee Chong A', 'Deveault C', 'Traubici J', 'Maloney AM', 'Knight S', 'Lorenzo A', 'Allen L']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

The clinical significance of the 2 morphological patterns is unclear, and their biological features have not been compared. We retrospectively reviewed 77 cases: 26 of type I and 51 of type II CHL-RT; 3 cases progressed from type I to type II. We examined clinical features, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status, and clonal relatedness after microdissection. Median age for type I was 62 years versus 73 years for type II (P=.01); 27% (type I) versus 73% (type II) had a history of CLL. HRS cells were positive for EBV in 71% (55/77), similar in types I and II. Clonality analysis was performed in 33 cases (type I and type II combined): HRS cells were clonally related to the underlying CLL in 14 and unrelated in 19. ZAP-70 expression of the CLL cells but not EBV status or morphological pattern was correlated with clonal relatedness: all 14 clonally related cases were ZAP-70 negative, whereas 74% (14/19) of clonally unrelated cases were ZAP-70 positive. Overall median survival (types I and II) after diagnosis was 44 months. Advanced age was an adverse risk factor for survival, but not histologic pattern, type I versus type II. HRS-like cells in a background of CLL carries a similar clinical risk to that of CHL-RT and may progress to classic Hodgkin lymphoma in some cases.","['Xiao, Wenbin', 'Chen, Wayne W', 'Sorbara, Lynn', 'Davies-Hill, Theresa', 'Pittaluga, Stefania', 'Raffeld, Mark', 'Jaffe, Elaine S']","['Xiao W', 'Chen WW', 'Sorbara L', 'Davies-Hill T', 'Pittaluga S', 'Raffeld M', 'Jaffe ES']","['Hematopathology Section, Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Hematopathology Section, Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Molecular Diagnostic Unit, Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Hematopathology Section, Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Hematopathology Section, Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Molecular Diagnostic Unit, Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Hematopathology Section, Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', '*Clone Cells/pathology/virology', 'Databases, Factual', 'Disease Progression', '*Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/genetics/mortality/pathology/virology', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/*isolation & purification', '*Hodgkin Disease/genetics/mortality/pathology/virology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/mortality/pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', '*Reed-Sternberg Cells/pathology/virology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2016/05/18 06:00,2017/08/23 06:00,['2016/05/18 06:00'],"['2016/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/23 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2016 Sep;55:108-116. doi: 10.1016/j.humpath.2016.04.019.

Cetuximab, an anti-EGFR, is administered together with chemotherapy to patients with various types of cancer. This studies aim was to investigate the effect of cetuximab on testicular function. Adult male mice were injected with cetuximab (10 mg/kg), cisplatin (8 mg/kg) or a combination of both, and killed one week or one month later. The doses were chosen by human equivalent dose calculation. Testicular function was evaluated by epididymal-spermatozoa total motile count and sperm motility, weights of testes and epididymides, and the level of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) in the serum. Immunohistochemistry was performed to examine germ cell proliferation (Ki-67), apoptosis (Terminal transferase-mediated deoxyuridine 5-triphosphate nick-end labelling), reserve (DAZL-Deleted in azoospermia-like, Promyelocytic leukaemia zinc-finger), blood vessels (CD34) and Sertoli cells (GATA-4). Administration of cetuximab alone increased testicular apoptosis and decreased epididymal-spermatozoa total motile count over time. When added to cisplatin, cetuximab exacerbated most of the recorded testicular parameters, compared with the effect of cisplatin alone, including testis and epididymis weights, epididymal-spermatozoa total motile count, AMH concentration, meiosis and apoptosis. In conclusion, cetuximab has only a mild effect on testicular reserve, but when added to cisplatin, it exacerbates cisplatin-induced testicular toxicity.","['Levi, Mattan', 'Popovtzer, Aron', 'Tzabari, Moran', 'Mizrachi, Aviram', 'Savion, Naphtali', 'Stemmer, Salomon M', 'Shalgi, Ruth', 'Ben-Aharon, Irit']","['Levi M', 'Popovtzer A', 'Tzabari M', 'Mizrachi A', 'Savion N', 'Stemmer SM', 'Shalgi R', 'Ben-Aharon I']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', 'Institute of Oncology, Davidoff Center, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Campus, Petah-Tiqva, and Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', 'Institute of Oncology, Davidoff Center, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Campus, Petah-Tiqva, and Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.', 'The Goldschleger Eye Research Institute, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, 52621, Israel; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Oncology, Davidoff Center, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Campus, Petah-Tiqva, and Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', 'Institute of Oncology, Davidoff Center, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Campus, Petah-Tiqva, and Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.

However, it is now well documented that even genetically wild-type tumor suppressors can be involved in tumorigenesis, when functionally inactivated. In particular, tumor suppressors' functions can be impaired by subtle variations of protein levels, changes in cellular compartmentalization and post-transcriptional/post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination and sumoylation. Notably, tumor suppressors inactivation offers challenging therapeutic opportunities. The reactivation of an inactive and genetically wild-type tumor suppressor could indeed promote selective apoptosis of cancer cells without affecting normal cells. MAIN BODY: Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) could be considered as the paradigm for non-genomic loss of function of tumor suppressors due to the ability of BCR-ABL to directly promote functionally inactivation of several tumor suppressors. SHORT CONCLUSION: In this review we will describe new insights on the role of FoxO, PP2A, p27, BLK, PTEN and other tumor suppressors in CML pathogenesis. Finally, we will describe strategies to promote tumor suppressors reactivation in CML.","['Crivellaro, Sabrina', 'Carra, Giovanna', 'Panuzzo, Cristina', 'Taulli, Riccardo', 'Guerrasio, Angelo', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Morotti, Alessandro']","['Crivellaro S', 'Carra G', 'Panuzzo C', 'Taulli R', 'Guerrasio A', 'Saglio G', 'Morotti A']","['Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, San Luigi Hospital, Regione Gonzole 10, 10043, Orbassano, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, San Luigi Hospital, Regione Gonzole 10, 10043, Orbassano, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, San Luigi Hospital, Regione Gonzole 10, 10043, Orbassano, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Turin, Orbassano, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, San Luigi Hospital, Regione Gonzole 10, 10043, Orbassano, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, San Luigi Hospital, Regione Gonzole 10, 10043, Orbassano, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, San Luigi Hospital, Regione Gonzole 10, 10043, Orbassano, Italy. alessandro.morotti@unito.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",2016/05/18 06:00,2017/10/03 06:00,['2016/05/18 06:00'],"['2015/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/03 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2016 May 16;16:314. doi: 10.1186/s12885-016-2346-6.,10.1186/s12885-016-2346-6 [doi],20160516,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)'],PMC4869339,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Non genomic loss of function', '*Tumor suppressor', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,"['10.1186/s12885-016-2346-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-016-2346-6 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How oncogenic U2AF35 mutants promote transformation remains to be determined. Here we derive cell lines transformed by the oncogenic U2AF35(S34F) mutant and identify aberrantly processed pre-mRNAs by deep sequencing. We find that in U2AF35(S34F)-transformed cells the autophagy-related factor 7 (Atg7) pre-mRNA is abnormally processed, which unexpectedly is not due to altered splicing but rather selection of a distal cleavage and polyadenylation (CP) site. This longer Atg7 mRNA is translated inefficiently, leading to decreased ATG7 levels and an autophagy defect that predisposes cells to secondary mutations, resulting in transformation. MDS and acute myeloid leukemia patient samples harboring U2AF35(S34F) have a similar increased use of the ATG7 distal CP site, and previous studies have shown that mice with hematopoietic cells lacking Atg7 develop an MDS-like syndrome. Collectively, our results reveal a basis for U2AF35(S34F) oncogenic activity.","['Park, Sung Mi', 'Ou, Jianhong', 'Chamberlain, Lynn', 'Simone, Tessa M', 'Yang, Huan', 'Virbasius, Ching-Man', 'Ali, Abdullah M', 'Zhu, Lihua Julie', 'Mukherjee, Siddhartha', 'Raza, Azra', 'Green, Michael R']","['Park SM', 'Ou J', 'Chamberlain L', 'Simone TM', 'Yang H', 'Virbasius CM', 'Ali AM', 'Zhu LJ', 'Mukherjee S', 'Raza A', 'Green MR']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD 20815-6789, USA; Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD 20815-6789, USA; Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD 20815-6789, USA; Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD 20815-6789, USA; Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD 20815-6789, USA; Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10032, USA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA; Programs in Molecular Medicine and Bioinformatics and Integrative Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10032, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10032, USA.

Its association with chronic lymphocytic leukemia is rarely described in the literature, and it may be difficult to diagnose and to treat this association. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 73-year-old Caucasian patient, a rare case in which Wegener's granulomatosis is associated in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, who is admitted in the Infectious Disease Department for fever, diplopia, headache, purulent and hemorrhagic nasal secretions, intense asthenia, and weight loss. The patient had associated eyelid edema; scleritis; chemosis; subconjunctival hemorrhage at the left eye; swelling of the left region of the eyehole, of the base of the nasal pyramid, and of the left zygomatic region; anterior nasal bleeding; pustulous non-itching lesions at the cervical region and posterior thorax; enlarged bilateral axillary lymph nodes; hepatomegaly; and moderate splenomegaly. During the surgical treatment of the pansinusitis, a biopsy from the tissue is taken; the biopsy fragments of the nasal mucosa pleads for Wegener's granulomatosis. The c-ANCA were positive. The patient's evolution was favorable under treatment with meropenem, teicoplanin, fluconazole, transfusions of platelet concentrates, and methylprednisolone. CONCLUSIONS: The real dimension of the association between chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Wegener's granulomatosis is not known; it may be useful to evaluate the vasculitis by testing ANCA routinely in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and by histopathological examinations of the lesions.","['Birlutiu, Victoria', 'Rezi, Elena Cristina', 'Birlutiu, Rares Mircea', 'Zaharie, Ioan Sorin']","['Birlutiu V', 'Rezi EC', 'Birlutiu RM', 'Zaharie IS']","['Faculty of Medicine, Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu, Infectious Diseases Clinic - Academic Emergency Hospital Sibiu, Str.

There is no consensus on the treatment of patients with refractory or relapsed mantle cell lymphoma, or for patients with relapsed or possibly refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Ibrutinib inhibits an enzyme involved in regulating B lymphocyte activity. It has been authorised in the European Union for these conditions. Clinical evaluation of ibrutinib in mantle cell lymphoma is based on a single non-comparative trial in 111 patients, in which the median overall survival time was 22.5 months. Clinical evaluation of ibrutinib in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is based on two randomised trials. One unblinded trial compared ibrutinib versus ofatumumab and involved 391 patients, most of whom were sufficiently fit to receive anticancer combination therapy. Ibrutinib was more effective than ofatumumab, but the choice of this comparator might not have been appropriate for most of the patients who received it. The other double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 578 patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Ibrutinib was added to the bendamustine + rituximab combination. No significant difference in mortality was observed between the two groups. The main adverse effects of ibrutinib were: gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhoea; life-threatening infections and bleeding disorders; and cardiac disorders, including atrial fibrillation.

In contrast, current paradigms suggest that such approaches will be ineffective in cancers with few nonsynonymous mutations. To examine this issue, we made use of a murine model of BCR-ABL(+) B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Using a principal component analysis, we found that robust MHC class II expression, coupled with appropriate costimulation, correlated with lower leukemic burden. We next assessed whether checkpoint blockade or therapeutic vaccination could improve survival in mice with pre-established leukemia. Consistent with the low mutation load in our leukemia model, we found that checkpoint blockade alone had only modest effects on survival. In contrast, robust heterologous vaccination with a peptide derived from the BCR-ABL fusion (BAp), a key driver mutation, generated a small population of mice that survived long-term. Checkpoint blockade strongly synergized with heterologous vaccination to enhance overall survival in mice with leukemia. Enhanced survival did not correlate with numbers of BAp:I-A(b)-specific T cells, but rather with increased expression of IL-10, IL-17, and granzyme B and decreased expression of programmed death 1 on these cells. Our findings demonstrate that vaccination to key driver mutations cooperates with checkpoint blockade and allows for immune control of cancers with low nonsynonymous mutation loads.","['Manlove, Luke S', 'Schenkel, Jason M', 'Manlove, Kezia R', 'Pauken, Kristen E', 'Williams, Richard T', 'Vezys, Vaiva', 'Farrar, Michael A']","['Manlove LS', 'Schenkel JM', 'Manlove KR', 'Pauken KE', 'Williams RT', 'Vezys V', 'Farrar MA']","['Center for Immunology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455; Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455;', 'Center for Immunology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455;', 'Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802;', 'Center for Immunology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455; Department of Microbiology, Institute of Immunology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104;', 'Medical Sciences, Amgen, Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA 91320; and.', 'Center for Immunology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455;', 'Center for Immunology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455; Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455; Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 farra005@umn.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/*pathology', '*Vaccination']",2016/05/18 06:00,2017/09/29 06:00,['2016/05/17 06:00'],"['2016/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2016 Jun 1;196(11):4793-804. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1600130.

During thymic development, iNKT cells also differentiate into NKT1, NKT2, and NKT17 functional subsets that preferentially produce cytokines IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-17, respectively, upon activation. Newly selected iNKT cells undergo a burst of proliferation, which is defective in mice with a specific deletion of NKAP in the iNKT cell lineage, leading to severe reductions in thymic and peripheral iNKT cell numbers. The decreased cell number is not due to defective homeostasis or increased apoptosis, and it is not rescued by Bcl-xL overexpression. NKAP is also required for differentiation into NKT17 cells, but NKT1 and NKT2 cell development and function are unaffected. This failure in NKT17 development is rescued by transgenic expression of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger; however, the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger transgene does not restore iNKT cell numbers or the block in positive selection into the iNKT cell lineage in CD4-cre NKAP conditional knockout mice. Therefore, NKAP regulates multiple steps in iNKT cell development and differentiation.","['Thapa, Puspa', 'Chen, Meibo W', 'McWilliams, Douglas C', 'Belmonte, Paul', 'Constans, Megan', ""Sant'Angelo, Derek B"", 'Shapiro, Virginia Smith']","['Thapa P', 'Chen MW', 'McWilliams DC', 'Belmonte P', 'Constans M', ""Sant'Angelo DB"", 'Shapiro VS']","['Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905; and.', 'Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905; and.', 'Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905; and.', 'Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905; and.', 'Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905; and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08901.', 'Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905; and Shapiro.virginia1@mayo.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/immunology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Interleukin-17/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Interleukin-4/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/cytology/immunology/*physiology', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 3/*genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics']",2016/05/18 06:00,2017/08/02 06:00,['2016/05/17 06:00'],"['2015/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2016 Jun 15;196(12):4987-98. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1501653.

Cardiotoxicity has become a significant problem, and the risks of adverse cardiac events induced by systemic drugs need to be seriously considered. Potential cardiovascular toxicities linked to anticancer agents include arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia and infarction, hypertension, thromboembolism, left ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure. It has been shown that several anticancer drugs seriously affect the cardiovascular system, such as ErbB2 inhibitors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, multitargeted kinase inhibitors, Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog inhibitors, and others. Each of these agents has a different mechanism through which it affects the cardiovascular system. ErbB2 inhibitors block the ErbB4/ErbB2 heterodimerization pathway triggered by Neuregulin-1, which is essential for cardiomyocyte survival. VEGF signaling is crucial for vascular growth, but it also has a major impact on myocardial function, and the VEGF pathway is also essential for maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis. Drugs that inhibit the VEGF signaling pathway lead to a net reduction in capillary density and loss of contractile function. Here, we review the mechanisms and pathophysiology of the most significant cardiotoxic effects of ErbB2 inhibitors and antiangiogenic drugs. Moreover, we highlight the role of cardioncology in recognizing these toxicities, developing strategies to prevent or minimize cardiovascular toxicity, and reducing long-term cardiotoxic effects.","['Maurea, Nicola', 'Coppola, Carmela', 'Piscopo, Giovanna', 'Galletta, Francesca', 'Riccio, Gennaro', 'Esposito, Emanuela', 'De Lorenzo, Claudia', 'De Laurentiis, Michelino', 'Spallarossa, Paolo', 'Mercuro, Giuseppe']","['Maurea N', 'Coppola C', 'Piscopo G', 'Galletta F', 'Riccio G', 'Esposito E', 'De Lorenzo C', 'De Laurentiis M', 'Spallarossa P', 'Mercuro G']","[""aDivision of Cardiology, Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumor 'Fondazione Giovanni Pascale' - IRCCS bCEINGE Biotecnologie Avanzate S.C.A.R.L cDepartment of Breast Surgery and Cancer Prevention, Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori 'Fondazione Giovanni Pascale' - IRCCS dDepartment of Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnology, University 'Federico II' eDepartment of Senology, Division of Breast Oncology Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori 'Fondazione Giovanni Pascale' - IRCCS, Naples fClinic of Cardiovascular Diseases, IRCCS San Martino IST, Genoa gDepartment of Medical Sciences 'Mario Aresu', University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown),"Journal of cardiovascular medicine (Hagerstown, Md.)",101259752,IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects', 'Cardiotoxicity/physiopathology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/*chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Heart/drug effects/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/adverse effects', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors/adverse effects']",2016/05/18 06:00,2016/05/18 06:01,['2016/05/17 06:00'],"['2016/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/18 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown). 2016 May;17 Suppl 1:S19-26. doi: 10.2459/JCM.0000000000000377.,10.2459/JCM.0000000000000377 [doi],,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",,,,,"['10.2459/JCM.0000000000000377 [doi]', '01244665-201605001-00004 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the adoption of new approaches by clinical laboratories requires careful evaluation of all potential sources of error and the development of strategies to ensure the highest accuracy. Timely and efficient clinical use of HTS platforms will depend on combining multiple samples (multiplexing) in each sequencing run. Here we examine the Ig heavy-chain gene HTS on the Illumina MiSeq platform for MRD. We identify errors associated with multiplexing that could potentially impact the accuracy of MRD analysis. We optimize a strategy that combines high-purity, sequence-optimized oligonucleotides, dual indexing, and an error-aware demultiplexing approach to minimize errors and maximize sensitivity. We present a probability-based, demultiplexing pipeline Error-Aware Demultiplexer that is suitable for all MiSeq strategies and accurately assigns samples to the correct identifier without excessive loss of data. Finally, using controls quantified by digital PCR, we show that HTS-MRD can accurately detect as few as 1 in 10(6) copies of specific leukemic MRD.","['Bartram, Jack', 'Mountjoy, Edward', 'Brooks, Tony', 'Hancock, Jeremy', 'Williamson, Helen', 'Wright, Gary', 'Moppett, John', 'Goulden, Nick', 'Hubank, Mike']","['Bartram J', 'Mountjoy E', 'Brooks T', 'Hancock J', 'Williamson H', 'Wright G', 'Moppett J', 'Goulden N', 'Hubank M']","['Genetics and Genomic Medicine Program, Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom; Department of Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, United Kingdom.', 'School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'UCL Genomics Centre, Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Bristol Genetics Laboratory, Southmead Hospital, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'Bristol Genetics Laboratory, Southmead Hospital, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, Royal Hospital for Children, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, United Kingdom.', 'Genetics and Genomic Medicine Program, Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom; UCL Genomics Centre, Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom.

Herein, we present the case of a 25-year-old male diagnosed with B-ALL whose initial karyotype showed a t(17;19)(q22p13.3). FISH confirmed TCF3 involvement and also revealed a 5' IGH deletion. After treatment, the patient relapsed, at which point conventional cytogenetic studies showed a t(17;19), loss of the 5' IGH region, and a t(3;10) not seen in initial studies. After hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the patient relapsed again, at which point conventional cytogenetic studies showed a complex karyotype with t(17;19), t(1;9)(p13;p13), and structural anomalies involving chromosomes 5, 7, and 14, but no IGH abnormalities by FISH. The t(1;9) has been shown to involve PAX5, which plays numerous regulatory roles in B-cell differentiation. Other PAX5 rearrangements have been detected in B-ALL cases of young adults and adolescents, but with unclear clinical significance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of t(17;19)-ALL with concomitant 5' IGH deletion and t(1;9)(p13;p13) potentially involving PAX5, albeit at different time points in disease progression. This case provides insight into the clonal evolution of t(17;19)-ALL and the potential involvement of PAX5 and IGH aberrations in the evolution of this malignancy.","['Chow, R', 'Shabsovich, D', 'Schiller, G', 'Kallen, M', 'Tirado, Carlos A']","['Chow R', 'Shabsovich D', 'Schiller G', 'Kallen M', 'Tirado CA']","['Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UCLA Los Angeles, CA 90024.', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UCLA Los Angeles, CA 90024.', 'Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90024.', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UCLA Los Angeles, CA 90024.', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UCLA Los Angeles, CA 90024.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Assoc Genet Technol,Journal of the Association of Genetic Technologists,9807282,,,2016/05/18 06:00,2016/05/18 06:01,['2016/05/17 06:00'],"['2016/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/18 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,J Assoc Genet Technol. 2016;42(1):6-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, between 50 and 60 cases have been reported. In this review, we will discuss the literature regarding t(16;21) as well as cases published. We compiled 68 cases from the Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations and Gene Fusions in Cancer as well as 10 additional cases in the literature, for a total of 78 cases. The t(16;21) results in the TLS(FUS)-ERG fusion protein, which is believed to function as a transcriptional activator in leukemogenesis and has been demonstrated to interfere in normal pre-mRNA splicing functions of FUS/TLS. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of fusion transcripts in patients, has been demonstrated to have diagnostic significance in monitoring for minimal residual disease. Cytogenetically, about half of the cases had secondary chromosomal abnormalities; we found that trisomy 8 and 10 were the most common abnormalities, occurring in 9.1% of the otal cases for each. t(16;21) in AML has been described with various morphological features, such as phagocytosis and vacuolation, and is present in multiple FAB types. Immunophenotypic characteristics such as CD33 and CD34 expression have also been noted, and several studies have examined the relation between CD56 receptor expression and t(16;21) AML. In general, t(16;21) in AML is associated with a poor prognosis and this abnormality could serve as cytogenetic indicator in determining diagnosis and prognosis. Herein, we summarize the cytogenetic features found in the the Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations and Gene Fusions in Cancer for t(16;21) in AML, as well as review the current literature associated with t(16;21), AML and its features.","['Buchanan, Justin', 'Tirado, Carlos A']","['Buchanan J', 'Tirado CA']","['Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UCLA Los Angeles, CA 90024.', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UCLA Los Angeles, CA 90024.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Assoc Genet Technol,Journal of the Association of Genetic Technologists,9807282,,,2016/05/18 06:00,2016/05/18 06:01,['2016/05/17 06:00'],"['2016/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/18 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,J Assoc Genet Technol. 2016;42(1):24-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although SOS/VOD progressively resolves within a few weeks in most patients, the most severe forms result in multi-organ dysfunction and are associated with a high mortality rate (>80%). Therefore, careful attention must be paid to allow an early detection of SOS/VOD, particularly as drugs have now proven to be effective and licensed for its treatment. Unfortunately, current criteria lack sensitivity and specificity, making early identification and severity assessment of SOS/VOD difficult. The aim of this work is to propose a new definition for diagnosis, and a severity-grading system for SOS/VOD in adult patients, on behalf of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.","['Mohty, M', 'Malard, F', 'Abecassis, M', 'Aerts, E', 'Alaskar, A S', 'Aljurf, M', 'Arat, M', 'Bader, P', 'Baron, F', 'Bazarbachi, A', 'Blaise, D', 'Ciceri, F', 'Corbacioglu, S', 'Dalle, J-H', 'Dignan, F', 'Fukuda, T', 'Huynh, A', 'Masszi, T', 'Michallet, M', 'Nagler, A', 'NiChonghaile, M', 'Okamoto, S', 'Pagliuca, A', 'Peters, C', 'Petersen, F B', 'Richardson, P G', 'Ruutu, T', 'Savani, B N', 'Wallhult, E', 'Yakoub-Agha, I', 'Duarte, R F', 'Carreras, E']","['Mohty M', 'Malard F', 'Abecassis M', 'Aerts E', 'Alaskar AS', 'Aljurf M', 'Arat M', 'Bader P', 'Baron F', 'Bazarbachi A', 'Blaise D', 'Ciceri F', 'Corbacioglu S', 'Dalle JH', 'Dignan F', 'Fukuda T', 'Huynh A', 'Masszi T', 'Michallet M', 'Nagler A', 'NiChonghaile M', 'Okamoto S', 'Pagliuca A', 'Peters C', 'Petersen FB', 'Richardson PG', 'Ruutu T', 'Savani BN', 'Wallhult E', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Duarte RF', 'Carreras E']","['Hematology Department, Hopital Saint Antoine, and Universite Pierre & Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'Hematology Department, Hopital Saint Antoine, and Universite Pierre & Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'Instituto Portugues de Oncologia, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'King Abdullah International Medical Research Center/King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Department of Oncology, King Abdulaziz Medical City, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Sisli Florence Nightingale Hospital, HSCT Unit, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunology, Department for Children and Adolescents, University Hospital, Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Hematology Department, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Immunology, Hospital Robert Debre, Paris 7-Paris Diderot University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Central Manchester Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK.', 'HSCT division, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse -

OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of leisure-time physical activity with incidence of common types of cancer and whether associations vary by body size and/or smoking. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We pooled data from 12 prospective US and European cohorts with self-reported physical activity (baseline, 1987-2004). We used multivariable Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals for associations of leisure-time physical activity with incidence of 26 types of cancer. Leisure-time physical activity levels were modeled as cohort-specific percentiles on a continuous basis and cohort-specific results were synthesized by random-effects meta-analysis. Hazard ratios for high vs low levels of activity are based on a comparison of risk at the 90th vs 10th percentiles of activity. The data analysis was performed from January 1, 2014, to June 1, 2015. EXPOSURES: Leisure-time physical activity of a moderate to vigorous intensity. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident cancer during follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 1.44 million participants (median [range] age, 59 [19-98] years; 57% female) and 186932 cancers were included. High vs low levels of leisure-time physical activity were associated with lower risks of 13 cancers: esophageal adenocarcinoma (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.37-0.89), liver (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.55-0.98), lung (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.71-0.77), kidney (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.70-0.85), gastric cardia (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64-0.95), endometrial (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.68-0.92), myeloid leukemia (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70-0.92), myeloma (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.95), colon (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77-0.91), head and neck (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.93), rectal (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80-0.95), bladder (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82-0.92), and breast (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87-0.93). Body mass index adjustment modestly attenuated associations for several cancers, but 10 of 13 inverse associations remained statistically significant after this adjustment. Leisure-time physical activity was associated with higher risks of malignant melanoma (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.16-1.40) and prostate cancer (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.08). Associations were generally similar between overweight/obese and normal-weight individuals. Smoking status modified the association for lung cancer but not other smoking-related cancers. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Leisure-time physical activity was associated with lower risks of many cancer types. Health care professionals counseling inactive adults should emphasize that most of these associations were evident regardless of body size or smoking history, supporting broad generalizability of findings.","['Moore, Steven C', 'Lee, I-Min', 'Weiderpass, Elisabete', 'Campbell, Peter T', 'Sampson, Joshua N', 'Kitahara, Cari M', 'Keadle, Sarah K', 'Arem, Hannah', 'Berrington de Gonzalez, Amy', 'Hartge, Patricia', 'Adami, Hans-Olov', 'Blair, Cindy K', 'Borch, Kristin B', 'Boyd, Eric', 'Check, David P', 'Fournier, Agnes', 'Freedman, Neal D', 'Gunter, Marc', 'Johannson, Mattias', 'Khaw, Kay-Tee', 'Linet, Martha S', 'Orsini, Nicola', 'Park, Yikyung', 'Riboli, Elio', 'Robien, Kim', 'Schairer, Catherine', 'Sesso, Howard', 'Spriggs, Michael', 'Van Dusen, Roy', 'Wolk, Alicja', 'Matthews, Charles E', 'Patel, Alpa V']","['Moore SC', 'Lee IM', 'Weiderpass E', 'Campbell PT', 'Sampson JN', 'Kitahara CM', 'Keadle SK', 'Arem H', 'Berrington de Gonzalez A', 'Hartge P', 'Adami HO', 'Blair CK', 'Borch KB', 'Boyd E', 'Check DP', 'Fournier A', 'Freedman ND', 'Gunter M', 'Johannson M', 'Khaw KT', 'Linet MS', 'Orsini N', 'Park Y', 'Riboli E', 'Robien K', 'Schairer C', 'Sesso H', 'Spriggs M', 'Van Dusen R', 'Wolk A', 'Matthews CE', 'Patel AV']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', ""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden4Department of Community Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Tromso, Arctic University of Norway, Tromso, Norway5Genetic Epidemiology Group, Folkh.', 'Epidemiology Research Program, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland8now with USAID Bureau for Global Health, Washington, DC.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden9Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

The phosphyotidylinositol-3-kinase delta inhibitor idelalisib is effective in patients with treatment-naive and relapsed/refractory CLL as monotherapy and in combination with rituximab, but it can be associated with treatment-limiting adverse events, particularly diarrhea/colitis. The outcomes for patients who cease treatment for adverse events have not been previously described. METHODS: The authors analyzed long-term follow-up data from 40 treatment-naive patients aged >/=65 years who received treatment at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center on a phase 2 study of idelalisib plus rituximab for CLL. RESULTS: In patients who permanently ceased treatment because of toxicity, the time to subsequent disease progression was analyzed according to baseline characteristics. Fifteen patients permanently ceased therapy (PCT) because of toxicity (PCTTOX ), most commonly diarrhea/colitis (n = 7), at a median of 11 months after commencing treatment. PCTTOX was associated with a higher risk of subsequent disease progression (hazard ratio, 6.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.77-16.15) relative to that observed in patients who remained on therapy. Ten patients subsequently progressed, and 7 required salvage therapy; 5 patients remained progression-free at a median of 23.3 months (range, 8.5-28.6 months). Patients who were positive for zeta-associated protein-70 had more rapid disease progression after treatment cessation (P = .048). There were no CLL-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS: PCTTOX is the major determinant of PFS in patients who receive first-line idelalisib-based treatment. However, a subgroup of patients with favorable biologic characteristics has prolonged PFS, even after PCTTOX . The absence of CLL-related deaths indicates that salvage treatment is generally successful after PCTTOX . Cancer 2016;122:2505-11.

The expression status of Lyn and its correlation with multiple clinical parameters including cell differentiation degree, different cytogenetic risk classification, and the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) were thus investigated. To address the mechanisms underlying the involvement of Lyn in differentiation induction, the effects of dasatinib, an inhibitor for SFKs including Lyn, on the alterations of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)- or dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3)-induced differentiation, and c-Myc protein expression were investigated. METHODS: Primary AML blasts were obtained from 31 newly diagnosed AML patients with different French-American-British (FAB) subtypes. The expression of phosphorylated and total Lyn, c-Myc, and CD11b, CD11c and CD15 was analyzed by flow cytometry. The activation of Akt and Erk known to be involved in the regulation of c-Myc expression was investigated using western blotting. RESULTS: Significant higher expression levels of total Lyn were observed in AML patients with favorable cytogenetics, higher MPO activity and FAB M2 subtype. A clear positive correlation between the expression levels of Lyn and differentiation status of primary AML blasts was observed. Dasatinib inhibited the expression of phosphorylated Lyn, and further enhanced the differentiation-inducing activity of ATRA and VD3 in HL-60 cells. Augmented downregulation of c-Myc protein expression was observed in the combination treatment with ATRA, VD3 and dasatinib compared to treatment with each reagent alone in HL-60 cells. The suppression of the activation of Akt and Erk was also observed concomitantly. CONCLUSIONS: The expression level of total Lyn is closely linked to the differentiation status of AML blasts. The enhancement of differentiation-inducing activity of ATRA/VD3 by dasatinib suggested that Lyn was associated in the negative regulation of ATRA/VD3-induced HL-60 cells differentiation. The enhancement probably was attributed to the downregulation of c-Myc implicated with the suppression of the activation of Akt and Erk. These results provide novel insights into a possible combinational therapeutic approach by targeting Lyn for AML patients, and offer new possibilities for the combination therapy with VD3 and dasatinib.","['Iriyama, Noriyoshi', 'Yuan, Bo', 'Hatta, Yoshihiro', 'Takagi, Norio', 'Takei, Masami']","['Iriyama N', 'Yuan B', 'Hatta Y', 'Takagi N', 'Takei M']","['Division of Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, Itabashi Hospital, 30-1 Oyaguchi Kamicho, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Applied Biochemistry, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392 Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, Itabashi Hospital, 30-1 Oyaguchi Kamicho, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Applied Biochemistry, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392 Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, Itabashi Hospital, 30-1 Oyaguchi Kamicho, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,2016/05/18 06:00,2016/05/18 06:01,['2016/05/17 06:00'],"['2016/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/18 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2016 May 13;16:37. doi: 10.1186/s12935-016-0314-5. eCollection 2016.,10.1186/s12935-016-0314-5 [doi],20160513,,PMC4866426,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'All-trans retinoic acid', 'Dihydroxyvitamin D3', 'Lyn', 'c-Myc', 'dasatinib']",,"['10.1186/s12935-016-0314-5 [doi]', '314 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary university-affiliated assisted reproduction technology (ART) and oncology centers. PATIENT(S): Twenty cancer survivors who underwent ovarian transplantation of frozen-thawed ovarian tissue with the aim to conceive. INTERVENTION(S): Ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTCP) and transplantation, endocrine monitoring, in vitro fertilization (IVF). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Endocrine profile, IVF, pregnancies, live births. RESULT(S): The patient ages at tissue harvesting ranged from 14 to 39 years. Fifteen women had hematologic malignancies, and two had leukemia (chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute myelogenous leukemia). Ten patients were exposed to nonsterilizing chemotherapy before OTCP. After transplantation, the endocrine recovery rate was 93%. Fourteen patients underwent IVF treatments with a fertilization rate of 58%. Sixteen pregnancies were achieved (10 after IVF, 6 spontaneous), resulting in 10 live births, two (twins) after harvesting from the mother at the age of 37. Two pregnancies are currently ongoing. After transplantation, 53% of patients conceived, and 32% delivered at least once. One patient conceived four times. Preharversting chemotherapy exposure was not associated with inferior outcomes. All patients, including two leukemia survivors, remained cancer free. CONCLUSION(S): Orthotopic transplantation of thawed ovarian tissue is a highly effective measure to restore fertility in sterilized cancer patients. Chemotherapy exposure before harvesting and age >35 is a realistic option in selected patients. Retransplantation in leukemic patients is possible after application of maximal safety measures. These results have led the national ethical and professional authorities to decide for the first time not to consider OTCP as an experimental modality for fertility preservation.

METHODS: The co-culture system of UC-MSC with acute promyelocytic leukemic cell line NB4 cells was constructed in vitro,and the differentiation status of the leukemic cells was assessed by cell morphology,nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test,and cell surface differentiation marker CD11b. RESULTS: UC-MSC induced the granulocytic differentiation of NB4 cells. When UC-MSC and a small dose of all-trans retinoic acid were applied together,the differentiation-inducing effect was enhanced in an additive manner. Interleukin (IL)-6Ra neutralization attenuated differentiation and exogenous IL-6-induced differentiation of leukemic cells. CONCLUSION: UC-MSC can promotd granulocytic differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells by way of IL-6 and presented additive effect when combined with a small dose of all-trans retinoic acid.","['Chen, Fang', 'Ma, Feng-xia', 'Li, Yang', 'Xu, Fang-yun', 'Chi, Ying', 'Lu, Shi-hong', 'Han, Zhong-chao']","['Chen F', 'Ma FX', 'Li Y', 'Xu FY', 'Chi Y', 'Lu SH', 'Han ZC']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology,Institute of Hematology and Hospital of Blood Diseases,CAMS and PUMC,Tianjin 300020,China;', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology,Institute of Hematology and Hospital of Blood Diseases,CAMS and PUMC,Tianjin 300020,China;', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology,Institute of Hematology and Hospital of Blood Diseases,CAMS and PUMC,Tianjin 300020,China;', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology,Institute of Hematology and Hospital of Blood Diseases,CAMS and PUMC,Tianjin 300020,China;', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology,Institute of Hematology and Hospital of Blood Diseases,CAMS and PUMC,Tianjin 300020,China;', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology,Institute of Hematology and Hospital of Blood Diseases,CAMS and PUMC,Tianjin 300020,China;', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology,Institute of Hematology and Hospital of Blood Diseases,CAMS and PUMC,Tianjin 300020,China;']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Yi Xue Ke Xue Yuan Xue Bao,Zhongguo yi xue ke xue yuan xue bao.

Here, we found that as expected puromycin induced SUMO-1/2/3 accumulation with ubiquitin at multiple nuclear foci in HeLa cells when co-exposed to MG132. Co-administration of puromycin and MG132 also facilitated redistribution of PML and the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase RNF4 concurrently with SUMO-2/3. As removal of the drugs from the medium led to disappearance of the SUMO-2/3-ubiquitin nuclear foci, our findings indicated that nuclear assembly/disassembly of SUMO-2/3 and ubiquitin was pharmacologically manipulable, supporting our previous observation on OP-Puro, which predicted the ubiquitin family function in sequestrating aberrant proteins to the nucleus.","['Matsumoto, Hotaru', 'Saitoh, Hisato']","['Matsumoto H', 'Saitoh H']","['Course for Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Course for Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.

However, the poor prognosis of patients with advanced-phase CML and the lifelong dependency on TKIs are remaining challenges; therefore, an effective therapeutic has been sought. The BCR-ABL p210 fusion protein's junction region represents a leukemia-specific neoantigen and is thus an attractive target for antigen-specific T-cell immunotherapy. BCR-ABL p210 fusion-region-specific CD4(+) T-helper (Th) cells possess antileukemic potential, but their function remains unclear. In this study, we established a BCR-ABL p210 b3a2 fusion-region-specific CD4(+) Th-cell clone (b3a2-specific Th clone) and examined its dendritic cell (DC)-mediated antileukemic potential. The b3a2-specific Th clone recognized the b3a2 peptide in the context of HLA-DRB1*09:01 and exhibited a Th1 profile. Activation of this clone through T-cell antigen receptor stimulation triggered DC maturation, as indicated by upregulated production of CD86 and IL-12p70 by DCs, which depended on CD40 ligation by CD40L expressed on b3a2-specific Th cells. Moreover, in the presence of HLA-A*24:02-restricted Wilms tumor 1 (WT1)235-243 peptide, DCs conditioned by b3a2-specific Th cells efficiently stimulated the primary expansion of WTI-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The expanded CTLs were cytotoxic toward WT1235-243-peptide-loaded HLA-A*24:02-positive cell lines and exerted a potent antileukemic effect in vivo. However, the b3a2-specific Th-clone-mediated antileukemic CTL responses were strongly inhibited by both TKIs and interferon-alpha. Our findings indicate a crucial role of b3a2-specific Th cells in leukemia antigen-specific CTL-mediated immunity and provide an experimental basis for establishing novel CML immunotherapies.","['Ueda, Norihiro', 'Zhang, Rong', 'Tatsumi, Minako', 'Liu, Tian-Yi', 'Kitayama, Shuichi', 'Yasui, Yutaka', 'Sugai, Shiori', 'Iwama, Tatsuaki', 'Senju, Satoru', 'Okada, Seiji', 'Nakatsura, Tetsuya', 'Kuzushima, Kiyotaka', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Naoe, Tomoki', 'Kaneko, Shin', 'Uemura, Yasushi']","['Ueda N', 'Zhang R', 'Tatsumi M', 'Liu TY', 'Kitayama S', 'Yasui Y', 'Sugai S', 'Iwama T', 'Senju S', 'Okada S', 'Nakatsura T', 'Kuzushima K', 'Kiyoi H', 'Naoe T', 'Kaneko S', 'Uemura Y']","['Division of Immunology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya 464-0021, Japan.', 'Shin Kaneko Laboratory, Department of Cell Growth and Differentiation, Center for iPS cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya 466-0065, Japan.', 'Division of Immunology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya 464-0021, Japan.', 'Division of Cancer Immunotherapy, Exploratory Oncology Research & Clinical Trial Center, National Cancer Center, Kashiwa, Chiba 277-8577, Japan.', 'Division of Immunology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya 464-0021, Japan.', 'Division of Immunology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya 464-0021, Japan.', 'Key Laboratory of Cancer Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Shin Kaneko Laboratory, Department of Cell Growth and Differentiation, Center for iPS cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Shin Kaneko Laboratory, Department of Cell Growth and Differentiation, Center for iPS cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Division of Cancer Immunotherapy, Exploratory Oncology Research & Clinical Trial Center, National Cancer Center, Kashiwa, Chiba 277-8577, Japan.', 'Division of Cancer Immunotherapy, Exploratory Oncology Research & Clinical Trial Center, National Cancer Center, Kashiwa, Chiba 277-8577, Japan.', 'Department of Immunogenetics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-8556, Japan.', 'Division of Hematopoiesis, Center for AIDS Research, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan.', 'Division of Cancer Immunotherapy, Exploratory Oncology Research & Clinical Trial Center, National Cancer Center, Kashiwa, Chiba 277-8577, Japan.', 'Division of Immunology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya 464-0021, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya 466-0065, Japan.', 'National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya 460-0001, Japan.', 'Shin Kaneko Laboratory, Department of Cell Growth and Differentiation, Center for iPS cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Division of Immunology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya 464-0021, Japan.', 'Division of Cancer Immunotherapy, Exploratory Oncology Research & Clinical Trial Center, National Cancer Center, Kashiwa, Chiba 277-8577, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Cell Mol Immunol,Cellular & molecular immunology,101242872,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Cross-Priming/drug effects/*immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/*immunology', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'HLA-DR Serological Subtypes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-12/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/chemistry/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/drug effects/*immunology']",2016/05/18 06:00,2019/05/07 06:00,['2016/05/17 06:00'],"['2015/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/22 00:00 [revised]', '2016/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/17 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Immunol. 2018 Jan;15(1):15-26. doi: 10.1038/cmi.2016.7.

We performed integrative analysis of whole-genome, whole-exome, custom capture, whole-transcriptome (RNA-seq), and locus-specific genomic assays across nine time points from a patient with primary de novo B-ALL. Comprehensive genome and transcriptome characterization revealed a dramatic tumor evolution during progression, yielding a tumor with complex clonal architecture at second relapse. We observed and validated point mutations in EP300 and NF1, a highly expressed EP300-ZNF384 gene fusion, a microdeletion in IKZF1, a focal deletion affecting SETD2, and large deletions affecting RB1, PAX5, NF1, and ETV6. Although the genome analysis revealed events of potential biological relevance, no clinically actionable treatment options were evident at the time of the second relapse. However, transcriptome analysis identified aberrant overexpression of the targetable protein kinase encoded by the FLT3 gene. Although the patient had refractory disease after salvage therapy for the second relapse, treatment with the FLT3 inhibitor sunitinib rapidly induced a near complete molecular response, permitting the patient to proceed to a matched-unrelated donor stem cell transplantation. The patient remains in complete remission more than 4 years later.

They are usually RNA or DNA oligonucleotides, the length of which ranges between 20 and 80 nt. They are produced using the SELEX method that allows one to obtain aptamers that bind to virtually any molecule of interest, providing a high specificity. Aptamers are an alternative to antibodies because on the one hand, their sensitivity is at a similar or sometimes even higher level, while on the other hand they do not show immunogenicity, and may be synthesized in vitro. To date, a broad range of different applications of aptamers has been described: as components of biosensors, or use in various laboratory techniques, such as microarrays or chromatography. One of the most important is the use of aptamers in medicine, especially in the fight against cancer. They can be used both for diagnosis and for the eradication of cancers - particularly through the delivery of drugs. Currently, most transport-related research is devoted to the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs, such as doxorubicin. This was used in research on liver cancer cells, prostate, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia blast cells. Another possibility is to use aptamers to deliver siRNAs. In this way inhibition of the quality control process of the mRNA in tumor cells is possible. An aptamer complex with the drug allows for direct delivery of the active substance in a particular cell type, substantially eliminating the non-specific effect of the drug.","['Odrzywolski, Adrian', 'Wasko, Adam']","['Odrzywolski A', 'Wasko A']","['Katedra i Zaklad Biochemii i Biologii Molekularnej, Uniwersytet Medyczny w Lublinie.', 'Katedra Biotechnologii, Zywienia Czlowieka i Towaroznawstwa Zywnosci, Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Lublinie.']",['pol'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Poland,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online),Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),101206517,IM,"['Aptamers, Nucleotide/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'RNA, Small Interfering/therapeutic use', '*SELEX Aptamer Technique']",2016/05/18 06:00,2016/06/09 06:00,['2016/05/17 06:00'],"['2016/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online). 2016 May 4;70:400-9. doi: 10.5604/17322693.1201115.,,20160504,"['0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",,,,,"['1201115 [pii]', '10.5604/17322693.1201115 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,Wykorzystanie aptamerow oligonukleotydowych w terapii nowotworow.,,,,,,,,,

Patients treated with LAL/SHOP protocols often suffer from vincristine-related neurotoxicity in early phases of treatment. Recently, a genome-wide association study connected a SNP in CEP72, involved in vincristine pharmacodynamics, with neurotoxicity during later phases of therapy, which was not replicated during induction phase. These results, together with previous studies indicating that polymorphisms in pharmacokinetic genes are associated with drug toxicity, suggest that changes in the activity or levels of vincristine transporters or metabolizers could work as predictors of vincristine-related neurotoxicity in early phases of treatment in pediatric ALL. PATIENTS & METHODS: We analyzed 150 SNPs in eight key genes involved in vincristine pharmacokinetics and in 13 miRNAs that regulate them. We studied their correlation with neurotoxicity during induction phase in 152 ALL patients treated with LAL/SHOP protocols. RESULTS: The strongest associations with neurotoxicity were observed for two SNPs in ABCC2. The genotypes rs3740066 GG and rs12826 GG were associated with increased neurotoxicity. CONCLUSION: Polymorphisms in ABCC2 could be novel markers for vincristine-related neurotoxicity in pediatric ALL in early phases.","['Lopez-Lopez, Elixabet', 'Gutierrez-Camino, Angela', 'Astigarraga, Itziar', 'Navajas, Aurora', 'Echebarria-Barona, Aizpea', 'Garcia-Miguel, Purificacion', 'Garcia de Andoin, Nagore', 'Lobo, Carmen', 'Guerra-Merino, Isabel', 'Martin-Guerrero, Idoia', 'Garcia-Orad, Africa']","['Lopez-Lopez E', 'Gutierrez-Camino A', 'Astigarraga I', 'Navajas A', 'Echebarria-Barona A', 'Garcia-Miguel P', 'Garcia de Andoin N', 'Lobo C', 'Guerra-Merino I', 'Martin-Guerrero I', 'Garcia-Orad A']","['Department of Genetics, Physical Anthropology & Animal Physiology, Faculty of Medicine & Odontology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics, Physical Anthropology & Animal Physiology, Faculty of Medicine & Odontology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa, Spain.', 'Unit of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Cruces, Bilbao, Spain.', 'Unit of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Cruces, Bilbao, Spain.', 'Unit of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Cruces, Bilbao, Spain.', 'Service of Pediatric Oncohematology, University Hospital La Paz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Unit of Pediatric Oncohematology, University Hospital Donostia, San Sebastian, Spain.', 'Department of Anatomic Pathology, University Hospital Donostia, Donostia, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospital of Araba, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics, Physical Anthropology & Animal Physiology, Faculty of Medicine & Odontology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics, Physical Anthropology & Animal Physiology, Faculty of Medicine & Odontology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa, Spain.', 'BioCruces Health Research Institute, Barakaldo, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Pharmacogenomics,Pharmacogenomics,100897350,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/etiology', 'Pharmacogenomic Testing', '*Pharmacogenomic Variants', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vincristine/*adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics']",2016/05/18 06:00,2017/03/28 06:00,['2016/05/17 06:00'],"['2016/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/28 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Pharmacogenomics. 2016 May;17(7):731-41. doi: 10.2217/pgs-2016-0001.

Gefitinib also induces differentiation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and patient samples lacking EGFR by an unknown mechanism. Here we dissected the mechanism of gefitinib action responsible for its EGFR-independent effects. METHODS: Signaling events were analyzed by homogenous time-resolved fluorescence and immunoblotting. Cellular proliferation and differentiation were assessed by ATP measurement, trypan blue exclusion, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation and flow-cytometry. Gefitinib and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) interactions were assessed by beta-arrestin recruitment, luciferase and radioligand competition assays. Role of histamine receptors (HR) in gefitinib actions were assessed by HR knockdown or pharmacological modulation. EGFR and HR interaction was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: Gefitinib reduced cyclic AMP content in both AML and EGFR-expressing cells and induced ERK phosphorylation in AML cells. Dibutyryl-cAMP or PD98059 suppressed gefitinib-induced AML cell cytostasis and differentiation. Gefitinib bound to and modulated HRs with subtype selectivity. Pharmacological or genetic modulations of H2 and H4 HRs (H2R and H4R) not only suppressed gefitinib-induced cytostasis and differentiation of AML cells but also blocked EGFR and ERK1/2 inhibition in MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, in MDA-MB-231 cells gefitinib enhanced EGFR interaction with H4R that was blocked by H4R agonist 4-methyl histamine (4MH). CONCLUSION: HRs play critical roles in anti-cancer effects of gefitinib in both EGFR-deficient and EGFR-rich environments. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: We furnish fresh insights into gefitinib functions which may provide new molecular clues to its efficacy and safety issues.","['Yadav, Manisha', 'Singh, Abhishek Kumar', 'Kumar, Harish', 'Rao, Geeta', 'Chakravarti, Bandana', 'Gurjar, Anagha', 'Dogra, Shalini', 'Kushwaha, Sapana', 'Vishwakarma, Achchhe Lal', 'Yadav, Prem Narayan', 'Datta, Dipak', 'Tripathi, Anil Kumar', 'Chattopadhyay, Naibedya', 'Trivedi, Arun Kumar', 'Sanyal, Sabyasachi']","['Yadav M', 'Singh AK', 'Kumar H', 'Rao G', 'Chakravarti B', 'Gurjar A', 'Dogra S', 'Kushwaha S', 'Vishwakarma AL', 'Yadav PN', 'Datta D', 'Tripathi AK', 'Chattopadhyay N', 'Trivedi AK', 'Sanyal S']","['Division of Biochemistry, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow 226031, UP, India.', 'Division of Biochemistry, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow 226031, UP, India.', 'Division of Biochemistry, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow 226031, UP, India.', 'Division of Biochemistry, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow 226031, UP, India.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Raebareli Road, Lucknow 226014, UP, India.', 'Division of Biochemistry, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow 226031, UP, India.', 'Division of Pharmacology, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow 226031, UP, India.', 'Division of Biochemistry, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow 226031, UP, India.', 'Division of Sophisticated and Analytical Instrument Facility, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow 226031, UP, India.', 'Division of Pharmacology, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow 226031, UP, India.', 'Division of Biochemistry, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow 226031, UP, India.', ""Department of Clinical Hematology and Medical Oncology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow 226003, Uttar Pradesh, India."", 'Division of Endocrinology, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow 226031, UP, India.', 'Division of Biochemistry, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow 226031, UP, India.', 'Division of Biochemistry, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow 226031, UP, India.

However, some ALL patients acquire resistance to glucocorticoids (GC). Thus, it is important to explore new agents to overcome GC resistance. The aim of the present work was to assess the ability of Pyr3, a selective inhibitor of transient receptor potential canonical 3 (TRPC3), to sensitize human ALL cells to Dex. We show here, for the first time, that Pyr3 enhances Dex sensitivity through the distraction of Dex-mediated Ca(2+) signaling in ALL cells (in vitro) and primary blasts (ex vivo) associated with mitochondrial-mediated reactive oxygen species production in ALL cells. Pyr3 alone induced Ca(2+) signaling via only endoplasmic reticulum-released Ca(2+) and exerted inhibitory effect on store-operated Ca(2+) entry in dose-dependent manner in ALL cell lines. Pre-incubation of cells with Pyr3 significantly curtailed the thapsigargin- and Dex-evoked Ca(2+) signaling in ALL cell lines. Pyr3 synergistically potentiated Dex lethality, as shown by the induction of cell mortality, G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in ALL cell lines. Moreover, Pyr3 disrupted Dex-mediated Ca(2+) signaling and increased the sensitivity of Dex-induced cell death in primary blasts from ALL patients. Additional analysis showed that co-treatment with Dex and Pyr3 results in mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization and reactive oxygen species production in ALL cells.

Numerous miRNAs promote tumorigenesis and cancer progression by enhancing tumor growth, angiogenesis, invasion and immune evasion, while others have tumor suppressive effects (Hayes, et al., Trends Mol Med 20(8): 460-9, 2014; Stahlhut and Slack, Genome Med 5 (12): 111, 2013). The expression profile of cancer miRNAs can be used to predict patient prognosis and clinical response to treatment (Bouchie, Nat Biotechnol 31(7): 577, 2013). The majority of miRNAs are intracellular localized, however circulating miRNAs have been detected in various body fluids and represent new biomarkers of solid and hematologic cancers (Fabris and Calin, Mol Oncol 10(3):503-8, 2016; Allegra, et al., Int J Oncol 41(6): 1897-912, 2012).

The interaction between regulatory signals and cellular metabolism is an emerging area. Several metabolic pathways function differently in HSCs compared with progenitors and differentiated cells. Hypoxia, acting through hypoxia-inducing factors, has emerged as a key regulator of stem cell biology and acts by maintaining HSC quiescence and a condition of metabolic dormancy based on anaerobic glycolytic energetic metabolism, with consequent low production reactive oxygen species (ROS) and high antioxidant defense. Hematopoietic cell differentiation is accompanied by changes in oxidative metabolism (decrease of anaerobic glycolysis and increase of oxidative phosphorylation) and increased levels of ROS. Leukemic stem cells, defined as the cells that initiate and maintain the leukemic process, show peculiar metabolic properties in that they are more dependent on oxidative respiration than on glycolysis and are more sensitive to oxidative stress than normal HSCs. Several mitochondrial abnormalities have been described in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, explaining the shift to aerobic glycolysis observed in these cells and offering the unique opportunity for therapeutic metabolic targeting. Finally, frequent mutations of the mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) enzyme are observed in AML cells, in which the mutated enzyme acts as an oncogenic driver and can be targeted using specific inhibitors under clinical evaluation with promising results.","['Testa, Ugo', 'Labbaye, Catherine', 'Castelli, Germana', 'Pelosi, Elvira']","['Testa U', 'Labbaye C', 'Castelli G', 'Pelosi E']","['Departement of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.

The structure and immunomodulation of LTA vary greatly between different species. LTA from Lactobacillus plantarum has been shown to exert anti-pathogenic effects. Vibrio anguillarum is a major causative agent of vibriosis, one of the most prevalent fish diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of L. plantarum LTA on V. anguillarum growth, adhesion, and induced inflammation and apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells of silvery pomfret (Pampus argenteus). Our results showed that L. plantarum LTA was unable to inhibit V. anguillarum growth; however, it significantly inhibited adhesion of V. anguillarum. It also showed significant inhibitory effects on EHEC-induced inflammation and apoptosis by modulating the expression of NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappa B), IkappaB (inhibitor of NF-kappaB), Bcl2 (B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2), BAX (Bcl-2-associated X protein), IL-8 (interleukin 8) and TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor-alpha), and via inhibition of caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation. These data extend our understanding of the beneficial effects of L. plantarum LTA, which is related to the inhibition of V. anguillarum, and suggest that L. plantarum LTA has potential as a new therapeutic agent against V. anguillarum-caused vibriosis in fish.","['Gao, Quanxin', 'Gao, Qian', 'Min, Minghua', 'Zhang, Chenjie', 'Peng, Shiming', 'Shi, Zhaohong']","['Gao Q', 'Gao Q', 'Min M', 'Zhang C', 'Peng S', 'Shi Z']","[""Key Laboratory of Marine and Estuarine Fisheries, Ministry of Agriculture, East China Sea Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Shanghai 200090, People's Republic of China."", ""Shibo High-Tech Hospital, Zibo 255086, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Marine and Estuarine Fisheries, Ministry of Agriculture, East China Sea Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Shanghai 200090, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Marine and Estuarine Fisheries, Ministry of Agriculture, East China Sea Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Shanghai 200090, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Marine and Estuarine Fisheries, Ministry of Agriculture, East China Sea Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Shanghai 200090, People's Republic of China.

Antioxidants such as glutathione can decrease symptom severity in adult oncology patients, but no study has evaluated antioxidants' effects on symptoms in pediatric oncology patients. This study describes fatigue patterns and associations of fatigue with antioxidants represented by reduced glutathione (GSH) and the reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio among children receiving leukemia treatment. A repeated measures design assessed fatigue and antioxidants among 38 children from two large U.S. cancer centers. Fatigue was assessed among school-age children and by parent proxy among young children. Antioxidants (GSH and GSH/GSSG ratio) were assessed from cerebrospinal fluid at four phases during leukemia treatment. Young children had a steady decline of fatigue from the end of induction treatment through the continuation phase of treatment, but no significant changes were noted among the school-age children. Mean antioxidant scores varied slightly over time; however, the GSH/GSSG ratios in these children were significantly lower than the normal ratio. Mean GSH/GSSG ratios significantly correlated to fatigue scores of the school-age children during early phases of treatment. Children with low mean GSH/GSSG ratios demonstrated oxidative stress. The low ratios noted early in therapy were significantly correlated with higher fatigue scores during induction and postinduction treatment phases. This finding suggests that increased oxidative stress during the more intensive phases of therapy may explain the experience of fatigue children report.","['Rodgers, Cheryl', 'Sanborn, Chelse', 'Taylor, Olga', 'Gundy, Patricia', 'Pasvogel, Alice', 'Moore, Ida M Ki', 'Hockenberry, Marilyn J']","['Rodgers C', 'Sanborn C', 'Taylor O', 'Gundy P', 'Pasvogel A', 'Moore IM', 'Hockenberry MJ']","['Duke University School of Nursing, Durham, NC, USA cheryl.rodgers@duke.edu.', ""Duke Children's Hospital & Health Center, Durham, NC, USA."", ""Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, USA."", 'University of Arizona College of Nursing, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'University of Arizona College of Nursing, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'University of Arizona College of Nursing, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Duke University School of Nursing, Durham, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Biol Res Nurs,Biological research for nursing,9815758,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antioxidants/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fatigue/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Glutathione/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'United States']",2016/05/15 06:00,2017/09/19 06:00,['2016/05/15 06:00'],"['2016/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/19 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Biol Res Nurs. 2016 Oct;18(5):515-20. doi: 10.1177/1099800416647794.

However, the role of HPIP in ovarian cancer is still unclear. Here, we aimed to clarify the role of HPIP in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of ovarian cancer cells, stimulated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1. In this study, we found that HPIP was highly expressed in ovarian cancer cells, and TGF-beta1 treatment induced HPIP expression in ovarian cancer cells. In addition, knockdown of HPIP suppressed TGF-beta1-induced EMT and migration/invasion in ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, knockdown of HPIP significantly blocked the phosphorylated pattern of both PI3K and Akt induced by TGF-beta1 in SKOV3 cells. In conclusion, the present study showed that HPIP silencing might prevent TGF-beta1-induced EMT in ovarian cancer cells. Thus, HPIP may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of ovarian cancer.","['Zhang, Guo-Ying', 'Liu, Ai-Hua', 'Li, Guo-Min', 'Wang, Jian-Rong']","['Zhang GY', 'Liu AH', 'Li GM', 'Wang JR']","[""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Dongying People's Hospital, Dongying, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Silencing/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics', 'Phosphorylation/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/*genetics']",2016/05/15 06:00,2017/03/04 06:00,['2016/05/15 06:00'],"['2016/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/04 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Oncol Res. 2016;24(1):33-9. doi: 10.3727/096504016X14575597858654.,10.3727/096504016X14575597858654 [doi],,"['0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (PBXIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",PMC7838700,,,,['10.3727/096504016X14575597858654 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, most patients show TKI resistance and tumor recurrence after therapy. Therefore, we expected that an adjuvant biomarker other than EGFR mutation is needed for predicting TKI resistance. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Molecular manipulations were performed to verify whether TKI resistance mediated by p21-activated kinase (PAK1) could be through increasing Mcl-1 protein stability via the PI3K/AKT/C/EBP-beta/miR-145 cascade. Xenograft mouse models were used to confirm the mechanistic action of PAK1 on TKI resistance. Forty-six tumor tissues from patients with lung adenocarcinoma who received TKI therapy were collected to evaluate PAK1 and E-cadherin mRNA expressions by real-time PCR. The association of PAK1 and E-cadherin mRNA expressions with tumor response to TKI treatment and outcomes was evaluated. RESULTS: We demonstrate that PAK1 confers TKI resistance in EGFR-mutant cells as well as in EGFR-wild-type cells. Mechanistically, the positive feedback loop of PAK1/PI3K/AKT/C/EBP-beta/miR-145 cascades persistently activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to protect Mcl-1 degradation by Fbw7, which results, in turn, in TKI resistance and cell invasion via epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition due to a decrease in E-cadherin expression. The mechanism underlying the cell model is further confirmed in xenograft tumors. Among patients, high-PAK1 or low-E-cadherin tumors more commonly exhibited an unfavorable response to TKI and poorer outcome compared with low-PAK1 or low-E-cadherin tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of TKI with AKT inhibitor might confer TKI sensitivity and in turn improve outcomes in patients with lung adenocarcinoma who harbored high PAK1 mRNA-expressing tumors.

Factors negatively associated with leukemia-free survival (LFS) were unfavorable cytogenetics (3-year LFS 48% versus 80%, P = .0035) and ABCG2 positivity (65% versus 80%, P = .045). Three-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) in the whole population was 20%; a higher incidence of relapse was associated with adverse cytogenetics (41% versus 16%, P = .018), ABCG2 overexpression (29% versus 15%, P = .04), and, marginally, age > 50 years (30% versus 14%, P = .06). We grouped patients according to the combination of these 3 risk factors: no patient relapsed within 3 years from SCT in the group without risk factors, whereas the 3-year CIR was 12% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2% to 25%) in the group with 1 risk factor and 47% (95% CI, 31% to 70%) in patients with 2 or 3 risk factors (P = .00005). In conclusion, allogeneic SCT does not seem to abrogate the negative prognosis associated with ABCG2 overexpression at diagnosis, specifically in terms of a higher relapse risk. ABCG2, age, and cytogenetics can predict AML relapse after SCT in patients who undergo transplantation while in CR.","['Damiani, Daniela', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Geromin, Antonella', 'Cerno, Michela', 'Zanini, Francesca', 'Michelutti, Angela', 'Fanin, Renato']","['Damiani D', 'Tiribelli M', 'Geromin A', 'Cerno M', 'Zanini F', 'Michelutti A', 'Fanin R']","['Division of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Udine, Udine, Italy.

Venetoclax is an oral small-molecule BCL2 inhibitor that induces chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cell apoptosis. In a previous first-in-human study of venetoclax, 77% of patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia achieved an overall response. Here we aimed to assess the activity and safety of venetoclax monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory del(17p) chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. METHODS: In this phase 2, single-arm, multicentre study, we recruited patients aged 18 years and older with del(17p) relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (as defined by 2008 Modified International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia guidelines) from 31 centres in the USA, Canada, UK, Germany, Poland, and Australia. Patients started once daily venetoclax with a weekly dose ramp-up schedule (20, 50, 100, 200, 400 mg) over 4-5 weeks. Patients were then given daily 400 mg continuous dosing until disease progression or discontinuation for another reason. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving an overall response, assessed by an independent review committee. Activity and safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug (per protocol). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01889186. Follow-up is ongoing, and patients are still receiving treatment. FINDINGS: Between May 27, 2013, and June 27, 2014, 107 patients were enrolled into the study. At a median follow-up of 12.1 months (IQR 10.1-14.2), an overall response by independent review was achieved in 85 (79.4%; 95% CI 70.5-86.6) of 107 patients. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (43 [40%]), infection (21 [20%]), anaemia (19 [18%]), and thrombocytopenia (16 [15%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 59 (55%) patients, irrespective of their relationship to treatment, with the most common (>/=5% of patients) being pyrexia and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (seven [7%] each), pneumonia (six [6%]), and febrile neutropenia (five [5%]). 11 patients died in the study within 30 days of the last dose of venetoclax; seven due to disease progression and four from an adverse event (none assessed as treatment related). INTERPRETATION: Results of this trial show that venetoclax monotherapy is active and well tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory del(17p) chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, providing a new therapeutic option for this very poor prognosis population. Additionally, in view of the distinct mechanism-of-action of venetoclax, combinations or sequencing with other novel targeted agents should be investigated to further advance treatment of del(17p) chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

In addition, it has been shown that glutamate might facilitate the spread and growth of leukemia T cells through interactions with AMPA receptors. The aim of the present study was to investigate the modulation of cell cycle elicited by a novel 2,3-benzodiazepine-4-one non-competitive AMPA antagonist derivative in the human leukemia Jurkat T cells. Our results indicated that the 1-(4-amino-3,5-dimethylphenyl)-3,5-dihydro-7,8-ethylenedioxy-4h-2,3-benzodiazepin -4-one, named 1g, exerted a significant growth inhibition of leukemia Jurkat T cells in a time and dose dependent manner, arresting the transition of G2/M phase through activation of Myt-1. The molecule also induced apoptosis through the enhanced expression of the pro-apoptotic p53, and the inhibition of Bcl-2, and Bcl-xl, followed by the activation of caspase-3. The results suggested that compound 1g might act mostly as a cytostatic rather than cytotoxic compound. Although further studies are necessary, in order to identify others specific pathways involved in the activity of the present molecule, the presented results identified a novel molecule acting on specific G2/M checkpoint regulation pathway. Finally, our data suggest that compound 1g might be a good molecule for future development in the cancer research.","['Parenti, S', 'Casagrande, G', 'Montanari, M', 'Espahbodinia, M', 'Ettari, R', 'Grande, A', 'Corsi, L']","['Parenti S', 'Casagrande G', 'Montanari M', 'Espahbodinia M', 'Ettari R', 'Grande A', 'Corsi L']","['Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Via Campi 287, 41125 Modena, Italy.

Adoptive transfer of NK cells has been tested in multiple clinical trials including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and ovarian cancer, although limitations do exist especially for treatment of solid tumors. In order to overcome these limitations, mouse xenograft models are needed for evaluation of various NK cell populations, as well as routes of NK cell administration. Here, we describe the methods used for the establishment of an intraperitoneal (ip) ovarian cancer mouse xenograft model with ip delivery of NK cells. This model has been successfully employed with multiple ovarian cell lines and could be applied to other tumor models where the tumor's primary location is in the peritoneal cavity. It is also compatible with multiple routes of NK cell administration. Bioluminescent imaging for monitoring tumor formation and response provides for easy visualization of NK cell tumor inhibition. This xenograft model is superior to other models because the tumor is implanted into the same physiological space where ovarian cancer is found, which allows for improved mimicking of actual disease.","['Hermanson, David L', 'Bendzick, Laura', 'Kaufman, Dan S']","['Hermanson DL', 'Bendzick L', 'Kaufman DS']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota as institution, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota as institution, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California- San Diego, Sanford Consortium, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA. dskaufman@ucsd.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*transplantation', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Mice', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2016/05/15 06:00,2017/12/26 06:00,['2016/05/15 06:00'],"['2016/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/26 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2016;1441:277-84. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-3684-7_23.,10.1007/978-1-4939-3684-7_23 [doi],,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bioluminescent imaging', '*Immunotherapy', '*Mouse xenograft', '*Natural killer cells', '*Ovarian cancer']",,['10.1007/978-1-4939-3684-7_23 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We described the validation of antibodies, methods development and application of the assay. METHOD: We characterized and validated antibodies to BCL-2, BCL-XL , and MCL-1 in cell lines to confirm specificity for flow cytometry. Each protein was measured in a panel of leukemia/lymphoma cell lines and B-cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients treated with the BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitor navitoclax. The cellular activity of various BCL-2 family member inhibitors alone and in combination was determined to demonstrate utility of our assay to correlate protein levels with efficacy. RESULTS: We identified antibodies that were highly specific for each protein. The expression profile in cell lines as determined by molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome was comparable to western blot. Using our assay, BCL-2, BCL-XL , and MCL-1 protein levels were shown to correlate with response to BCL-2 family inhibitors in vitro and could be measured in clinical samples. CONCLUSIONS: This method can quantify BCL-2 family members in a specific, highly reproducible and sensitive fashion, and requires fewer cells compared to western blot. It is particularly useful for identifying BCL-2, BCL-XL , and MCL-1 protein levels in a specific cell population within a heterogeneous population like those collected from CLL patients. These data show that our QFCM method can be used to facilitate the quantification and evaluation of biomarkers predictive of response in patients treated with BCL-2 family member inhibitors.

However, mechanisms of action of alisertib, including the molecular pathways involved in alisertib-induced apoptosis and autophagy of leukemic cells, have remained elusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of alisertib on cell growth, apoptosis and autophagy and to delineate the possible molecular mechanisms in leukemic cells. Acid phosphatase, MTT and Annexin V/propidium iodide staining assays as well as immunostaining for light chain 3B showed that treatment of the REH leukemia cell line with alisertib exerted potent growth inhibitory effects, and induced apoptosis and autophagy in a dosedependent manner. Western blot analysis indicated that these effects may be attributed to the suppression of the activity of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin/5'-AMP-dependent kinase/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in REH cells. The present study confirmed that alisertib may represent a promising autophagy-inducing drug for the treatment of leukemia and shed light on its molecular mechanism of action.","['Fu, Yunfeng', 'Zhang, Yanan', 'Gao, Meng', 'Quan, Lingli', 'Gui, Rong', 'Liu, Jing']","['Fu Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Gao M', 'Quan L', 'Gui R', 'Liu J']","['The Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410013, P.R.

Two machine learning models, namely the support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) methods, were used for classification. Four datasets were downloaded from the European Bioinformatics Institute, two of which (containing 371 samples, including 281 FLT3/ITD mutation-negative and 90 mutationpositive samples) were randomly defined as the training group, while the other two datasets (containing 488 samples, including 350 FLT3/ITD mutation-negative and 138 mutation-positive samples) were defined as the test group. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by significance analysis of the microarray data by using the training samples. The classification efficiency of the SCM and RF methods was evaluated using the following parameters: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Functional enrichment analysis was performed for the feature genes with DAVID. A total of 585 DEGs were identified in the training group, of which 580 were upregulated and five were downregulated. The classification accuracy rates of the two methods for the training group, the test group and the combined group using the 585 feature genes were >90%. For the SVM and RF methods, the rates of correct determination, specificity and PPV were >90%, while the sensitivity and NPV were >80%. The SVM method produced a slightly better classification effect than the RF method. A total of 13 biological pathways were overrepresented by the feature genes, mainly involving energy metabolism, chromatin organization and translation.

Here, we present population level data on survival of patients with AML in Germany and the United States (US). Data were extracted from 11 population-based cancer registries in Germany and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER13) database in the US. Patients diagnosed with AML in 1997-2011 were included. Period analysis was used to estimate 5-year relative survival (RS) and trends in survival in the early 21st century. Overall 5-year age-adjusted RS for patients with AML in 2007-2011 was greater in Germany than in the US at 22.8% and 18.8%, respectively. Five-year RS was higher in Germany than in the US at all ages, with particularly large differences at ages 15-24 for whom 5-year RS was 64.3% in Germany and 55.0% in the US and 35-44, with 5-year RS estimates of 61.8% in Germany and 46.6% in the US. Most of the difference in 5-year RS was due to higher 1-year RS, with overall 1-year RS estimates of 47.0% in Germany and 38.5% in the US. A small increase in RS was observed between 2003-2005 and 2009-2011 in both countries, but no increase in survival was observed in either country for ages 75+.

It has been reported that Th17 cells as a newly identified subset of CD4(+) T cells are involved in the pathogenesis of several hematological disorders. However, the role of Th17 cells in the pathophysiology of B-ALL is still unclear. METHODS: The frequencies of T cells were determined by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood and bone marrow of 44 newly diagnosed B-ALL patients and 25 age-matched healthy donors. The cell viability and apoptosis were determined by CCK-8 assay and Annexin V staining, respectively. Western blot was applied to identify the level of Akt and Stat3 phosphorylation. RESULTS: We assessed and observed a significantly increased frequency of Th17 cells and a drastically decreased frequency of Th1 cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bone marrow mononuclear cells from newly diagnosed B-ALL patients compared with healthy donors. Furthermore, increased levels of Th17-related cytokines including IL-17, IL-21, IL-23, IL-1beta, and IL-6 were presented in between blood and marrow in B-ALL patients. Both IL-17A and IL-21, two Th17-secreted cytokines, induced the proliferation of B-ALL cell line Nalm-6 and patient B-ALL cells isolated from B-ALL patients, herein either cytokine led to the phosphorylation of Akt and Stat3. Additionally, IL-17A promoted resistance to daunorubicin via activation of Akt signaling and the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 or perifosine almost completely rescued daunorubicin-induced cell death in B-ALL cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that elevated Th17 cells secrete IL-17A by which promotes the proliferation and resistance to daunorubicin in B-ALL cells through activation of Akt signaling. Th17 cells may represent a novel target to improve B-ALL immunotherapy.","['Bi, Laixi', 'Wu, Junqing', 'Ye, Aifang', 'Wu, Jianbo', 'Yu, Kang', 'Zhang, Shenghui', 'Han, Yixiang']","['Bi L', 'Wu J', 'Ye A', 'Wu J', 'Yu K', 'Zhang S', 'Han Y']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325015, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325015, China.', 'Laboratory of Internal Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325015, China.', 'Laboratory of Internal Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325015, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325015, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325015, China. shenghuizhang1@126.com.', 'Laboratory of Internal Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325015, China. yxhan2001@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-17/*metabolism', 'Interleukins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Th1 Cells/immunology', 'Th17 Cells/drug effects/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",2016/05/14 06:00,2017/10/21 06:00,['2016/05/14 06:00'],"['2015/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2016 May 12;14(1):132. doi: 10.1186/s12967-016-0894-9.,10.1186/s12967-016-0894-9 [doi],20160512,"['0 (IL17A protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'MKM3CA6LT1 (interleukin-21)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",PMC4866013,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*IL-17A', '*Th1 cells', '*Th17 cells']",,"['10.1186/s12967-016-0894-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12967-016-0894-9 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, the survival of younger patients has increased due to improved management of the toxicity of therapies including stem cell transplantation. Older patients and those with infirmity that precludes treatment-intensification have, however, not benefited from improvements in supportive care and continue to experience poor outcomes. An increased understanding of the genomic heterogeneity of AML raises the possibility of treatment-stratification to improve prognosis. Thus, efforts to identify agents with non-conventional anti-leukemic effects have paralleled those aiming to optimize leukemia cell-kill with conventional chemotherapy, resulting in a number of randomized controlled trials (RCT). In the last 18 months, RCTs investigating the effects of vosaroxin, azacitidine and gemtuzumab ozogamycin and daunorubicin dose have been reported with some studies indicating a statistically significant survival benefit with the investigational agent compared with standard therapy and potentially, a new era in AML therapeutics. Given the increasing costs of cancer care, a review of these studies, with particular attention to the magnitude of clinical benefit with the newer agents would be useful, especially for physicians treating patients in single-payer health systems.","['Tauro, S']",['Tauro S'],"['Dundee Cancer Centre, Ninewells Hospital & Medical School, University of Dundee, Dundee, Scotland, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2016/05/14 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2016/05/14 06:00'],"['2016/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2016 May 13;6:e424. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2016.33.,10.1038/bcj.2016.33 [doi],20160513,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],PMC4916302,,,,"['bcj201633 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2016.33 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, transcriptome analysis or multiplex reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of 373 BCP-ALL patients without recurrent genetic abnormalities identified 29 patients with kinase fusions. Clinically, male predominance (male/female: 22/7), older age at onset (mean age at onset: 8.8 years) and a high white blood cell count at diagnosis (mean: 94 200/mul) reflected the predominance of National Cancer Institute high-risk (NCI-HR) patients (NCI-standard risk/HR: 8/21). Genetic analysis identified three patients with ABL1 rearrangements, eight with PDGFRB rearrangements, two with JAK2 rearrangements, three with IgH-EPOR and one with NCOR1-LYN. Of the 14 patients with CRLF2 rearrangements, two harbored IgH-EPOR and PDGFRB rearrangements. IKZF1 deletion was present in 16 of the 22 patients. The 5-year event-free and overall survival rates were 48.6+/-9.7% and 73.5+/-8.6%, respectively. The outcome was not satisfactory without sophisticated minimal residual disease-based stratification. Furthermore, the efficacy of TKIs combined with conventional chemotherapy without allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in this cohort should be determined.","['Imamura, T', 'Kiyokawa,

Four different approaches of mapping relative dose rates between humans and rodents are herein proposed and analyzed. Based on these mapping methods and volume averaging guidelines published by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNRP) in 2010, maximum and median induced field values for whole body and for tissues of children and rodents were evaluated and compared. Median induced electric fields in children younger than 10 years old are in the range 5.9-8.5 V/m per T (+/-0.4 dB). Maximum induced electric fields, generally in the skin, are between 48 V/m and 228 V/m per T (+/-4 dB). To achieve induced electric fields of comparable magnitude in rodents, external magnetic field must be increased by a factor of 4.0 (+/-2.6 dB) for rats and 7.4 (+/-1.8 dB) for mice. Meanwhile, to achieve comparable magnetic field dose in rodents, ratio is close to one.

However, neither its molecular mechanism nor its molecular targets are well understood. Thus, the aim of the present study was to explore the possibility that Manu A has cancer preventive and chemotherapeutic effects on malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) through regulation of Sp1 and induction of mitochondrial cell death pathway. Manu A inhibited the cell viability of MSTO-211H and H28 cells in a concentrationdependent manner as determined by MTS assay. IC50 values were calculated as 8.3 and 4.3 microM in the MSTO-311H and H28 cells following 48 h incubation, respectively. Manu A induced a significant increase in apoptotic indices as shown by DAPI staining, Annexin V assay, multi-caspase activity and mitochondrial membrane potential assay. The downregulation of Sp1 mRNA and protein expression by Manu A led to apoptosis by suppressing Sp1-regulated proteins (cyclin D1, Mcl-1 and survivin). Manu A decreased the protein levels of BID, Bcl-xL and PARP while it increased Bax levels. Manu A caused depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane with induction of CHOP, DR4 and DR5. Our results demonstrated that Manu A exerted anticancer effects by inducing apoptosis via inhibition of the Sp1-related signaling pathway in human MPM.","['Kim, Ka Hwi', 'Chae, Jung-Il', 'Oh, Hana', 'Cho, Jin Hyoung', 'Lee, Ra-Ham', 'Yoon, Goo', 'Cho, Seung-Sik', 'Cho, Young-Sik', 'Lee, Mee-Hyun', 'Liu, Kangdong', 'Lee, Hyun-Jeong', 'Shim, Jung-Hyun']","['Kim KH', 'Chae JI', 'Oh H', 'Cho JH', 'Lee RH', 'Yoon G', 'Cho SS', 'Cho YS', 'Lee MH', 'Liu K', 'Lee HJ', 'Shim JH']","['Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy and Natural Medicine Research Institute, Mokpo National University, Jeonnam 534-729, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Dental Pharmacology, School of Dentistry and Institute of Oral Bioscience, BK21 Plus, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju 651-756, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy and Natural Medicine Research Institute, Mokpo National University, Jeonnam 534-729, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Dental Pharmacology, School of Dentistry and Institute of Oral Bioscience, BK21 Plus, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju 651-756, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Dental Pharmacology, School of Dentistry and Institute of Oral Bioscience, BK21 Plus, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju 651-756, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy and Natural Medicine Research Institute, Mokpo National University, Jeonnam 534-729, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy and Natural Medicine Research Institute, Mokpo National University, Jeonnam 534-729, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Keimyung University, Dalseo-gu, Daegu 704-701, Republic of Korea.', 'The China-US (Henan) Hormel Cancer Institute, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, P.R.

The death ligand TRAIL (tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) and its selective tumour receptor system has attracted exceptional clinical interest. However, many malignancies including ALL are resistant to TRAIL monotherapy. Tumour resistance can be overcome by drug combination therapy. TRAIL and its agonist antibodies are currently undergoing phase II clinical trials with established chemotherapeutics. Herein, we present promising therapeutic benefits in combining TRAIL with the selective anti-leukaemic agents, the pyrrolo-1,5-benzoxazepines (PBOXs) for the treatment of ALL. PBOX-15 synergistically enhanced apoptosis induced by TRAIL and a DR5-selective TRAIL variant in ALL-derived cells. PBOX-15 enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis by dual activation of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. The specific caspase-8 inhibitor, Z-IETD-FMK, identified the extrinsic pathway as the principal mode of apoptosis. We demonstrate that PBOX-15 can enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis by upregulation of DR5, reduction of cellular mitochondrial potential, activation of the caspase cascade and downregulation of PI3K/Akt, c-FLIP, Mcl-1 and IAP survival pathways. Of note, the PI3K pathway inhibitor LY-294002 significantly enhanced the apoptotic potential of TRAIL and PBOX-15 validating the importance of Akt downregulation in the TRAIL/PBOX-15 synergistic combination. Considering the lack of cytotoxicity to normal cells and ability to downregulate several survival pathways, PBOX-15 may represent an effective agent for use in combination with TRAIL for the treatment of ALL.","['Nathwani, Seema-Maria', 'Greene, Lisa M', 'Butini, Stefania', 'Campiani, Giuseppe', 'Williams, D Clive', 'Samali, Afshin', 'Szegezdi, Eva', 'Zisterer, Daniela M']","['Nathwani SM', 'Greene LM', 'Butini S', 'Campiani G', 'Williams DC', 'Samali A', 'Szegezdi E', 'Zisterer DM']","['School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland.', 'School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland.', 'European Research Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'European Research Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, Bioscience Research Building, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, Bioscience Research Building, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland.', 'School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/biosynthesis', 'Caspase 8/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/biosynthesis', 'Oxazepines/*administration & dosage', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Pyrroles/*administration & dosage', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*administration & dosage/genetics']",2016/05/14 06:00,2017/03/31 06:00,['2016/05/14 06:00'],"['2016/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2016 Jul;49(1):74-88. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2016.3518.

Although the imaging features were highly suggestive of neurofibromatosis Type 2, the patient's history and clinical course were consistent with granulocytic sarcoma; repeat imaging and, later, needle biopsy definitively established the diagnosis of granulocytic sarcoma. Laminectomy and surgical decompression of the spine were not required and, arguably, could have posed unnecessary risk to the patient.

Saponin 6, derived from Anemone taipaiensis, exerts potent cytotoxic effects against the human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cell line and the human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cell line; however, the effects of saponin 6 on glioblastoma remain unknown. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of saponin 6 on human U87 malignant glioblastoma (U87 MG) cells. The current study revealed that saponin 6 induced U87 MG cell death in a dose and timedependent manner, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 2.83 microM after treatment for 48 h. However, saponin 6 was needed to be used at a lesser potency in HT22 cells, with an IC50 value of 6.24 microM. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry using Annexin Vfluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide double staining. DNA fragmentation and alterations in nuclear morphology were examined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated dUTP nick end labeling and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. The present study demonstrated that treatment with saponin 6 induced cell apoptosis in U87 MG cells, and resulted in DNA fragmentation and nuclear morphological alterations typical of apoptosis. In addition, flow cytometric analysis revealed that saponin 6 was able to induce cell cycle arrest. The present study also demonstrated that saponin 6induced apoptosis of U87 MG cells was attributed to increases in the protein expression levels of Fas, Fas ligand, and cleaved caspase3, 8 and 9, and decreases in the levels of Bcell lymphoma 2. The current study indicated that saponin 6 may exhibit selective cytotoxicity toward U87 MG cells by activating apoptosis via the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Therefore, saponin 6 derived from A. taipaiensis may possess therapeutic potential for the treatment of GBM.","['Ji, Chen-Chen', 'Tang, Hai-Feng', 'Hu, Yi-Yang', 'Zhang, Yun', 'Zheng, Min-Hua', 'Qin, Hong-Yan', 'Li, San-Zhong', 'Wang, Xiao-Yang', 'Fei, Zhou', 'Cheng, Guang']","['Ji CC', 'Tang HF', 'Hu YY', 'Zhang Y', 'Zheng MH', 'Qin HY', 'Li SZ', 'Wang XY', 'Fei Z', 'Cheng G']","[""Department of Neurosurgery, Xijing Institute of Clinical Neuroscience, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710032, P.R.

There is a growing body of evidence indicating that a small subpopulation of self-renewing cells, the so called cancer stem cells (CSC), are responsible for the growth of drug resistant secondary tumors. As many CSCs have upregulated the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway, preclinical and clinical studies are addressing the inhibition of this axis to target drug resistance. We evaluated the susceptibility of breast CSCs to NVP-BKM120 (BKM120), a new generation of PI3K-specific inhibitor, when used individually or in combination with trastuzumab or RAD001 both in vitro and in vivo. For this, a stem-like cell population (SC) was enriched from breast cancer cell lines after mammosphere cultures. We demonstrated that BKM120 inhibits growth, generation of drug-resistant derivatives and SC formation in a panel of four breast cancer cell lines: MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, SK-BR-3 and CAL51. Importantly, BKM120 inhibits the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway in SCs from these cell lines. When BKM120 was used in combination with trastuzumab, a targeted therapy to treat HER2-positive breast cancer, we found synergistic cell growth inhibition, generation of drug resistant cells as well as SC formation from SK-BR-3 cells. Importantly, SK-BR-3 xenograft-derived tumors showed marginal growth when the drug combination was used. We also found a similar synergistic anticancer effect of BKM120 in combination with RAD001, an mTOR inhibitor, when treating triple-negative breast cancer cells in vitro and in both MDA-MB-231 and CAL51- mouse xenografts. Moreover, mouse data indicate that these drug combinations are well tolerated and provide the proof-of-concept and rationale to initiate clinical trials in both HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer.","['Yu, Feng', 'Zhao, Jing', 'Hu, Yunhui', 'Zhou, Yang', 'Guo, Rong', 'Bai, Jingchao', 'Zhang, Sheng', 'Zhang, Huilai', 'Zhang, Jin']","['Yu F', 'Zhao J', 'Hu Y', 'Zhou Y', 'Guo R', 'Bai J', 'Zhang S', 'Zhang H', 'Zhang J']","['The Third Department of Breast Cancer, China Tianjin Breast Cancer Prevention, Treatment and Research Center, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Tianjin 300060, P.R.

An usual read-out for this transcriptional deregulation is the HOXA gene cluster, where upregulated HOXA genes are detected in MLL-r AML and ALL patients. In case of t(4;11) leukemia, this simple picture becomes challenged, because these patients separate into HOXAhi- and HOXAlo-patients. HOXAlo-patients showed a reduced HOXA gene transcription, but instead overexpressed the homeobox gene IRX1. This transcriptional pattern was associated with a higher relapse rate and worse outcome. Here, we demonstrate that IRX1 binds to the MLL-AF4 complex at target gene promotors and counteract its promotor activating function. In addition, IRX1 induces transcription of HOXB4 and EGR family members. HOXB4 is usually a downstream target of c-KIT, WNT and TPO signaling pathways and necessary for maintaining and expanding in hematopoietic stem cells. EGR proteins control a p21-dependent quiescence program for hematopoietic stem cells. Both IRX1-dependend actions may help t(4;11) leukemia cells to establish a stem cell compartment. We also demonstrate that HDACi administration is functionally interfering with IRX1 and MLL-AF4, a finding which could help to improve new treatment options for t(4;11) patients.","['Kuhn, Alessa', 'Loscher, Denise', 'Marschalek, Rolf']","['Kuhn A', 'Loscher D', 'Marschalek R']","['Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology/DCAL, Goethe-University of Frankfurt, Biocenter, D-60438 Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology/DCAL, Goethe-University of Frankfurt, Biocenter, D-60438 Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology/DCAL, Goethe-University of Frankfurt, Biocenter, D-60438 Frankfurt/Main, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']",2016/05/14 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2016/05/14 06:00'],"['2016/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jun 7;7(23):35341-52. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9241.,10.18632/oncotarget.9241 [doi],,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (IRX1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '157907-48-7 (HoxA protein)']",PMC5085233,['NOTNLM'],"['EGR1/2/3', 'HOXA profile', 'HOXB4', 'IRX1', 'MLL-r leukemia']",['We declare no conflicts of interest.'],"['9241 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9241 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We combined data from 6 existing North American juvenile-onset arthritis cohorts. Patients with juvenile-onset arthritis were linked to regional cancer registries to detect incident cancers after cohort entry, defined as first date seen in the paediatric rheumatology clinic. The expected number of malignancies was obtained by multiplying the person-years observed (defined from cohort entry to end of follow-up) by the geographically matched age, sex and calendar year-specific cancer rates. The standardised incidence ratios (SIR; ratio of cancers observed to expected) were generated, with 95% CIs. RESULTS: The 6 juvenile arthritis registries provided a total of 5294 patients. The mean age at cohort entry was 8.9 (SD 5.0) years and 68% of participants were female. The mean duration of follow-up was 6.8 years with a total of 36 063 person-years spanning 1978-2012. During follow-up, 9 invasive cancers occurred, compared with 10.9 expected (SIR 0.82, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.5). 3 of these were haematological (Hodgkin's, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukaemia). 6 of the patients with cancer were exposed to disease-modifying drugs; 5 of these had also been exposed to biological agents. CONCLUSIONS: We did not clearly demonstrate an increase in overall malignancy risk in patients with juvenile-onset arthritis followed for an average of almost 7 years. 3 of the 9 observed cancers were haematological. 5 of the cancers arose in children exposed to biological agents. Longer follow-up of this population is warranted, with further study of drug effects.","['Zahedi Niaki, Omid', 'Clarke, Ann E', 'Ramsey-Goldman, Rosalind', 'Yeung, Rae', 'Hayward, Kristen', 'Oen, Kiem', 'Duffy, Ciaran M', 'Rosenberg, Alan', ""O'Neil, Kathleen M"", 'von Scheven, Emily', 'Schanberg, Laura', 'Labrecque, Jeremy', 'Tse, Shirley M L', 'Hasija, Rachana', 'Lee, Jennifer L F', 'Bernatsky, Sasha']","['Zahedi Niaki O', 'Clarke AE', 'Ramsey-Goldman R', 'Yeung R', 'Hayward K', 'Oen K', 'Duffy CM', 'Rosenberg A', ""O'Neil KM"", 'von Scheven E', 'Schanberg L', 'Labrecque J', 'Tse SM', 'Hasija R', 'Lee JL', 'Bernatsky S']","['Department of Medicine , McGill University , Montreal, Quebec , Canada.', 'Department of Medicine , University of Calgary , Calgary, Alberta , Canada.', 'Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine , Chicago, Illinois , USA.', 'Division of Rheumatology , The Hospital for Sick Children , Toronto, Ontario , Canada.', ""Department of Rheumatology , Seattle Children's Hospital , Seattle, Washington , USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics , University of Manitoba , Winnipeg, Manitoba , Canada.', ""Department of Pediatrics , Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario , Ottawa, Ontario , Canada."", 'Department of Pediatrics , Royal University Hospital , Saskatoon, Saskatchewan , Canada.', 'Division of Pediatric Rheumatology , Riley Hospital for Children , Indianapolis, Indiana , USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Rheum San Francisco , University of California , San Francisco, California , USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics , Duke University Medical Center , Durham, North Carolina , USA.', 'Department of Medicine , McGill University , Montreal, Quebec , Canada.', 'Division of Rheumatology , The Hospital for Sick Children , Toronto, Ontario , Canada.', 'Division of Rheumatology , The Hospital for Sick Children , Toronto, Ontario , Canada.', 'Department of Medicine , McGill University , Montreal, Quebec , Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Division of Clinical Epidemiology, Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,RMD Open,RMD open,101662038,,,2016/05/14 06:00,2016/05/14 06:01,['2016/05/14 06:00'],"['2015/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/08 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/14 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,RMD Open. 2016 May 2;2(1):e000212. doi: 10.1136/rmdopen-2015-000212. eCollection 2016.,10.1136/rmdopen-2015-000212 [doi],20160502,,PMC4860862,['NOTNLM'],"['Arthritis', 'Epidemiology', 'Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis']",,"['10.1136/rmdopen-2015-000212 [doi]', 'rmdopen-2015-000212 [pii]']",,,['UL1 TR001422/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Minimal residual disease levels are generally lower when TKIs are used in combination with chemotherapy rather than as monotherapy. Although outcome has improved substantially with TKI-based regimens compared with historic controls, allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in first remission provides the best chance of cure for the majority of patients eligible for SCT. Administration of imatinib after SCT further reduces molecular recurrence and is associated with greatly improved relapse-free and overall survival. The high relapse rate in non-transplanted patients is largely attributable to the emergence of leukemic clones with mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of BCR-ABL. Ongoing studies with newer TKIs will determine whether these more potent agents are able to sustain remissions without SCT. Assessment of minimal residual disease has become an integral part of the management of Ph+ALL, as it has prognostic importance and is used to guide therapeutic intervention. Novel immunotherapeutic interventions and combinations of TKIs are currently being investigated in clinical trials and may further improve the prognosis of patients with Ph+ALL.","['Ottmann, O G']",['Ottmann OG'],"['Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Johann-Wolfgang Goethe University , Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Suppl,Leukemia supplements,101589153,,,2012/08/01 00:00,2012/08/01 00:01,['2016/05/14 06:00'],"['2016/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/01 00:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Leuk Suppl. 2012 Aug;1(Suppl 2):S7-9. doi: 10.1038/leusup.2012.7.

Mutations of SF3B1, a splicing factor that is a critical component of the spliceosome, recurrently associate with fludarabine-refractory CLL, occur at a low rate at CLL presentation and have a minor role in Richter transformation, corroborating the notion that CLL histological shift is molecularly distinct from chemorefractory progression without the Richter transformation.","['Rossi, D', 'Rasi, S', 'Spina, V', 'Bruscaggin, A', 'Monti, S', 'Cresta, S', 'Fama, R', 'Deambrogi, C', 'Greco, M', 'Fangazio, M', 'Ciardullo, C', 'Piranda, D', 'Casaluci, G M', 'Messina, M', 'Giudice, I D', 'Chiaretti, S', 'Marinelli, M', 'Guarini, A', 'Foa, R', 'Gaidano, G']","['Rossi D', 'Rasi S', 'Spina V', 'Bruscaggin A', 'Monti S', 'Cresta S', 'Fama R', 'Deambrogi C', 'Greco M', 'Fangazio M', 'Ciardullo C', 'Piranda D', 'Casaluci GM', 'Messina M', 'Giudice ID', 'Chiaretti S', 'Marinelli M', 'Guarini A', 'Foa R', 'Gaidano G']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont , Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont , Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont , Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont , Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont , Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont , Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont , Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont , Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont , Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont , Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont , Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont , Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont , Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University , Rome, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University , Rome, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University , Rome, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University , Rome, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University , Rome, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy; Fondazione Eleonora Lorillard Spencer Cenci, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont , Novara, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Suppl,Leukemia supplements,101589153,,,2012/08/01 00:00,2012/08/01 00:01,['2016/05/14 06:00'],"['2016/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/01 00:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Leuk Suppl. 2012 Aug;1(Suppl 2):S26-8. doi: 10.1038/leusup.2012.16.

CXCR4/CXCL12 interaction is crucially involved in recruitment and retention of leukemia-initiating cells within this niche. Various drugs targeting this pathway have entered clinical trials. To evaluate CXCR4 imaging in acute myeloid leukemia, we first tested CXCR4 expression in patient-derived primary blasts. Flow cytometry revealed that high blast counts in patients with acute myeloid leukemia correlate with high CXCR4 expression. The wide range of CXCR4 surface expression in patients was reflected in cell lines of acute myeloid leukemia. Next, we evaluated the CXCR4-specific peptide Pentixafor by positron emission tomography imaging in mice harboring CXCR4 positive and CXCR4 negative leukemia xenografts, and in 10 patients with active disease. [(68)Ga]Pentixafor-positron emission tomography showed specific measurable disease in murine CXCR4 positive xenografts, but not when CXCR4 was knocked out with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Five of 10 patients showed tracer uptake correlating well with leukemia infiltration assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. The mean maximal standard uptake value was significantly higher in visually CXCR4 positive patients compared to CXCR4 negative patients. In summary, in vivo molecular CXCR4 imaging by means of positron emission tomography is feasible in acute myeloid leukemia.

It generates phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate, which provides a membrane docking site for protein kinaseB activation. PI3K catalytic p110 subunits are divided into 4 isoforms; alpha,beta,delta and gamma. The PI3Kdelta isoform is always expressed in AML cells, whereas the frequency of PI3Kgamma expression is highly variable. The functions of these individual catalytic enzymes have not been fully resolved in AML, therefore using the PI3K p110delta and p110gamma-targeted inhibitor IPI-145 (duvelisib) and specific p110delta and p110gamma shRNA, we analysed the role of these two p110 subunits in human AML blast survival. The results show that PI3Kdelta and PI3Kgamma inhibition with IPI-145 has anti-proliferative activity in primary AML cells by inhibiting the activity of AKT and MAPK. Pre-treatment of AML cells with IPI-145 inhibits both adhesion and migration of AML blasts to bone marrow stromal cells. Using shRNA targeted to the individual isoforms we demonstrated that p110delta-knockdown had a more significant anti-proliferative effect on AML cells, whereas targeting p110gamma-knockdown significantly inhibited AML migration. The results demonstrate that targeting both PI3Kdelta and PI3Kgamma to inhibit AML-BMSC interactions provides a biologic rationale for the pre-clinical evaluation of IPI-145 in AML.","['Pillinger, Genevra', 'Loughran, Niamh V', 'Piddock, Rachel E', 'Shafat, Manar S', 'Zaitseva, Lyubov', 'Abdul-Aziz, Amina', 'Lawes, Matthew J', 'Bowles, Kristian M', 'Rushworth, Stuart A']","['Pillinger G', 'Loughran NV', 'Piddock RE', 'Shafat MS', 'Zaitseva L', 'Abdul-Aziz A', 'Lawes MJ', 'Bowles KM', 'Rushworth SA']","['Department of Molecular Haematology, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, NR4 7TJ, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular Haematology, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, NR4 7TJ, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular Haematology, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, NR4 7TJ, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular Haematology, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, NR4 7TJ, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular Haematology, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, NR4 7TJ, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular Haematology, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, NR4 7TJ, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Trust, Norwich, NR4 7UY, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular Haematology, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, NR4 7TJ, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Trust, Norwich, NR4 7UY, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular Haematology, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, NR4 7TJ, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Class Ib Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/*metabolism', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Treatment Outcome']",2016/10/26 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2016/05/14 06:00'],"['2015/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jun 28;7(26):39784-39795. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9289.,10.18632/oncotarget.9289 [doi],,"['0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '610V23S0JI (duvelisib)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class Ib Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CD protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CG protein, human)']",PMC5129970,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'PI3Kgamma', 'PI3Kdelta', 'bone marrow stromal cells', 'duvelisib']",['The authors declare no conflict of interest'],"['9289 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9289 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The acquired mutation in DDX41 is highly concentrated at c.G1574A (p.R525H) in the conserved motif VI located at the C-terminus of the helicase core domain where ATP interacts and is hydrolyzed. Therefore, it is likely that the p.R525H mutation perturbs ATPase activity in a dominant-negative manner. In this study, we screened for the DDX41 mutation of CD34-positive tumor cells based on mRNA sequencing and identified the p.R525H mutation in three cases among 23 patients. Intriguingly, these patients commonly exhibited acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with peripheral blood cytopenias and low blast counts, suggesting that the mutation inhibits the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Data from cord blood cells and leukemia cell lines suggest a role for DDX41 in preribosomal RNA processing, in which the expression of the p.R525H mutant causes a certain ribosomopathy phenotype in hematopoietic cells by suppressing MDM2-mediated RB degradation, thus triggering the inhibition of E2F activity. This study uncovered a pathogenic role of p.R525H DDX41 in the slow growth rate of tumor cells. Age-dependent epigenetic alterations or other somatic changes might collaborate with the mutation to cause AML.","['Kadono, Moe', 'Kanai, Akinori', 'Nagamachi, Akiko', 'Shinriki, Satoru', 'Kawata, Jin', 'Iwato, Koji', 'Kyo, Taiichi', 'Oshima, Kumi', 'Yokoyama, Akihiko', 'Kawamura, Takeshi', 'Nagase, Reina', 'Inoue, Daichi', 'Kitamura, Toshio', 'Inaba, Toshiya', 'Ichinohe, Tatsuo', 'Matsui, Hirotaka']","['Kadono M', 'Kanai A', 'Nagamachi A', 'Shinriki S', 'Kawata J', 'Iwato K', 'Kyo T', 'Oshima K', 'Yokoyama A', 'Kawamura T', 'Nagase R', 'Inoue D', 'Kitamura T', 'Inaba T', 'Ichinohe T', 'Matsui H']","['Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan; Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Laboratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Central Clinical Laboratory, Kumamoto University Hospital, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Central Clinical Laboratory, Kumamoto University Hospital, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital & Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital & Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Laboratory for Malignancy Control Research, Medical Innovation Center, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Medicine, Laboratory for System Biology and Medicine (LSBM), Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology (RCAST), University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.

A significant proportion of NS patients may also develop myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), including juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML). Surprisingly, scarce information is available in relation to other tumour types in these patients. We have previously developed and characterized a knock-in mouse model that carries one of the most frequent KRAS-NS-related mutations, the K-Ras(V14I) substitution, which recapitulates most of the alterations described in NS patients, including MPDs. The K-Ras(V14I) mutation is a mild activating K-Ras protein; thus, we have used this model to study tumour susceptibility in comparison with mice expressing the classical K-Ras(G12V) oncogene. Interestingly, our studies have shown that these mice display a generalized tumour predisposition and not just MPDs. In fact, we have observed that the K-Ras(V14I) mutation is capable of cooperating with the p16Ink4a/p19Arf and Trp53 tumour suppressors, as well as with other risk factors such as pancreatitis, thereby leading to a higher cancer incidence. In conclusion, our results illustrate that the K-Ras(V14I) activating protein is able to induce cancer, although at a much lower level than the classical K-Ras(G12V) oncogene, and that it can be significantly modulated by both genetic and non-genetic events.

The HLA-DRB1*14, specifically DRB1*14:21, 14:22, 14:45, 14:26, 14:33, 14:51, 14:35 subtypes was the most frequent in CML Venezuelan patients. OBJECTIVES: It is interesting to evaluate the molecular mimicry between the Adenovirus and the DRB1*14 subtypes which exhibit the same change in the amino acid position of the DR53 epitope. This mimicked segment has been identified as a LLERRRA polypeptide. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Experimental research conducted in the IHO Venezuela, in peripheral blood samples of patients with ALL, CML and healthy controls. Mixed culture, serology, lymphocyte proliferation and cytofluorometry were performed. RESULTS: DRB1*14 patient's lymphocytes reacted in 48 hours mixed culture against DRB1*14 promoters lymphocytes exhibiting increased CD8+T lymphocytes. CML patients show a different serological profile against Adenovirus. Only CML patients reacted to LLERRRA peptide, increasing CD8+ T cells. CONCLUSION: It is established that the relationship CML, HLADRB1* 14, autoreactive CD8+ T memory cell and CD8+T specific response from Adenovirus could be at the origin of the CML in Venezuelan patients.","['Rivera, Sergio E', 'Echeverria, Miriam', 'Salcedo, Pedro', 'Marquez, Georgina', 'Carrillo, Zuhey', 'Parra, Yennis', 'Cipriani, Ana Maria', 'Nunez, Jose R', 'Alvarez de Mon, Melchor', 'Farruco, Atilio']","['Rivera SE', 'Echeverria M', 'Salcedo P', 'Marquez G', 'Carrillo Z', 'Parra Y', 'Cipriani AM', 'Nunez JR', 'Alvarez de Mon M', 'Farruco A']","['Universidad del Zulia, Maracaibo, Venezuela. sergio.rivera54@hotmail.es.']",['spa'],['Journal Article'],Mexico,Rev Alerg Mex,"Revista alergia Mexico (Tecamachalco, Puebla, Mexico : 1993)",9438824,IM,"['Adenoviridae Infections/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'HLA-DRB1 Chains/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/virology', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Venezuela']",2016/05/14 06:00,2018/10/20 06:00,['2016/05/14 06:00'],"['2016/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Rev Alerg Mex. 2016 Apr-Jun;63(2):163-8. doi: 10.29262/ram.v63i2.149.,,,['0 (HLA-DRB1 Chains)'],,['NOTNLM'],"['*HLA association and disease', '*TCD4+', '*adenovirus', '*leukemias']",,['10.29262/ram.v63i2.149 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,Linfocitos TCD8+ autorreactivos en pacientes con leucemia mieloide cronica en asociacion con HLA e infeccion con adenovirus.,,,,,,,,,

Mutations were detected in 14/51 idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome patients (idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome/next-generation sequencing-positive) (28%), involving single gene in 7 and >/=2 in 7 patients. The more frequently mutated genes included ASXL1 (43%), TET2 (36%), EZH2 (29%), SETBP1 (22%), CBL (14%), and NOTCH1 (14%). Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome/next-generation sequencing-positive patients showed a number of clinical features and bone marrow findings resembling chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified. Chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified patients showed a disease-specific survival of 14.4 months, markedly inferior to idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome/next-generation sequencing-negative (P<0.001), but not significantly different from idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome/next-generation sequencing-positive (P=0.117). These data suggest that targeted next-generation sequencing helps to establish clonality in a subset of patients with hypereosinophilia that would otherwise be classified as idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. In conjunction with other diagnostic features, mutation data can be used to establish a diagnosis of chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified in patients presenting with hypereosinophilia.","['Wang, Sa A', 'Tam, Wayne', 'Tsai, Albert G', 'Arber, Daniel A', 'Hasserjian, Robert P', 'Geyer, Julia T', 'George, Tracy I', 'Czuchlewski, David R', 'Foucar, Kathryn', 'Rogers, Heesun J', 'Hsi, Eric D', 'Bryan Rea, B', 'Bagg, Adam', 'Dal Cin, Paola', 'Zhao, Chong', 'Kelley, Todd W', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Orazi, Attilio']","['Wang SA', 'Tam W', 'Tsai AG', 'Arber DA', 'Hasserjian RP', 'Geyer JT', 'George TI', 'Czuchlewski DR', 'Foucar K', 'Rogers HJ', 'Hsi ED', 'Bryan Rea B', 'Bagg A', 'Dal Cin P', 'Zhao C', 'Kelley TW', 'Verstovsek S', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Orazi A']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*genetics/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'United States', 'Young Adult']",2016/05/14 06:00,2018/01/24 06:00,['2016/05/14 06:00'],"['2016/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/07 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2016 Aug;29(8):854-64. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2016.75.

Strikingly, these mutations (except RAS/NF1) were mutually exclusive, suggesting that they each cause the aberrant activation of a common downstream target. Expressing these mutant signaling molecules-but not their wild-type counterparts-rendered Ba/F3 cells independent of IL3 by activating the RAS-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT pathways. Interestingly, cells expressing either IL7Ra or JAK mutants are sensitive to JAK inhibitors, but respond less robustly to inhibitors of the downstream RAS-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways, indicating that inhibiting only one downstream pathway is not sufficient. Here, we show that inhibiting both the MEK and PI3K-AKT pathways synergistically prevents the proliferation of BaF3 cells expressing mutant IL7Ra, JAK and RAS. Furthermore, combined inhibition of MEK and PI3K/AKT was cytotoxic to samples obtained from 6 out of 11 primary T-ALL patients, including 1 patient who had no mutations in the IL7R signaling pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that the potent cytotoxic effects of inhibiting both MEK and PI3K/AKT should be investigated further as a therapeutic option using leukemia xenograft models.","['Cante-Barrett, K', 'Spijkers-Hagelstein, J A P', 'Buijs-Gladdines, J G C A M', 'Uitdehaag, J C M', 'Smits, W K', 'van der Zwet, J', 'Buijsman, R C', 'Zaman, G J R', 'Pieters, R', 'Meijerink, J P P']","['Cante-Barrett K', 'Spijkers-Hagelstein JA', 'Buijs-Gladdines JG', 'Uitdehaag JC', 'Smits WK', 'van der Zwet J', 'Buijsman RC', 'Zaman GJ', 'Pieters R', 'Meijerink JP']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC Rotterdam-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Netherlands Translational Research Center B.V., Oss, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC Rotterdam-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Netherlands Translational Research Center B.V., Oss, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC Rotterdam-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC Rotterdam-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Netherlands Translational Research Center B.V., Oss, The Netherlands.', 'Netherlands Translational Research Center B.V., Oss, The Netherlands.', 'The Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC Rotterdam-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2016/05/14 06:00,2017/08/30 06:00,['2016/05/14 06:00'],"['2015/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/02 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Sep;30(9):1832-43. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.83.

The aim of this study is to find out if the extent of proliferation centers or the immunohistochemical expression of p53 is related to disease prognosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the scope of this study, 54 biopsy specimens from 51 patients (50 of lymph nodes; the others of spleen, tonsil, orbit, and liver) diagnosed with CLL at the Hacettepe University Department of Pathology in 2000-2013 were reevaluated. The clinical and demographic data of the patients were obtained from our patient database. Biopsy samples were assessed semi-quantitatively for the percentage of proliferation center/total biopsy area (PC/TBA) and an immunohistochemical study was performed on representative blocks of tissues for p53 expression. RESULTS: When the patients were divided into two categories according to Rai stage as high and low (stages 0, 1, and 2 vs. stages 3 and 4), it was seen that patients with low Rai stage had a better prognosis than those with high stages (p=0.030). However, there was no statistically significant correlation between overall survival and PC/TBA ratio or p53 expression levels. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, PC/TBA ratio and immunopositivity of p53 did not show correlations with overall survival.","['Kulac, Ibrahim', 'Demir, Cetin', 'Buyukasik, Yahya', 'Kutluk, Tezer', 'Uner, Aysegul']","['Kulac I', 'Demir C', 'Buyukasik Y', 'Kutluk T', 'Uner A']","['Johns Hopkins University Faculty of Medicine, Baltimore, USA Phone: +1 410 502 7354 E-mail: dribrahimkulac@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",2016/05/14 06:00,2017/04/11 06:00,['2016/05/14 06:00'],"['2016/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2017 Mar 1;34(1):34-39. doi: 10.4274/tjh.2016.0115.

The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is involved in regulation of proliferation, survival and trafficking of hematopoietic stem cells, including B lymphocytes and disruption within this signaling pathway has been implicated in pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The aim of this study was to determine a potential association of the CXCL12 rs1801157 G > A polymorphism with susceptibility to CLL, the disease course and efficacy of therapy. Also, expression of the CD74 and CD38 proteins on B cells was analyzed in relation to clinical parameters and genotyping results. A total of 124 patients with CLL and 75 healthy controls were studied. CXCL12 genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The CD74 and CD38 surface expression was determined using flow cytometry. There was a significantly increased frequency of the A allele and AA genotype in CLL patients compared with control group (P < 0.001 in both cases). In addition, the A allele was overrepresented among patients with worse response to therapy in comparison to other genotypes (P < 0.001). On the contrary, patients carrying the A allele displayed lower grade of the disease at diagnosis more frequently than patients homozygous for the G allele (P = 0.037). Moreover, the AA homozygosity correlated with lower CD74 expression on B cells (P = 0.007).

PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched to identify relevant studies from their inception to June 2015. Pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated using fixed- or random-effect models. A total of 6 case-control studies containing 1432 patients and 2750 controls were used in this meta-analysis, and our results showed no association between the 135G/C polymorphism in the RAD51 gene and AML risk (CC vs GG: OR = 1.67, 95%CI = 0.93-3.02; GC vs GG: OR = 1.24, 95%CI = 0.80-1.92; the dominant model: OR = 1.26, 95%CI = 0.83-1.91; the recessive model: OR = 1.63, 95%CI = 0.90-2.95).

A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to all members of French and Australian patients' national MDS associations. Data of 301 patients were analysed. Patients were satisfied with the information they had received, but 33.2% did not know that they had an increased risk of developing AML. Younger age, higher-risk MDS treatment, preferences for health-related information and satisfaction with information provided about treatment were the factors independently associated with awareness of AML risk. Compared to unaware patients, patients knowing their risk were more likely to participate in a hypothetical clinical trial (83.0% vs 72.4%, p=0.043). More efforts are needed to provide more systematic information about AML risk to patients wishing to know it. More research is needed to study if increasing awareness can lead to more active engagement of MDS patients in their care and can increase the rate of clinical trial participation.","['Ousseine, Youssoufa M', 'Butow, Phyllis N', 'Julian-Reynier, Claire', 'Dring, Rebecca', 'Festy, Patrick', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Mancini, Julien']","['Ousseine YM', 'Butow PN', 'Julian-Reynier C', 'Dring R', 'Festy P', 'Fenaux P', 'Vey N', 'Mancini J']","['Aix-Marseille Universite, Inserm, IRD, UMR912, SESSTIM, ""Cancers, Biomedicine & Society"" group, Marseille F-13273 France.', 'Psycho-Oncology Co-operative Research Group (PoCoG) and Centre for Medical Psychology and Evidence-based Decision-making (CeMPED), University of Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.', 'Aix-Marseille Universite, Inserm, IRD, UMR912, SESSTIM, ""Cancers, Biomedicine & Society"" group, Marseille F-13273 France; Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille F-13273 France.', 'Leukaemia Foundation of Australia, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Connaitre et Combattre les Myelodysplasies, Paris, France.', ""AP-HP, Hopital Saint-Louis, Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Groupe Francophone des Myelodysplasies (GFM), Paris, France; Paris 7 University, Paris, France."", 'Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille F-13273 France; Aix-Marseille Universite, Inserm, CNRS, UM105, CRCM, Marseille F-13273, France.', 'Aix-Marseille Universite, Inserm, IRD, UMR912, SESSTIM, ""Cancers, Biomedicine & Society"" group, Marseille F-13273 France; APHM, Timone Hospital, Public Health Department (BioSTIC), Marseille F-13385, France.

In this study, we analysed 50 ALL cases by both methods in two phases: in the first, we established analytical parameters to investigate the applicability of this new technique; in the second, we analysed MRD levels in 141 follow-up (FU) samples to investigate the possible use of ddPCR for MRD monitoring in ALL patients. We documented that ddPCR has sensitivity and accuracy at least comparable to those of RQ-PCR. Overall, the two methods gave concordant results in 124 of the 141 analysed MRD samples (88%, P = 0.94). Discordant results were found in 12% borderline cases.

This study sought to determine the efficacy of an intensified, multi-agent approach derived from a Dana-Farber consortium trial in younger adults for patients older than 50 years (trial identifier NCT00973752). METHODS: The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) at 1 year. Patients received induction chemotherapy with vincristine, prednisone, doxorubicin, and pegylated asparaginase. Imatinib was incorporated for Philadelphia chromosome-positive disease. After induction, the first consolidation incorporated clofarabine. Patients in remission could proceed to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) after induction and consolidation I. Those not receiving HCT went on to receive central nervous system, consolidation II, and continuation phases of treatment. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled: 19 achieved a complete remission (CR) after induction and 1 achieved CR after consolidation I for a CR rate of 67%. Sixteen patients underwent HCT. The proportion surviving at 1 year was 63%, and this met the primary endpoint. The 2-year OS rate was 52% (n = 30), and the 2-year disease-free survival rate was 52% for patients achieving CR (n = 20). There was no survival advantage among those undergoing HCT. Therapy-related hyperbilirubinemia prompted adjustments and limitations to asparaginase dosing. CONCLUSIONS: Intensified chemotherapy can result in improved outcomes in comparison with historical data. Additional studies of similarly intensive regimens are warranted in this population.

Our previous study indicates that long-chain fatty acyl-Co A synthetase (ACSL) 3 is essential for lipid upregulation induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress. In this report, we aimed to identify the role of ACSL family in cancer with systematic analysis and in vitro experiment. We explored the ACSL expression using Oncomine database to determine the gene alteration during carcinogenesis and identified the association between ACSL expression and the survival of cancer patient using PrognoScan database. ACSL1 may play a potential oncogenic role in colorectal and breast cancer and play a potential tumor suppressor role in lung cancer. Co-expression analysis revealed that ACSL1 was coexpressed with MYBPH, PTPRE, PFKFB3, SOCS3 in colon cancer and with LRRFIP1, TSC22D1 in lung cancer. In accordance with PrognoScan analysis, downregulation of ACSL1 in colon and breast cancer cell line inhibited proliferation, migration, and anchorage-independent growth. In contrast, increase of oncogenic property was observed in lung cancer cell line by attenuating ACSL1. High ACSL3 expression predicted a better prognosis in ovarian cancer; in contrast, high ACSL3 predicted a worse prognosis in melanoma. ACSL3 was coexpressed with SNUPN, TRIP13, and SEMA5A in melanoma. High expression of ACSL4 predicted a worse prognosis in colorectal cancer, but predicted better prognosis in breast, brain and lung cancer. ACSL4 was coexpressed with SERPIN2, HNRNPCL1, ITIH2, PROCR, LRRFIP1. High expression of ACSL5 predicted good prognosis in breast, ovarian, and lung cancers. ACSL5 was coexpressed with TMEM140, TAPBPL, BIRC3, PTPRE, and SERPINB1. Low ACSL6 predicted a worse prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia. ACSL6 was coexpressed with SOX6 and DARC. Altogether, different members of ACSLs are implicated in diverse types of cancer development. ACSL-coexpressed molecules may be used to further investigate the role of ACSL family in individual type of cancers.","['Chen, Wei-Ching', 'Wang, Chih-Yang', 'Hung, Yu-Hsuan', 'Weng, Tzu-Yang', 'Yen, Meng-Chi', 'Lai, Ming-Derg']","['Chen WC', 'Wang CY', 'Hung YH', 'Weng TY', 'Yen MC', 'Lai MD']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Center for Infectious Diseases and Signaling Research, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coenzyme A Ligases/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",2016/05/14 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2016/05/13 06:00'],"['2016/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 May 12;11(5):e0155660. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0155660. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0155660 [doi],20160512,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 6.2.1.- (Coenzyme A Ligases)', 'EC 6.2.1.3 (long-chain-fatty-acid-CoA ligase)']",PMC4865206,,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0155660 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-06652 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One technique is to leverage curated datasets found in the public domain. The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD; http://ctdbase.org/) manually curates chemical-gene, chemical-disease, and gene-disease interactions from the scientific literature. The use of official gene symbols in CTD interactions enables this information to be combined with the Gene Ontology (GO) file from NCBI Gene. By integrating these GO-gene annotations with CTD's gene-disease dataset, we produce 753,000 inferences between 15,700 GO terms and 4,200 diseases, providing opportunities to explore presumptive molecular underpinnings of diseases and identify biological similarities. Through a variety of applications, we demonstrate the utility of this novel resource. As a proof-of-concept, we first analyze known repositioned drugs (e.g., raloxifene and sildenafil) and see that their target diseases have a greater degree of similarity when comparing GO terms vs. genes. Next, a computational analysis predicts seemingly non-intuitive diseases (e.g., stomach ulcers and atherosclerosis) as being similar to bipolar disorder, and these are validated in the literature as reported co-diseases. Additionally, we leverage other CTD content to develop testable hypotheses about thalidomide-gene networks to treat seemingly disparate diseases. Finally, we illustrate how CTD tools can rank a series of drugs as potential candidates for repositioning against B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and predict cisplatin and the small molecule inhibitor JQ1 as lead compounds. The CTD dataset is freely available for users to navigate pathologies within the context of extensive biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components conferred by GO. This inference set should aid researchers, bioinformaticists, and pharmaceutical drug makers in finding commonalities in disease mechanisms, which in turn could help identify new therapeutics, new indications for existing pharmaceuticals, potential disease comorbidities, and alerts for side effects.","['Davis, Allan Peter', 'Wiegers, Thomas C', 'King, Benjamin L', 'Wiegers, Jolene', 'Grondin, Cynthia J', 'Sciaky, Daniela', 'Johnson, Robin J', 'Mattingly, Carolyn J']","['Davis AP', 'Wiegers TC', 'King BL', 'Wiegers J', 'Grondin CJ', 'Sciaky D', 'Johnson RJ', 'Mattingly CJ']","['Department of Biological Sciences, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, Salisbury Cove, Maine, United States of America.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Center for Human Health and the Environment, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Computational Biology', '*Databases, Genetic', 'Disease/*genetics', 'Drug Repositioning', '*Gene Ontology', 'Humans', '*Toxicogenetics']",2016/05/14 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2016/05/13 06:00'],"['2016/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 May 12;11(5):e0155530. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0155530. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0155530 [doi],20160512,,PMC4865041,,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0155530 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-00748 [pii]']",,,"['P30 ES025128/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES023788/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM104318/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES019604/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM103423/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES014065/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, few studies have investigated adult sexual functioning in these survivors. METHODS: The authors studied 52 male survivors of childhood ALL at a median age of 28.5 years (range, 25-38 years) >/= 10 years after diagnosis. In addition, 56 men without a history of cancer were recruited for an age-matched control group. The participants completed the Derogatis Interview for Sexual Functioning self-report. To analyze predictive factors for sexual dysfunction, variables assessing sociodemographic background, antileukemia treatment, testicular size, laboratory variables from current serum and semen samples, self-reported depressive symptoms, and self-reported physical functioning were included in multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: ALL survivors had significantly poorer sexual functioning, as measured by the Derogatis Interview for Sexual Functioning self-report, compared with the control group. Survivors had a similar frequency of sexual fantasies, autoerotic acts, and full erection during these activities as the control group, but they had less frequent sexual activity with a sexual partner, poorer self-rated orgasms, and lower satisfaction with their sex life. Predictive factors for poorer sexual functioning were depressive symptoms, the absence of a relationship, and, to a lesser extent, testicular size as an indication of gonadal damage from childhood antileukemia therapy. Older survivors experienced a deeper decline in sexual functioning compared with men in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Decline in sexual functioning at an early adult age can be regarded as 1 of the late effects of childhood cancer. Monitoring these survivors' sexual health is indicated.

CMI has many advantages over Pearson correlation coefficient in measuring non-linear dependence to infer gene regulatory networks. It can also discriminate the direct regulations from indirect ones. However, it is still a challenge to select the conditional genes in an optimal way, which affects the performance and computation complexity of the PC algorithm. In this study, we develop a novel conditional mutual information-based algorithm, namely RPNI (Regulation Pattern based Network Inference), to infer gene regulatory networks. For conditional gene selection, we define the co-regulation pattern, indirect-regulation pattern and mixture-regulation pattern as three candidate patterns to guide the selection of candidate genes. To demonstrate the potential of our algorithm, we apply it to gene expression data from DREAM challenge. Experimental results show that RPNI outperforms existing conditional mutual information-based methods in both accuracy and time complexity for different sizes of gene samples. Furthermore, the robustness of our algorithm is demonstrated by noisy interference analysis using different types of noise.","['Xiao, Fei', 'Gao, Lin', 'Ye, Yusen', 'Hu, Yuxuan', 'He, Ruijie']","['Xiao F', 'Gao L', 'Ye Y', 'Hu Y', 'He R']","[""School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710071, China."", ""School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710071, China."", ""School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710071, China."", ""School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710071, China."", ""School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710071, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Computer Simulation', 'Databases, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', '*Genetic Association Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'ROC Curve', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics']",2016/05/14 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2016/05/13 06:00'],"['2015/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 May 12;11(5):e0154953. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0154953. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0154953 [doi],20160512,,PMC4865039,,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0154953 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-48977 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study included all mitoxantrone-treated patients with multiple sclerosis seen at our department between 1994 and 2007. We collected follow-up information on medically confirmed malignancies, life status, and cause of death, as of 2010. Malignancy rates were compared to the German national cancer registry matched for sex, age, and year of occurrence. RESULTS: Follow-up was completed in 676 of 677 identified patients. Median follow-up time was 8.7 years (interquartile range 6.8-11.2), corresponding to 6,220 person-years. Median cumulative mitoxantrone dose was 79.0 mg/m(2) (interquartile range 50.8-102.4). Thirty-seven patients (5.5%) were diagnosed with a malignancy after mitoxantrone initiation, revealing a standardized incidence ratio of 1.50 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-2.08). Entities included breast cancer (n = 9), colorectal cancer (n = 7), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 4, 0.6%), and others (each entity n = 1 or 2). The standardized incidence ratio of colorectal cancer was 2.98 (95% CI 1.20-6.14) and of acute myeloid leukemia 10.44 (95% CI 3.39-24.36). It was not increased for other entities including breast cancer. Multivariate Cox regression identified higher age at treatment initiation but neither cumulative mitoxantrone dose (>75 vs </=75 mg/m(2)) nor treatment with other immunosuppressive drugs or sex as a risk factor. Fifty-five patients had died, among them 12 of a malignancy and 43 reportedly of other causes. CONCLUSIONS: While the overall incidence of malignancies was only mildly increased, the risk of leukemia and colorectal cancer was heightened. If confirmed, posttherapy colonoscopy could become advisable.","['Buttmann, Mathias', 'Seuffert, Linda', 'Mader, Uwe', 'Toyka, Klaus V']","['Buttmann M', 'Seuffert L', 'Mader U', 'Toyka KV']","['From the Department of Neurology (M.B., L.S., K.V.T.) and the Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken (U.M.), University of Wurzburg, Germany. m.buttmann@uni-wuerzburg.de.', 'From the Department of Neurology (M.B., L.S., K.V.T.) and the Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken (U.M.), University of Wurzburg, Germany.', 'From the Department of Neurology (M.B., L.S., K.V.T.) and the Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken (U.M.), University of Wurzburg, Germany.', 'From the Department of Neurology (M.B., L.S., K.V.T.) and the Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken (U.M.), University of Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",United States,Neurology,Neurology,0401060,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",2016/05/14 06:00,2017/05/10 06:00,['2016/05/13 06:00'],"['2015/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Neurology. 2016 Jun 7;86(23):2203-7. doi: 10.1212/WNL.0000000000002745.

However, whether this vaccine induces humoral immune responses to produce WT1 antibody remains unknown. Thus, we measured IgG antibody levels against the WT1-235 peptide (WT1-235 IgG antibody) in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) receiving the WT1 peptide vaccine. The WT1-235 IgG antibody, which was undetectable before vaccination, became detectable in 30 (50.8%) of a total of 59 patients during 3 months of WT1 peptide vaccination. The dominant WT1-235 IgG antibody subclass was Th1-type, IgG1 and IgG3 . WT1-235 IgG antibody production was significantly and positively correlated with both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Importantly, the combination of WT1-235 IgG antibody production and positive delayed type-hypersensitivity (DTH) to the WT1-235 peptide was a better prognostic marker for long-term OS than either parameter alone. These results suggested that WT1-235 peptide vaccination induces not only WT1-235-specific CTLs as previously described but also WT1-235-specific humoral immune responses associated with antitumor cellular immune response. Our results indicate that the WT1 IgG antibody against the WT1 peptide may be a useful predictive marker, with better predictive performance in combination with DTH to WT1 peptide, and provide a new insight into the antitumor immune response induction in WT1 peptide vaccine-treated patients.","['Oji, Yusuke', 'Hashimoto, Naoya', 'Tsuboi, Akihiro', 'Murakami, Yui', 'Iwai, Miki', 'Kagawa, Naoki', 'Chiba, Yasuyoshi', 'Izumoto, Shuichi', 'Elisseeva, Olga', 'Ichinohasama, Ryo', 'Sakamoto, Junichi', 'Morita, Satoshi', 'Nakajima, Hiroko', 'Takashima, Satoshi', 'Nakae, Yoshiki', 'Nakata, Jun', 'Kawakami, Manabu', 'Nishida, Sumiyuki', 'Hosen, Naoki', 'Fujiki, Fumihiro', 'Morimoto, Soyoko', 'Adachi, Mayuko', 'Iwamoto, Masahiro', 'Oka, Yoshihiro', 'Yoshimine, Toshiki', 'Sugiyama, Haruo']","['Oji Y', 'Hashimoto N', 'Tsuboi A', 'Murakami Y', 'Iwai M', 'Kagawa N', 'Chiba Y', 'Izumoto S', 'Elisseeva O', 'Ichinohasama R', 'Sakamoto J', 'Morita S', 'Nakajima H', 'Takashima S', 'Nakae Y', 'Nakata J', 'Kawakami M', 'Nishida S', 'Hosen N', 'Fujiki F', 'Morimoto S', 'Adachi M', 'Iwamoto M', 'Oka Y', 'Yoshimine T', 'Sugiyama H']","['Department of Cancer Stem Cell Biology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunotherapy, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Stem Cell Biology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Stem Cell Biology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Kinki University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Cell Signal Unit, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tohoku University, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Tokai Central Hospital, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Biomedical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Respiratory Medicine and Allergy, Rheumatic Disease, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Respiratory Medicine and Allergy, Rheumatic Disease, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunotherapy, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunotherapy, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Respiratory Medicine and Allergy, Rheumatic Disease, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Stem Cell Biology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Stem Cell Biology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Stem Cell Biology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Respiratory Medicine and Allergy, Rheumatic Disease, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Immunopathology, Immunology Frontier Research Center (World Premier International Research Center), Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers', 'Cancer Vaccines/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Glioblastoma/*immunology/*mortality/therapy', 'HLA-A24 Antigen/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood/*immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptides/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/metabolism', 'Th1 Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vaccination', 'WT1 Proteins/chemistry/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",2016/05/14 06:00,2017/04/30 06:00,['2016/05/13 06:00'],"['2015/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/20 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2016 Sep 15;139(6):1391-401. doi: 10.1002/ijc.30182.

The European Canine Lymphoma Network (ECLN) is an international cooperation of different institutions working on canine lymphoma diagnosis and therapy. The ECLN panel of experts on FC has defined the issue of reporting FC on canine lymphoma and leukemia as their first hot topic, since a standardized report that includes all the important information is still lacking in veterinary medicine. METHODS: The flow cytometry panel of the ECLN started a consensus initiative using the Delphi approach. Clinicians were considered the main target of FC reports. A panel of experts in FC was interrogated about the important information needed from a report. RESULTS: Using the feedback from clinicians and subsequent discussion, a list of information to be included in the report was made, with four different levels of recommendation. The final report should include both a quantitative part and a qualitative or descriptive part with interpretation of the salient results. Other items discussed included the necessity of reporting data regarding the quality of samples, use of absolute numbers of positive cells, cutoff values, the intensity of fluorescence, and possible aberrant patterns of antigen expression useful from a clinical point of view. CONCLUSION: The consensus initiative is a first step toward standardization of diagnostic approach to canine hematopoietic neoplasms among different institutions and countries. This harmonization will improve communication and patient care and also facilitate the multicenter studies necessary to further our knowledge of canine hematopoietic neoplasms.

Lymphodepletion chemotherapy followed by infusion of T cells that are genetically modified to express a CD19-specific CAR is a promising therapy for patients with refractory CD19(+) B-cell malignancies, producing rates of complete remission that are remarkably high in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and encouraging in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Responses are often durable, although additional studies are needed to define the role of CAR-T cell immunotherapy in the context of other treatments.

RNA expression profiles of CD34(+) cells were analyzed in 125 MDS patients and compared to healthy controls. Prognostic impact on overall survival (OS) of mRNA proliferation signatures established for solid tumor cells was analyzed retrospectively. For validation on the protein level, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry analyses in bone marrow (BM) biopsies were performed, and an independent cohort of 223 MDS and secondary AML patients was investigated. Lower proliferative activity correlated with the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C (CDKN1C) and with shorter OS (p < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, higher CDKN1C expression was associated with worse OS (p = 0.02). On the BM level, a total of 84 (38%) patients showed CDKN1C protein expression before start of treatment. Patient, disease and treatment characteristics did not differ between CDKN1C-positive and -negative patients. Positive CDKN1C BM status was associated with shorter OS in multivariable analysis (HR 1.54, p = 0.04). There was an interaction between CDKN1C BM status and subsequent treatment with negative impact on OS being most pronounced in patients receiving conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy (n = 83, 2-year OS 30% versus 58%, p = 0.002). In conclusion, low-proliferative phenotype and CDKN1C expression were associated with shorter OS. CDKN1C protein expression in the BM of newly diagnosed, treatment-naive MDS and secondary AML patients was identified as a prognostic factor for poor survival in patients treated with antiproliferative chemotherapy.","['Radujkovic, Aleksandar', 'Dietrich, Sascha', 'Andrulis, Mindaugas', 'Benner, Axel', 'Longerich, Thomas', 'Pellagatti, Andrea', 'Nanda, Kriti', 'Giese, Thomas', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Baldus, Stefan', 'Boultwood, Jacqueline', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Dreger, Peter', 'Luft, Thomas']","['Radujkovic A', 'Dietrich S', 'Andrulis M', 'Benner A', 'Longerich T', 'Pellagatti A', 'Nanda K', 'Giese T', 'Germing U', 'Baldus S', 'Boultwood J', 'Ho AD', 'Dreger P', 'Luft T']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Bloodwise Molecular Hematology Unit, NDCLS, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases and Institute of Immunology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Bloodwise Molecular Hematology Unit, NDCLS, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p57/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*metabolism/*mortality/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/drug therapy/*metabolism/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2016/05/14 06:00,2017/04/30 06:00,['2016/05/13 06:00'],"['2016/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/22 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2016 Sep 15;139(6):1402-13. doi: 10.1002/ijc.30181.

SUMMARY ANSWER: YCS can self-collect high-quality DBS specimens in non-clinical settings, and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels can be assayed in such specimens. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Large-scale biosample collection is a barrier to studying ovarian reserve in YCS. DBS collected by research personnel has high acceptability. AMH levels measured in DBS are highly correlated with those measured by serum-based methods. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: In a prospective cohort study, YCS were recruited to self-collect DBS samples. AMH levels were assayed in 112 samples. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: YCS participants, ages 18-44, were recruited from a nationwide longitudinal cohort and DBS collection materials were posted to them. AMH levels were assayed by the Ansh DBS AMH ELISA and compared according to participant characteristics. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Among 163 potential participants, 123 (75%) were enrolled. Of those enrolled, 112 (91%) were able to complete DBS self-collection and submit mailed samples adequate for measuring AMH. Participants (mean age 31.6 [SD 5.5]) were 85% white, 87% college graduates and 46% reported higher income. Common cancer types were lymphoma and leukemia (34%), breast cancer (30%) and thyroid or skin cancer (8%). The geometric mean (95% confidence interval) AMH level in DBS samples was 0.24 ng/ml (0.16-0.36). In adjusted analysis, AMH levels for survivors of breast cancer (0.02 ng/ml [0.01-0.07]) or leukemia/lymphoma (0.03 ng/ml [0.01-0.08]) were lower than the levels in thyroid or skin cancer survivors (0.12 ng/ml [0.03-0.44]). Pelvic radiation remained associated with lower AMH levels (0.20 ng/ml [0.10-0.40] in unexposed versus 0.02 ng/ml [0.01-0.06] in exposed). Amenorrheic survivors had AMH levels (0.02 ng/ml [0.01-0.06]) that were lower than those of YCS with 7-9 (0.09 ng/ml [0.03-0.32]) or >/=10 (0.17 ng/ml [0.08-0.37]) menstrual periods in the past year. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The results are generalizable to a population of highly educated, higher income YCS. It is unclear how generalizable the results are to other populations. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Self-collected DBS is a patient-friendly and minimally invasive tool for studying ovarian reserve in geographically diverse populations.

The object of the present audit was to assess whether the investigation and management of HCL in University College Hospital Galway (UCHG) complies with the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) guidelines. METHODS: Following a review of the records in our Haematology Department, 18 cases of HCL were identified between January 2006 and October 2014. RESULTS: Blood film examination had been performed in all cases. Flow cytometry of liquid material had been undertaken in 89 % (n = 16) of cases, of which only 31 % (n = 5) included all four hairy cell panel markers (CD11c, CD25, CD103, CD123). Although all initial trephine biopsies included CD20, none analyzed DBA44. Only 65 % (n = 11) of treated patients had a post-treatment bone marrow biopsy preformed. CONCLUSION: This audit highlights areas of improvement in the diagnosis and management of HCL in UCHG, which do not currently adhere to the BCSH recommendations.","['Velazquez-Kennedy, K', 'Crowe, C', 'Craven, B', 'Walsh, J', 'Prendergast, C', 'Krawczyk, J']","['Velazquez-Kennedy K', 'Crowe C', 'Craven B', 'Walsh J', 'Prendergast C', 'Krawczyk J']","['Haematology Department, Galway University Hospital, Galway, Ireland. kyra.vkennedy@gmail.com.', 'Haematology Department, Galway University Hospital, Galway, Ireland.', 'Haematology Department, Galway University Hospital, Galway, Ireland.', 'Haematology Department, Galway University Hospital, Galway, Ireland.', 'Haematology Department, Galway University Hospital, Galway, Ireland.', 'Haematology Department, Galway University Hospital, Galway, Ireland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Ir J Med Sci,Irish journal of medical science,7806864,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Guideline Adherence', 'Hematology', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Practice Guidelines as Topic']",2016/05/14 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2016/05/13 06:00'],"['2015/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/13 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ir J Med Sci. 2017 May;186(2):345-347. doi: 10.1007/s11845-016-1460-4.

The tumor showed a vague nodular growth pattern separated by thick fibrous bands and the tumor cells were large and pleomorphic, with focal sheet-like growth pattern, in a background of small B and T-lymphocytes. The large tumor cells were positive for CD15, CD19, CD20 (intensely and diffusely), CD30, fascin, PAX5, MUM1, OCT2, and LMP-1 by immunohistochemical stains, and EBV by in situ hybridization. The tumor was diagnosed as EBV-positive diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), with overlapping features of classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL). The patient received salvage chemotherapy and was free of disease 2 years after adrenalectomy. We speculated that our case was a clonally unrelated tumor with his underlying CLL and discussed the differential diagnoses between EBV-positive DLBCL and CHL in the setting of RS.","['Chen, Yun-An', 'Wang, Ran-Ching', 'Yang, Youngsen', 'Chuang, Shih-Sung']","['Chen YA', 'Wang RC', 'Yang Y', 'Chuang SS']","['Department of Pathology, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology, Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,,,2016/05/14 06:00,2016/05/14 06:00,['2016/05/13 06:00'],"['2015/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Pathol Int. 2016 Jul;66(7):393-397. doi: 10.1111/pin.12417.

The polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) has been identified as one of the most frequently mutated epigenetic protein complexes in hematologic cancers. PRC2 acts as an epigenetic repressor through histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), catalyzed by the histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 protein (EZH2). METHODS: To study the prevalence and clinical impact of PRC2 aberrations in an unselected childhood ALL cohort (n = 152), we performed PRC2 mutational screenings by Sanger sequencing and promoter methylation analyses by quantitative pyrosequencing for the three PRC2 core component genes EZH2, suppressor of zeste 12 (SUZ12), and embryonic ectoderm development (EED). Targeted deep next-generation sequencing of 30 frequently mutated genes in leukemia was performed to search for cooperating mutations in patients harboring PRC2 aberrations. Finally, the functional consequence of EZH2 promoter hypermethylation on H3K27me3 was studied by Western blot analyses of primary cells. RESULTS: Loss-of-function EZH2 mutations were detected in 2/152 (1.3 %) patients with common-ALL and early T-cell precursor (ETP)-ALL, respectively. In one patient, targeted deep sequencing identified cooperating mutations in ASXL1 and TET2. EZH2 promoter hypermethylation was found in one patient with ETP-ALL which led to reduced H3K27me3. In comparison with healthy children, the EZH2 promoter was significantly higher methylated in T-ALL patients. No mutations or promoter methylation changes were identified for SUZ12 or EED genes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although PRC2 aberrations seem to be rare in childhood ALL, our findings indicate that EZH2 aberrations might contribute to the disease in specific cases. Hereby, EZH2 promoter hypermethylation might have functionally similar consequences as loss-of-function mutations.","['Schafer, Vivien', 'Ernst, Jana', 'Rinke, Jenny', 'Winkelmann, Nils', 'Beck, James F', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Gruhn, Bernd', 'Ernst, Thomas']","['Schafer V', 'Ernst J', 'Rinke J', 'Winkelmann N', 'Beck JF', 'Hochhaus A', 'Gruhn B', 'Ernst T']","['Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Erlanger Allee 101, 07740, Jena, Germany.', 'Sektion fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und Stammzelltransplantation, Klinik fur Kinder- und Jugendmedizin, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Kochstrasse 2, 07745 Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Erlanger Allee 101, 07740, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Erlanger Allee 101, 07740, Jena, Germany.', 'Sektion fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und Stammzelltransplantation, Klinik fur Kinder- und Jugendmedizin, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Kochstrasse 2, 07745 Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Erlanger Allee 101, 07740, Jena, Germany.', 'Sektion fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und Stammzelltransplantation, Klinik fur Kinder- und Jugendmedizin, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Kochstrasse 2, 07745 Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Erlanger Allee 101, 07740, Jena, Germany. thomas.ernst@med.uni-jena.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*DNA Methylation', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/*genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic']",2016/05/14 06:00,2017/02/18 06:00,['2016/05/13 06:00'],"['2016/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2016 Jul;142(7):1641-50. doi: 10.1007/s00432-016-2174-8.

Although ICH worsened temporarily, his clinical condition gradually improved with resolution of the SSST, and he eventually became fully ambulatory. There were no deficiencies of natural anticoagulants. Three additional cycles of HD-AraC without IT therapy were conducted, but no neurological complications recurred with the concomitant use of warfarin. He was discharged free of neurological deficits.

We previously reported that the T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3) is expressed on the LCS surface in most types of AML. Since only the TIM-3(+), i.e. not the TIM-3(-), fraction of human AML cells can reconstitute human AML in immunodeficient mice, we hypothesized that the TIM-3 has an essential function in maintaining AML LSCs. Herein, we show that TIM-3 and its ligand, galectin-9 (Gal-9), constitute an autocrine loop critical for human AML LSC development. Serum Gal-9 was significantly elevated in primary AML patients and in mice xenografted with human AML. Neutralization of Gal-9 inhibited xenogeneic reconstitution of human AML, as well as Gal-9 ligation of TIM-3 co-activated NF-kappaB and beta-catenin signaling, suggesting that TIM-3 signaling is necessary for LSC self-renewal. Interestingly, identical changes were found to be involved in the progressive transformation of a variety of pre-leukemic disorders into myeloid leukemia. Thus, molecules constituting the TIM-3/Gal-9 autocrine loop are potential therapeutic targets applicable to most types of myeloid leukemia.","['Kikushige, Yoshikane']",['Kikushige Y'],"['Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Science.']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,IM,"['Animals', '*Autocrine Communication', '*Cell Self Renewal', 'Disease Progression', 'Galectins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism']",2016/05/14 06:00,2016/10/01 06:00,['2016/05/13 06:00'],"['2016/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2016 Apr;57(4):412-6. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.57.412.,10.11406/rinketsu.57.412 [doi],,"['0 (Galectins)', '0 (HAVCR2 protein, human)', '0 (Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2)', '0 (LGALS9 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)']",,,,,['10.11406/rinketsu.57.412 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of present study was to investigate how clinical outcomes vary among patients with different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ABCB1. A total of 48 adult patients with CML and higher than median ABCB1 mRNA levels were selected for testing of ABCB1 SNPs. In 28 of the 48 patients, the IM concentration and expression levels of human organic cation transporter 1 (hOCT1) and ABCB1 in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) were also tested. Correlations between treatment outcomes and IM concentration or the SNP status of ABCB1 were analyzed. Patients were classified by therapeutic response as major molecular response (MMR) (n=11), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) (n=19) and non-CCyR (n=18) groups. It was found that the concentration of IM in BMMCs of the CCyR group was significant higher than that of the resistant groups (P=0.013). In addition, the IM concentration was positively correlated with the expression of hOCT1 mRNA (R=0.456, P=0.033), but negatively correlated with the expression of ABCB1 mRNA (R=-0.491, P=0.015). Furthermore, the mRNA expression level of ABCB1 was not associated with therapeutic response, but SNPs of the ABCB1 gene were associated with the response to IM. In conclusion, the concentration of IM in BMMCs may be regulated by the ABCB1 gene, and SNPs of the ABCB1 gene predict the therapeutic response to IM in patients with CML.","['Yin, Chang-Xin', 'Chen, Wei-Wei', 'Zhong, Qing-Xiu', 'Jiang, Xue-Jie', 'Wang, Zhi-Xiang', 'Li, Xiao-Dong', 'Ye, Jie-Yu', 'Cao, Rui', 'Liao, Li-Bing', 'Wu, Fu-Qun', 'Xu, Dan', 'Zhong, Jian-Sheng', 'Meng, Fan-Yi']","['Yin CX', 'Chen WW', 'Zhong QX', 'Jiang XJ', 'Wang ZX', 'Li XD', 'Ye JY', 'Cao R', 'Liao LB', 'Wu FQ', 'Xu D', 'Zhong JS', 'Meng FY']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510515, P.R.

Metformin is a widely prescribed anti-hyperglycemic drug, which is emerging as a potential cancer preventative and treatment agent. However, the mechanisms underlying the suppressive effects of metformin on cancer cell growth and the induction of cancer cell apoptosis are not fully elucidated. The present study aimed to identify the pathways regulated by metformin in two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435. Cells were treated with various concentrations of metformin and then evaluated with respect to viability, proliferation, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, mitochondrial membrane potential (psim), and the expression of anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins. Metformin caused apoptosis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and decreased cell viability and ATP production. Furthermore, metformin induced the generation of ROS and decreased the psim. Moreover, metformin downregulated the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) and myeloid cell leukemia-1, and upregulated the expression of the pro-apoptotic BCL-2-associated X protein in MDA-MB-231 cells.

Plant extracts or their active constituents are used as folk medicine in traditional therapies by 80% of the world population. The aim of the present study was to determine the anti-proliferative potential of Fumaria vaillantii extracts on three different cancer cell lines including malignant melanoma SKMEL-3, human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 and human myelogenous leukemia K562 as well as human gingival fibroblast (HGF) as normal cell line. Anti-proliferative activity was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), flowcytometry and annexin methods. Total phenolics and flavonoids were determined by Folin-Ciocalteu and aluminum chloride methods. Chloroform fraction had the lowest IC50 value at 72 h (0.1 mug/ml) in MCF-7 cells. Flowcytometry and annexin-V analysis indicated that the chloroform fraction induced necrosis in MCF-7 cells. In addition, the colorimetric methods showed that the methanolic fraction possessed the highest amount of total phenolics (33.03 +/- 0.75 mg/g of dry powder) and flavonoids (10.5 +/- 2.0 mg/g of dry powder). The collective data demonstrated that F. vaillantii chloroform fraction may contain effective compounds with chemo-therapeutic potential act through an apoptotic independent pathway.","['Tabrizi, Fatemeh Haji Abbas', 'Irian, Saeed', 'Amanzadeh, Amir', 'Heidarnejad, Fatemeh', 'Gudarzi, Hoda', 'Salimi, Mona']","['Tabrizi FH', 'Irian S', 'Amanzadeh A', 'Heidarnejad F', 'Gudarzi H', 'Salimi M']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Kharazmi University, Tehran, I.R.

METHODS: In the present study the effect of precourse folate levels and MTHFR genotypes on the complications during high dose methotrexate chemotherapy in children with ALL were examined. RESULTS: Twenty-one children were studied. Folate deficiency was associated with higher incidence of neutropenia (P = 0.03) and longer duration of chemotherapy interruption (P = 0.009). Children with MTHFR1298 mutations needed more red cell transfusion (P = 0.03). All 3 deaths encountered were seen in folate deficient children.

Since new compounds with biological activity and less cytotoxicity to normal cells are necessary for cancer therapy, the aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of 1-(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)-dodecylbenzoate on human acute myeloid leukemia K562 cells and on human acute lymphoblastic leukemia Jurkat cells. The cell viability was determined by MTT method. The apoptosis induction was assessed by bromide and acridine orange staining and by Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection kit. The cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry using propidium iodide. Cytometric analysis was also performed to evaluate the expression of the following proteins: AIF, p53, Bcl-2 and Bax. The mitochondrial potential was also assessed by flow cytometry using MitoView633 kit. The results showed that the compound significantly reduced the cell viability of K562 and Jurkat cells in a concentration and time dependent manner (IC50 of 30 muM). The compound induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1phase and significantly increased the proportion of cells in the sub-G0/G1phase. Apoptosis was confirmed by the sight of morphological characteristics of apoptosis and by phosphatidylserine externalization (73.47+/-5.71% of cells expressing annexin). The results also showed that the compound promotes a modification in Bax:Bcl-2 ratio and increases p53 expression. Thus, it is possible to conclude that 1-(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)-dodecylbenzoate induces apoptosis by inhibiting the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and by increasing the release of AIF, Bax and p53. In addition, it blocks the cell cycle at G0/G1, stopping cell proliferation. So far, the results suggest that this compound may have a potential therapeutic effect against leukemia cells.","['Maioral, M F', 'Bubniak, L D S', 'Marzarotto, M A L', 'De Moraes, A C R', 'Leal, P', 'Nunes, R', 'Yunes, R A', 'Santos-Silva, M C']","['Maioral MF', 'Bubniak LD', 'Marzarotto MA', 'De Moraes AC', 'Leal P', 'Nunes R', 'Yunes RA', 'Santos-Silva MC']","['Department of Clinical Analysis, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Campus Trinity, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis-SC, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Analysis, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Campus Trinity, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis-SC, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Analysis, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Campus Trinity, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis-SC, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Analysis, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Campus Trinity, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis-SC, Brazil.', 'Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Campus Trinity, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis-SC, Brazil.', 'Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Campus Trinity, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis-SC, Brazil.', 'Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Campus Trinity, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis-SC, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Analysis, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Campus Trinity, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis-SC, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Pharm Sci,Indian journal of pharmaceutical sciences,7809431,,,2016/05/12 06:00,2016/05/12 06:01,['2016/05/12 06:00'],"['2016/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/12 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Indian J Pharm Sci. 2016 Jan-Feb;78(1):120-8. doi: 10.4103/0250-474x.180255.,,,,PMC4852561,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'acute leukemia', 'cytotoxicity', 'gallic acid']",,['10.4103/0250-474x.180255 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Investigation of strategies aiming to inhibit alternative survival pathways in CML is therefore critical. We have previously shown that a nonspecific pharmacological inhibition of autophagy potentiates TKI-induced death in Philadelphia chromosome-positive cells. Here we provide further understanding of how specific and pharmacological autophagy inhibition affects nonmitochondrial and mitochondrial energy metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated differentiation of CML cells and highlight ATG7 (a critical component of the LC3 conjugation system) as a potential specific therapeutic target. By combining extra- and intracellular steady state metabolite measurements by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with metabolic flux assays using labeled glucose and functional assays, we demonstrate that knockdown of ATG7 results in decreased glycolysis and increased flux of labeled carbons through the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle. This leads to increased oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial ROS accumulation. Furthermore, following ROS accumulation, CML cells, including primary CML CD34(+) progenitor cells, differentiate toward the erythroid lineage. Finally, ATG7 knockdown sensitizes CML progenitor cells to TKI-induced death, without affecting survival of normal cells, suggesting that specific inhibitors of ATG7 in combination with TKI would provide a novel therapeutic approach for CML patients exhibiting persistent disease.","['Karvela, Maria', 'Baquero, Pablo', 'Kuntz, Elodie M', 'Mukhopadhyay, Arunima', 'Mitchell, Rebecca', 'Allan, Elaine K', 'Chan, Edmond', 'Kranc, Kamil R', 'Calabretta, Bruno', 'Salomoni, Paolo', 'Gottlieb, Eyal', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Helgason, G Vignir']","['Karvela M', 'Baquero P', 'Kuntz EM', 'Mukhopadhyay A', 'Mitchell R', 'Allan EK', 'Chan E', 'Kranc KR', 'Calabretta B', 'Salomoni P', 'Gottlieb E', 'Holyoake TL', 'Helgason GV']","[""a Paul O'Gorman Leukemia Research Center, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow , Glasgow , UK."", 'b Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Center, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow , UK.', 'c Cancer Research UK, Beatson Institute, Garscube Estate, Switchback Road , Glasgow , UK.', ""a Paul O'Gorman Leukemia Research Center, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow , Glasgow , UK."", 'b Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Center, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow , UK.', 'd Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service, Gartnavel General Hospital , Glasgow , UK.', 'e Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Strathclyde , Glasgow , UK.', 'f Medical Research Council Center for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh , Edinburgh , UK.', 'g Department of Cancer Biology , Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia , PA USA.', ""h Samantha Dickson Brain Cancer Unit, UCL Cancer Institute, Paul O'Gorman Building , London , UK."", 'c Cancer Research UK, Beatson Institute, Garscube Estate, Switchback Road , Glasgow , UK.', ""a Paul O'Gorman Leukemia Research Center, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow , Glasgow , UK."", 'b Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Center, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow , UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 7/*metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Respiration/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Citric Acid Cycle/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Energy Metabolism/drug effects', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Metabolic Flux Analysis', 'Metabolome/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation/drug effects', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/metabolism']",2016/05/12 06:00,2017/11/14 06:00,['2016/05/12 06:00'],"['2016/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/14 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Autophagy. 2016 Jun 2;12(6):936-48. doi: 10.1080/15548627.2016.1162359.

Improved understanding of the genomic landscape of iAMP21-ALL will ascertain whether these patients may benefit from targeted therapy. We performed whole-exome sequencing of eight iAMP21-ALL samples. The mutation rate was dramatically disparate between cases (average 24.9, range 5-51) and a large number of novel variants were identified, including frequent mutation of the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway. Targeted sequencing of a larger cohort revealed that 60% (25/42) of diagnostic iAMP21-ALL samples harboured 42 distinct RAS pathway mutations. High sequencing coverage demonstrated heterogeneity in the form of multiple RAS pathway mutations within the same sample and diverse variant allele frequencies (VAFs) (2-52%), similar to other subtypes of ALL. Constitutive RAS pathway activation was observed in iAMP21 samples that harboured mutations in the predominant clone (35% VAF).

B-PLL is resistant to most chemotherapy and newer targeted therapies such as alemtuzumab and thalidomide. Phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) is a natural compound from horseradish with evidence for therapeutic potential in multiple leukemia types. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we present a case report of a 53-year-old man whose chronic lymphocytic leukemia transformed to end-stage B-PLL, disqualifying him for allogenic stem cell transplantation. He was treated with PEITC followed by salvage R-CHOP (Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Hydroxydaunorubicin [doxorubicin hydrochloride], Oncovin [vincristine sulfate], Prednisone or Prednisolone) chemotherapy, which led to normalized white blood cell count and disease stabilization that requalified him for allogenic peripheral stem-cell transplant therapy. We conducted a systematic review to analyze and interpret the potential contribution of PEITC to his unexpectedly favorable R-CHOP response. Following sequential 8 weeks of PEITC/pentostatin and 6 cycles of R-CHOP, the patient received allogenic peripheral blood stem cell transplant on an outpatient basis and remains well at the time of this publication, with no evidence of CD20+ small B-cells. DISCUSSION: Given the limited data for R-CHOP in B-PLL, this patient's recovery suggests presensitization of B-PLL cells toward R-CHOP, potentially justifying further investigation.","['Nachat, Arian', 'Turoff-Ortmeyer, Sam', 'Liu, Chunnan', 'Mcculloch, Michael']","['Nachat A', 'Turoff-Ortmeyer S', 'Liu C', 'Mcculloch M']","['Physician Lead for Integrative Medicine at Walnut Creek Hospital in CA. arian.nachat@kp.org.', 'Research Associate in Integrative Medicine at Walnut Creek Hospital in CA. samturoff@gmail.com.', 'Medical Oncologist at Walnut Creek Hospital in CA. chunnan.liu@kp.org.', 'Chief of Research for Integrative Medicine at the Pine Street Foundation in San Anselmo and at Walnut Creek Hospital in CA. michael.f.mcculloch@kp.org.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",United States,Perm J,The Permanente journal,9800474,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', '*Salvage Therapy']",2016/05/12 06:00,2017/03/24 06:00,['2016/05/12 06:00'],"['2016/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/24 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Perm J.

Here we review advances in mapping the emergence of these lineages from early lymphoid precursors. We discuss the identification of a common innate lymphoid cell precursor characterized by transient expression of the transcription factor PLZF, and the lineage relationships of innate lymphoid cells with conventional natural killer cells and lymphoid tissue inducer cells.

This led to studies of the thymus as the site of maturation of T cells, which led to the discovery, isolation, and clinical transplantation of purified hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The induction of immune tolerance with HSCs has led to isolation of other tissue-specific stem cells for regenerative medicine. Our studies of circulating competing germline stem cells in colonial protochordates led us to document competing HSCs. In human acute myelogenous leukemia we showed that all preleukemic mutations occur in HSCs, and determined their order; the final mutations occur in a multipotent progenitor derived from the preleukemic HSC clone. With these, we discovered that CD47 is an upregulated gene in all human cancers and is a ""don't eat me"" signal; blocking it with antibodies leads to cancer cell phagocytosis.

Recently, chronic pain hypersensitivity in rodents treated to induce chronic inflammation in peripheral tissues was linked to enhanced tryptophan catabolism in brain mediated by indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO). Here we show that acute influenza A virus (IAV) and chronic murine leukemia retrovirus (MuLV) infections, which stimulate robust IDO expression in lungs and lymphoid tissues, induced acute or chronic pain hypersensitivity, respectively. In contrast, virus-induced pain hypersensitivity did not manifest in mice lacking intact IDO1 genes. Spleen IDO activity increased markedly as MuLV infections progressed, while IDO1 expression was not elevated significantly in brain or spinal cord (CNS) tissues. Moreover, kynurenine (Kyn), a tryptophan catabolite made by cells expressing IDO, incited pain hypersensitivity in uninfected IDO1-deficient mice and Kyn potentiated pain hypersensitivity due to MuLV infection. MuLV infection stimulated selective IDO expression by a discreet population of spleen cells expressing both B cell (CD19) and dendritic cell (CD11c) markers (CD19+ DCs). CD19+ DCs were more susceptible to MuLV infection than B cells or conventional (CD19neg) DCs, proliferated faster than B cells from early stages of MuLV infection and exhibited mature antigen presenting cell (APC) phenotypes, unlike conventional (CD19neg) DCs. Moreover, interactions with CD4 T cells were necessary to sustain functional IDO expression by CD19+ DCs in vitro and in vivo. Splenocytes from MuLV-infected IDO1-sufficient mice induced pain hypersensitivity in uninfected IDO1-deficient recipient mice, while selective in vivo depletion of DCs alleviated pain hypersensitivity in MuLV-infected IDO1-sufficient mice and led to rapid reduction in splenomegaly, a hallmark of MuLV immune pathogenesis. These findings reveal critical roles for CD19+ DCs expressing IDO in host responses to MuLV infection that enhance pain hypersensitivity and cause immune pathology. Collectively, our findings support the hypothesis elevated IDO activity in non-CNS due to virus infections causes pain hypersensitivity mediated by Kyn. Previously unappreciated links between host immune responses to virus infections and pain sensitivity suggest that IDO inhibitors may alleviate heightened pain sensitivity during infections.","['Huang, Lei', 'Ou, Rong', 'Rabelo de Souza, Guilherme', 'Cunha, Thiago M', 'Lemos, Henrique', 'Mohamed, Eslam', 'Li, Lingqian', 'Pacholczyk, Gabriela', 'Randall, Janice', 'Munn, David H', 'Mellor, Andrew L']","['Huang L', 'Ou R', 'Rabelo de Souza G', 'Cunha TM', 'Lemos H', 'Mohamed E', 'Li L', 'Pacholczyk G', 'Randall J', 'Munn DH', 'Mellor AL']","['Cancer Immunology, Inflammation and Tolerance Program, Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Cancer Immunology, Inflammation and Tolerance Program, Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Cancer Immunology, Inflammation and Tolerance Program, Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Cancer Immunology, Inflammation and Tolerance Program, Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Cancer Immunology, Inflammation and Tolerance Program, Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Cancer Immunology, Inflammation and Tolerance Program, Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Cancer Immunology, Inflammation and Tolerance Program, Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Cancer Immunology, Inflammation and Tolerance Program, Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Cancer Immunology, Inflammation and Tolerance Program, Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hyperalgesia/*enzymology/*etiology', 'Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase/*biosynthesis', 'Kynurenine/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Virus Diseases/*complications']",2016/05/12 06:00,2017/05/20 06:00,['2016/05/12 06:00'],"['2015/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2016 May 11;12(5):e1005615. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005615. eCollection 2016 May.,10.1371/journal.ppat.1005615 [doi],20160511,"['0 (IDO1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase)', '343-65-7 (Kynurenine)']",PMC4863962,,,,"['10.1371/journal.ppat.1005615 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-15-01948 [pii]']",,,"['R01 AI103347/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA096651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA103320/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AI083005/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it has been demonstrated that BCR-ABL1- expressing leukemic stem cells (LSCs) persist in patients in deep molecular response. It has also been shown that the discontinuation of Imatinib leads to a molecular relapse in the majority of cases. To determine a possible relationship between these two phenomena, we have evaluated by clonogenic and long-term culture initiating cell (LTC-IC) assays, the presence of BCR-ABL1-expressing LSCs in marrow samples from 21 patients in deep molecular response for three years after TKI therapy (mean duration seven years). LSCs were detected in 4/21 patients. Discontinuation of TKI therapy in 13/21 patients led to a rapid molecular relapse in five patients (4 without detectable LSCs and one with detectable LSCs). No relapse occurred in the eight patients still on TKI therapy, whether LSCs were detectable or not.

However, evidence of the benefits that patients derive from genomic testing is limited. This study evaluated patient preferences for genomic testing in the context of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). METHODS: We used a discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey to assess the preferences of CLL patients in the UK for genomic testing. The survey presented patients with 16 questions in which they had to choose between two possible test scenarios. Tests in these scenarios were specified in terms of six attributes, including test effectiveness, test reliability and time to receive results. RESULTS: 219 patients completed the survey (response rate 20 %). Both clinical and process-related attributes were valued by respondents. Patients were willing to pay pound24 for a 1 % increase in chemotherapy non-responders identified, and pound27 to reduce time to receive test results by 1 day. Patients were also willing to wait an extra 29 days for test results if an additional one-third of chemotherapy non-responders could be identified, and would tolerate a genomic test being wrong 8 % of the time to receive this information. CONCLUSION: CLL patients value the information that could be provided by genomic tests, and prefer combinations of test characteristics that more closely reflect future genomic testing practice than current genetic testing practice. Commissioners will need to carefully consider how genomic testing is operationalised in this context if the benefits of testing are to be realised.","['Buchanan, James', 'Wordsworth, Sarah', 'Schuh, Anna']","['Buchanan J', 'Wordsworth S', 'Schuh A']","['Nuffield Department of Population Health, Health Economics Research Centre, University of Oxford, Old Road Campus, Headington, Oxford, OX3 7LF, UK. james.buchanan@dph.ox.ac.uk.', 'Nuffield Department of Population Health, Health Economics Research Centre, University of Oxford, Old Road Campus, Headington, Oxford, OX3 7LF, UK.', 'BRC/NHS Oxford Molecular Diagnostics Centre, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Patient,The patient,101309314,IM,"['*Choice Behavior', '*Genetic Testing', '*Genomics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Patient Preference', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2016/05/12 06:00,2018/03/29 06:00,['2016/05/12 06:00'],"['2016/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/29 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Patient. 2016 Dec;9(6):525-536. doi: 10.1007/s40271-016-0172-1.,,,,PMC5107190,,,"['Compliance with Ethical Standards Ethical approval This study has been performed', 'in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.

We investigated the cytotoxicity of a pan-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ponatinib, and a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor, panobinostat, against IM-resistant CML cells in vitro. Two different IM-resistant cell lines, K562/IM-R1 and Ba/F3/T315I were evaluated in comparison with their respective, parental cell lines, K562 and Ba/F3. K562/IM-R1 overexpressed BCR-ABL due to gene amplification. Ba/F3/T315I was transfected with a BCR-ABL gene encoding T315I-mutated BCR-ABL. Ponatinib inhibited the growth of both K562/IM-R1 and Ba/F3/T315I as potently as it inhibited their parental cells with an IC50 of 2-30 nM. Panobinostat also similarly inhibited the growth of all of the cell lines with an IC50 of 40-51 nM. This was accompanied by reduced histone deacetylase activity, induced histone H3 acetylation, and an increased protein level of heat shock protein 70, which suggested disruption of heat shock protein 90 chaperone function for BCR-ABL and its degradation. Importantly, the combination of ponatinib with panobinostat showed synergistic growth inhibition and induced a higher level of apoptosis than the sum of the apoptosis induced by each agent alone in all of the cell lines. Ponatinib inhibited phosphorylation not only of BCR-ABL but also of downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription 5, protein kinase B, and ERK1/2 in both K562/IM-R1 and Ba/F3/T315I, and the addition of panobinostat to ponatinib further inhibited these phosphorylations. In conclusion, panobinostat enhanced the cytotoxicity of ponatinib towards IM-resistant CML cells including those with T315I-mutated BCR-ABL.","['Matsuda, Yasufumi', 'Yamauchi, Takahiro', 'Hosono, Naoko', 'Uzui, Kanako', 'Negoro, Eiju', 'Morinaga, Koji', 'Nishi, Rie', 'Yoshida, Akira', 'Kimura, Shinya', 'Maekawa, Taira', 'Ueda, Takanori']","['Matsuda Y', 'Yamauchi T', 'Hosono N', 'Uzui K', 'Negoro E', 'Morinaga K', 'Nishi R', 'Yoshida A', 'Kimura S', 'Maekawa T', 'Ueda T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Panobinostat', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Pyridazines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2016/05/12 06:00,2017/02/15 06:00,['2016/05/12 06:00'],"['2016/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/15 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2016 Jul;107(7):1029-38. doi: 10.1111/cas.12965.

While seasonal influenza viruses infect humans every year, occasionally animal-origin viruses emerge to cause pandemics with significantly higher morbidity and mortality rates. In March 2013, the public health authorities of China reported three cases of laboratory confirmed human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus, and subsequently there have been many cases reported across South East Asia and recently in North America. Most patients experience severe respiratory illness, and morbidity with mortality rates near 40%. No vaccine is currently available and the use of antivirals is complicated due the frequent emergence of drug resistant strains. Thus, there is an imminent need to identify new drug targets for therapeutic intervention. In the current study, a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay was performed using microRNA (miRNA) inhibitors to identify new host miRNA targets that reduce influenza H7N9 replication in human respiratory (A549) cells. Validation studies lead to a top hit, hsa-miR-664a-3p, that had potent antiviral effects in reducing H7N9 replication (TCID50 titers) by two logs. In silico pathway analysis revealed that this microRNA targeted the LIF and NEK7 genes with effects on pro-inflammatory factors. In follow up studies using siRNAs, anti-viral properties were shown for LIF. Furthermore, inhibition of hsa-miR-664a-3p also reduced virus replication of pandemic influenza A strains H1N1 and H3N2.","['Wolf, Stefan', 'Wu, Weilin', 'Jones, Cheryl', 'Perwitasari, Olivia', 'Mahalingam, Suresh', 'Tripp, Ralph A']","['Wolf S', 'Wu W', 'Jones C', 'Perwitasari O', 'Mahalingam S', 'Tripp RA']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, United States of America.', 'Institute for Glycomics, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Southport, QLD, Australia.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, United States of America.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, United States of America.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, United States of America.', 'Institute for Glycomics, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Southport, QLD, Australia.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/metabolism', 'Dogs', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genome, Human', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype/*physiology', 'Influenza, Human/genetics/virology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Software', 'Virus Replication/*physiology']",2016/05/12 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2016/05/12 06:00'],"['2015/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 May 11;11(5):e0155104. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0155104. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0155104 [doi],20160511,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",PMC4864377,,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0155104 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-52666 [pii]']",,,['HHSN272201400004C/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the crystal structure of the inactive c-Abl kinase core, the SH2 and SH3 domains dock onto the back of the kinase domain, resulting in a compact, assembled state. This inactive conformation is stabilized by the interaction of the myristoylated N-cap with a pocket in the C-lobe of the kinase domain. Mutations that perturb these intramolecular interactions result in kinase activation. Here, we present X-ray scattering solution structures of multidomain c-Abl kinase core proteins modeling diverse active states. Surprisingly, the relative positions of the regulatory N-cap, SH3, and SH2 domains in an active myristic acid binding pocket mutant (A356N) were virtually identical to those of the assembled wild-type kinase core, indicating that Abl kinase activation does not require dramatic reorganization of the downregulated core structure. In contrast, the positions of the SH2 and SH3 domains in a clinically relevant imatinib-resistant gatekeeper mutant (T315I) appear to be reconfigured relative to their positions in the wild-type protein. Our results demonstrate that c-Abl kinase activation can occur either with (T315I) or without (A356N) global allosteric changes in the core, revealing the potential for previously unrecognized signaling diversity.","['Badger, John', 'Grover, Prerna', 'Shi, Haibin', 'Panjarian, Shoghag B', 'Engen, John R', 'Smithgall, Thomas E', 'Makowski, Lee']","['Badger J', 'Grover P', 'Shi H', 'Panjarian SB', 'Engen JR', 'Smithgall TE', 'Makowski L']","['DeltaG Technologies , San Diego, California 92122, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myristic Acid/*metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'src Homology Domains']",2016/05/12 06:00,2017/05/04 06:00,['2016/05/12 06:00'],"['2016/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 2016 Jun 14;55(23):3251-60. doi: 10.1021/acs.biochem.6b00202.

Survival models with random effects on the baseline hazard and/or on the effect of the covariates of interest have been largely applied, for instance, to investigate potential centre effects. We aimed to develop a procedure to routinely test for multiple random effects in survival analyses. We propose a statistic and a permutation approach to test whether all or a subset of components of the variance-covariance matrix of random effects are non-zero in a mixed-effects Cox model framework. Performances of the proposed permutation tests are examined under different null hypotheses corresponding to the different components of the variance-covariance matrix, i.e ., to the different random effects considered on the baseline hazard and/or on the covariates effects. Several alternative hypotheses are evaluated using simulations. The results indicate that the permutation tests have valid type I error rates under the null and achieve satisfactory power under all alternatives. The procedure is applied to two European cohorts of haematological stem cell transplants in acute leukaemia to investigate the heterogeneity across centres in leukaemia-free survival and the potential heterogeneity in prognostic factors effects across centres.","['Biard, L', 'Labopin, M', 'Chevret, S', 'Resche-Rigon, M']","['Biard L', 'Labopin M', 'Chevret S', 'Resche-Rigon M']","['1 Service de Biostatistique et Information Medicale, AP-HP Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', '2 Universite Paris Diderot - Paris 7, Sorbonne Paris Cite UMR-S 1153, Paris, France.', '3 ECSTRA Team, INSERM, UMR-S 1153, Paris, France.', '4 Clinical Haematology and Cellular Therapy Department AP-HP, Hopital Saint Antoine, Paris, France.', '5 EBMT Acute Leukaemia Working Party Office, Hopital Saint Antoine, Paris, France.', '6 Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.', '7 INSERM UMR-S 938, Paris, France.', '1 Service de Biostatistique et Information Medicale, AP-HP Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', '2 Universite Paris Diderot - Paris 7, Sorbonne Paris Cite UMR-S 1153, Paris, France.', '3 ECSTRA Team, INSERM, UMR-S 1153, Paris, France.', '1 Service de Biostatistique et Information Medicale, AP-HP Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', '2 Universite Paris Diderot - Paris 7, Sorbonne Paris Cite UMR-S 1153, Paris, France.', '3 ECSTRA Team, INSERM, UMR-S 1153, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Stat Methods Med Res,Statistical methods in medical research,9212457,IM,"['Biostatistics/*methods', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Computer Simulation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/therapy', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic/*statistics & numerical data', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*Survival Analysis']",2016/05/12 06:00,2019/09/03 06:00,['2016/05/12 06:00'],"['2016/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/03 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stat Methods Med Res. 2018 Mar;27(3):920-932. doi: 10.1177/0962280216647981.

We show here that the DNA damaging agents cisplatin and etoposide upregulate Noxa expression, which is required for the phosphorylation of MCL-1 at Ser64/Thr70 sites, proteasome-dependent degradation, and apoptosis. Noxa-induced MCL-1 phosphorylation at these sites occurs at the mitochondria and is primarily regulated by CDK2. MCL-1 and CDK2 form a stable complex and Noxa binds to this complex to facilitate the phosphorylation of MCL-1. When Ser64 and Thr70 of MCL-1 are substituted with alanine, the mutated MCL-1 is neither phosphorylated nor ubiquitinated, and becomes more stable than the wild-type protein. As a consequence, this mutant can inhibit apoptosis induced by Noxa overexpression or cisplatin treatment. These results indicate that Noxa-mediated MCL-1 phosphorylation followed by MCL-1 degradation is critical for apoptosis induced by DNA damaging agents through regulation of the Noxa/MCL-1/CDK2 complex.","['Nakajima, Wataru', 'Sharma, Kanika', 'Lee, June Young', 'Maxim, Nicolas T', 'Hicks, Mark A', 'Vu, Thien-Trang', 'Luu, Angela', 'Yeudall, W Andrew', 'Tanaka, Nobuyuki', 'Harada, Hisashi']","['Nakajima W', 'Sharma K', 'Lee JY', 'Maxim NT', 'Hicks MA', 'Vu TT', 'Luu A', 'Yeudall WA', 'Tanaka N', 'Harada H']","['Phillips Institute for Oral Health Research, School of Dentistry, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Institute for Advanced Medical Sciences, Nippon Medical School, Kawasaki, Japan.', 'Phillips Institute for Oral Health Research, School of Dentistry, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA.', 'Phillips Institute for Oral Health Research, School of Dentistry, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA.', 'Phillips Institute for Oral Health Research, School of Dentistry, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA.', 'Phillips Institute for Oral Health Research, School of Dentistry, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA.', 'Phillips Institute for Oral Health Research, School of Dentistry, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA.', 'Phillips Institute for Oral Health Research, School of Dentistry, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA.', 'Department of Oral Biology, Dental College of Georgia, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Institute for Advanced Medical Sciences, Nippon Medical School, Kawasaki, Japan.', 'Phillips Institute for Oral Health Research, School of Dentistry, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference']",2016/05/12 06:00,2017/12/28 06:00,['2016/05/12 06:00'],"['2015/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/28 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jun 14;7(24):36353-36365. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9217.,10.18632/oncotarget.9217 [doi],,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",PMC5095005,['NOTNLM'],"['CDK2', 'MCL-1', 'Noxa', 'chemotherapy', 'phosphorylation']",['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],"['9217 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9217 [doi]']",,,"['P30 CA016059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA134473/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE024381/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Bcl-2-selective inhibitor ABT-199 has demonstrated encouraging preclinical results, drug resistance remains a concern. Mcl-1 has been demonstrated to contribute to ABT-199 resistance, thus combining with therapies that target Mcl-1 could overcome such resistance. In this study, we utilized a CHK1 inhibitor, LY2603618, to decrease Mcl-1 and enhance ABT-199 efficacy. We found that LY2603618 treatment resulted in abolishment of the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint and increased DNA damage, which was partially dependent on CDK activity. LY2603618 treatment resulted in decrease of Mcl-1, which coincided with the initiation of apoptosis. Overexpression of Mcl-1 in AML cells significantly attenuated apoptosis induced by LY2603618, confirming the critical role of Mcl-1 in apoptosis induced by the agent. Simultaneous treatment with LY2603618 and ABT-199 resulted in synergistic induction of apoptosis in both AML cell lines and primary patient samples. Our findings provide new insights into overcoming a mechanism of intrinsic ABT-199 resistance in AML cells and support the clinical development of combined ABT-199 and CHK1 inhibition.","['Zhao, Jianyun', 'Niu, Xiaojia', 'Li, Xinyu', 'Edwards, Holly', 'Wang, Guan', 'Wang, Yue', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Lin, Hai', 'Ge, Yubin']","['Zhao J', 'Niu X', 'Li X', 'Edwards H', 'Wang G', 'Wang Y', 'Taub JW', 'Lin H', 'Ge Y']","['National Engineering Laboratory for AIDS Vaccine, Key Laboratory for Molecular Enzymology and Engineering, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, MI, USA."", 'National Engineering Laboratory for AIDS Vaccine, Key Laboratory for Molecular Enzymology and Engineering, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'National Engineering Laboratory for AIDS Vaccine, Key Laboratory for Molecular Enzymology and Engineering, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Molecular Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'National Engineering Laboratory for AIDS Vaccine, Key Laboratory for Molecular Enzymology and Engineering, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, MI, USA."", 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Molecular Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'THP-1 Cells', 'U937 Cells']",2016/05/12 06:00,2017/12/30 06:00,['2016/05/12 06:00'],"['2016/02/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jun 7;7(23):34785-99. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9185.,10.18632/oncotarget.9185 [doi],,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (LY2603618)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",PMC5085189,['NOTNLM'],"['ABT-199', 'CHK1', 'LY2603618', 'Mcl-1', 'acute myeloid leukemia']",['The authors declare no competing financial interests.'],"['9185 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9185 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods and results: Ninety-four (53 males) adult survivors of childhood leukaemias aged 22.2 +/- 5.5 years and 66 (36 males) healthy controls were studied retrospectively. Diastolic wall strain and calibrated integrated backscatter (cIB) were measured as indices of myocardial stiffness and fibrosis, respectively. Left and right ventricular (RV) diastolic and torsional mechanics were interrogated using speckle tracking echocardiography. Patients had significantly lower LV DWS, and hence stiffer LV myocardium, and greater myocardial cIB in patients than controls (all P < 0.001). Left ventricular longitudinal, radial, and circumferential early diastolic strain rates, circumferential late diastolic strain rate, and peak twisting and untwisting velocities, tricuspid annular early diastolic velocity, and RV-free wall longitudinal early diastolic strain rate were significantly lower in patients than controls (all P < 0.05). Diastolic wall strain correlated inversely with myocardial cIB, and positively with LV longitudinal, radial, and circumferential early diastolic strain rates (all P < 0.05), while myocardial cIB correlated inversely with LV radial and circumferential early diastolic strain rates, circumferential late diastolic strain rate, peak twisting and untwisting velocities, and tricuspid annular e velocity (all P < 0.05). Conclusion: In adult survivors of childhood leukaemias, despite the preservation of LV ejection fraction, increased stiffness of the LV myocardium is evident and is associated with myocardial fibrosis and impaired ventricular diastolic function.","['Li, Vivian Wing-Yi', 'Cheuk, Daniel Ka-Leung', 'Cheng, Frankie Wai-Tsoi', 'Yang, Janet Yee-Kwan', 'Yau, Jeffrey Ping-Wa', 'Ho, Karin Ka-Huen', 'Li, Chi-Kong', 'Li, Rever Chak-Ho', 'Yuen, Hui-Leung', 'Ling, Alvin Siu-Cheung', 'Chan, Godfrey Chi-Fung', 'Cheung, Yiu-Fai']","['Li VW', 'Cheuk DK', 'Cheng FW', 'Yang JY', 'Yau JP', 'Ho KK', 'Li CK', 'Li RC', 'Yuen HL', 'Ling AS', 'Chan GC', 'Cheung YF']","['Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sha Tin, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Tuen Mun Hospital, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Yau Ma Tei, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Princess Margaret Hospital, Kwai Chung, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sha Tin, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Tuen Mun Hospital, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Yau Ma Tei, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Princess Margaret Hospital, Kwai Chung, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging,European heart journal.

However, number of years of life lost (YLL) is a more appropriate indicator in some cases. We have calculated the YLL of adult cancers and its trend over the past few years in Yazd to provide planners with baseline data. Data obtained from death registration system were used to calculate the YLL, based on each individual's age at death, and the standardized expected YLL method was applied with a discount rate of 0.03, an age weight of 0.04, and a correction factor of 0.165. All data were analyzed and prepared in Epi6 and Excel 2007. A total of 3,850 death records were analyzed. Some 550 patients in Yazd province aged >/=20 die annually due to cancer (male: female ratio 1.3). The average ages at death in lung, CNS, breast cancer and leukemia cases were 68.5, 59, 58.7 and 61, respectively. The age group of 40-59 with 21 % had the highest cancer mortality percentage. Premature cancer deaths have caused 40,753 YLL (5,823 YLL annually). Females lose on average more life years to cancer than do men (11.6 vs 9.8 years). Lung cancer (12.1%), CNS tumors (11.7%) and leukemia (11.4 %) were the leading causes terms of YLL due to all cancers in both sexes. From 2004 to 2010, cancer-caused YLL as a fraction of all YLL increased from 12.8 to 15.2 %. This study can help in the assessment of health care needs and prioritization. Cancer is the major cause of deaths and the trend is increasing. The use of YLLs is a better index for measurement of premature mortality for ranking of diseases than is death counts. Longer periods of observation will make these trends more robust and will help to evaluate and develop, better public health interventions.","['Mirzaei, Mohsen', 'Mirzadeh, Mahboobahsadat', 'Mirzaei, Mojtaba']","['Mirzaei M', 'Mirzadeh M', 'Mirzaei M']","['Department of Community Medicine, Health Monitoring Research Center Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, IranE-mail: drmmirzadeh@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Health Status', 'Health Status Disparities', 'Humans', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Life Expectancy/*trends', 'Longevity', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality/*trends', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",2016/05/12 06:00,2017/02/10 06:00,['2016/05/12 06:00'],"['2016/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/10 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2016;17(S3):101-5. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2016.17.s3.101.,,,,,,,,['10.7314/apjcp.2016.17.s3.101 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subcellular localization and immunoprecipitation coupled mass spectrometry demonstrated that a proportion of plant homeodomain (PHD) finger protein 6 (PHF6) protein is localized within the nucleolus and interacts with proteins involved in ribosomal processing. PHF6 sequence variants cause Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome (BFLS, MIM#301900) and are also associated with a female-specific phenotype overlapping with Coffin-Siris syndrome (MIM#135900), T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (MIM#613065), and acute myeloid leukemia (MIM#601626); however, very little is known about its cellular function, including its nucleolar role. HEK 293T cells were treated with RNase A, DNase I, actinomycin D, or 5,6-dichloro-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimadole, followed by immunocytochemistry to determine PHF6 sub-nucleolar localization. We observed RNA-dependent localization of PHF6 to the sub-nucleolar fibrillar center (FC) and dense fibrillar component (DFC), at whose interface rRNA transcription occurs. Subsequent ChIP-qPCR analysis revealed strong enrichment of PHF6 across the entire rDNA-coding sequence but not along the intergenic spacer (IGS) region. When rRNA levels were quantified in a PHF6 gain-of-function model, we observed an overall decrease in rRNA transcription, accompanied by a modest increase in repressive promoter-associated RNA (pRNA) and a significant increase in the expression levels of the non-coding IGS36RNA and IGS39RNA transcripts. Collectively, our results demonstrate a role for PHF6 in carefully mediating the overall levels of ribosome biogenesis within a cell.","['Todd, Matthew A M', 'Huh, Michael S', 'Picketts, David J']","['Todd MA', 'Huh MS', 'Picketts DJ']","['Regenerative Medicine Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Regenerative Medicine Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Regenerative Medicine Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Hum Genet,European journal of human genetics : EJHG,9302235,IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Ribosomal/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins']",2016/05/12 06:00,2017/06/18 06:00,['2016/05/12 06:00'],"['2016/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Eur J Hum Genet. 2016 Oct;24(10):1453-9. doi: 10.1038/ejhg.2016.40.

Pharmacokinetic dosing of busulfan (Bu) is frequently done for myeloablative conditioning, but evidence for its use is limited in RIC transplants. We compared transplant outcomes of FB versus FM using i.v. Bu targeted to the area under the curve (AUC). A total of 134 RIC transplants (47 FB and 87 FM) for acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome were identified, and median follow-up of the cohort was 40 months (range, 0 to 63.3). A significantly higher 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was associated with FB versus FM at 35.6% versus 17.3%, respectively (P = .0058). Furthermore, 2-year progression-free survival rates were higher for FM versus FB at 60.5% versus 48.7%, respectively (P = .04). However, 2-year rates of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and overall survival (OS) were similar. The need for dose adjustment based on AUC did not alter relapse risk or NRM. Patients with Karnofsky performance status >/= 90 who received FM had a 2-year OS rate of 74.8% versus 48.3% for FB (P = .03). FB use remained prognostic for relapse in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio, 2.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.28 to 5.89; P = .0097). In summary, in spite of AUC-directed dosing, FB compared with FM was associated with a significantly higher CIR.","['Damlaj, Moussab', 'Alkhateeb, Hassan B', 'Hefazi, Mehrdad', 'Partain, Daniel K', 'Hashmi, Shahrukh', 'Gastineau, Dennis A', 'Al-Kali, Aref', 'Wolf, Robert C', 'Gangat, Naseema', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Hogan, William J', 'Patnaik, Mrinal M']","['Damlaj M', 'Alkhateeb HB', 'Hefazi M', 'Partain DK', 'Hashmi S', 'Gastineau DA', 'Al-Kali A', 'Wolf RC', 'Gangat N', 'Litzow MR', 'Hogan WJ', 'Patnaik MM']","['Division of Hematology & HSCT, Department of Oncology, King AbdulAziz Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.

We considered the hypothesis that the various classes of peripheral leukocytes differentially regulate the synthesis of 5-methylcytosine (5mCG) and its removal via Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) dioxygenase catalyzed hydroxymethylation to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmCG), reflecting their responsiveness to environment. Although it is known that reductions in TET1 and/or TET2 activity lead to the over-proliferation of various leukocyte precursors in bone marrow and in development of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and myeloproliferative neoplasms, the role of 5mCG hydroxymethylation in peripheral blood is less well studied. RESULTS: We developed simplified protocols to rapidly and reiteratively isolate non-overlapping leukocyte populations from a single small sample of fresh or frozen whole blood. Among peripheral leukocyte types we found extreme variation in the levels of transcripts encoding proteins involved in cytosine methylation (DNMT1, 3A, 3B), the turnover of 5mC by demethylation (TET1, 2, 3), and DNA repair (GADD45A, B, G) and in the global and gene-region-specific levels of DNA 5hmCG (CD4+ T cells>>CD14+ monocytes>CD16+ neutrophils>CD19+ B cells>CD56+ NK cells>Siglec8+ eosinophils>CD8+ T cells). CONCLUSIONS: Our data taken together suggest a potential hierarchy of responsiveness among classes of leukocytes with CD4+, CD8+ T cells and CD14+ monocytes being the most distinctly poised for a rapid methylome response to physiological stress and disease.","['Hohos, Natalie M', 'Lee, Kevin', 'Ji, Lexiang', 'Yu, Miao', 'Kandasamy, Muthugapatti M', 'Phillips, Bradley G', 'Baile, Clifton A', 'He, Chuan', 'Schmitz, Robert J', 'Meagher, Richard B']","['Hohos NM', 'Lee K', 'Ji L', 'Yu M', 'Kandasamy MM', 'Phillips BG', 'Baile CA', 'He C', 'Schmitz RJ', 'Meagher RB']","['Department of Foods and Nutrition, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA.

Cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and the followed activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3 are the important steps. Now, a new mitochondrial protein, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), has been shown to have relationship with the caspase-independent apoptotic pathway. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of propofol through inhibiting AIF-mediated apoptosis induced by whole cerebral I/R injury in rats. 120 Wistar rats that obtained the permission of the animal care committee of Harbin Medical University were randomly divided into three groups: sham group (S group), cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury group (I/R group), and propofol treatment group (P group). Propofol (1.0mg/kg/min) was administered intravenously for 1h before the induction of ischemia in P group. The apoptotic rate in three groups was detected by flow cytometry after 24h of reperfusion. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) changes were detected via microplate reader. The expressions of B-cell leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) and AIF were evaluated using Western blot after 6h, 24h and 48h of reperfusion. The results of our study showed that apoptotic level was lower in P group compared with I/R group and propofol could protect MMP. The ratio of Bcl-2/Bax was significantly higher in P group compared with I/R group. The translocation of AIF from mitochondrial to nucleus was lower in P group than that in I/R group. Our findings suggested that the protective effects of propofol on cerebral I/R injury might be associated with inhibiting translocation of AIF from mitochondrial to the nucleus in hippocampal neurons.","['Tao, Tao', 'Li, Chun-Lei', 'Yang, Wan-Chao', 'Zeng, Xian-Zhang', 'Song, Chun-Yu', 'Yue, Zi-Yong', 'Dong, Hong', 'Qian, Hua']","['Tao T', 'Li CL', 'Yang WC', 'Zeng XZ', 'Song CY', 'Yue ZY', 'Dong H', 'Qian H']","['Department of Anesthesiology, China and Heilongjiang Key Laboratory for Anesthesia and Critical Care, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150081, China.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, China and Heilongjiang Key Laboratory for Anesthesia and Critical Care, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150081, China.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, China and Heilongjiang Key Laboratory for Anesthesia and Critical Care, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150081, China.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, China and Heilongjiang Key Laboratory for Anesthesia and Critical Care, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150081, China.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, China and Heilongjiang Key Laboratory for Anesthesia and Critical Care, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150081, China.

However, it is unclear whether older patients have benefited to the same extent as younger patients. This study examines changes in survival for older patients with the 7 most common hematologic malignancies. METHODS: Period analysis was used to examine survival for patients who were 65 years old or older and were diagnosed with a common hematologic malignancy between 1992 and 2012 with data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. RESULTS: Five-year relative survival increased for older patients with hematologic malignancies with the partial exception of acute myelogenous leukemia, for which no change in survival was seen for patients who were 75 years old or older. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including the oldest patients, had especially strong improvements, with increases in 5-year relative survival for patients who were 85 years old or older of 31.5% and 39.6%, respectively, between 1997-2000 and 2009-2012. CONCLUSIONS: Despite these increases, survival rates did not reach those observed for patients aged 50 to 59 years for any hematologic malignancy. Newer therapies and a better understanding of how to treat older patients have led to increased survival expectations for older patients with most hematologic malignancies, but an age-related survival disparity persists.

PROCEDURE: One hundred children with low-risk ALL, who were treated according to the St. Jude Total therapy XV, were recruited. The recruited children were receiving MTX and 6-MP during maintenance phase. Patients were excluded from the study if they had other types of leukemia. Genotyping analyses for the thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes were performed using a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-RFLP (where RFLP is restriction fragment length polymorphism) protocols. Relevant clinical data on adverse drug reactions were collected objectively (blinded to genotypes) from the patient medical records. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between the combined presence of HCV and TPMT*3B G460A gene polymorphisms and grades 2-4 hepatotoxicity as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation (P < 0.04). The same observation was seen when comparing either the presence of HCV alone or the presence of the gene polymorphism alone. A significant association between the combined presence of HCV and MTHFR C677T polymorphism and grades 2-4 hepatotoxicity as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), AST, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) elevation was observed (P values <0.001, 0.02, and 0.001, respectively). The presence of HCV infection had a significant negative effect on hepatic transaminases. CONCLUSIONS: The present data support a role for combining analysis of genetic variation in drug-metabolizing enzymes and the presence of HCV in the assessment of specific drugs toxicities in multiagent chemotherapeutic treatment regimens.","['Abdelaziz, Doaa H', 'Elhosseiny, Noha M', 'Khaleel, Sahar A', 'Sabry, Nirmeen A', 'Attia, Ahmed S', 'El-Sayed, Manal H']","['Abdelaziz DH', 'Elhosseiny NM', 'Khaleel SA', 'Sabry NA', 'Attia AS', 'El-Sayed MH']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacy, National Hepatology and Tropical Medicine Research Institute, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology-Oncology Division, Faculty of Medicine, Ain-Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Hepacivirus/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Liver/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*adverse effects', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/genetics', 'Methyltransferases/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/virology']",2016/05/11 06:00,2017/06/22 06:00,['2016/05/11 06:00'],"['2015/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Sep;63(9):1539-45. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26045.

However, several studies show heterogeneity in HHD ALL and suggest that the favourable prognosis is associated rather with higher ploidy defined by DNA index (DNAi) >/= 1.16 or with a presence of specific single or combined trisomies. HHD ALL with DNAi < 1.16 are only rarely studied separately. Using single nucleotide polymorphism array, we analysed 89 childhood HHD ALL patients divided into groups with lower (<1.16; n = 34) and higher (>/=1.16; n = 55) DNAi. We assessed treatment response, presence of secondary aberrations, mutations in RAS pathway genes and CREBBP and also gene expression profile (GEP) to reveal differences between the two subgroups. Cases with 51-54 chromosomes had DNAi 1.1-1.16 and cases with 55-67 chromosomes had DNAi >/= 1.16. The groups with lower and higher DNAi had distinct response to early treatment and distinct GEP. The better response of the group with higher DNAi was associated with specific trisomies (trisomy of chromosome 10 or combined with trisomies 4 and/or 17). Our results suggest that cytogenetically defined HHD ALL can in fact be divided into two biologically distinguishable subgroups and that DNAi 1.16 is a relevant value to separate between the two.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study which was performed by reviewing the medical records of 95 patients with leukemia complicated with biopsy-proven mucormycosis admitted to the educational hospitals affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences over a 21-year period. We recorded demographic information including age and sex and disease characteristics such as type of leukemia, site of involvement, paraclinical findings at the time of admission and the outcome of the patients. The incidence of mucormycosis in leukemia was determined by identifying the number of leukemia patients diagnosed within the last 17 years. RESULTS: The male to female ratio was 2.39:1 in of 95 patients studied. The overall incidence rate of mucormycosis was 4.27 per 100 leukemic patients in last 17 years which showed a decreasing trend from 2001 to 2011. The most frequent type of leukemia was acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) which was found in 58 patients (61.5%). The most common site of initial tumor involvement was sinonasal (90.16%). The mortality rate was about 54%, compared to the mortality rate of about 43.24% in patients with best prognosis of AML. CONCLUSION: The incidence of mucormycosis in leukemia showed a decreasing trend in our country and its recent incidence is comparable to that of other regions. The best preventive method against this lethal infection is to modify and control the environment which reduces the risk of exposure to air-born fungal spores.","['S Sarvestani, Amene', 'Pishdad, Gholamreza', 'Bolandparvaz, Shahram']","['S Sarvestani A', 'Pishdad G', 'Bolandparvaz S']","['Department of Surgery, Imam-Ali Education Hospital, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Trauma Research Center, Shahid Rajaee (Emtiaz) Trauma Hospital, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Iran,Bull Emerg Trauma,Bulletin of emergency and trauma,101614018,,,2014/01/01 00:00,2014/01/01 00:01,['2016/05/11 06:00'],"['2016/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Bull Emerg Trauma. 2014 Jan;2(1):38-43.,,,,PMC4771258,['NOTNLM'],"['Iran', 'Leukemia', 'Mucormycosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This retrospective case control study, reviewed the medical records of 162 patients with pathologically confirmed diagnosis of mucormycosis hospitalized in two major Shiraz University hospitals during the last 21 years. For each diabetic patient, two patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) matched for age, sex and the date of admission was selected as control group. Age, type of diabetes mellitus (DM) and duration of involvement as well as paraclinical findings were compared between cases and controls. RESULTS: There were 162 patients with murormycosis of which 30 (18.5%) had DM as predisposing factor. Diabetes was the second common predisposing disease next to leukemia. There were 19 (63.3%) women and 11 (36.7%) men among the patients. The overall mortality rate was 53.33% mortality rate. The mean age of the patients was 45.3 +/- 17.6 years. The mean duration of diabetes in case and control groups were 5.75 +/- 5.43 and 7.2 +/- 7.85 years respectively, without any statistical significance between them (p=0.063). Blood sugar in patients was lower than control group (p=0.012). Serum bicarbonate level in case group was higher than in control group (p<0.001). Arterial pH in control group was more acidic than case group (p<0.001). Insulin dependent DM was significantly more prevalent in control group compared to case group (73.4% vs. 36.6%; p=0.002). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the number of hospitalized patients with mucormycosis over the last 7 years has been decreased which is due to better control of infection in diabetics. In addition to hyperglycemia and acidosis, several other unknown factors like immune defects may predispose diabetics to this fungal infection.","['S Sarvestani, Amene', 'Pishdad, Gholamreza', 'Bolandparvaz, Shahram']","['S Sarvestani A', 'Pishdad G', 'Bolandparvaz S']","['Department of Surgery, Imam-Ali Hospital, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Endocrine and Metabolism Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Trauma Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Iran,Bull Emerg Trauma,Bulletin of emergency and trauma,101614018,,,2013/10/01 00:00,2013/10/01 00:01,['2016/05/11 06:00'],"['2016/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/01 00:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Bull Emerg Trauma. 2013 Oct;1(4):164-70.,,,,PMC4789452,['NOTNLM'],"['Diabetes mellitus', 'Iran', 'Mucormycosis', 'Predisposing factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These small (0.1-1 muM) nuclear structures contain both constant [e.g., promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), Sp100, death-domain associated protein (Daxx), and so forth] and variable proteins, depending on the function of the cells or the stress to which they are exposed. The amounts of PML and the number of ND10 structures increase in cells exposed to IFN-beta. On initiation of HSV-1 gene expression, ICP0, a viral E3 ligase, degrades both PML and Sp100. The earlier report that IFN-beta is significantly more effective in blocking viral replication in murine PML(+/+) cells than in sibling PML(-/-) cells, reproduced here with human cells, suggests that PML acts as an effector of antiviral effects of IFN-beta. To define more precisely the function of PML in HSV-1 replication, we constructed a PML(-/-) human cell line. We report that in PML(-/-) cells, Sp100 degradation is delayed, possibly because colocalization and merger of ICP0 with nuclear bodies containing Sp100 and Daxx is ineffective, and that HSV-1 replicates equally well in parental HEp-2 and PML(-/-) cells infected at 5 pfu wild-type virus per cell, but poorly in PML(-/-) cells exposed to 0.1 pfu per cell. Finally, ICP0 accumulation is reduced in PML(-/-) infected at low, but not high, multiplicities of infection. In essence, the very mechanism that serves to degrade an antiviral IFN-beta effector is exploited by HSV-1 to establish an efficient replication domain in the nucleus.","['Xu, Pei', 'Mallon, Stephen', 'Roizman, Bernard']","['Xu P', 'Mallon S', 'Roizman B']","['Marjorie B.

One of these strategies is to use small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). A major challenge here is the siRNA delivery into the cells. The purpose of this study was to design and prepare a biocompatible, biodegradable, and safe nanosized particle for siRNA delivery into human breast cancer MCF-7 and leukemia K562 cells. Chemically synthesized magnetic nanoparticles containing polyethyleneglycol-lactate polymer (PEG-LAC), chitosan, and polyethyleneimine (PEI) were successfully prepared and used as a gene delivery vehicle. The nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and zeta potential. The Fe3O4-PEG-LAC-chitosan-PEI nanoparticle showed efficient and stable survivin siRNA loading in gel retardation assay. The cytotoxicity of the prepared nanoparticle was studied using 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay and was compared with that of mitoxantrone (MTX) in combination with the prepared siRNA delivery system to evaluate the possible synergic effect of MTX and survivin siRNA. The nanoparticles with and without noncomplementary siRNA showed low toxicity against both cell lines; however, a twofold decrease was observed in cell survival percent after MTX addition to MCF-7 cells treated with either nanoparticle itself or complexed with noncomplementary siRNA. While survivin siRNA nanoplex caused threefold decrease in the cell survival percent, its combination with MTX did not result in a significant increase in the cytotoxic effect. Therefore, Fe3O4-PEG-LAC-chitosan-PEI nanoparticle should be considered as a potential carrier for enhanced survivin siRNA delivery into MCF-7 and K562 cells.","['Arami, S', 'Rashidi, M R', 'Mahdavi, M', 'Fathi, M', 'Entezami, A A']","['Arami S', 'Rashidi MR', 'Mahdavi M', 'Fathi M', 'Entezami AA']","['1 Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', '2 Research Center for Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', '2 Research Center for Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', '3 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', '4 Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Science, University Of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.', '5 Laboratory of Polymer, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.', '5 Laboratory of Polymer, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hum Exp Toxicol,Human & experimental toxicology,9004560,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chitosan/*chemistry', 'Ferrosoferric Oxide/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*genetics', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*chemistry', 'Polyethyleneimine/*chemistry', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*administration & dosage', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Survivin']",2016/05/11 06:00,2017/03/30 06:00,['2016/05/11 06:00'],"['2016/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/30 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Exp Toxicol. 2017 Mar;36(3):227-237. doi: 10.1177/0960327116646618.

Here, we investigated this question in nonpermissive HLA-DPB1 T-cell epitope (TCE) mismatches reflected by numerical functional distance (FD) scores, assignable to all HLA-DPB1 alleles based on the combined impact of 12 polymorphic AAs. We calculated the difference in FD scores (DeltaFD) of mismatched HLA-DPB1 alleles in patients and their 10/10 HLA-matched unrelated donors of 379 HCTs performed at our center for acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Receiver-operator curve-based stratification into 2 DeltaFD subgroups showed a significantly higher percentage of nonpermissive TCE mismatches for DeltaFD >2.665, compared with DeltaFD </=2.665 (88% vs 25%, P < .0001). In multivariate analysis, DeltaFD >2.665 was significantly associated with overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.87; P < .021) and event-free survival (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.05-1.82; P < .021), compared with DeltaFD </=2.665. These associations were stronger than those observed for TCE mismatches. There was a marked but not statistically significant increase in the hazards of relapse and nonrelapse mortality in the high DeltaFD subgroup, whereas no differences were observed for acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease. Seven nonconservative AA substitutions in peptide-binding positions had a significantly stronger impact on DeltaFD compared with 5 others (P = .0025), demonstrating qualitative differences in the relative impact of AA polymorphism in HLA-DPB1. The novel concept of DeltaFD sheds new light onto nonpermissive HLA-DPB1 mismatches in unrelated HCT.","['Crivello, Pietro', 'Heinold, Andreas', 'Rebmann, Vera', 'Ottinger, Hellmut D', 'Horn, Peter A', 'Beelen, Dietrich W', 'Fleischhauer, Katharina']","['Crivello P', 'Heinold A', 'Rebmann V', 'Ottinger HD', 'Horn PA', 'Beelen DW', 'Fleischhauer K']","['Institute for Experimental Cellular Therapy.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, and.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, and.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany; and.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, and German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany; and.', 'Institute for Experimental Cellular Therapy, German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Allografts', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'HLA-DP beta-Chains/*genetics', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/mortality/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/mortality/therapy', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Survival Rate', '*Tissue Donors']",2016/05/11 06:00,2017/07/28 06:00,['2016/05/11 06:00'],"['2015/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jul 7;128(1):120-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-12-686238.

The complexity of clonal architecture has been known for many years in the setting of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), based on karyotyping studies. However the true complexity of AMLs is only now being understood thanks to in depth genome sequencing studies in humans, which reveal that heterogeneity is a multilayered and involves not only the genome but also the epigenome. Here, we review recent advances in genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity and clonal dynamics in AML and their relevance to biology, clinical outcomes and therapeutic implications. Special attention is focused on somatic mutations affecting regulators of cytosine methylation, since these tend to occur early in disease evolution, reprogram the epigenome of hematopoietic stem cells, and are linked to unfavorable outcome.","['Li, Sheng', 'Mason, Christopher E', 'Melnick, Ari']","['Li S', 'Mason CE', 'Melnick A']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA; The HRH Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsaud Institute for Computational Biomedicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA; The HRH Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsaud Institute for Computational Biomedicine, New York, NY, USA; The Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute (BMRI), New York, NY, USA.

Recent studies have led to the hypothesis that neuropsychological adverse effects may be a result of cortisol depletion of the cerebral mineralocorticoid receptors. We examined whether including a physiologic dose of hydrocortisone in dexamethasone treatment can reduce neuropsychologic and metabolic adverse effects in children with ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial with a crossover design. Of 116 potentially eligible patients (age 3 to 16 years), 50 were enrolled and were treated with two consecutive courses of dexamethasone in accordance with Dutch Childhood Oncology Group ALL protocols. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either hydrocortisone or placebo in a circadian rhythm (10 mg/m(2)/d) during both dexamethasone courses. Primary outcome measure was parent-reported Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire in Dutch, which assesses psychosocial problems. Other end points included questionnaires, neuropsychological tests, and metabolic parameters. RESULTS: Of 48 patients who completed both courses, hydrocortisone had no significant effect on outcome; however, a more detailed analysis revealed that in 16 patients who developed clinically relevant psychosocial adverse effects, addition of hydrocortisone substantially reduced their Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire in Dutch scores in the following domains: total difficulties, emotional symptoms, conduct problems, and impact of difficulties. Moreover, in nine patients who developed clinically relevant, sleep-related difficulties, addition of hydrocortisone reduced total sleeping problems and disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep. In contrast, hydrocortisone had no effect on metabolic parameters. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that adding a physiologic dose of hydrocortisone to dexamethasone treatment can reduce the occurrence of serious neuropsychological adverse effects and sleep-related difficulties in pediatric patients with ALL.","['Warris, Lidewij T', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', 'Aarsen, Femke K', 'Pluijm, Saskia M F', 'Bierings, Marc B', 'van den Bos, Cor', 'Zwaan, Christian M', 'Thygesen, Helene H', 'Tissing, Wim J E', 'Veening, Margreet A', 'Pieters, Rob', 'van den Akker, Erica L T']","['Warris LT', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Aarsen FK', 'Pluijm SM', 'Bierings MB', 'van den Bos C', 'Zwaan CM', 'Thygesen HH', 'Tissing WJ', 'Veening MA', 'Pieters R', 'van den Akker EL']","[""Lidewij T.

METHODS: We conducted a population-based, retrospective large-scale cohort study on 7125 newly diagnosed PD patients who had just initiated anti-parkinsonian medications between 1.1.2000 and 12.31.2012; all members of Maccabi Health Services (MHS), a large Israeli HMO. Cancer incidence during the same period was collected from MHS cancer-registry. Standardized-Incidence-Ratio (SIR) accounting for age, chronological-year and sex were calculated to compare cancer risks of PD patients to that of MHS population. RESULTS: The PD cohort (54% males) had a mean age at initiation of anti-parkinsonian medications of 71.2 +/- 10.3years. In a time-window of 6.6 +/- 3.4years before and 4.0 +/- 3.9years after PD was first treated, 21% of the men and 15% of the women were diagnosed with incident-cancer. We found no-difference in any cancer risk for the PD cohort compared to the reference population: SIR = 0.99 (95%CI: 0.92-1.06) for males and 0.98 (95%CI: 0.89-1.07) for females. Risks for lung and colon cancers in the PD cohort were significantly lower for both sexes compared to the reference population. Risks for breast, central nervous system, kidney, leukemia, lymphoma, melanoma, ovarian, pancreatic, prostatic, rectal and thyroid were similar for the two populations. The SIRs did not differ between the sexes. CONCLUSIONS: We found no difference in the risk of any-type of cancer among PD patients compared to the general population, focusing on 10yrs time-window around the initiation of anti-parkinsonian medications.","['Peretz, Chava', 'Gurel, Ron', 'Rozani, Violet', 'Gurevich, Tanya', 'El-Ad, Baruch', 'Tsamir, Judith', 'Giladi, Nir']","['Peretz C', 'Gurel R', 'Rozani V', 'Gurevich T', 'El-Ad B', 'Tsamir J', 'Giladi N']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'The Neurological Institute, Tel Aviv Medical Center, Israel.', 'Maccabi Healthcare Services, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Maccabi Healthcare Services, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Sagol School of Neuroscience, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel; The Neurological Institute, Tel Aviv Medical Center, Siertazki Chair in Neurology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Sagol School of Neuroscience, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.

Isn't this one of reasons that venous thromboembolism (VTE) including catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) retain high frequency despite of modern antithrombotic therapy? AIM: The aim was to investigate rheological behavior of blood in patients with some myeloproliferative neoplasms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 16 adults with Polycythemia Vera (PV), 42 young with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and 67 healthy donors as control group. Of patients 38% had thrombosis. We measured plasma viscosity, and whole blood viscosity (WBV) by shear rate from 300 to 5 s-1. Then indices were calculated for erythrocyte aggregation, and deformability, and non-Newtonian behavior of blood. Hematocrit, erythrocytes count, erythrocyte indices, leukocyte count, fibrinogen and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) were analyzed simultaneously. RESULTS: Increased WBV revealed totally in PV-patients but not by all shear rates in ALL-patients. Unlike donor, in patients WBV values had no equivalence under sequential one sample measurements with a decrease and then an increase of shear rates. We speculated this difference becomes diagnostic meaning like one and by its size. WBV dependent on leukocytes count, on MCH and mainly on MCV. Forty percent of patients had elevated BNP assuming subclinical cardiac dysfunction. The latter explains discoordinated changes in shear stress values required for fully reversible erythrocyte aggregation. As a result, residual units like ""erythrocyte-erythrocyte"" and/or ""erythrocyte-leukocyte"" interferes blood stream and violates mechanically blood flow in small vessels. Moreover in PV-patients but not in ALL-patients we found loss of non-Newtonian behavior of blood later than in control group. Both myeloproliferative neoplasms lead to increased erythrocyte aggregation but not impair deformability of red blood cells. In total these facts explains chronic hypoxia in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with some myeloproliferative neoplasms has abnormal blood flow properties. Revealed hemorheologic disturbances could be as a trigger to start of VTE or to growth of blood clot in the area of permanent venous catheter. These non-hemocoagulation conditions leaded for thrombus formation makes hemorheologic therapy looking attractive for antithrombotic management. The choice of targeted methods requires to continue this study.","['Roitman, E V', 'Kolesnikova, I M', 'Davydkin, I L', 'Kozlova, N S', 'Roumiantsev, S A']","['Roitman EV', 'Kolesnikova IM', 'Davydkin IL', 'Kozlova NS', 'Roumiantsev SA']","['Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University.', 'Federal Scientific and Clinical Centre on Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology n.a.D.Rogachev, Moscow.', 'Samara State Medical University, Samara, Russia.', 'Samara State Medical University, Samara, Russia.', 'Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University; Federal Scientific and Clinical Centre on Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology n.a.D.Rogachev, Moscow.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,,,2016/05/11 06:00,2016/05/11 06:01,['2016/05/11 06:00'],"['2016/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/11 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2016 Apr;140 Suppl 1:S198. doi: 10.1016/S0049-3848(16)30192-X.

However, TKIs can induce serious hemostatic side effects including cardiovascular disease and bleeding disorders. Blood platelet aggregation and formation of pro-coagulant platelets are important to allow a well-balanced hemostatic response. Therefore, a detailed understanding of what effect different TKIs exert on platelets and hemostasis could help to understand if there are differences of importance to minimize the risk of bleeding complications in treated patients. AIM: To investigate how TKIs used in CML (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib) affect platelet activation and hemostasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have developed a multi-parameter six color flow cytometry protocol to study different aspects of platelet function upon activation, e.g. formation of aggregatory (PAC-1-positive) and pro-coagulant (phosphatidylserine-exposing) platelets, exocytosis of alpha- and lysosomal granules and mitochondrial membrane potential.This protocol was performed in presence or absence of TKIs in blood from normal donors and in treated patients. Whole blood aggregometry (Multiplate(R)), thrombin generation in platelet-rich plasma and in vitro thrombus formation by free oscillation rheometry (ReoRox G2) was further evaluated in some situations. RESULTS: At clinically relevant concentrations, dasatinib significantly decreased the formation of procoagulant platelets. Ponatinib induced a slight decrease in formation of procoagulant platelets, whereas bosutinib and nilotinib showed opposite tendencies (n=7). Dasatinib also decreased platelet aggregation (n=4-6) and in vitro thrombus formation (n=3). Thrombin generation was not significantly affected by therapeutic levels of TKIs, whereas higher doses of dasatinib, bosutinib, ponatinib and imatinib significantly changed one or several of the thrombin generation parameters (n=7-8). Interestingly, large differences in response to the drugs were observed among the healthy donors, especially for dasatinib and bosutinib. Major inter-individual variations were also observed in dasatinib-treated patients, see Figure 1. CONCLUSIONS: Different TKIs show varying potency to affect platelet-based hemostasis. In addition, we found large inter-individual variations in how some drugs affected platelet function. Therefore, we suggest that development of a clinically useful protocol for platelet function testing could help to identify patients more susceptible to adverse drug reactions. Such a protocol could potentially help clinicians to gain insight into the risk of side effects, which could help to choose the most suitable drug for each individual patient.","['Deb, S', 'Sjostrom, C', 'Tharmakulanathan, A', 'Boknas, N', 'Lotfi, K', 'Ramstrom, S']","['Deb S', 'Sjostrom C', 'Tharmakulanathan A', 'Boknas N', 'Lotfi K', 'Ramstrom S']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine.', 'Department of Haematology and Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine; Linkoping University, Sweden.', 'Department of Haematology and Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine; Linkoping University, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,,,2016/05/11 06:00,2016/05/11 06:01,['2016/05/11 06:00'],"['2016/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/11 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2016 Apr;140 Suppl 1:S196-7. doi: 10.1016/S0049-3848(16)30188-8.

About 50% of treated patients display minor bleedings and about 5% major bleedings. A defect of platelet function has been hypothesized and inhibition of signaling by glycoprotein (GP) VI, which is the receptor for collagen, has been previously described. Ibrutinib-associated bleedings and platelet dysfunction may be relevant in the context of aged patients, who are often under antithrombotic treatments. AIM: Aim of this study is to investigate and characterize the effect of ibrutinib on platelet function in vitro in patients with CLL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine patients recruited in ongoing ibrutinib clinical trials were studied. Assessment of spontaneous bleeding was performed using the WHO bleeding scale. The following tests were performed before and after initiation of treatment with ibrutinib: 1) Light transmission aggregometry (LTA) using platelet-rich-plasma (ADP 2-4muM, PAR1-AP 25 muM, Collagen 10 ug /mL, arachidonic acid 1 mM, ristocetin 0.6-1.2mg/mL) 2) Measurement of vWF antigen and ristocetin cofactor activities by chemiluminescent immunoassay. RESULTS: I) Five patients displayed grade 1 bleeding (cutaneous bleeding) and one patient grade 2 bleeding (rectal bleeding) (66.7%) after initiation of ibrutinib treatment. II) Eight patients displayed abnormalities of the aggregation by 10 ug/ml collagen after initiation of ibrutinib treatment. At high collagen concentration, only significant prolongation of the lag phase was measured (60.4+/-10.6sec vs basal 38.4+/-17sec), whereas the maximal aggregation was not impaired (67.9+/-21.4% vs basal 85.5+/-5.8%). Compared to previous reports, these results confirmed an impairment of collagen induced aggregation, but at these concentrations only the lag phase was affected. III) Five patients displayed a significant improvement of the aggregation by 2 uM (91.25+/-5.26% vs basal 39.3+/-24.62%) and 4 uM (91+/-2.83% vs basal 65.42+/-19.43%) ADP after initiation of ibrutinib treatment. IV) vWF antigen and ristocetin cofactor activity were measured in 3 patients. In all patients vWF levels were higher at the onset of the disease (169+/-38%) and reduced up to normal values under Ibrutinib treatment (111.4+/-47%). CONCLUSIONS: Ibrutinib treatment in LLC patients causes a mild bleeding phenotype most probably due to platelet dysfunction. In this study, collagen induced aggregation resulted impaired, whereas the aggregation by PAR1-AP, ristocetin and arachidonic acid was not affected. On the contrary, the aggregation by ADP was improved upon ibrutinib treatment. The levels of vonWillebrand factor are significantly higher in LLC patients before treatment and were normalized by ibrutinib.","['Alberelli, M A', 'Innocenti, I', 'Sica, S', 'Laurenti, L', 'De Candia, E']","['Alberelli MA', 'Innocenti I', 'Sica S', 'Laurenti L', 'De Candia E']","['Department of Oncology and Hematology; Institute of internal medicine.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology; Institute of hematology, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology; Institute of hematology, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology; Institute of hematology, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology; Institute of internal medicine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,,,2016/05/11 06:00,2016/05/11 06:01,['2016/05/11 06:00'],"['2016/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/11 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2016 Apr;140 Suppl 1:S196. doi: 10.1016/S0049-3848(16)30187-6.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are shed from normal and pathologic cells and express membrane proteins and antigens, reflecting their cellular origin. AIM: To explore whether bone marrow EVs of AML patients originate from blast cells and are capable of influencing hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in a pseudo-natural microenvironment obtained by co-culture of HSC with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone marrow (BM) samples were collected from healthy controls and patients with newly diagnosed AML at three time points: diagnosis, nadir and remission. EV concentration, cell origin and expression of coagulation proteins were characterized by FACS. Stem cells were obtained from Ficoll gradient of cord blood (CB) followed by CD34+ isolation. Cord blood stem cells with or without MSC were co-incubated with AML EVs. EV internalization was demonstrated by FACS-AMNIS and confocal microscopy. Mir-125b and -155 expressions in the cells were analyzed by RT-PCR. RESULTS: AML patients were enrolled in the study. The total BM-EVs number was higher in patients at first remission compared to controls, while blast EV counts (labeled with anti-CD34, CD33, CD117) were higher in patients at diagnosis compared to controls and to patients in remission. Internalization of CD117+/CD33+ BM-EVs to cord blood stem cells in the presence or absence of MSC was evaluated by FACS-AMNIS. Confocal microscopy of CD33+ stained EVs strengthens the findings and shows presence of EVs even in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Quantitative analysis of mir-125b and mir-155 expression in cord blood stem cells incubated with AML EVs revealed a clear tendency of increased expression in case of cell exposure to AML EVs in comparison to healthy control EVs. This tendency was emphasized in the presence of MSC. CONCLUSIONS: EVs of AML patients are generated from blast cells. By internalization into naive stem cells they can influence their differentiation. Moreover, the presence of mesenchymal stem cells is likely to be essential to the process.","['Tzoran, I', 'Rebibo-Sabbah, A', 'Brenner, B', 'Aharon, A']","['Tzoran I', 'Rebibo-Sabbah A', 'Brenner B', 'Aharon A']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus; Internal Medicine C, Rambam Health Care Campus; Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology; Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus; Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology; Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus; Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology; Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus; Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology; Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,,,2016/05/11 06:00,2016/05/11 06:01,['2016/05/11 06:00'],"['2016/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/11 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2016 Apr;140 Suppl 1:S193. doi: 10.1016/S0049-3848(16)30179-7.

One of the major adverse events noted in many MM clinical studies in patients treated with combination regimens including Thalidomide (Thal), Lenanlidomide (Len) and dexamethasone or chemotherapy was the development of hrombosis (Carrier et al., 2011). AIM: We have postulated that one mechanism for venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurrence may be through chemotherapy damage to endothelium (Date et al., 2013) and much recent work has centred on the study of soluble dysfunction markers to predict this event. In states of endothelial dysfunction soluble antigen concentrations of circulating endothelial activation markers sCD106 and sCD54 have been shown to increase (Burger and Touyz, 2012), and sCD106 was recently associated with inferior survival in newly diagnosed MM patients treated with Thal- or Len-based therapies (Terpos et al., 2013). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum from newly diagnosed and relapsed MM patients were collected before, during and after prescribed chemotherapy courses (minimum of 4 cycles). Levels of endothelial activation markers sCD106 and sCD54 were evaluated by quantitative ELISA (Platinum ELISA kits; eBioscience, Hatfield, UK). RESULTS: The percentage mean+/-SD change in the serum concentration of sCD106 increased by 25.8% after the first cycle of chemotherapy (T2; n=10) relative to T1 prior to chemotherapy administration. These levels subsequently decreased after the second cycle of chemotherapy (T3; n=9) and after completion (T4; n=5), but were still higher than baseline levels (15.5 and 15.3% increase in comparison to baseline, respectively). In contrast, the mean+/-SD percentage change in sCD54 relative to T1 were similar after the first cycle (T2; n=10) and the second cycle (T3; n=9), but increased by 15.0% after completion of chemotherapy (T4; n=5). Additionally, a statistical correlation was found to exist between the serum concentration of sCD106 and sCD54 (Pearson's correlation coefficient r=0.84, p <0.0005) for all analysed samples (n=39). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the increase in serum levels of both sCD106 and sCD54 after IMiD-based chemotherapy implies a disruptive effect of these combination regimens on the vascular endothelium. This agrees with previous studies where serum levels of sCD106 were shown to be significantly elevated in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients on Len indicating Len-induced endothelial dysfunction, and associated with subsequent DVT development (Aue et al., 2011). Our study confirms the potential significance of these biomarkers in demonstrating chemotherapy-induced endothelial damage. Correlation with VTE however is difficult as most MM patients on chemotherapy receive thromboprophylaxis as per international guidelines.","['Hall, J', 'Adesanya, M A', 'Madden, L A', 'Maraveyas, A']","['Hall J', 'Adesanya MA', 'Madden LA', 'Maraveyas A']","['Hull York Medical School, Universities of Hull and York.', 'Hull York Medical School, Universities of Hull and York.', 'School of Biological, Biomedical and Environmental Sciences, University of Hull, United Kingdom.', 'Hull York Medical School, Universities of Hull and York.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,,,2016/05/11 06:00,2016/05/11 06:01,['2016/05/11 06:00'],"['2016/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/11 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2016 Apr;140 Suppl 1:S187. doi: 10.1016/S0049-3848(16)30163-3.

Although generally regarded safe, infections and thrombotic events have occurred with PICC use, necessitating study to guide future clinical prophylaxis and management. AIM: 1) Determine the incidence of PICC associated thrombosis in patients with haematological malignancies 2) To identify clinically significant risk factors contributing to these complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cohort study, conducted in Cork University Hospital, between January 2010 and June 2015. After ethical approval Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) in radiology was used. All adult patients with PICC inserted under haematology were identified. A total of 90 patients with haematological malignancies who had PICC line placement were included. Patients' charts were reviewed in the medical record department. Data was collected using proforma sheets. This included patients demographs, type of malignancy, size of the PICC line, and total days of insertion. Haematological laboratory parameters were also recorded. The main outcome measures were PICC associated thrombosis and/or infection RESULTS: Of 131 PICC placements in a total of 90 patients. Out of these total PICC episodes 28.2% developed complications (n=37) and lead to removal. Thrombosis was found in 14.5% (n=19), 13.7% developed infection (n=18) and remaining were without complications. Of those with thrombosis (n=19), 7 patients had a diagnosis of Multiple Myeloma and 6 had Acute Myeloid Leukaemia. Whereas those with PICC associated infection (n=18), 5 had Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 5 had Acute Lymphoid Leukaemia. Diagnosis was significantly associated with complication (p=0.019). The mean age of patients who has PICC associated thrombosis was 51.6 years (+/-8.1 years). PICC removal as a result of complications was associated with increasing PICC lumen size; 30% of 5-French PICCs necessitated removal whereas 79.2% of 6-French PICCs necessitated removal (p=0.01). In addition, increased PICC lumen size was associated with clinically evident thrombophlebitis; 30% of 5-French PICCs displayed thrombophlebitis vs. 77%of 6-French PICCs displayed thrombophlebitis (p=0.017). Decreased in PICC lumen size was shown to influence the risk of complications; of 5 French catheters, 20% had thrombosis and 15% had infection, vs. 6 French catheters (13% and 13% respectively). Men were found to experience complications earlier with 80% of men having complications 1-50 days post PICC insertion and 12% 51-100 days post insertion. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of complications of PICC line insertion is relatively high in patients with haematological malignancies. Our institute thrombosis rate is similar to other studies. Haematological diagnosis was significantly associated with complication risk. Increased PICC lumen size was associated with higher removal rates as a result of complications and clinical signs of thrombophlebitis.","['McAuliffe, E', ""O'Shea, S"", 'Khan, M I']","['McAuliffe E', ""O'Shea S"", 'Khan MI']","['University College Cork.', 'Cork University Hospital; Cork, Ireland.', 'Cork University Hospital; Cork, Ireland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,,,2016/05/11 06:00,2016/05/11 06:01,['2016/05/11 06:00'],"['2016/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/11 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2016 Apr;140 Suppl 1:S176. doi: 10.1016/S0049-3848(16)30135-9.

The underlying pathomechanisms are still poorly understood. Recent experimental studies found an important role for the interaction between procoagulant neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and tissue factor (TF) in the pathogenesis of thrombosis. AIM: To investigate whether NETs and TF-bearing microvesicles (MVs) play a central role in cancer-related overt DIC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight cancer patients with overt DIC (ISTH score >/=5, 14 females, median age: 62 years [range: 21-80], 13 with solid tumors, 15 with acute leukemia) and 28 matched healthy controls were included. NET formation parameters (plasma DNA and nucleosomes), MVassociated TF activity, and routine coagulation parameters were determined at study inclusion. In 11 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), follow-up measurements were also performed. RESULTS: Plasma DNA, nucleosomes, and MV-TF activity were highly elevated in patients with cancer-related DIC compared to healthy individuals (all p-values<0.001). Strong correlations were found between plasma DNA and nucleosomes (Spearman correlation-coefficient: r=0.68), nucleosomes and MV-TF activity (r=0.62), and DNA and MV-TF activity (r=0.57). In multivariate regression, altered routine coagulation parameters were highly associated with NET parameters and MV-TF activity. In detail, a doubling in plasma DNA was associated with a 7.6% decrease in fibrinogen (p=0.012), a 15.3% decrease in platelet count (p=0.002), a 3.9% decrease in prothrombin time (p=0.014), and a 41.0% increase in D-dimer (p<0.001). A 10% increase in nucleosomes was associated with a 3.1% decrease in fibrinogen (p<0.001), a 5.0% decrease in platelet count (p<0.001), a 1.0% decrease in prothrombin time (p<0.009), and a 112.7% increase in D-dimer (p<0.001). A 10% increase in MV-TF activity was associated with a 4.9% decrease in fibrinogen (p<0.001), a 7.1% decrease in platelet count (p<0.001), a 1.3% decrease in prothrombin time (p<0.001), and a 15.5% increase in D-dimer (p<0.001). After initiation of chemotherapy in AML patients, NET parameters and MV-TF activity decreased significantly (nucleosomes: 3.3-fold decrease and normalization after 1 week; DNA: 1.2-fold decrease after 1 week and 1.5-fold decrease after 1 month; MV-TF activity: 10-fold decease after 1 week and normalization after 1 month) (Figure 1), and routine coagulation parameters improved. CONCLUSIONS: Our results add to experimental studies that have investigated the interaction between NETs and TF. Taken together, evidence indicates the presence of a liaison dangereuse between NETs and TF-bearing MVs, which could be the underlying cause of cancer-related overt DIC.","['Hell, L', 'Thaler, J', 'Martinod, K', 'Ay, C', 'Posch, F', 'Wagner, D D', 'Pabinger, I']","['Hell L', 'Thaler J', 'Martinod K', 'Ay C', 'Posch F', 'Wagner DD', 'Pabinger I']","['Clinical Division of Haematology and Haemostaseology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna; Austria.', 'Clinical Division of Haematology and Haemostaseology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna; Austria.', ""Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital; Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School; Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital; Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", 'Clinical Division of Haematology and Haemostaseology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna; Austria.', 'Clinical Division of Haematology and Haemostaseology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna; Austria.', ""Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital; Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School; Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital; Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", 'Clinical Division of Haematology and Haemostaseology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna; Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,,,2016/05/11 06:00,2016/05/11 06:01,['2016/05/11 06:00'],"['2016/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/11 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2016 Apr;140 Suppl 1:S174-5. doi: 10.1016/S0049-3848(16)30133-5.

The overall impact of VTE on cancer patients can be considerable. Targeted patient selection by identifying patients with clinically significant recurrent VTE may have wider health economic benefits whilst reducing patient risk through over-treatment. In the UK, dalteparin is one licensed anticoagulant for the extended treatment and prevention of recurrence of VTE in cancer patients. Rivaroxaban is a highly selective direct Factor Xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability. AIM: To assess VTE recurrence in selected cancer patients at risk of recurrence of VTE treated with rivaroxaban or dalteparin. The secondary objectives include safety, acceptability, biomarker identification and health economics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Select-d is a prospective, randomised, open label, multicentre pilot trial comparing dalteparin (200 IU/kg daily subcutaneously for 1 month and 150 IU/kg months 2-6); and rivaroxaban (15mg orally twice daily for 3 weeks and 20mg once daily for 6 months in total) for cancer patients with VTE - symptomatic and incidental pulmonary embolism (P)E or symptomatic lower limb proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - with a second placebo-controlled randomisation (rivaroxaban vs placebo) comparing the duration of therapy (6 vs 12 months) in all patients with PE and those with a DVT who are residual vein thrombosis (RVT) positive. 70% of DVT patients are estimated to be RVT positive after initial treatment. 530 patients are being recruited toprovide reliable estimates of the primary outcome (VTE recurrence rates) to within the 95% confidence interval of 8% assuming VTE rates are 10% at six months. RESULTS: As of 1st December 2015, 264 patients have been recruited from 61 open sites across the UK. Preliminary data indicate that the majority of patients presented with solid tumours (98%), ranging from early or locally advanced (41%) to metastatic disease (57%), and primarily comprising colorectal, lung, and breast malignancies. Only a small number of select-d patients presented with haematological malignancies (2%), which included; leukaemia, myeloma and lymphoma. Over half of the select-d patients had an incidental PE (54%); the remainder had symptomatic PE or DVT (46%). The median number of hours on anticoagulation prior to starting select-d randomised treatment was 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS: select-d is the first randomised trial for treatment of VTE, investigating the direct oral anticoagulants vs a low molecular weight heparin in patients with cancer. The results will support optimal treatment for this key patient group and are eagerly awaited.","['Young, A', 'Phillips, J', 'Hancocks, H', 'Hill, C', 'Joshi, N', 'Marshall, A', 'Grumett, J', 'Dunn, J A', 'Lokare, A', 'Chapman, O']","['Young A', 'Phillips J', 'Hancocks H', 'Hill C', 'Joshi N', 'Marshall A', 'Grumett J', 'Dunn JA', 'Lokare A', 'Chapman O']","['Warwick Clinical Trials Unit, University of Warwick.', 'Warwick Clinical Trials Unit, University of Warwick.', 'Warwick Clinical Trials Unit, University of Warwick.', 'Warwick Clinical Trials Unit, University of Warwick.', 'Warwick Clinical Trials Unit, University of Warwick.', 'Warwick Clinical Trials Unit, University of Warwick.', 'Warwick Clinical Trials Unit, University of Warwick.', 'Warwick Clinical Trials Unit, University of Warwick.', 'University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, Coventry;United Kingdom.', 'University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, Coventry;United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,,,2016/05/11 06:00,2016/05/11 06:01,['2016/05/11 06:00'],"['2016/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/11 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2016 Apr;140 Suppl 1:S172-3. doi: 10.1016/S0049-3848(16)30128-1.

The mechanism of the occurrence of thrombosis in hematological disorders is still unresolved. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is associated with VTE and bleeding in acute promyelocytic leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Although DIC has also been reported in AML, no data exist on the relationship between DIC and VTE in AML patients. AIM: We hypothesized that the presence of DIC at diagnosis of AML may contribute to the risk of both venous and arterial thrombosis in AML. Therefore we studied a large cohort of adult patients with newly diagnosed AML aged <65 years by measuring DIC parameters at diagnosis prior to treatment and assessing the occurrence of both venous and arterial thrombosis during follow up. The findings of this study were validated in a second large cohort of patient with newly diagnosed AML aged >60 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective study we analysed markers of DIC and their association with the occurrence of thrombosis during follow up in a cohort of 272 young AML patients (aged 18-65) and a validation cohort of 132 elderly AML patients (aged >60) patients that were all treated with intensive chemotherapy. DIC parameters (fibrinogen, D-dimer, alpha-2-antiplasmin, antitrombin, prothrombin time and platelets) were measured at presentation with AML before start of induction chemotherapy. The DIC score according to the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis DIC scoring systemwas calculated of all patients. RESULTS: The prevalence of thrombosis was 8.7% (4.7% venous, 4.0% arterial) in young patients over a median follow up of 478 days and 10.4% (4.4% venous, 5.9% arterial) in elderly patients. Most thrombotic events (66%) occurred before start of the second course of chemotherapy. The calculated DIC score significantly predicted venous and arterial thrombosis with a Hazard Ratio (HR) for a high DIC score (=>5) of 4.79 (1.71-13.45) in the cohort of young AML patients. These results were confirmed in our validation cohort of elderly AML patients. (HR 11.08 (3.23-38.06)). Of all DIC parameters D-dimer levels are most predictive for thrombosis with a HR of 12.3 (3.39-42.64) in the cohort of young AML patients and a HR of 7.82 (1.95-31.38) in the elderly cohort for a D-dimer >4.0 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that both venous and arterial thrombosis occurs in around 10% of AML patients treated with intensive chemotherapy, which can be predicted by the presence of DIC, or individual DIC parameters at time of AML diagnosis.","['Libourel, E J', 'Klerk, C', 'van Norden, Y', 'de Maat, M P M', 'Kruip, M J', 'Sonneveld, P', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Leebeek, F W G']","['Libourel EJ', 'Klerk C', 'van Norden Y', 'de Maat MP', 'Kruip MJ', 'Sonneveld P', 'Lowenberg B', 'Leebeek FW']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Sint Franciscus Gasthuis, Rotterdam.', 'Clinical Trial Center - HOVON Data Center, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam; The Netherlands.', 'Clinical Trial Center - HOVON Data Center, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam; The Netherlands.', 'Clinical Trial Center - HOVON Data Center, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam; The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Sint Franciscus Gasthuis, Rotterdam; Clinical Trial Center - HOVON Data Center, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam; The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam; Clinical Trial Center - HOVON Data Center, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam; The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Sint Franciscus Gasthuis, Rotterdam.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Sint Franciscus Gasthuis, Rotterdam; Clinical Trial Center - HOVON Data Center, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam; The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,,,2016/05/11 06:00,2016/05/11 06:01,['2016/05/11 06:00'],"['2016/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/11 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2016 Apr;140 Suppl 1:S172. doi: 10.1016/S0049-3848(16)30127-X.

AIM: Aim of our study was to determine incidence of thromboembolic (TE) events in patients with non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/ small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who were hospitalized to the lymphoma department in the Clinic of hematology, Clinical Center Serbia, Belgrade and Clinic of hematology, Clinical Center Kragujevac. Also, we assessed 2 predictive models (Padua and Khorana score) and create new model for the identification of lymphoma patients at risk for thromboembolism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed all medical records of patients with with NHL, HL and CLL/SLL diagnosed and treated at two previously mentioned institution between January 2006 and December 2014. RESULTS: The study population included 1820 eligible lymphoma patients. Of all the patients included in the study, 99 (5.4%) developed at least one TE during a follow-up period of 3 months from the end of therapy. In the final multivariate analysis, the following variables were independently associated with risk of TE: previous VTE and/or arterial events, reduced mobility (ECOG 2-4), obesity (BMI >30 kg/m(2)), extranodal localization, mediastinum involvement, development of neutropenia during therapy and hemoglobin level less than 100g/L. Subsequently, we assigned points for the risk model based on the regression coefficients obtained from the final model and developed Thrombosis Lymphoma (ThroLy) score consisting of all significant variables from the multivariate analysis. The Throly score was arrived at by assigning 2 points for all parameters with an OR >5 in multivariate regression analyses (e.g., previous VTE and arterial events, mediastinum involvement, and BMI) and 1 point for rest all other significant variables. Finally, population were divided into 3 risk categories for TE based on the score from the risk model: low (score 0-1), intermediate (score 2-3) and high (score >3). High risk score had a positive predictive value (probability of TE in those designated high risk) of 65.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Significance of our investigation is development of score that help phisicians to recruit lymphoma patients at risk for development of thromboembolic complications. Also, we can say that our score is dynamic allowing us to change approach during different phase of therapy and is not limited to outpatient settings or with some complicated laboratory analysis.","['Antic, D', 'Milic, N', 'Todorovic, M', 'Bila, J', 'Andjelic, B', 'Djurasinovic, V', 'Sretenovic, A', 'Vukovic, V', 'Jelicic, J', 'Nikolovski, S', 'Mihaljevic, B']","['Antic D', 'Milic N', 'Todorovic M', 'Bila J', 'Andjelic B', 'Djurasinovic V', 'Sretenovic A', 'Vukovic V', 'Jelicic J', 'Nikolovski S', 'Mihaljevic B']","['Clinic for hematology, Clinical Center Serbia, Belgrade; Medical faculty.', 'Institute for medical statistics, Medical faculty; University of Belgrade; Serbia.', 'Clinic for hematology, Clinical Center Serbia, Belgrade; Medical faculty.', 'Clinic for hematology, Clinical Center Serbia, Belgrade; Medical faculty.', 'Clinic for hematology, Clinical Center Serbia, Belgrade; Medical faculty.', 'Clinic for hematology, Clinical Center Serbia, Belgrade.', 'Clinic for hematology, Clinical Center Serbia, Belgrade.', 'Clinic for hematology, Clinical Center Serbia, Belgrade.', 'Clinic for hematology, Clinical Center Serbia, Belgrade.', 'Clinic for hematology, Clinical Center Serbia, Belgrade.', 'Clinic for hematology, Clinical Center Serbia, Belgrade; Medical faculty.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,,,2016/05/11 06:00,2016/05/11 06:01,['2016/05/11 06:00'],"['2016/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/11 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2016 Apr;140 Suppl 1:S171. doi: 10.1016/S0049-3848(16)30124-4.

However, approximately 30% of pediatric and 50% of adult patients lack abnormalities with clinical relevance by traditional cytogenetic analysis. We integrated cytogenetic, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism array results from 60 consecutive clinical ALL cases. By cytogenetic and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses, recurring abnormalities with clinical relevance were observed in 33 B-cell ALL (B-ALL), including t(9;22), hyperdiploidy, KMT2A translocation, ETV6-RUNX1, intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21, near haploidy or low hypodiploidy, and t(8;22). Single-nucleotide polymorphism array analysis found additional aberrations with prognostic or therapeutic implication in 21 B-ALL and two T-cell ALL, including IKZF1 deletion, intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 (one case with a normal karyotype), low hypodiploidy (two cases with a normal karyotype), and one case each with fusion genes ETV6-NTRK3, CRLF2-P2RY8, NUP214-ABL1, and SET-NUP214. IKZF1 deletion was noted in nine B-ALL with t(9;22), one B-ALL with t(4;11), five B-ALL with a normal karyotype, and three B-ALL with nonrecurring karyotypic abnormalities. Combining single-nucleotide polymorphism array with chromosome and fluorescence in situ hybridization assays, the detection rate for clinically significant abnormal results increased from 56% to 75%.

A validated retrospective cohort of paediatric patients diagnosed with ALL from 1999 to 2011 was assembled from the US Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database to examine organ toxicity, sepsis, and resource utilization in children with and without DS. Among 10699 ALL patients, 298 had DS-ALL (2.8%). In a multivariate model, DS was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular (odds ratio [OR] 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-2.7), respiratory (OR 2.1, 95% CI: 1.6-2.9), neurologic (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.9-6.2), and hepatic (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-1.9) dysfunction and sepsis (OR 1.8, 95% CI: 1.4-2.4). Children with DS-ALL used significantly more respiratory support, insulin, and anti-infectives, including broad-spectrum Gram-positive agents, quinolones, and azoles. They used significantly fewer analgesics and antiemetics compared to non-DS-ALL children. Ultimately, this study confirms the increased risk of infectious and end-organ toxicity in children with DS-ALL and quantifies important differences in resource utilization between children with DS and non-DS ALL. These findings highlight the importance of investigating the impact of these care variations and developing specific supportive care guidelines for this population.","['Salazar, Elizabeth G', 'Li, Yimei', 'Fisher, Brian T', 'Rheingold, Susan R', 'Fitzgerald, Julie', 'Seif, Alix E', 'Huang, Yuan-Shung', 'Bagatell, Rochelle', 'Aplenc, Richard']","['Salazar EG', 'Li Y', 'Fisher BT', 'Rheingold SR', 'Fitzgerald J', 'Seif AE', 'Huang YS', 'Bagatell R', 'Aplenc R']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", 'The Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'The Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', ""Division of Infectious Diseases, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", ""Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care Medicine, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", ""Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care Medicine, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", 'The Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Databases, Factual', 'Down Syndrome/complications/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Health Resources/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United States']",2016/05/11 06:00,2017/06/03 06:00,['2016/05/11 06:00'],"['2015/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2016 Aug;174(4):591-9. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14085.

G. Don consists of a range of dimeric indole alkaloids with significant antitumor activities. These alkaloids have been found to possess apoptosis-inducing activity against tumor cells in vitro and in vivo mediated by nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways, in which DNA damage and mitochondrial dysfunction play important roles. In this study, a unique bisindole alkaloid named cathachunine, along with five known dimeric indole alkaloids, was obtained from C. roseus and investigated in vitro. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the antitumor activity of isolated alkaloids and the mechanism through which cathachunine exerts its antitumor effect. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Cell growth inhibition was assessed by WST-1 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays in HL60, K562 leukemia cells and EA.hy926 umbilical vein cells. Induction of apoptosis in HL60 cells was confirmed by observation of nuclear morphology, a caspase-3 activity assay and annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide (FITC/PI) double staining. The intrinsic apoptotic pathway induced by cathachunine was evidenced by B-cell lymphoma 2/Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bcl-2/Bax) dysregulation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, translocation of cytochrome c, and cleavage of caspase-3 and poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production after cathachunine treatment was determined by 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) staining. Cell cycle arrest of the S phase was also observed in HL60 cells after cathachunine treatment. RESULTS: The WST-1 and LDH assays showed that Catharanthus alkaloids were cytotoxic toward human leukemia cells to a greater extent than toward normal human endothelial cells, and the anti-proliferation and pro-apoptosis abilities of cathachunine were much more potent than other previously reported alkaloids. The induction of apoptosis by cathachunine occurred through an ROS-dependent mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway rather than an extrinsic pathway, and was regulated by the Bcl-2 protein family. CONCLUSION: An unprecedented bisindole alkaloid cathachunine which lost C-18' and C-19' was isolated from C. roseus. It exerted a potent antitumor effect toward human leukemia cells through the induction of apoptosis via an intrinsic pathway. Thus, this study provides evidence for a new lead compound from a natural source for anti-cancer investigations.","['Wang, Xiao-Dong', 'Li, Chen-Yang', 'Jiang, Miao-Miao', 'Li, Dong', 'Wen, Ping', 'Song, Xun', 'Chen, Jun-Da', 'Guo, Li-Xuan', 'Hu, Xiao-Peng', 'Li, Guo-Qiang', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Wang, Chun-Hua', 'He, Zhen-Dan']","['Wang XD', 'Li CY', 'Jiang MM', 'Li D', 'Wen P', 'Song X', 'Chen JD', 'Guo LX', 'Hu XP', 'Li GQ', 'Zhang J', 'Wang CH', 'He ZD']","['Department of Pharmacy, School of Medicine, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, Guangdong, PR China; Institute of Biotherapy, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, Guangdong, PR China; Engineering Laboratory of Shenzhen Natural Micromolecule Innovative Drugs, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, Guangdong, PR China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, School of Medicine, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, Guangdong, PR China; Institute of Biotherapy, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, Guangdong, PR China; Engineering Laboratory of Shenzhen Natural Micromolecule Innovative Drugs, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, Guangdong, PR China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Modern Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 300193, PR China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Modern Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 300193, PR China.', 'Business Technology Department, Shenzhen Institute for Drug Control, Shenzhen 518057, Guangdong, PR China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, School of Medicine, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, Guangdong, PR China; Institute of Biotherapy, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, Guangdong, PR China; Engineering Laboratory of Shenzhen Natural Micromolecule Innovative Drugs, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, Guangdong, PR China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, School of Medicine, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, Guangdong, PR China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, School of Medicine, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, Guangdong, PR China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, School of Medicine, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, Guangdong, PR China; Institute of Biotherapy, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, Guangdong, PR China; Engineering Laboratory of Shenzhen Natural Micromolecule Innovative Drugs, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, Guangdong, PR China.', 'Experiment and Technology Center, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, PR China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, School of Medicine, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, Guangdong, PR China; Institute of Biotherapy, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, Guangdong, PR China; Engineering Laboratory of Shenzhen Natural Micromolecule Innovative Drugs, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, Guangdong, PR China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Modern Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 300193, PR China.

Bone marrow specimens from 50 patients with CML and peripheral blood specimens from 20 healthy individuals were collected. K562 cells were treated with imatinib. Subsequently, a stable cell line, K562-C/EBPalpha, was constructed. Cell proliferation was assayed with cell counting kit-8, and mRNA levels of C/EBPalpha, forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1 (Foxo3a) and Bim were detected by semiquantitative PCR. The correlation of C/EBPalpha and BCR-ABL was assessed by Spearman's correlation analysis. The results showed that C/EBPalpha mRNA levels were significantly reduced in CML patients compared with healthy subjects (p < 0.001) and were negatively correlated with BCR-ABL1 (r = -0.5046, p < 0.01). Additionally, imatinib enhanced the expression of C/EBPalpha in K562 cells compared with untreated cells (p < 0.05). Overexpression of C/EBPalpha significantly decreased cell proliferation and upregulated the expressions of the apoptosis-related genes Foxo3a (p < 0.01) and Bim (p < 0.05) in K562 cells. In conclusion, C/EBPalpha expression was decreased in patients with CML. Imatinib enhances the expression of C/EBPalpha in K562 cells, and the overexpression of C/EBPalpha inhibits cell proliferation and increases apoptosis via the Foxo3a-Bim pathway.","['Zhang, Guili', 'Dong, Fei', 'Luan, Caifu', 'Zhang, Xia', 'Shao, Huiyuan', 'Liu, Jie', 'Sun, Chengming']","['Zhang G', 'Dong F', 'Luan C', 'Zhang X', 'Shao H', 'Liu J', 'Sun C']","['Department of Laboratory, Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital, Medical College, Qingdao University, Yantai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Comment']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*biosynthesis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', '*K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Transfection']",2016/05/11 06:00,2016/12/23 06:00,['2016/05/11 06:00'],"['2015/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/23 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2016;136(2):65-70. doi: 10.1159/000444517.

METHODS: Patients between 6 and 14 years with OM were randomly assigned to two groups, group A (Bioxtra((R)) toothpaste) and group B (fluoride toothpaste without menthol). The patients were instructed to brush their teeth at least twice a day using a soft toothbrush with a small head. Oral hygiene grade was assessed using the simplified oral hygiene index (OHI-s); quality of life was assessed using the short form of the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) questionnaires. The patients were evaluated on day 1(diagnosis of OM-T0) and on day 8 (T1). Statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 64 patients were enrolled. A significant difference (P < 0.001) between the mean of the OHI-s in group A (0.9 +/- 1.2) and in group B (1.5 +/- 1.3) was found; the overall OHIP-14 scores were not associated with the use of one or the other toothpaste (P = 0.33).

AIM: To describe the age and sex frequencies of the major subtypes of leukemias in two reference hospitals in the metropolitan area of Mexico City. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A descriptive and retrospective study, based on medical records of two hematology services during January 2007 to October 2014; all cases diagnosed with leukemia were included. RESULTS: A total of 1,432 cases were included, with a median age of 38 years old (2 months to 115 years). There were significant age differences between subtypes of leukemia (ANOVA test, p = 0.000); chronic lymphocytic with a mean age of 64.8 years, higher than chronic myeloid (43.4 years) and all acute leukemias (lymphoblastic: 32.6 years, myeloblastic 43.5 years). Of the patients, 51.8% (n = 742) were women, although males predominated in chronic myeloid (57.8%) and lymphocytic (60%) leukemia. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia was the more common variety, L2 subtype of the French-American-British classification, followed by myeloid leukemia M4, M2, and chronic myeloid.

The aim of this retrospective study is to investigate 1- and 2-year medication adherence to imatinib treatment, linking adherence rates with the clinical outcome, in accordance with European LeukemiaNet Recommendations for the management of CML. We have tried to find a cutoff value for adherence in order to achieve a good clinical outcome. METHODS: The method used to calculate medication adherence was the ratio between the received and the prescribed daily dose. RESULTS: We observed the levels of mean adherence for each of the following response groups (in years 1 and 2, respectively): complete response (0.96, 0.95), MR4.5 (1.00, -), MR4 (0.93, 0.91), major molecular responses (0.96, 0.97), warning (0.91, 0.89) and failure (0.79, 0.84). CONCLUSION: Results show that the higher the adherence, the lower the level of BCR-ABL1. Furthermore, using cutoffs >/=0.9, outcomes were significantly improved compared to those with cutoffs <0.90. This value of adherence is in line with previous publications.","['Santoleri, Fiorenzo', 'Lasala, Ruggero', 'Ranucci, Elena', 'La Barba, Gaetano', 'Di Lorenzo, Roberto', 'Vetro, Antonio', 'Di Bartolomeo, Paolo', 'Costantini, Alberto']","['Santoleri F', 'Lasala R', 'Ranucci E', 'La Barba G', 'Di Lorenzo R', 'Vetro A', 'Di Bartolomeo P', 'Costantini A']","['Hospital Pharmacy, Spirito Santo General Hospital of Pescara, Pescara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Comment']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', '*Medication Adherence', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2016/05/11 06:00,2016/12/23 06:00,['2016/05/11 06:00'],"['2015/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/23 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2016;136(1):45-51. doi: 10.1159/000444626.

However, the role of HQH on leukemia cells and its underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effect of HQH on the proliferation and apoptosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines. METHODS: Sup-B15 and Nalm-6 cells were treated with gradient doses of HQH for 24, 48 or 72 h. Cell viability was measured using a CCK8 assay and cell cycle distribution and apoptosis levels were analyzed using flow cytometry. Western blotting was used to assess the levels of proteins associated with the apoptotic pathway. RESULTS: The results revealed that cell survival decreased significantly with increasing concentrations of HQH. HQH induced G2 cell-cycle arrest and cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. HQH inhibited phosphorylated-Akt, phosphorylated- FoxO1 and Bcl2 expression and upregulated Bim, cleaved-caspase-3 and Bax expression in a dose-dependent manner, which suggests that HQH induces the apoptosis of ALL cells via the Akt/FoxO1 pathway. CONCLUSION: HQH is a potential complementary agent for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Han, Juan', 'Lin, Ming', 'Zhou, Dongfeng', 'Zhang, Zhiquan', 'Jin, Runming', 'Zhou, Fen']","['Han J', 'Lin M', 'Zhou D', 'Zhang Z', 'Jin R', 'Zhou F']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Astragalus propinquus', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Forkhead Box Protein O1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2016/05/11 06:00,2017/02/09 06:00,['2016/05/11 06:00'],"['2016/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2016;38(5):1803-14. doi: 10.1159/000443119.

The analysis included 98 cases with an average age of onset of ALL of 5.9 years (range 1.5 to 26). The average latency period was 7.8 years until diagnosis of secondary glioma. Radiation therapy was administered in 92 cases for the primary malignancy at an average dose of 20.7 Gy. The median survival time of patients treated with multimodality treatment for secondary glioma was 23 months (95 % confidence interval 12-27 months), and multimodality therapy improved survival time significantly (p = 0.0029). The exact cause for the development of glioma following ALL is not clear. The risk of a secondary glioma in childhood cancer survivors may be influenced by genetic and other predisposing factors as well as by treatment type. In patients diagnosed with ALL, the risk of secondary glioma warrants a longer follow-up period that continues long after the risk of relapse of the primary malignancy has passed. Moreover, multimodality therapy should be considered in cases of secondary glioma following ALL.","['Yamanaka, Ryuya', 'Hayano, Azusa']","['Yamanaka R', 'Hayano A']","['Laboratory of Molecular Target Therapy for Cancer, Graduate School for Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kawaramachi-Hirokoji, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan. ryaman@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Target Therapy for Cancer, Graduate School for Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kawaramachi-Hirokoji, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Neurosurg Rev,Neurosurgical review,7908181,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brain Neoplasms/diagnosis/*etiology/*therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Glioma/diagnosis/*etiology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/pathology/*therapy', 'Young Adult']",2016/05/11 06:00,2018/08/21 06:00,['2016/05/11 06:00'],"['2015/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/16 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/21 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neurosurg Rev. 2017 Oct;40(4):549-557. doi: 10.1007/s10143-016-0733-8.

Since conventional therapy appears ineffective for severe TII, and these patients often progress to renal failure, understanding in situ mechanisms might reveal new therapeutic targets. This study was undertaken to assess whether dysregulated apoptotic regulators maintain local adaptive immunity and drive inflammation in TII. METHODS: This study utilized novel computational approaches that, when applied to multicolor confocal images, quantified apoptotic regulator protein expression in selected lymphocyte subsets. This approach was validated using laser-capture microdissection (LCM) coupled to quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Furthermore, the consequences of dysregulated apoptotic mediator expression were explored in a murine model of lupus nephritis. RESULTS: Analyses of renal biopsy tissue from patients with lupus nephritis and those with mixed cellular renal allograft rejection revealed that the B cell lymphoma 2 protein (Bcl-2) was frequently expressed in infiltrating lymphocytes, whereas expression of myeloid cell leukemia 1 was low. In contrast, the reciprocal pattern of expression was observed in tonsil germinal centers. These results were consistent with RNA expression data obtained using LCM and qPCR. Bcl-2 was also highly expressed in tubulointerstitial infiltrates in (NZB x NZW)F1 (NZB/NZW) mice. Furthermore, treatment of NZB/NZW mice with ABT-199, a selective oral inhibitor of Bcl-2, prolonged survival and prevented proteinuria and development of TII in a lupus prevention model. Interestingly, glomerular immune complexes were partially ameliorated by ABT-199 treatment, and serum anti-double-stranded DNA antibody titers were unaffected. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that Bcl-2 is an attractive therapeutic target in patients with lupus nephritis who manifest TII.","['Ko, Kichul', 'Wang, Jianing', 'Perper, Stuart', 'Jiang, Yulei', 'Yanez, Denisse', 'Kaverina, Natalya', 'Ai, Junting', 'Liarski, Vladimir M', 'Chang, Anthony', 'Peng, Yahui', 'Lan, Li', 'Westmoreland, Susan', 'Olson, Lisa', 'Giger, Maryellen L', 'Chun Wang, Li', 'Clark, Marcus R']","['Ko K', 'Wang J', 'Perper S', 'Jiang Y', 'Yanez D', 'Kaverina N', 'Ai J', 'Liarski VM', 'Chang A', 'Peng Y', 'Lan L', 'Westmoreland S', 'Olson L', 'Giger ML', 'Chun Wang L', 'Clark MR']","['University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Stuart Perper, BS, Susan Westmoreland, VMD, Lisa Olson, PhD, Li Chun Wang, PhD: AbbVie, AbbVie Bioresearch Center, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Stuart Perper, BS, Susan Westmoreland, VMD, Lisa Olson, PhD, Li Chun Wang, PhD: AbbVie, AbbVie Bioresearch Center, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Stuart Perper, BS, Susan Westmoreland, VMD, Lisa Olson, PhD, Li Chun Wang, PhD: AbbVie, AbbVie Bioresearch Center, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Stuart Perper, BS, Susan Westmoreland, VMD, Lisa Olson, PhD, Li Chun Wang, PhD: AbbVie, AbbVie Bioresearch Center, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois. mclark@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arthritis Rheumatol,"Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)",101623795,IM,"['Adaptive Immunity/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/genetics/metabolism', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Germinal Center/metabolism', 'Graft Rejection/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inflammation', 'Kidney/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Kidney Glomerulus/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Laser Capture Microdissection', 'Lupus Nephritis/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NZB', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Nephritis, Interstitial/immunology/*metabolism', 'Palatine Tonsil', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology']",2016/10/28 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2016/05/10 06:00'],"['2016/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arthritis Rheumatol. 2016 Nov;68(11):2740-2751. doi: 10.1002/art.39744.,10.1002/art.39744 [doi],,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",PMC5083145,,,"['Financial Disclosures and Conflict of Interest: Kichul Ko gets salary support', 'from AbbVie, Inc.

Like BCL-2, MCL-1 bears a surface groove whose function is to sequester the BH3 killer domains of proapoptotic BCL-2 family members, a mechanism harnessed by cancer cells to establish formidable apoptotic blockades. Although drugging the BH3-binding groove has been achieved for BCL-2, translating this approach to MCL-1 has been challenging. Here, we report an alternative mechanism for MCL-1 inhibition by small-molecule covalent modification of C286 at a new interaction site distant from the BH3-binding groove. Our structure-function analyses revealed that the BH3 binding capacity of MCL-1 and its suppression of BAX are impaired by molecular engagement, a phenomenon recapitulated by C286W mutagenic mimicry in vitro and in mouse cells. Thus, we characterize an allosteric mechanism for disrupting the antiapoptotic BH3 binding activity of MCL-1, informing a new strategy for disarming MCL-1 in cancer.","['Lee, Susan', 'Wales, Thomas E', 'Escudero, Silvia', 'Cohen, Daniel T', 'Luccarelli, James', 'Gallagher, Catherine G', 'Cohen, Nicole A', 'Huhn, Annissa J', 'Bird, Gregory H', 'Engen, John R', 'Walensky, Loren D']","['Lee S', 'Wales TE', 'Escudero S', 'Cohen DT', 'Luccarelli J', 'Gallagher CG', 'Cohen NA', 'Huhn AJ', 'Bird GH', 'Engen JR', 'Walensky LD']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Linde Program in Cancer Chemical Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Linde Program in Cancer Chemical Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Linde Program in Cancer Chemical Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Linde Program in Cancer Chemical Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Linde Program in Cancer Chemical Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Linde Program in Cancer Chemical Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Linde Program in Cancer Chemical Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Linde Program in Cancer Chemical Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Linde Program in Cancer Chemical Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Struct Mol Biol,Nature structural & molecular biology,101186374,IM,"['Allosteric Regulation/*drug effects', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Conformation/drug effects', 'Protein Domains', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/chemistry/metabolism', 'Small Molecule Libraries/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/chemistry/metabolism']",2016/05/10 06:00,2017/05/20 06:00,['2016/05/10 06:00'],"['2015/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2016 Jun;23(6):600-7. doi: 10.1038/nsmb.3223.

Molecularly targeted therapy is hindered by heterogeneity in T-ALL and mechanistic details of the affected pathways in T-ALL are needed. Deregulation of Ras signals is common in T-ALL. Ras is genetically mutated to a constitutively active form in about 15% of all haematopoietic malignancies, but there is a range of other ways to augment signaling through the Ras pathway. Several groups including our own uncovered that RasGRP1 overexpression leads to T-ALL in mouse models and in pediatric T-ALL patients, and we reported that this Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor, RasGRP1, cooperates with cytokines to drive leukemogenesis. In our recent study by Ksionda et al. we analyzed the molecular details of cytokine receptor-RasGRP1-Ras signals in T-ALL and compared these to signals from mutated Ras alleles, which yielded several surprising results. Examples are the striking differences in flux through the RasGDP/RasGTP cycle in distinct T-ALL or unexpected differences in wiring of the Ras signaling pathway between T-ALL and normal developing T cells, which we will discuss here.","['Mues, Marsilius', 'Roose, Jeroen P']","['Mues M', 'Roose JP']","['a Department of Anatomy , University of California San Francisco , San Francisco , CA , USA.', 'a Department of Anatomy , University of California San Francisco , San Francisco , CA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Comment']",United States,Small GTPases,Small GTPases,101530974,IM,"['Animals', 'Child', 'Cytokines', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Nucleotides', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', '*Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt']",2016/05/10 06:00,2019/03/19 06:00,['2016/05/10 06:00'],"['2016/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/19 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Small GTPases. 2017 Jan 2;8(1):20-25. doi: 10.1080/21541248.2016.1187323.

At the same time, the size of clinical cohorts often is still limited, calling for novel analysis strategies for identifying potentially prognostic SNPs that can help to better characterize disease processes. We propose such a strategy, drawing on univariate testing ideas from epidemiological case-controls studies on the one hand, and multivariable regression techniques as developed for gene expression data on the other hand. In particular, we focus on stable selection of a small set of SNPs and corresponding genes for subsequent validation. For univariate analysis, a permutation-based approach is proposed to test at the gene level. We use regularized multivariable regression models for considering all SNPs simultaneously and selecting a small set of potentially important prognostic SNPs. Stability is judged according to resampling inclusion frequencies for both the univariate and the multivariable approach. The overall strategy is illustrated with data from a cohort of acute myeloid leukemia patients and explored in a simulation study. The multivariable approach is seen to automatically focus on a smaller set of SNPs compared to the univariate approach, roughly in line with blocks of correlated SNPs. This more targeted extraction of SNPs results in more stable selection at the SNP as well as at the gene level. Thus, the multivariable regression approach with resampling provides a perspective in the proposed analysis strategy for SNP data in clinical cohorts highlighting what can be added by regularized regression techniques compared to univariate analyses.","['Hieke, Stefanie', 'Benner, Axel', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Schumacher, Martin', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Binder, Harald']","['Hieke S', 'Benner A', 'Schlenk RF', 'Schumacher M', 'Bullinger L', 'Binder H']","['Institute for Medical Biometry and Statistics, Medical Center- University Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Freiburg Center for Data Analysis and Modeling, University Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Biometry and Statistics, Medical Center- University Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University Medical Center Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Models, Theoretical', '*Multivariate Analysis', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis']",2016/05/10 06:00,2017/07/27 06:00,['2016/05/10 06:00'],"['2015/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 May 9;11(5):e0155226. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0155226. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0155226 [doi],20160509,,PMC4861340,,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0155226 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-32504 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormal differentiation of myeloid cells results in a high level of immature malignant cells and fewer differentiated red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells. The disease occurs at all ages, but predominantly occurs in older people (>60 years of age). AML typically presents with a rapid onset of symptoms that are attributable to bone marrow failure and may be fatal within weeks or months when left untreated. The genomic landscape of AML has been determined and genetic instability is infrequent with a relatively small number of driver mutations. Mutations in genes involved in epigenetic regulation are common and are early events in leukaemogenesis. The subclassification of AML has been dependent on the morphology and cytogenetics of blood and bone marrow cells, but specific mutational analysis is now being incorporated. Improvements in treatment in younger patients over the past 35 years has largely been due to dose escalation and better supportive care. Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be used to consolidate remission in those patients who are deemed to be at high risk of relapse. A plethora of new agents - including those targeted at specific biochemical pathways and immunotherapeutic approaches - are now in trial based on improved understanding of disease pathophysiology. These advances provide good grounds for optimism, although mortality remains high especially in older patients.","['Khwaja, Asim', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus', 'Gale, Rosemary E', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Jordan, Craig T', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Estey, Eli', 'Burnett, Alan', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Scheinberg, David A', 'Bouscary, Didier', 'Linch, David C']","['Khwaja A', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Gale RE', 'Levine RL', 'Jordan CT', 'Ehninger G', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Estey E', 'Burnett A', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Scheinberg DA', 'Bouscary D', 'Linch DC']","['Department of Haematology, University College London, UCL Cancer Institute, 72 Huntley Street, London WC1E 6DD, UK.', 'Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet and University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Haematology, University College London, UCL Cancer Institute, 72 Huntley Street, London WC1E 6DD, UK.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Denver, Denver, Colorado, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Washington and Clinical Research Division Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'CTI Life Sciences Ltd., Uxbridge, UK.', 'Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Experimental Therapeutics Center, Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Institut Cochin, Departement Developpement Reproduction Cancer, CNRS UMR8104, INSERM U1016, Paris, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Cochin, AP-HP, Paris, France."", 'Universite Paris Descartes, Faculte de Medecine Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Department of Haematology, University College London, UCL Cancer Institute, 72 Huntley Street, London WC1E 6DD, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Nat Rev Dis Primers,Nature reviews.

Several studies showed that TXN was over expressed in solid tumors and this was correlated to poorer prognosis. However, TXN expression has been insufficiently studied, particularly in newly diagnosed adult acute leukemia. METHODS: This study was designed to evaluate the gene expression of TXN in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) adult patients and to investigate its association with oxidative DNA damage. The expression of TXN was analyzed using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction while oxidative DNA damage was evaluated by measuring serum 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and strand breaks by the comet assay. RESULTS: We found that TXN was under expressed in both AML and ALL groups (P < 0.001 for both) as compared to the control group. Also TXN expression level was negatively correlated with serum 8-OHdG and tail moment in both AML (P = 0.042 and 0.047, respectively) and ALL (P < 0.001 and P = 0.02, respectively) while it showed no correlation with treatment outcome in either groups. DISCUSSION: This study suggests that TXN expression is hindered in adult acute leukemia which augments oxidative DNA damage and hence mutagenesis. CONCLUSION: This study provides a new insight into the pathogenesis of acute leukemia and suggests TXN as a new screening test for the risk for acute leukemia.","['Kamal, Amany M', 'El-Hefny, Nadia H', 'Hegab, Hany M', 'El-Mesallamy, Hala O']","['Kamal AM', 'El-Hefny NH', 'Hegab HM', 'El-Mesallamy HO']","['a Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy , Ain Shams University , Cairo , Egypt.', 'a Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy , Ain Shams University , Cairo , Egypt.', 'b Department of Clinical Hematology, Faculty of Medicine , Ain Shams University , Cairo , Egypt.', 'a Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy , Ain Shams University , Cairo , Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"", 'Adult', 'Aged', '*DNA Damage', 'Deoxyguanosine/analogs & derivatives/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxidative Stress/*physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Thioredoxins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2016/05/10 06:00,2017/04/07 06:00,['2016/05/10 06:00'],"['2016/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2016 Dec;21(10):567-575. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2016.1173341.

Vosaroxin is a first-in-class anticancer quinolone derivative that has shown promising activity in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. AREAS COVERED: Studies in relapsed/refractory AML, including a large randomized phase III trial, have shown improved response rates when vosaroxin was combined with cytarabine, which translated to prolonged survival in certain subsets of patients, including older patients. Given the encouraging results of vosaroxin in the relapsed/refractory setting, several studies are also evaluating vosaroxin in older patients with untreated AML who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy. The results from clinical trials evaluating vosaroxin in both treatment naive and relapsed/refractory AML will be reviewed. Expert Commentary: Vosaroxin has shown significant promise in the management of AML, especially in older patients with relapsed/refractory disease. As vosaroxin has been associated with increased toxicity in some studies, appropriate dosing and patient selection will be crucial to determine the future role of vosaroxin in AML.","['Short, Nicholas J', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Short NJ', 'Ravandi F']","['a Division of Cancer Medicine , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'b Department of Leukemia , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Naphthyridines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Retreatment', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2016/05/10 06:00,2017/05/19 06:00,['2016/05/10 06:00'],"['2016/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2016 Jun;9(6):529-34. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2016.1187063.

Here, we demonstrate that xenografting primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B lymphocytes with activated autologous T cells into alymphoid mice results in considerable CLL B cell division and sizable T cell expansion. Nevertheless, most/all CD5(+)CD19(+) cells are eventually lost, due in part to differentiation into antibody-secreting plasmablasts/plasma cells. CLL B cell differentiation is associated with isotype class switching and development of new IGHV-D-J mutations and occurs via an activation-induced deaminase-dependent pathway that upregulates IRF4 and Blimp-1 without appreciable levels of the expected Bcl-6. These processes were induced in IGHV-unmutated and IGHV-mutated clones by Th1-polarized T-bet(+) T cells, not classical T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Thus, the block in B cell maturation, defects in T cell action, and absence of antigen-receptor diversification, which are often cardinal characteristics of CLL, are not inherent but imposed by external signals and the microenvironment. Although these activities are not dominant features in human CLL, each occurs in tissue proliferation centers where the mechanisms responsible for clonal evolution operate. Thus, in this setting, CLL B cell diversification and differentiation develop by a nonclassical germinal center-like reaction that might reflect the cell of origin of this leukemia.","['Patten, Piers E M', 'Ferrer, Gerardo', 'Chen, Shih-Shih', 'Simone, Rita', 'Marsilio, Sonia', 'Yan, Xiao-Jie', 'Gitto, Zachary', 'Yuan, Chaohui', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Barrientos, Jacqueline', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'MacCarthy, Thomas', 'Chu, Charles C', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas']","['Patten PE', 'Ferrer G', 'Chen SS', 'Simone R', 'Marsilio S', 'Yan XJ', 'Gitto Z', 'Yuan C', 'Kolitz JE', 'Barrientos J', 'Allen SL', 'Rai KR', 'MacCarthy T', 'Chu CC', 'Chiorazzi N']","[""The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York, USA.; King's College London, Department of Haematological Medicine, London, United Kingdom."", 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York, USA.', 'Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, State University of New York, Stony Brook, New York, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York, USA.; Department of Medicine, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Manhasset, New York, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York, USA.; Department of Medicine, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Manhasset, New York, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York, USA.; Department of Medicine, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Manhasset, New York, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York, USA.; Department of Medicine, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Manhasset, New York, USA.', 'Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, State University of New York, Stony Brook, New York, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York, USA.; Department of Medicine, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Manhasset, New York, USA.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Hempstead, New York, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York, USA.; Department of Medicine, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Manhasset, New York, USA.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Hempstead, New York, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,JCI Insight,JCI insight,101676073,,,2016/05/10 06:00,2016/05/10 06:00,['2016/05/10 06:00'],"['2016/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,JCI Insight. 2016 Apr 7;1(4). doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.86288.,e86288 [pii],,,PMC4855875,,,,['10.1172/jci.insight.86288 [doi]'],,,"['R01 CA081554/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM111741/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS777155'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, limited options exist for the treatment of FLT3-independent AML, demonstrating the need for novel therapies that reduce toxicity and improve survival. MERTK receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in 80% to 90% of AMLs and contributes to leukemogenesis. Here, we describe MRX-2843, a type 1 small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that abrogates activation of both MERTK and FLT3 and their downstream effectors. MRX-2843 treatment induces apoptosis and inhibits colony formation in AML cell lines and primary patient samples expressing MERTK and/or FLT3-ITD, with a wide therapeutic window compared with that of normal human cord blood cells. In murine orthotopic xenograft models, once-daily oral therapy prolonged survival 2- to 3-fold over that of vehicle-treated controls. Additionally, MRX-2843 retained activity against quizartinib-resistant FLT3-ITD-mutant proteins with clinically relevant alterations at the D835 or F691 loci and prolonged survival in xenograft models of quizartinib-resistant AML. Together, these observations validate MRX-2843 as a translational agent and support its clinical development for the treatment of AML.","['Minson, Katherine A', 'Smith, Catherine C', 'DeRyckere, Deborah', 'Libbrecht, Clara', 'Lee-Sherick, Alisa B', 'Huey, Madeline G', 'Lasater, Elisabeth A', 'Kirkpatrick, Gregory D', 'Stashko, Michael A', 'Zhang, Weihe', 'Jordan, Craig T', 'Kireev, Dmitri', 'Wang, Xiaodong', 'Frye, Stephen V', 'Earp, H Shelton', 'Shah, Neil P', 'Graham, Douglas K']","['Minson KA', 'Smith CC', 'DeRyckere D', 'Libbrecht C', 'Lee-Sherick AB', 'Huey MG', 'Lasater EA', 'Kirkpatrick GD', 'Stashko MA', 'Zhang W', 'Jordan CT', 'Kireev D', 'Wang X', 'Frye SV', 'Earp HS', 'Shah NP', 'Graham DK']","[""Aflac Cancer Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and Emory University Department of Pediatrics, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."", 'UCSF, Department of Medicine, San Francisco, California, USA.', ""Aflac Cancer Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and Emory University Department of Pediatrics, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."", 'Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'University of Colorado, Department of Pediatrics, Aurora, Colorado, USA.', 'University of Colorado, Department of Pediatrics, Aurora, Colorado, USA.', ""Aflac Cancer Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and Emory University Department of Pediatrics, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."", 'UCSF, Department of Medicine, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'University of Colorado, Department of Pediatrics, Aurora, Colorado, USA.', 'University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Eshelman School of Pharmacy, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Eshelman School of Pharmacy, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'University of Colorado, Department of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, USA.', 'University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Eshelman School of Pharmacy, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Eshelman School of Pharmacy, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Eshelman School of Pharmacy, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Department of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'UCSF, Department of Medicine, San Francisco, California, USA.', ""Aflac Cancer Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and Emory University Department of Pediatrics, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."", 'Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,JCI Insight,JCI insight,101676073,,,2016/05/10 06:00,2016/05/10 06:01,['2016/05/10 06:00'],"['2016/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/10 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,JCI Insight. 2016 Mar;1(3):e85630. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.85630.,10.1172/jci.insight.85630 [doi] 85630 [pii],,,PMC4855528,,,,"['10.1172/jci.insight.85630 [doi]', '85630 [pii]']",,,"['P30 DK057516/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA187577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008497/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA082086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA137078/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001C/RC/CCR NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001E/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS770916'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-7 plays a critical role in homeostatic proliferation, survival and memory formation of naive T-cells in lymphopenia, and its underlying molecular mechanism has also been well studied. However, the mechanism for adoptively transferred effector T-cell survival and memory formation is not fully understood. Here, we transferred in vitro-activated transgenic OT-I CD8(+) effector T-cells into irradiation (600 rads)-induced lymphopenic C57BL/6, IL-7 knockout (KO) and IL-15 KO mice, and investigated the survival and memory formation of transferred T-cells in lymphopenia. RESULTS: We demonstrate that transferred T-cells prolong their survival and enhance their memory in lymphopenic mice, in a manner that depends on IL-15 signaling, but not IL-7. We determine that in vitro stimulation of naive or effector T-cells with IL-7 and IL-15 reduces IL-7Ralpha, and increases and/or maintains IL-15Rbeta expression, respectively. Consistent with these findings, the expression of IL-7Ralpha and IL-15Rbeta is down- and up-regulated, respectively, in vivo on transferred T-cells in an early phase post T-cell transfer in lymphopenia. We further show that in vitro IL-15 restimulation-induced memory T-cells (compared to IL-2 restimulation-induced effector T-cells) and in vivo transferred T-cells in irradiated IL-15-sufficient C57BL/6 mice (compared to IL-15-deficient IL-15 KO mice) have increased mitochondrial content, but less NADH and lower mitochondrial potential (DeltaPsim), and demonstrate greater phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription-5 (STAT5) and Unc-51-like kinase-1 (ULK1), and higher expression of B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl2) and memory-, autophagy- and mitochondrial biogenesis-related molecules. CONCLUSION: Irradiation-induced lymphopenia promotes effector T-cell survival via IL-15 signaling the STAT5/Bcl2 pathway, enhances T-cell memory formation via IL-15 activation of the forkhead-box family of transcription factor (FOXO)/eomesodermin (Eomes) memory and ULK1/autophagy-related gene-7 (ATG7) autophagy pathways, and via IL-15 activation of the mitochondrial remodeling. Our data thus identify some important targets to consider when designing potent adoptive T-cell immunotherapies of cancer.","['Xu, Aizhang', 'Bhanumathy, Kalpana Kalyanasundaram', 'Wu, Jie', 'Ye, Zhenmin', 'Freywald, Andrew', 'Leary, Scot C', 'Li, Rongxiu', 'Xiang, Jim']","['Xu A', 'Bhanumathy KK', 'Wu J', 'Ye Z', 'Freywald A', 'Leary SC', 'Li R', 'Xiang J']","['State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China ; School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Cancer Research Cluster, Saskatchewan Cancer Agency, Saskatoon, SK Canada ; Departments of Oncology, University of Saskatchewan, HSB Room 4D30.1, 107 Wiggins Road, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E5 Canada.', 'Cancer Research Cluster, Saskatchewan Cancer Agency, Saskatoon, SK Canada.', 'Cancer Research Cluster, Saskatchewan Cancer Agency, Saskatoon, SK Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK Canada.', 'State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China ; School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China ; Engineering Research Center of Cell & Therapeutic Antibody, School of Pharmacy, Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Cancer Research Cluster, Saskatchewan Cancer Agency, Saskatoon, SK Canada ; Departments of Oncology, University of Saskatchewan, HSB Room 4D30.1, 107 Wiggins Road, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E5 Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cell Biosci,Cell & bioscience,101561195,,,2016/05/10 06:00,2016/05/10 06:01,['2016/05/10 06:00'],"['2016/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/10 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Cell Biosci. 2016 May 6;6:30. doi: 10.1186/s13578-016-0098-2. eCollection 2016.,10.1186/s13578-016-0098-2 [doi],20160506,,PMC4858849,['NOTNLM'],"['Autophagy', 'Effector T-cells', 'IL-15', 'Irradiation', 'Lymphopenia', 'Mitochondrial biogenesis', 'T-cell memory', 'T-cell survival']",,"['10.1186/s13578-016-0098-2 [doi]', '98 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several risk stratification approaches based on clinical and biological aspects have been proposed to intensify treatment in patients with high risk of relapse and reduce toxicity on those with a greater probability of cure. The detection of residual leukemic cells (minimal residual disease, MRD) is the most important prognostic factor to identify high-risk patients, allowing redefinition of chemotherapy. In the last decades, several standardized research protocols evaluated MRD using immunophenotyping by flow cytometry and/or real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction at different time points during treatment. Both methods are highly sensitive (10(-3) a 10(-5)), but expensive, complex, and, because of that, require qualified staff and frequently are restricted to reference centers.

Symptoms are usually mild and reversible following discontinuation of treatment. A more severe chronic sensorimotor polyneuropathy characterized by distal axonal-loss neuropathy can be seen in chronic arsenic exposure. The clinical course of arsenic neurotoxicity in patients with coexistence of thiamine deficiency is only anecdotally known but this association may potentially lead to severe consequences. We describe a case of acute irreversible axonal neuropathy in a patient with hidden thiamine deficiency who was treated with a short course of arsenic trioxide for acute promyelocytic leukemia. Thiamine replacement therapy and arsenic trioxide discontinuation were not followed by neurological recovery and severe polyneuropathy persisted at 12-month follow-up. Thiamine plasma levels should be measured in patients who are candidate to arsenic trioxide therapy. Prophylactic administration of vitamin B1 may be advisable. The appearance of polyneuropathy signs early during the administration of arsenic trioxide should prompt electrodiagnostic testing to rule out a pattern of axonal neuropathy which would need immediate discontinuation of arsenic trioxide.,"['Kuhn, Marcus', 'Sammartin, Kety', 'Nabergoj, Mitja', 'Vianello, Fabrizio']","['Kuhn M', 'Sammartin K', 'Nabergoj M', 'Vianello F']","['Hematology and Immunology Unit, Padua University School of Medicine, via Giustiniani 1, 35128, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Immunology Unit, Padua University School of Medicine, via Giustiniani 1, 35128, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Immunology Unit, Padua University School of Medicine, via Giustiniani 1, 35128, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Immunology Unit, Padua University School of Medicine, via Giustiniani 1, 35128, Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,2016/05/10 06:00,2016/05/10 06:01,['2016/05/10 06:00'],"['2016/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/10 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2016 Apr 1;8(1):e2016023. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2016.023. eCollection 2016.,10.4084/MJHID.2016.023 [doi],20160401,,PMC4848016,,,,"['10.4084/MJHID.2016.023 [doi]', 'mjhid-8-1-e2016023 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chemotherapeutic drugs that have been used in treating lung cancer include cisplatin-pemetrexed, cisplastin-gencitabinoe, carboplatin-paclitaxel and crizotinib. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. However, its effects on lung cancer are not known. We hypothesize that ATO may also have a bioactivity against lung cancer, and its mechanisms of action may involve apoptosis, DNA damage and changes in stress-related proteins in lung cancer cells. METHODS: To test the above stated hypothesis, lung carcinoma (A549) cells were used as the test model. The effects of ATO were examined by performing 6-diamidine-2 phenylindole (DAPI) nuclear staining for morphological characterization of apoptosis, flow cytometry analysis for early apoptosis, and western blot analysis for stress-related proteins (Hsp70 and cfos) and apoptotic protein expressions. Also, the single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay was used to evaluate the genotoxic effect. RESULTS: ATO-induced apoptosis was evidenced by chromatin condensation and formation of apoptotic bodies as revealed by DAPI nuclear staining. Cell shrinkage and membrane blebbing were observed at 4 and 6 microg/ml of ATO. Data from the western blot analysis revealed a significant dose-dependent increase (p < 0.05) in the Hsp 70, caspase 3 and p53 protein expression, and a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in the cfos, and bcl-2 protein expression at 4 and 6 microg/ml of ATO. There was a slight decrease in cytochrome c protein expression at 4 and 6 microg/ ml of ATO. Comet assay data revealed significant dose-dependent increases in the percentages of DNA damage, Comet tail lengths, and Comet tail moment. CONCLUSION: Taken together our results indicate that ATO is cytotoxic to lung cancer cells and its bioactivity is associated with oxidative damage, changes in cellular morphology, and apoptosis.","['Walker, Alice M', 'Stevens, Jacqueline J', 'Ndebele, Kenneth', 'Tchounwou, Paul B']","['Walker AM', 'Stevens JJ', 'Ndebele K', 'Tchounwou PB']","['Molecular and Cellular Biology Research Laboratory, Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi, USA.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology Research Laboratory, Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi, USA.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology Research Laboratory, Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi, USA.', 'Molecular Toxicology Research Laboratory, NIH-Center for Environmental Health, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cancer Sci Ther,Journal of cancer science & therapy,101526958,,,2016/05/10 06:00,2016/05/10 06:01,['2016/05/10 06:00'],"['2016/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/10 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,J Cancer Sci Ther. 2016 Jan;8(1):1-9. doi: 10.4172/1948-5956.1000379.

Online sequence alignment showed that there is a putative binding site of miR-223-3p on the 3'UTR of LIF, which is considered to be an important marker of endometrial receptivity. Thus, we hypothesized that miR-223-3p may affect embryo implantation by suppressing LIF expression. In this study, we found that miR-223-3p and LIF protein was inversely expressed in the endometrium of mice during implantation window. Then we proved that miR-223-3p directly binds to LIF 3'UTR with luciferase reporter assay and supresses the expression of LIF. To investigate whether miR-233-3p affects embryo implantation, miR-223-3p agonist was injected into the uteri of pregnant mice. The results demonstrated the suppressing effect of miR-223-3p on embryo implantation. Furthermore, over-expression of miR-223-3p was found to compromise pinopodes formation in the endometrium of mice. Taken all together, our findings revealed that miR-223-3p suppresses pinopodes formation and LIF protein expression, which may lead to diminished embryo implantation.","['Dong, Xiyuan', 'Sui, Cong', 'Huang, Kai', 'Wang, Lan', 'Hu, Dan', 'Xiong, Ting', 'Wang, Rui', 'Zhang, Hanwang']","['Dong X', 'Sui C', 'Huang K', 'Wang L', 'Hu D', 'Xiong T', 'Wang R', 'Zhang H']","[""Reproductive Medicine Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medicine College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology Jiefang Avenue 1095#, Wuhan 430030, People's Republic of China."", ""Reproductive Medicine Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medicine College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology Jiefang Avenue 1095#, Wuhan 430030, People's Republic of China."", ""Reproductive Medicine Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medicine College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology Jiefang Avenue 1095#, Wuhan 430030, People's Republic of China."", ""Reproductive Medicine Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medicine College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology Jiefang Avenue 1095#, Wuhan 430030, People's Republic of China."", ""Reproductive Medicine Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medicine College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology Jiefang Avenue 1095#, Wuhan 430030, People's Republic of China."", ""Reproductive Medicine Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medicine College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology Jiefang Avenue 1095#, Wuhan 430030, People's Republic of China."", ""Reproductive Medicine Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medicine College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology Jiefang Avenue 1095#, Wuhan 430030, People's Republic of China."", ""Reproductive Medicine Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medicine College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology Jiefang Avenue 1095#, Wuhan 430030, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Transl Res,American journal of translational research,101493030,,,2016/05/10 06:00,2016/05/10 06:01,['2016/05/10 06:00'],"['2016/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/10 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Am J Transl Res. 2016 Feb 15;8(2):1155-63. eCollection 2016.,,20160215,,PMC4846958,['NOTNLM'],"['LIF', 'MiR-223-3p', 'embryo implantation', 'pinopodes']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of hispidulin on the human leukemia cell line in vitro and the underlying mechanisms of its actions on these cells. Our results showed that hispidulin inhibits AML cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and induces cell apoptosis throughan intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. Our results also revealed that hispidulin treatment significantly inhibits extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) expression in both tested AML cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, and that the overexpression of EMMPRIN protein markedly attenuates hispidulin-induced cell apoptosis. Furthermore, our results strongly indicated that the modulating effect of hispidulin on EMMPRIN is correlated with its inhibitory effect on both the Akt and STAT3 signaling pathways.","['Gao, Hui', 'Liu, Yongji', 'Li, Kan', 'Wu, Tianhui', 'Peng, Jianjun', 'Jing, Fanbo']","['Gao H', 'Liu Y', 'Li K', 'Wu T', 'Peng J', 'Jing F']","['Qingdao University Medical College Qingdao, Shandong, 266071, China.', 'Qingdao Hiser Medical Center Qingdao, Shandong 266000, China.', 'Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University Shandong 250021, China.', ""Qingdao 5th People's Hospital Qingdao, Shandong 266000, China."", 'College of Life Sciences, Chongqing Normal University Chongqing 401331, China.', 'The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University Qingdao, Shandong 266003, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Transl Res,American journal of translational research,101493030,,,2016/05/10 06:00,2016/05/10 06:01,['2016/05/10 06:00'],"['2015/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/10 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Am J Transl Res. 2016 Feb 15;8(2):1115-32. eCollection 2016.,,20160215,,PMC4846955,['NOTNLM'],"['Akt', 'EMMPRIN', 'Hispidulin', 'STAT3', 'apoptosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BAK1 was predicted to be the target gene of microRNA-451 (miR-125b). The present study was designed to illustrate the mechanism of miR-125b in regulating CML via targeting BAK1. In this study, we found that the expression of miR-125b increased strongly, whereas the expression of BAK1 decreased significantly in CML patients and CML cell lines compared with healthy controls. Moreover, the luciferase report assay confirmed the interaction between miR-125b and BAK1 mRNA. After transfection of the miR-125b mimic or miR-125b inhibitor into CML cells, we found that the inhibition of miR-125b decreased the proliferation rates and promoted apoptosis with cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in both K562 and NB-4 cells, increased the expression of BAK1 and Caspase-3, and decreased the expression of Bcl-2 and c-myc; the miR-125b mimic yielded the opposite results. In addition, siBAK1 offset the suppression effect of the miR-125b inhibitor in K562 cells, indicating that miR-125b promotes these cellular processes by inhibiting the expression of BAK1. Further in vivo experiments supported these findings because miR-125b suppression reduced CML growth in mice. Taken together, our study suggests that the down-regulation of miR-125b affects the expression of BAK1, promotes cell apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation, leading to up-regulated expression of pro-apoptosis factors, down-regulated expression of anti-apoptosis factors in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, and decreased tumor size and weight of CML in vivo.

It was previously shown that aberrant DNA methylation of distinct target genes defines a more aggressive variant of JMML, but only few significant targets are known so far. To get a broader picture of disturbed CpG methylation patterns in JMML, we carried out a methylation screen of 34 candidate genes in 45 patients using quantitative mass spectrometry. FINDINGS: Five of 34 candidate genes analyzed showed recurrent hypermethylation in JMML. cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein (CREBBP) was the most frequent target of epigenetic modification (77 % of cases). However, no pathogenic mutations of CREBBP were identified in a genetic analysis of 64 patients. CREBBP hypermethylation correlated with clinical parameters known to predict poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the relevance of epigenetic aberrations in JMML pathophysiology. Our data confirm that DNA hypermethylation in JMML is highly target-specific and associated with higher-risk features. These findings encourage the development of prognostic markers based on epigenetic alterations, which will be helpful in the difficult clinical management of this heterogeneous disease.","['Fluhr, Silvia', 'Boerries, Melanie', 'Busch, Hauke', 'Symeonidi, Aikaterini', 'Witte, Tania', 'Lipka, Daniel B', 'Mucke, Oliver', 'Nollke, Peter', 'Krombholz, Christopher Felix', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte M', 'Plass, Christoph', 'Flotho, Christian']","['Fluhr S', 'Boerries M', 'Busch H', 'Symeonidi A', 'Witte T', 'Lipka DB', 'Mucke O', 'Nollke P', 'Krombholz CF', 'Niemeyer CM', 'Plass C', 'Flotho C']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center, Mathildenstrasse 1, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Hermann Staudinger Graduate School, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine and Cell Research, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine and Cell Research, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine and Cell Research, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center, Mathildenstrasse 1, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center, Mathildenstrasse 1, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center, Mathildenstrasse 1, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center, Mathildenstrasse 1, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,IM,"['CREB-Binding Protein/*genetics', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mass Spectrometry/methods', 'Prognosis']",2016/05/10 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/05/10 06:00'],"['2016/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2016 May 5;8:50. doi: 10.1186/s13148-016-0216-3. eCollection 2016.,10.1186/s13148-016-0216-3 [doi],20160505,"['EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)']",PMC4858931,['NOTNLM'],"['CREBBP', 'DNA methylation', 'Epigenetics', 'Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia']",,"['10.1186/s13148-016-0216-3 [doi]', '216 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We set out to elucidate the role of Hh signaling in CP-CML and determine if inhibition of Hh signaling, through inhibition of smoothened (SMO), was an effective strategy to target CP-CML LSC. Assessment of Hh pathway gene and protein expression demonstrated that the Hh pathway is activated in CD34(+) CP-CML stem/progenitor cells. LDE225 (Sonidegib), a small molecule, clinically investigated SMO inhibitor, used alone and in combination with nilotinib, inhibited the Hh pathway in CD34(+) CP-CML cells, reducing the number and self-renewal capacity of CML LSC in vitro. The combination had no effect on normal haemopoietic stem cells. When combined, LDE225 + nilotinib reduced CD34(+) CP-CML cell engraftment in NSG mice and, upon administration to EGFP(+) /SCLtTA/TRE-BCR-ABL mice, the combination enhanced survival with reduced leukaemia development in secondary transplant recipients. In conclusion, the Hh pathway is deregulated in CML stem and progenitor cells. We identify Hh pathway inhibition, in combination with nilotinib, as a potentially effective therapeutic strategy to improve responses in CP-CML by targeting both stem and progenitor cells.","['Irvine, David A', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Kinstrie, Ross', 'Tarafdar, Anuradha', 'Morrison, Heather', 'Campbell, Victoria L', 'Moka, Hothri A', 'Ho, Yinwei', 'Nixon, Colin', 'Manley, Paul W', 'Wheadon, Helen', 'Goodlad, John R', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Copland, Mhairi']","['Irvine DA', 'Zhang B', 'Kinstrie R', 'Tarafdar A', 'Morrison H', 'Campbell VL', 'Moka HA', 'Ho Y', 'Nixon C', 'Manley PW', 'Wheadon H', 'Goodlad JR', 'Holyoake TL', 'Bhatia R', 'Copland M']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 0XB, UK."", 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Centre, Duarte, CA, USA.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 0XB, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 0XB, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 0XB, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 0XB, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 0XB, UK."", 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Centre, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Histology, The Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Garscube Estate, Switchback Rd, Glasgow G61 1BD, UK.', 'Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 0XB, UK."", 'Department of Histology, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road South, Edinburgh EH4 2XU, UK.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 0XB, UK."", 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 0XB, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Biphenyl Compounds/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Pyridines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Small Molecule Libraries/pharmacology', 'Spleen/pathology']",2016/05/10 06:00,2018/02/06 06:00,['2016/05/10 06:00'],"['2015/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/06 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 May 9;6:25476. doi: 10.1038/srep25476.,10.1038/srep25476 [doi],20160509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', '0RLU3VTK5M (sonidegib)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",PMC4860619,,,,"['srep25476 [pii]', '10.1038/srep25476 [doi]']",,,"['CAF/08/09/CSO_/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom', 'P30 CA013148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA172447/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'SCD/04/CSO_/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom', 'R01 CA095684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '11008/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To characterize the role of activated NOTCH3 in cancer, we generated an antibody that detects the neo-epitope created upon gamma-secretase cleavage of NOTCH3 to release its intracellular domain (ICD3), and sequenced the negative regulatory region (NRR) and PEST (proline, glutamate, serine, threonine) domain coding regions of NOTCH3 in a panel of cell lines. We also characterize NOTCH3 tumor-associated mutations that result in activation of signaling and report new inhibitory antibodies. We determined the structural basis for receptor inhibition by obtaining the first co-crystal structure of a NOTCH3 antibody with the NRR protein and defined two distinct epitopes for NRR antibodies. The antibodies exhibit potent anti-leukemic activity in cell lines and tumor xenografts harboring NOTCH3 activating mutations. Screening of primary T-ALL samples reveals that 2 of 40 tumors examined show active NOTCH3 signaling. We also identified evidence of NOTCH3 activation in 12 of 24 patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models, 2 of which exhibit activation of NOTCH3 without activation of NOTCH1. Our studies provide additional insights into NOTCH3 activation and offer a path forward for identification of cancers that are likely to respond to therapy with NOTCH3 selective inhibitory antibodies.","['Bernasconi-Elias, P', 'Hu, T', 'Jenkins, D', 'Firestone, B', 'Gans, S', 'Kurth, E', 'Capodieci, P', 'Deplazes-Lauber, J', 'Petropoulos, K', 'Thiel, P', 'Ponsel, D', 'Hee Choi, S', 'LeMotte, P', 'London, A', 'Goetcshkes, M', 'Nolin, E', 'Jones, M D', 'Slocum, K', 'Kluk, M J', 'Weinstock, D M', 'Christodoulou, A', 'Weinberg, O', 'Jaehrling, J', 'Ettenberg, S A', 'Buckler, A', 'Blacklow, S C', 'Aster, J C', 'Fryer, C J']","['Bernasconi-Elias P', 'Hu T', 'Jenkins D', 'Firestone B', 'Gans S', 'Kurth E', 'Capodieci P', 'Deplazes-Lauber J', 'Petropoulos K', 'Thiel P', 'Ponsel D', 'Hee Choi S', 'LeMotte P', 'London A', 'Goetcshkes M', 'Nolin E', 'Jones MD', 'Slocum K', 'Kluk MJ', 'Weinstock DM', 'Christodoulou A', 'Weinberg O', 'Jaehrling J', 'Ettenberg SA', 'Buckler A', 'Blacklow SC', 'Aster JC', 'Fryer CJ']","['Developmental and Molecular Pathways, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Center for Proteomic Chemistry, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Developmental and Molecular Pathways, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Developmental and Molecular Pathways, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Discovery Alliances and Technologies, MorphoSys AG, Martinsried, Germany.', 'Discovery Alliances and Technologies, MorphoSys AG, Martinsried, Germany.', 'Discovery Alliances and Technologies, MorphoSys AG, Martinsried, Germany.', 'Discovery Alliances and Technologies, MorphoSys AG, Martinsried, Germany.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biologics, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biologics, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Developmental and Molecular Pathways, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Developmental and Molecular Pathways, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Pathology Children Hospital Boston, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Discovery Alliances and Technologies, MorphoSys AG, Martinsried, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Developmental and Molecular Pathways, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Developmental and Molecular Pathways, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Codon', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epitopes/chemistry/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', '*Mutation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptor, Notch3/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2016/05/10 06:00,2017/09/07 06:00,['2016/05/10 06:00'],"['2016/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2016 Nov 24;35(47):6077-6086. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.133.

A recent study of our group revealed that the membrane-permeable cCMP analog cCMP-acetoxymethylester (cCMP-AM) induces apoptosis in mouse lymphoma cells independent of protein kinase A via an intrinsic and mitochondria-dependent pathway. In our present study, we examined the effects of various cNMP-AMs in human tumor cell lines. In HEL cells, a human erythroleukemia cell line, cCMP-AM effectively reduced the number of viable cells, effectively induced apoptosis by altering the mitochondrial membrane potential and thereby caused changes in the cell cycle. cCMP itself was biologically inactive, indicating that membrane penetration is required to trigger intracellular effects. cCMP-AM did not induce apoptosis in K-562 cells, a human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, due to rapid export via multidrug resistance-associated proteins. The biological effects of cCMP-AM differed from those of other cNMP-AMs. In conclusion, cCMP effectively induces apoptosis in HEL cells, cCMP export prevents apoptosis of K-562 cells and cNMPs differentially regulate various aspects of apoptosis, cell growth and mitochondrial function. In a broader perspective, our data support the concept of distinct second messenger roles of cAMP, cGMP, cCMP and cUMP.","['Dittmar, Fanni', 'Wolter, Sabine', 'Seifert, Roland']","['Dittmar F', 'Wolter S', 'Seifert R']","['Institute of Pharmacology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, D-30625 Hannover, Germany.

Previous in vitro findings including ours suggest that divergent molecular aberrations in CMML seem to converge within the GM-CSF signaling pathway. As JAK2 is a sentinel kinase in this pathway, JAK2 inhibition may be an attractive treatment approach in CMML. We investigated the in vitro effects of the specific JAK2 inhibitor TG101209 on the autonomous CFU-GM formation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with CMML. TG101209 was found to either block or strongly inhibit spontaneous CFU-GM growth in all 10 patients tested. This inhibitory effect was dose dependent and significantly more pronounced as compared to the inhibitory effect on stimulated CFU-GM growth from normal individuals. In a CMML patient with splenomegaly, who was treated with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib off label, we can demonstrate a spleen response and the disappearance of constitutional symptoms which was associated with a decrease in autonomous CFU-GM formation ex vivo. Pharmacological JAK2 inhibition may be an interesting approach to be systematically studied in patients with CMML.","['Geissler, Klaus', 'Jager, Eva', 'Barna, Agnes', 'Sliwa, Thamer', 'Knobl, Paul', 'Schwarzinger, Ilse', 'Gisslinger, Heinz', 'Valent, Peter']","['Geissler K', 'Jager E', 'Barna A', 'Sliwa T', 'Knobl P', 'Schwarzinger I', 'Gisslinger H', 'Valent P']","['5th Medical Department with Hematology, Oncology and Palliative Medicine, Hospital Hietzing, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Blood Transfusion Service for Upper Austria, Austrian Red Cross, Linz, Austria.', '3rd Medical Department, Hanusch Hospital, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Progenitor Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/diagnosis/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nitriles', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2016/05/10 06:00,2017/02/07 06:00,['2016/05/10 06:00'],"['2016/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2016 Dec;97(6):562-567. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12773.

HDM4 has not been assessed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We examined the expression of HDM4 and the short splicing variant, HDM4-S, in bone marrow samples obtained from 85 and 23 patients with AML and MDS, respectively, and 18 negative tumor staging bone marrow samples (used as the control). Immunohistochemical staining showed that HDM4 was overexpressed in 78 AML cases (92%) and 12 MDS cases (52%) compared with 1 stressed bone marrow sample (6%). Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of 8 AML and 11 low-grade (LG)-MDS cases confirmed that HDM4 and HDM4-S mRNA expression were also elevated in all AML cases. HDM4 and HDM4-S mRNA expression was elevated in 3 (27%) and 10 (91%) LG-MDS cases, respectively. HDM4 and HDM4-S mRNA levels were higher in those with AML than in those with LG-MDS. In leukemia cell lines, HEL and U937 predominantly expressed HDM4-S. In contrast, NALM6 expressed HDM4 and HDM4-S. Downregulation of HDM4 expression by treatment with small interfering RNA in NALM6 and HEL cells induced p21 expression but not increased apoptotic activity.

We describe an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor in the lower abdominal wall of an adult male, which occurred 88days after he received an allogeneic stem cell transplant for T-lymphoblastic lymphoma, and which was positive for ALK immunohistochemistry and showed ALK gene rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Two other cases are reported in the post-stem cell transplant setting, but both occurred in children and did not have molecular analysis performed. The etiology remains unclear, but may be due to immune dysregulation caused by any combination of prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immune suppression. These neoplasms should be considered as a rare consequence of allogeneic stem cell transplantation and referral to a specialist sarcoma center for further management may be required.","['Vroobel, Katherine', 'Judson, Ian', 'Dainton, Melissa', 'McCormick, Alison', 'Fisher, Cyril', 'Thway, Khin']","['Vroobel K', 'Judson I', 'Dainton M', 'McCormick A', 'Fisher C', 'Thway K']","['Sarcoma Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK.', 'Sarcoma Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK.', 'Clinical Cytogenetics, Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, Surrey, UK.', 'Clinical Cytogenetics, Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, Surrey, UK.', 'Sarcoma Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK.', 'Sarcoma Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK.

The compounds were prepared via ZrOCl2.8H2O catalyzed condensation reactions between phthalaldehydic acid and different acetophenones. The reactions were carried out free of solvent and the isobenzofuran-1(3H)-ones were obtained in good yields (80-92%). The identities of the synthesized compounds were confirmed upon IR and NMR ((1)H and (13)C) spectroscopy as well as high resolution mass spectrometry analyses. Structures of compounds 1, 4 and 16 were also investigated by X-ray analysis. The synthesized compounds were submitted to in vitro bioassays against HL-60, K562 and NALM6 cancer cell lines using MTT cytotoxicity assay. After 48h of treatment, twelve derivatives were able to reduce cell viability and presented IC50 values equal to or below 20mumolL(-1) against at least one of the evaluated lineages. The most active compound corresponded to 3-(3-methylphenyl-2-oxoethyl)isobenzofuran-1(3H)-one (18) (IC50 values obtained for HL-60, K562 and NALM6 were, respectively, 13.5mumolL(-1), 8.83mumolL(-1), and 5.24mumolL(-1)). In addition, compound 18 was capable of triggering apoptosis on NALM6 cells. All isobenzofuranones herein evaluated did not present cytotoxicity on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), suggesting selective cytotoxic effect on leukemic cells. A computational study allowed prediction of pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness properties of the synthesized compounds.

Overexpression of recombinant l-asparaginase was achieved with an optimized final concentration of 1.5mM of isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) and the enzyme was expressed as a soluble protein. The recombinant enzyme was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) chromatography and the purified enzyme disclosed an elevated level of asparaginase activity (158.1IU/mL). Optimum pH and temperature of the purified l-asparaginase for the hydrolysis of l-asparagine were 8.0 and 37 degrees C and it was very specific for its natural substrate, l-asparagine. Detailed studies were carried out on the kinetics of enzyme reaction, catalytic activity, temperature and ionic strength and the thermostability of the l-asparaginase enzyme.

As most of the compounds are highly potent against K562 cells, all the synthesized compounds were evaluated for Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity by using well-established ADP-Glo assay method. Dasatinib was utilized as positive control to validate in both biological evaluations. The biological activity revealed that the compounds 5c, 5e, 6g, 9e, 9f and 10c were potent Bcr/Abl kinase inhibitors among the titled compounds.

An Evidence-Based Meta-Analysis.,1547-52,"BACKGROUND Possible associations of parasite infection with cancer risk have recently attracted much attention. Published studies concerning the association between Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) infection and leukemia risk have generated inconsistent results. In the present study, we aimed to address this topic by conducting a quantitative meta-analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Relevant publications were searched in electronic databases and eligible studies were rigorously screened and selected. Essential information was extracted and the data were pooled. Subgroup analysis on source of controls and detection target was also performed. RESULTS A total of 6 studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected. The overall data show that T. gondii infection might have an association with increased leukemia risk (OR=3.05; 95%CI=1.83-5.08). Similar results were shown in the subgroups regarding source of controls and detection target. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that T. gondii infection might be a risk factor for leukemia, providing new insight into the etiology of leukemia. Future studies with large sample sizes in different geographic areas are needed to confirm this conclusion.","['Huang, Yi', 'Huang, Yu', 'Chang, Aoshuang', 'Wang, Jishi', 'Zeng, Xiaoqing', 'Wu, Jiahong']","['Huang Y', 'Huang Y', 'Chang A', 'Wang J', 'Zeng X', 'Wu J']","['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China (mainland).', 'Department of Invasive Technology, Cancer Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China (mainland).', 'Department of Parasitology, College of Basic Medicine, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China (mainland).', 'Department of Parasitology, College of Basic Medicine, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China (mainland).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia/*parasitology', 'Risk Factors', 'Toxoplasma/*isolation & purification', 'Toxoplasmosis/*pathology']",2016/05/08 06:00,2017/02/22 06:00,['2016/05/08 06:00'],"['2016/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2016 May 7;22:1547-52. doi: 10.12659/msm.897155.,,20160507,,PMC4917333,,,,"['897155 [pii]', '10.12659/msm.897155 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, drugs which restore the sensitivity of leukemic cells to apoptotic stimuli are promising candidates in the treatment of leukemia. Recently, we have demonstrated that sanguinarine (SNG), a benzophenanthridine alkaloid, isolated from Sanguinaria canadensis induces ROS-dependent ERK1/2 activation and autophagic cell death in human malignant glioma cells (Pallichankandy et al., 2015; [43]). In this study, we investigated the antileukemic potential of SNG in vitro, and further examined the molecular mechanisms of SNG-induced cell death. In human leukemic cells, SNG activated apoptotic cell death pathway characterized by activation of caspase cascade, DNA fragmentation and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins. Importantly, we have identified a crucial role for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-dependent ceramide (Cer) generation in the facilitation of SNG-induced apoptosis. Additionally, we have found that SNG inhibits Akt, a key anti-apoptotic protein kinase by dephosphorylating it at Ser(473), leading to the dephosphorylation of its downstream targets, GSK3beta and mTOR. Interestingly, inhibition of Cer generation, using acid sphingomyelinase inhibitor, significantly reduced the SNG-induced Akt dephosphorylation and apoptosis, whereas, activation of Cer generation using inhibitors of acid ceramidase and glucosylceramide synthase enhanced it. Furthermore, using a group of ceramide activated protein phosphatases (CAPPs) inhibitor (calyculin A, Okadaic acid, and phosphatidic acid), the involvement of protein phosphatase 1 form of CAPP in SNG-induced Akt dephosphorylation and apoptosis was demonstrated. Altogether, these results underscore a critical role for H2O2-Cer-Akt signaling axis in the antileukemic action of SNG.","['Rahman, Anees', 'Thayyullathil, Faisal', 'Pallichankandy, Siraj', 'Galadari, Sehamuddin']","['Rahman A', 'Thayyullathil F', 'Pallichankandy S', 'Galadari S']","['Cell Signaling Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, UAE University, P.O.

Although the use of G-PB results in faster hematopoietic recovery, it is also associated with more chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). A potential alternative allograft is filgrastim-stimulated marrow (G-BM), which we hypothesized may be associated with prompt hematopoietic recovery but with less cGVHD. We conducted a phase 3, open-label, multicenter randomized trial of 230 adults with hematologic malignancies receiving allografts from siblings after myeloablative conditioning to compare G-PB with G-BM. The primary endpoint was time to treatment failure, defined as a composite of extensive cGVHD, relapse/disease progression, and death. With a median follow-up of 36 months (range, 9.6 to 48), comparing G-BM with G-PB, there was no difference between the 2 arms with respect to the primary outcome of this study (hazard ratio [HR], .91; 95% confidence interval [CI], .68 to 1.22; P = .52). However, the cumulative incidence of overall cGVHD was lower with G-BM (HR, .66; 95% CI, .46 to .95; P = .007) and there was no difference in the risk of relapse or progression (P = .35). The median times to neutrophil recovery (P = .0004) and platelet recovery (P = .012) were 3 days shorter for recipients allocated to G-PB compared with those allocated to G-BM, but there were no differences in secondary engraftment-related outcomes, such as time to first hospital discharge (P = .17). In addition, there were no graft failures in either arm. This trial demonstrates that, compared with G-PB, the use of G-BM allografts leads to a significantly lower rate of overall cGVHD without a loss of the graft-versus-tumor effect and comparable overall survival. Our findings suggest that further study of this type of allograft is warranted.","['Couban, Stephen', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Lachance, Sylvie', 'Walker, Irwin', 'Toze, Cynthia', 'Rubinger, Morel', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'Szer, Jeff', 'Doocey, Richard', 'Lewis, Ian D', 'Huebsch, Lothar', 'Howson-Jan, Kang', 'Lalancette, Michel', 'Almohareb, Fahad', 'Chaudhri, Nadeem', 'Ivison, Sabine', 'Broady, Raewyn', 'Levings, Megan', 'Fairclough, Diane', 'Devins, Gerald', 'Szwajcer, David', 'Foley, Ronan', 'Smith, Clayton', 'Panzarella, Tony', 'Kerr, Holly', 'Kariminia, Amina', 'Schultz, Kirk R']","['Couban S', 'Aljurf M', 'Lachance S', 'Walker I', 'Toze C', 'Rubinger M', 'Lipton JH', 'Lee SJ', 'Szer J', 'Doocey R', 'Lewis ID', 'Huebsch L', 'Howson-Jan K', 'Lalancette M', 'Almohareb F', 'Chaudhri N', 'Ivison S', 'Broady R', 'Levings M', 'Fairclough D', 'Devins G', 'Szwajcer D', 'Foley R', 'Smith C', 'Panzarella T', 'Kerr H', 'Kariminia A', 'Schultz KR']","['Department of Medicine, Capital District Health Authority and Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.

Here, we show that the H3K36me2 chromatin mark written by the ASH1L histone methyltransferase is preferentially bound in vivo by LEDGF, a mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-associated protein that colocalizes with MLL, ASH1L, and H3K36me2 on chromatin genome wide. Furthermore, ASH1L facilitates recruitment of LEDGF and wild-type MLL proteins to chromatin at key leukemia target genes and is a crucial regulator of MLL-dependent transcription and leukemic transformation. Conversely, KDM2A, an H3K36me2 demethylase and Polycomb group silencing protein, antagonizes MLL-associated leukemogenesis. Our studies are the first to provide a basic mechanistic insight into epigenetic interactions wherein placement, interpretation, and removal of H3K36me2 contribute to the regulation of gene expression and MLL leukemia, and suggest ASH1L as a novel target for therapeutic intervention. SIGNIFICANCE: Epigenetic regulators play vital roles in cancer pathogenesis and represent a new frontier in therapeutic targeting. Our studies provide basic mechanistic insight into the role of H3K36me2 in transcription activation and MLL leukemia pathogenesis and implicate ASH1L histone methyltransferase as a promising target for novel molecular therapy.

Chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and its receptor CXC receptor 4 (CXCR4) play crucial roles in malignant cell invasion. Genetic polymorphisms may contribute to the differences in the expression level and activities associated with the SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway. This study aimed to determine the associations between the polymorphisms located on the SDF-1 (rs1801157, G>A) and CXCR4 (rs2228014, C>T) encoding genes and susceptibility and leukemia cell dissemination in AML. METHODS: A total of 926 individuals, including 466 de novo AML patients and 460 healthy controls were genotyped for rs1801157 and rs2228014 using DNA Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Genotype distributions of CT and CT+TT for rs2228014 were significantly increased in AML patients compared with healthy controls [OR: 1.36, p=0.04; OR: 1.34, p=0.04; respectively]. However, rs1801157 demonstrated no significant differences in genotype distributions and allele frequency between AML patients and healthy controls. For the two combined SNPs, there was no significant proportional difference between the wild type GG-CC genotypes and non-GG-CC genotypes in AML patients and healthy controls. Additionally, peripheral blood leukemia-cell (PBLC) count was not statistically influenced by the genotypes of either rs1801157 or rs2228014. CONCLUSION: Genotype CT of rs2228014 appeared to correlate with AML risk, but played no role in leukemia cells invading the bloodstream, while rs1801157 and the two combined SNPs were not associated with either increased AML risk or extramedullary leukemia-cell dissemination.","['Zheng, Qin', 'Shuai, Xiao', 'Ye, Yuanxin', 'Jin, Yongmei', 'Jiang, Nenggang', 'Chen, Xingyuan', 'Su, Jun']","['Zheng Q', 'Shuai X', 'Ye Y', 'Jin Y', 'Jiang N', 'Chen X', 'Su J']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Genotyping Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/metabolism/pathology', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*genetics/metabolism', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction']",2016/05/08 06:00,2017/01/27 06:00,['2016/05/08 06:00'],"['2016/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/10 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Gene. 2016 Aug 22;588(2):103-8. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2016.04.059.

In B lymphocytes, TNFR-associated factor 3 inhibits signaling by TNFR superfamily receptors, Toll-like receptors, and interleukin-6R. In contrast, signaling to B cells by the virally encoded oncogenic protein latent membrane protein 1 is promoted by TNFR-associated factor 3. An important B cell-specific role for TNFR-associated factor 3 is the inhibition of homeostatic survival, directly relevant to the common occurrence of TNFR-associated factor 3 mutations in human B cell malignancies. TNFR-associated factor 3 was recently found to be a resident nuclear protein in B cells, where it interacts with and inhibits gene expression mediated by the cAMP response element-binding protein transcription complex, including expression of the prosurvival protein myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein 1. In T lymphocytes, TNFR-associated factor 3 is required for normal signaling by the T cell antigen receptor, while inhibiting signaling by the interleukin-2 receptor. Cytoplasmic TNFR -associated factor 3 restrains nuclear factor-kappaB2 activation in both T and B cells.

We had synthesized non-natural heterocyclic analogs and evaluated their anti-tumor activity by measuring effect on cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in different cell lines.

In this study, we further investigated the mechanistic aspects of anticancer properties of G-11 in HL-60 cell line. We demonstrated that cytotoxic effect of G-11 is mediated by caspase-dependent apoptosis. However, the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction induced by G-11 was independent of caspases. G-11 triggered generation of ROS, caused disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, increased release of cytochrome c to the cytosol, and altered the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins. These results suggest significant involvement of intrinsic apoptotic pathway.

Although altered DNA methylation has been reported in both benzene-exposed human subjects and HQ-exposed cultured cells, the inventory of benzene metabolite effects on the epigenome is only starting to be established. In this study, we used a monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from cord blood to investigate the effects of HQ treatment on the expression of the three most important families of retrotransposons in the human genome: LINE-1, Alu and Endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), that are normally subjected to tight epigenetic silencing. We found a clear tendency towards increased retrotransposon expression in response to HQ exposure, more pronounced in the case of LINE-1 and HERV. Such a partial loss of silencing, however, was generally not associated with HQ-induced DNA hypomethylation. On the other hand, retroelement derepression was also observed in the same cells in response to the hypomethylating agent decitabine. These observations suggest the existence of different types of epigenetic switches operating at human retroelements, and point to retroelement activation in response to benzene-derived metabolites as a novel factor deserving attention in benzene carcinogenesis studies.","['Conti, Anastasia', 'Rota, Federica', 'Ragni, Enrico', 'Favero, Chiara', 'Motta, Valeria', 'Lazzari, Lorenza', 'Bollati, Valentina', 'Fustinoni, Silvia', 'Dieci, Giorgio']","['Conti A', 'Rota F', 'Ragni E', 'Favero C', 'Motta V', 'Lazzari L', 'Bollati V', 'Fustinoni S', 'Dieci G']","['Department of Life Sciences, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'EPIGET - Epidemiology, Epigenetics and Toxicology Lab, Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milano, Milan, Italy.', ""Cell Factory, Unit of Cell Therapy and Cryobiology, Fondazione Ca' Granda, IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'EPIGET - Epidemiology, Epigenetics and Toxicology Lab, Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milano, Milan, Italy.', 'EPIGET - Epidemiology, Epigenetics and Toxicology Lab, Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milano, Milan, Italy.', ""Cell Factory, Unit of Cell Therapy and Cryobiology, Fondazione Ca' Granda, IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", ""EPIGET - Epidemiology, Epigenetics and Toxicology Lab, Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milano, Milan, Italy; Epidemiology Unit, Fondazione Ca' Granda, IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", ""EPIGET - Epidemiology, Epigenetics and Toxicology Lab, Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milano, Milan, Italy; Epidemiology Unit, Fondazione Ca' Granda, IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.

These patients are characterized by increased susceptibility to infections. Rice bran arabinoxylan (Ribraxx) has been shown to have immunostimulatory, anti-inflammatory, and proapoptotic effects. We postulated that addition of Ribraxx to curcumin therapy may be of benefit. Study design Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)/smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) or stage 0/1 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients who had been on oral curcumin therapy for a period of 6 months or more were administered both curcumin (as Curcuforte) and Ribraxx. Methods Ten MGUS/SMM patients and 10 patients with stage 0/1 CLL were administered 6 g of curcumin and 2 g Ribraxx daily. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at 2-month intervals for a period of 6 months, and various markers were monitored. MGUS/SMM patients included full blood count (FBC); paraprotein; free light chains/ratio; C-reactive protein (CRP)and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR); B2 microglobulin and immunological markers. Markers monitored for stage 0/1 CLL were FBC, CRP and ESR, and immunological markers. Results Of 10 MGUS/SMM patients,5 (50%) were neutropenic at baseline, and the Curcuforte/Ribraxx combination therapy showed an increased neutrophil count, varying between 10% and 90% among 8 of the 10 (80%) MGUS/SMM patients. An additional benefit of the combination therapy was the potent effect in reducing the raised ESR in 4 (44%) of the MGUS/SMM patients. Conclusion Addition of Ribraxx to curcumin therapy may be of benefit to patients with early-stage B-cell lymphoid malignancies.","['Golombick, Terry', 'Diamond, Terrence H', 'Manoharan, Arumugam', 'Ramakrishna, Rajeev']","['Golombick T', 'Diamond TH', 'Manoharan A', 'Ramakrishna R']","['St George Hospital, Sydney, Australia terry.golombick@sesiahs.health.nsw.gov.au.', 'St George Hospital, Sydney, Australia.', 'University of Wollongong, NSW, Australia.', 'University of Wollongong, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Integr Cancer Ther,Integrative cancer therapies,101128834,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'C-Reactive Protein/metabolism', 'Curcumin/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloma Proteins/metabolism', 'Oryza/*chemistry', 'Xylans/*therapeutic use']",2016/05/08 06:00,2017/10/13 06:00,['2016/05/08 06:00'],"['2015/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/13 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Integr Cancer Ther. 2016 Jun;15(2):183-9. doi: 10.1177/1534735416635742.

To the best of our knowledge only one case of myelofibrosis and acquired hemophilia A has been previously described. CASE PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old Caucasian man diagnosed with myelofibrosis evolving in acute myeloid leukemia was referred to us for postoperative bleeding. Hemostatic studies showed prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, decreased factor VIII coagulation, and a high factor VIII inhibitor titer; these findings led to a diagnosis of acquired hemophilia A for which he was treated with methylprednisolone and recombinant activated factor VII on admission. Due to a lack of response he was subsequently treated with rituximab combined with activated prothrombin complex concentrates. Furthermore, he received azacytidine to treat the underlying hematological malignancies. Immunosuppressive rituximab therapy resolved acquired hemophilia A with marked efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid and accurate diagnosis, effective hemostatic therapy, and timely treatment for underlying disease are important in the management of acquired hemophilia A secondary to hematological malignancy.","['Wrobel, Marie', 'Comio, Emilie', 'Gay, Valerie', 'Baroudi, Noureddine', 'Meyer, Pascal', 'Chuniaud-Louche, Christine', 'Hacini, Maya', 'Pica, Gian Matteo']","['Wrobel M', 'Comio E', 'Gay V', 'Baroudi N', 'Meyer P', 'Chuniaud-Louche C', 'Hacini M', 'Pica GM']","['Service of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Metropole Savoie, 73011, Chambery, France.', 'Medical laboratory, Centre Hospitalier Metropole Savoie, 73011, Chambery, France.', 'Haemophilia center and Transfusion medicine, Centre Hospitalier Metropole Savoie, 73011, Chambery, France.', 'Service of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Metropole Savoie, 73011, Chambery, France.', 'Service of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Metropole Savoie, 73011, Chambery, France.', 'Hospital Pharmacy, Centre Hospitalier Metropole Savoie, 73011, Chambery, France.', 'Service of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Metropole Savoie, 73011, Chambery, France.', 'Service of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Metropole Savoie, 73011, Chambery, France. gian-matteo.pica@ch-metropole-savoie.fr.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,IM,"['Aged', 'Blood Coagulation Factors/therapeutic use', 'Coagulants/therapeutic use', 'Factor VIIa/therapeutic use', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Hemophilia A/blood/*complications/drug therapy', 'Hemostatics/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Partial Thromboplastin Time', 'Postoperative Hemorrhage/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*complications', 'Rituximab/therapeutic use']",2016/05/08 06:00,2017/01/11 06:00,['2016/05/08 06:00'],"['2015/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/11 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2016 May 7;10(1):115. doi: 10.1186/s13256-016-0897-4.,10.1186/s13256-016-0897-4 [doi],20160507,"['0 (Blood Coagulation Factors)', '0 (Coagulants)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Hemostatics)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '37224-63-8 (prothrombin complex concentrates)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'EC 3.4.21.21 (Factor VIIa)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)', 'Factor 8 deficiency, acquired']",PMC4859983,['NOTNLM'],"['Acquired hemophilia A', 'Activated prothrombin complex concentrates', 'Azacytidine', 'Myelofibrosis', 'Rituximab']",,"['10.1186/s13256-016-0897-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s13256-016-0897-4 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is unknown whether allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) in first remission confers a survival benefit compared to a chemotherapy-only approach. We retrospectively compared the outcome of patients >40 years treated with HSCT or chemotherapy alone in first remission (n = 40 in each cohort). Three-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were not significantly different between the chemotherapy-only and HSCT groups (OS, 46% [31-68] vs. 40% [27-59], P = 0.35; DFS, 31% [18-52] vs. 40% [27-59], P = 0.98). The 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were 61% [41-76] and 9% [2-21] for the chemotherapy-only group and 28% [15-43] and 32% [17-47] for the transplant group (CIR, P = 0.011; NRM, P = 0.014). Allogeneic transplantation for patients >/=40 years with Ph-negative ALL in first remission is associated with a lower CIR, but this benefit is offset by considerable NRM as compared with chemotherapy-only approach.

We retrospectively investigated 609 patients from the NOPHO-AML database to determine the clinical and cytogenetic characteristics of +8 in pediatric AML and to investigate its prognostic impact. Complete cytogenetic data were available in 596 patients (98%) aged 0-18 years, diagnosed from 1993 to 2012, and treated according to the NOPHO-AML 1993 and 2004 protocols in the Nordic countries and Hong Kong. We identified 86 patients (14%) with +8. Trisomy 8 was combined with other cytogenetic aberrations in 68 patients (11%) (+8 other) and in 18 patients (3%), it was the sole abnormality (+8 alone). Trisomy 8 was associated with FAB M5 (36%) but otherwise clinically comparable with non-trisomy 8 patients. Trisomy 8 was favorable in patients of young age and with t(9;11). Trisomy 8 alone was associated with older age (median age 10.1 years), FAB M2 (33%), and FLT3-ITD mutations (58%). The 5-year event-free survival for patients with +8 alone was 50% and 5-year overall survival was 75%. In conclusion, +8 is one of the most common cytogenetic aberrations in pediatric AML. Trisomy 8 positive AML is a heterogeneous group and the majority of cases have additional cytogenetic aberrations. Patients with +8 alone differed from patients with +8 other and were associated with older age, FAB M2, and FLT3-ITD aberrations.

RESULTS: There were 201 patients, and 113 (56%) were PET responders (>/=35% decrease in the maximum standardized uptake value of the tumor). All PET responders received the same chemotherapy during radiation, whereas 38 of the 88 PET nonresponders (43%) changed chemotherapy. Among the 152 patients who underwent surgery, the pathologic complete response rate was 15% for PET responders and 3% for PET nonresponders who did not change chemotherapy (P = .046). The median progression-free survival (PFS; 18.9 vs 10.0 months, P < 0.01) and OS (37 vs 25.3 months, P = .02) were significantly better for PET responders versus PET nonresponders who did not change chemotherapy. The median PFS for PET nonresponders who changed chemotherapy was 17.9 months, and it was superior to the median PFS for PET nonresponders who did not change chemotherapy (P = .01). For PET nonresponders, the 5-year OS rates were 37% for those who changed chemotherapy and 25% for those who did not change chemotherapy (P = .18). CONCLUSIONS: A PET scan after induction chemotherapy predicts outcomes for locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma patients who undergo chemoradiation and surgery. The median PFS is improved, and trends toward improved OS appear possible in PET nonresponders who change chemotherapy during radiation. The fully accrued Cancer and Leukemia Group B 80803 study (NCT01333033) is evaluating this strategy. Cancer 2016;122:2083-90.

The origin and significance of high CE levels in cancer cell biology has not been completely clarified. Recent evidence that lymphoblastic cells selectively acquire exogenous CE from HDL via the scavenger receptor SR-BI has drawn attention to the additional membrane proteins involved in this pathway. P-glycopotein-MDR1 (P-gp) is a product of the MDR1 gene and confers resistance to antitumor drugs. Its possible role in plasma membrane cholesterol trafficking and CE metabolism has been suggested. In the present study this aspect was investigated in a lymphoblastic cell line selected for MDR1 resistance. CEM were made resistant by stepwise exposure to low (LR) and high (HR) doses of vincristine (VCR). P-gp activity ((3)H-vinblastine), CE content, CE and triglycerides (TG) synthesis ((14)C-oleate), neutral lipids and Dil-HDL uptake (fluorescence), SR-BI, ABCA1 and P-gp protein expression (western blotting) were determined. To better evaluate the relationship between CE metabolism and P-gp activity, the ACAT inhibitor Sandoz-58035 and the P-gp inhibitors progesterone, cyclosporine and verapamil were used. CE content and synthesis were similar in the parental and resistant cells. However, in the latter population, SR-BI protein expression increased, whereas CE-HDL uptake decreased. These changes correlated with the degree of VCR-resistance. As well as reverting MDR1-resistance, the inhibitors of P-gp activity induced the CE-HDL/SR-BI pathway by reactivating membrane cholesterol trafficking. Indeed, CE-HDL uptake, SRBI expression and CE content increased, whereas there was a decrease in cholesterol esterification. These results demonstrated that P-gp overexpression impairs anticancer drug uptake as well as the SR-BI mediated selective CE-HDL uptake. This suggests that these membrane proteins act in an opposite manner on the same transport mechanism. Therefore, the dampening activity of P-gp in this pathway and its reversal by P-gp inhibitors open new strategies for antitumor therapy in drug-resistant tumors.","['Spolitu, Stefano', 'Uda, Sabrina', 'Deligia, Stefania', 'Frau, Alessandra', 'Collu, Maria', 'Angius, Fabrizio', 'Batetta, Barbara']","['Spolitu S', 'Uda S', 'Deligia S', 'Frau A', 'Collu M', 'Angius F', 'Batetta B']","['Unit of Experimental Medicine, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Cagliari Cagliari, Italy.', 'Unit of Experimental Medicine, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Cagliari Cagliari, Italy.', 'Unit of Experimental Medicine, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Cagliari Cagliari, Italy.', 'Unit of Experimental Medicine, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Cagliari Cagliari, Italy.', 'Division of Neuroscience and Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Cagliari Cagliari, Italy.', 'Unit of Experimental Medicine, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Cagliari Cagliari, Italy.', 'Unit of Experimental Medicine, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Cagliari Cagliari, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Cancer Res,American journal of cancer research,101549944,,,2016/05/07 06:00,2016/05/07 06:01,['2016/05/07 06:00'],"['2016/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/07 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Am J Cancer Res. 2016 Feb 15;6(3):615-27. eCollection 2016.,,20160215,,PMC4851841,['NOTNLM'],"['P-glycoprotein-MDR1 inhibitors', 'Tumor biology', 'cell membrane', 'cholesterol traffic', 'multidrug resistance', 'neutral lipids']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proapoptotic proteins Caspase-9 and PP2Acalpha are functionally related in a direct interaction, which constitutes a promising target for cancer therapy. Both proteins present aberrant mRNA splicing variants that are antiapoptotic (Caspase-9b) and catalytically inactive (PP2Acalpha2), respectively. RESULTS: In this work we have analyzed the relative abundance of the aberrant spliced forms Caspase-9b and PP2Acalpha2 in several cell lines and chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and correlated it with several parameters of the disease. Despite 40 % of the patients presented Caspase-9b dysregulation, there was no direct association between alterations in Caspase-9b relative abundance and the parameters analyzed in medical records. More importantly, PP2Acalpha2 dysregulation was observed in 88 % of CLL patients and was related with advanced stages of the malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: Caspase-9b dysregulation seemed to be associated with the disease, although the differences between healthy donors and CLL patients were not statistically significant. However, PP2Acalpha2 dysregulation was significantly different between healthy donors and CLL patients and correlated with Binet B and C stages; therefore, we propose the use of PP2Acalpha2 dysregulation as a potential biomarker for advanced stages of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Dominguez-Berrocal, Leticia', 'Zhang, Xiguang', 'Zini, Jean Marc', 'Fominaya, Jesus', 'Rebollo, Angelita', 'Bravo, Jeronimo']","['Dominguez-Berrocal L', 'Zhang X', 'Zini JM', 'Fominaya J', 'Rebollo A', 'Bravo J']","['Instituto de Biomedicina de Valencia, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (IBV-CSIC), c/ Jaime Roig 11, 46010 Valencia, Spain.', ""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), U1135, 83, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, 91 bd de l'Hopital, 75013 Paris, France."", 'Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint Louis, 1 avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75010 Paris, France.', ""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), U1135, 83, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, 91 bd de l'Hopital, 75013 Paris, France."", ""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), U1135, 83, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, 91 bd de l'Hopital, 75013 Paris, France."", 'Instituto de Biomedicina de Valencia, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (IBV-CSIC), c/ Jaime Roig 11, 46010 Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biomark Res,Biomarker research,101607860,,,2016/05/07 06:00,2016/05/07 06:01,['2016/05/07 06:00'],"['2016/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/07 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Biomark Res. 2016 May 4;4:9. doi: 10.1186/s40364-016-0063-6. eCollection 2016.,10.1186/s40364-016-0063-6 [doi],20160504,,PMC4857392,['NOTNLM'],"['Alternative splicing', 'Biomarker', 'Caspase-9', 'Caspase-9b', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'PP2Acalpha', 'PP2Acalpha2']",,"['10.1186/s40364-016-0063-6 [doi]', '63 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prognostic and therapeutic implications.,941-50,"Despite therapeutic improvements, a sizable number of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia still have a poor outcome. To unravel the genomic background associated with refractoriness, we evaluated the transcriptome of 19 cases of refractory/early relapsed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (discovery cohort) by performing RNA-sequencing on diagnostic material. The incidence and prognostic impact of the most frequently mutated pathways were validated by Sanger sequencing on genomic DNA from diagnostic samples of an independent cohort of 49 cases (validation cohort), including refractory, relapsed and responsive cases. Combined gene expression and fusion transcript analyses in the discovery cohort revealed the presence of known oncogenes and identified novel rearrangements inducing overexpression, as well as inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Mutation analysis identified JAK/STAT and RAS/PTEN as the most commonly disrupted pathways in patients with chemorefractory disease or early relapse, frequently in association with NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations. The analysis on the validation cohort documented a significantly higher risk of relapse, inferior overall survival, disease-free survival and event-free survival in patients with JAK/STAT or RAS/PTEN alterations. Conversely, a significantly better survival was observed in patients harboring only NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations: this favorable prognostic effect was abrogated by the presence of concomitant mutations. Preliminary in vitro assays on primary cells demonstrated sensitivity to specific inhibitors. These data document the negative prognostic impact of JAK/STAT and RAS/PTEN mutations in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and suggest the potential clinical application of JAK and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors in patients harboring mutations in these pathways.","['Gianfelici, Valentina', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Demeyer, Sofie', 'Di Giacomo, Filomena', 'Messina, Monica', 'La Starza, Roberta', 'Peragine, Nadia', 'Paoloni, Francesca', 'Geerdens, Ellen', 'Pierini, Valentina', 'Elia, Loredana', 'Mancini, Marco', 'De Propris, Maria Stefania', 'Apicella, Valerio', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Testi, Anna Maria', 'Vitale, Antonella', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Mecucci, Cristina', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Cools, Jan', 'Foa, Robin']","['Gianfelici V', 'Chiaretti S', 'Demeyer S', 'Di Giacomo F', 'Messina M', 'La Starza R', 'Peragine N', 'Paoloni F', 'Geerdens E', 'Pierini V', 'Elia L', 'Mancini M', 'De Propris MS', 'Apicella V', 'Gaidano G', 'Testi AM', 'Vitale A', 'Vignetti M', 'Mecucci C', 'Guarini A', 'Cools J', 'Foa R']","['Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Belgium Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Science and Center for Experimental Research and Medical Studies (CeRMS), University of Turin, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'GIMEMA Data Center, Rome, Italy.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Belgium Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy GIMEMA Data Center, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Belgium Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy rfoa@bce.uniroma1.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Child', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'F-Box Proteins/metabolism', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Genetic Variation', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism', 'Young Adult', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",2016/05/07 06:00,2017/07/08 06:00,['2016/05/07 06:00'],"['2015/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/08 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2016 Aug;101(8):941-50. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2015.139410.

Genomic studies identified two types of deletions: interstitial and terminal. Interstitial 5q deletions, found in five cases, were present in both adults and children with a female predominance (chi-square, P=0.012). Interestingly, these cases resembled immature/early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia showing significant down-regulation of five out of the ten top differentially expressed genes in this leukemia group, including TCF7 which maps within the 5q31 common deleted region. Mutations of genes known to be associated with immature/early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, i.e. WT1, ETV6, JAK1, JAK3, and RUNX1, were present, while CDKN2A/B deletions/mutations were never detected. All patients had relapsed/resistant disease and blasts showed an early differentiation arrest with expression of myeloid markers. Terminal 5q deletions, found in 18 of patients, were more prevalent in adults (chi-square, P=0.010) and defined a subgroup of HOXA-positive T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia characterized by 130 up- and 197 down-regulated genes. Down-regulated genes included TRIM41, ZFP62, MAPK9, MGAT1, and CNOT6, all mapping within the 1.4 Mb common deleted region at 5q35.3. Of interest, besides CNOT6 down-regulation, these cases also showed low BTG1 expression and a high incidence of CNOT3 mutations, suggesting that the CCR4-NOT complex plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of HOXA-positive T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with terminal 5q deletions. In conclusion, interstitial and terminal 5q deletions are recurrent genomic losses identifying distinct subtypes of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['La Starza, Roberta', 'Barba, Gianluca', 'Demeyer, Sofie', 'Pierini, Valentina', 'Di Giacomo, Danika', 'Gianfelici, Valentina', 'Schwab, Claire', 'Matteucci, Caterina', 'Vicente, Carmen', 'Cools, Jan', 'Messina, Monica', 'Crescenzi, Barbara', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Foa, Robin', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Mecucci, Cristina']","['La Starza R', 'Barba G', 'Demeyer S', 'Pierini V', 'Di Giacomo D', 'Gianfelici V', 'Schwab C', 'Matteucci C', 'Vicente C', 'Cools J', 'Messina M', 'Crescenzi B', 'Chiaretti S', 'Foa R', 'Basso G', 'Harrison CJ', 'Mecucci C']","['Molecular Medicine Laboratory, Center for Hemato-Oncology Research, University of Perugia, Italy.', 'Molecular Medicine Laboratory, Center for Hemato-Oncology Research, University of Perugia, Italy.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Belgium Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Molecular Medicine Laboratory, Center for Hemato-Oncology Research, University of Perugia, Italy.', 'Molecular Medicine Laboratory, Center for Hemato-Oncology Research, University of Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, ""Sapienza"" University, Rome, Italy.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetic Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Molecular Medicine Laboratory, Center for Hemato-Oncology Research, University of Perugia, Italy.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Belgium Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Belgium Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, ""Sapienza"" University, Rome, Italy.', 'Molecular Medicine Laboratory, Center for Hemato-Oncology Research, University of Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, ""Sapienza"" University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, ""Sapienza"" University, Rome, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics ""Salus Pueri"", University of Padova, Italy.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetic Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Molecular Medicine Laboratory, Center for Hemato-Oncology Research, University of Perugia, Italy cristina.mecucci@unipg.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers', 'Child', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2016/05/07 06:00,2017/07/08 06:00,['2016/05/07 06:00'],"['2016/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/08 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2016 Aug;101(8):951-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.143875.

These spliceosomal mutations often occur in a mutually exclusive manner with one another and, in aggregate, account for the most frequent class of mutations in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) in particular. Although substantial progress has been made in understanding the effects of several of these mutations on splicing and splice site recognition, functional connections linking the mechanistic changes in splicing induced by these mutations to the phenotypic consequences of clonal and aberrant hematopoiesis are not yet well defined.

It has been shown to exhibit antioxidant, antiangiogenic, antiatherosclerotic, and anticancer properties. In this study, we demonstrated the ability of aqueous leaf extracts from TS to promote immune responses in BALB/c mice and to exhibit anti-leukemia activity in murine WEHI-3 cells. BALB/c mice were injected intravenously with WEHI-3 cells and then treated orally with TS (50 mg/kg). In vivo study showed that TS treatment reduced liver and spleen enlargement in WEHI-3 bearing mice compared with the untreated group. Furthermore, TS also decreased white blood cells (WBC), indicating inhibition of differentiation of the precursor of macrophages in WEHI-3 bearing mice. Treatment of WEHI-3 cells with TS (0-75 mug/mL for 24 hours) significantly reduced cell viability. Furthermore, TS treatment-induced late apoptosis was confirmed by Annexin-V/PI staining. Western blot analyses revealed that treatment of WEHI-3 cells with TS statistically increased the protein expression level of cytochrome c in the cytoplasm and activates caspase-3. Notably, TS treatment caused a dramatic reduction in Bcl-2 and increase in Bax protein levels. TS may disturb the Bcl-2 and Bax protein ratio and induce apoptosis.

Here we report that PRDM16 is a histone H3K4 methyltransferase on chromatin. Mutation in the N-terminal PR domain of PRDM16 abolishes the intrinsic enzymatic activity of PRDM16. We show that the methyltransferase activity of PRDM16 is required for specific suppression of MLL fusion protein-induced leukemogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies show that PRDM16 directly activates the SNAG family transcription factor Gfi1b, which in turn downregulates the HOXA gene cluster. Knockdown Gfi1b represses PRDM16-mediated tumor suppression, while Gfi1b overexpression mimics PRDM16 overexpression. In further support of the tumor suppressor function of PRDM16, silencing PRDM16 by DNA methylation is concomitant with MLL-AF9-induced leukemic transformation.

It has been well-established that lysine and arginine methylation can be reversed by two groups of evolutionarily conserved enzymes known as histone demethylases, which have been shown to play critical roles in development, differentiation and diseases like cancer. Recent work has demonstrated demethylase-independent functions of these proteins, highlighting the complex mechanisms by which these proteins exert their effects on gene expression. Here, we discuss the roles of lysine 27 demethylases, JMJD3 and UTX, in cancer and potential therapeutic avenues targeting these enzymes. Despite a high degree of sequence similarity in the catalytic domain between JMJD3 and UTX, numerous studies revealed surprisingly contrasting roles in cellular reprogramming and cancer, particularly leukemia. Understanding the demethylase-dependent and demethylase-independent functions of the enzymes affecting histone methylation, their post-translational modifications and participation in different complexes, as well as in vivo modeling of the mutations affecting those enzymes in cancer, can shed light on their unique physiological roles. This information cumulated in the future will aid in the development of improved inhibitors to treat cancers affected by demethylase mutations and aberrant gene activation.","['Arcipowski, Kelly Marie', 'Martinez, Carlos Alberto', 'Ntziachristos, Panagiotis']","['Arcipowski KM', 'Martinez CA', 'Ntziachristos P']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 320 E.

METHODS: A total of 30 patients with hematologic malignancies (8 cases of AML, 17 AML, 2 MDS and 3 Mix-AL) received related haploidentical and unrelated HLA-mismatched allo-HSCT combined with related haploidentical bone marrow infusion. Among them 20 cases received related haploidentical transplantation of the first donor, 10 cases received unrelated HLA-mismatched treaplantation. The new conditioning regimen for the patients underwent allo-HSCT consisted of fludarabine, busulfan, Me-CCNU and cyclophosphamide. The drugs for GVHD prophylaxis included cyclosporine A and methotrexate, while mycophenolate mofetil and rabbit anti-T-lymphocyte globulin (ATG) were used. RESULTS: All the patients achieved full engraftment. The median time for neutrophils to reach over 0.5 x 10(9)/L was 14 days (8-26 days), while the median time for platelets to reach over 20 x 10(9)/L was 11.5days (10-24 days).

The conditioning regimen of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched allo-HSCT group was modified BuCy, but in HLA-mismatched group Fludarabine and anti-human thymocyte globulin (ATG) was added. CsA+MTX regimen was used for prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in HLA-identical allo-HSCT, while additional MMF was added in HLA-mismatched group. The average time of follow-up was 13 months. RESULTS: At the last follow-up, 66.0% (66/100) patients survived, 53.0% (53/100) patients survived without leukemia, 28.0% (28/100) patients relapsed and 34.0% (34/100) patients died, 44.1% patients of them died from infectious pulmonary complications. During transplantation, 65.0% of the patients were suffered from lung infection. The overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of all cases was 60.9% and 48.8%, respectively. The recurrence rate was significantly higher in non-remission (66.7%) than in CR (21.2%) patients (P < 0.05). The cumulative incidence of GVHD in HLA-mismatched transplantation was 60.8%, which was significantly higher than that of HLA-matched transplantation (38.8%) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Allo-HSCT can cure a significant proportion of leukemia patients, especially for those in CR status. Since the incidence of infectious pulmonary complications after allo-HSCT is still high, much more attention should be paid to it. The comprehensive prognosis of HLA-matched transplantation is better than the HLA-mis-matched transplantation.","['Huang, Qing-Xin', 'Tu, San-Fang', 'Huang, Rui', 'Huang, Yu-Xian', 'Deng, Lan', 'Wu, Bing-Yi', 'Song, Chao-Yang', 'Li, Yu-Hua']","['Huang QX', 'Tu SF', 'Huang R', 'Huang YX', 'Deng L', 'Wu BY', 'Song CY', 'Li YH']","['Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510280, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510280, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510280, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510280, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510280, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510280, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510280, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510280, Guangdong Province, China.

METHODS: A total of 45 patients with MDS and transformed acute myeloid leukemia (tAML) who received allo-HSCT between January 2009 and December 2014 were enrolled in this study. The effects of different conditioning regimens, donor and chemotherapy before transplantation on the clinical outcome were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The median follow-up time for these patients was 54.6 months (ranged from 1 to 72.1 months), the 4-year cumulative overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 77.1% and 62.1%, respectively. In myeloblative conditioning group and reduced intensity conditioning group, the 3-year cumulative OS rate was 69% and 68.6% (HR = 1.0, P = 0.984), respectively, the 3-year cumulative relapse rate was 17.6% and 33.3% (HR = 3.389, P = 0.162). The 100-day cumulative rate of aGVHD (38.6%) in HLA-identical nonsibling group was similar to HLA identical sibling group (37%) (HR = 1.089, P = 0.885); meanwhile the similar 3-year commulative OS rate was achieved in the 2 groups (72.7% and 70%) (HR = 0.952, P = 0.942). Among 26 patients with RAEB-2 and t-AML, the 2-year cumulative OS were 66.7% and 58.3% (HR = 1.265, P = 0.750) and 2-year cumulative relapse rates were 20.0% and 12.5% (HR = 0.417, P = 0.477) in non-chemotherapy and CR post-chemotherapy subgroups. The 1-year cumulative OS rate was 53.5% and 84.8% in the group with or without aGVHD. The patients with aGVHD had higher transplantation related mortality (TRM) compared with patients without aGVHD (HR = 15.0, P =0.011). CONCLUSION: The reduced intensity conditioning doesn't reduce OS rate in patients with MDS, and elderly patients can benefit from it. The OS rate is similar between HLA-identical sibling and HLA-identical nonsibling allo-HSCT.

METHODS: A total of 62 ALL or T-NHL patients were diagnosed and treated in our department and were enrolled in this study. Among them, 22 patients received the combined chemotherapy with PEG-Asp, while the other 40 patients received the standard chemotherapy with L-asparaginase (L-Asp) as the control. Therapeutic effectiveness, adverse effects, duration and expense of hospitalization, treatment-related mortality and survival were evaluated and compared in 2 different groups. RESULTS: In group of combined chemotherapy with PEG-Asp, the overall response rate was 90.91% (20 cases), among them CR rate and PR rate are 77.27% (17 cases) and 13.64% (3 cases), respectively. In the group of standard chemotherapy with L-Asp, the overall response rate was 87.5% (35 cases), among them CR rate and PR rate were 72.5% (29 cases) and 15% (6 cases), respectively. The difference neither between PEG-Asp and L-Asp chemotherapy groups nor between ALL and T-NHL subgroups was significant (P > 0.05). The 6-month and 12-month overall survival rates were not significantly different between the PEG-Asp and L-Asp chemotherapy groups, respectively (P > 0.05). The adverse effects were identified as degree 1-2 according to the WHO criteria of drug toxicity. Neither the adverse effects identified as degree 3-4 nor the treatment-related death were observed. Expect for allergy and hyperglycaemia, the difference of side-effect incidence between the two groups were not significant (P > 0.05). The treatment for all the patients in PEG-Asp chemotherapy group was completed, while the treatment with L-Asp was completed only in 29 cases. Moreover, both average duration and expense of hospitalization after the combined chemotherapy were less than the control. CONCLUSION: With higher response rate, lower drug toxicity and allergy incidence, the combined chemotherapy with PEG-Asp can replace the standard chemotherapy with L-Asp in the treatment of ALL and T-NHL. The optimization of the combined chemotheropeutic protocols for more cases and long-term survival rates need to further and deeply explorate.","['Xu, Yan', 'Wang, Jin', 'Yang, Nan', 'Bai, Ju', 'Zhang, Peng-Yu', 'Gu, Liu-Fang', 'Lei, Bo', 'Liu, Jie', 'Wang, Fang-Xia', 'Huang, Bing-Qiao', 'Zhang, Wang-Gang', 'He, Ai-Li', 'Cao, Xing-Mei', 'Chen, Yin-Xia', 'Ma, Xiao-Rong']","['Xu Y', 'Wang J', 'Yang N', 'Bai J', 'Zhang PY', 'Gu LF', 'Lei B', 'Liu J', 'Wang FX', 'Huang BQ', 'Zhang WG', 'He AL', 'Cao XM', 'Chen YX', 'Ma XR']","[""Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710004, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710004, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710004, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710004, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710004, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710004, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710004, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710004, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710004, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710004, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710004, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710004, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710004, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710004, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710004, Shaanxi Province, China.

METHODS: The genomic DNA of 23 AML patients with positive FLT3-ITD was amplified by PCR, capillary electrophoresis was used to detect the ITD mutation. Then, the FLT3 gene was amplified using primer with different barcode, and the product was analyzed by illumina Miseq, and the results were compared with UCSC database. RESULTS: Out of 23 AML patients, 17 had a single ITD, and 3 had 2 ITDs, and the remaining 3 had 3 ITD detected by capillary electrophoresis. The high-throughput sequencing showed that 17 ITD were the complate duplications of wild-type FLT3, and the remaining 16 ITD were partial duplications in the all 33 ITDs. The same length ITD mutation contained 2 different ITD sequences in one patient with more than one ITD, and the other patient with 2 ITD had the same ITD insertion position. The ITD occurred in the regions from p. Y572 to p. L602 of the FLT3 protein, and all the patient ITD covered one or more amino acid between p. V592 and p. E598. CONCLUSION: Illumina Miseq can analyze the sequence of ITDs precisely and accurately.

METHODS: The clinical data of 68 ALL patients confirmed in our hospital were analyzed retrospectively; The bone marrow samples were detected by DCDF-FISH, flow cytometry, conventional cytogenetics (CCG), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the correlation of these results was compared. And the reaction of patients to treatment was dynamically observed by DCDF-FISH. RESULTS: Sixteen signal patterns were found in DCDF-FISH, including 14 kinds of atypical signal patterns (signal patterns of 1R2G, 2R3G, 2R4G and 3R3G as abnormal signal patterns without BCR/ABL fusion gene. Signal patterns of 1R1G1F, 1R1G3F, 1R1G4F, 1R2G1F, 1R2G2F, 1R2G3F, 1RnG2F (n >/= 3), 2R2G1F, 1G4F, 1R4F corresponded to t (9;22) karyotype). Ph(+) ALL patients accounted for 17. All cases with Ph chromosome or BCR/ABL positive were B-ALL or My(+)-B-ALL. The Ph chromosome was detected in 12 cases (positive rate was 18%) by CCG. The positive rate was 25% (17/68) by DCDF-FISH and RT-PCR. The DCDF-FISH fluorescence pattern change before and after chemotherapy of the patients showed that the quantity and form of the signal pattern was changed after chemotherapy, and the common characteristics was the Ph chromosome in patients. CONCLUSION: The DCDF-FISH is a sensitive and reliable method for the detection of BCR/ABL rearrangement. Analyzing the dynamical change of DCDF-FISH signal patterns has been comfirmed to have a important guiding significance in the diagnosis, and anlysis of response to therapy, drug resistance and the prognosis of ALL patients.","['Jiang, Mei', 'Zhang, Zhang-Lin', 'Xin, Yan-Hong', 'Liu, Shu-Yuan', 'Li, Xin', 'Wan, La-Gen']","['Jiang M', 'Zhang ZL', 'Xin YH', 'Liu SY', 'Li X', 'Wan LG']","['Department of Laboratorial Examination, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Department of Laboratorial Examination, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China.

METHODS: The clinical data of 65 patients were analysed retrospectively, these patients were diagnosed as Ph(+) ALL and treated with conventional chemotherapy plus TKI treatment with or without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from January 2005 to December 2014 in our hospital, then the differences of clinical features and prognosis were compared between the p190 (n = 41) and the p210 group (n = 24). RESULTS: The p190 group had lower platelet count than the p210 group (46.3 x 10(9)/L vs 65 x 10(9)/L) (P = 0.084); the leukemic blast cells in bone marrow at diagnosis was slightly higher in p190 group than that in p210 group (88.4% vs 76.8%) (P = 0.096); the other clinical features, such as sex, age, white blood cells, hemoglobin, leukemic blast cells in peripheral blood, and BCR-ABL/ABL expression level were not significantly different between these two groups. As to the response to treatment, the complete remission rate (CR) after induction therapy was 80% (32/40) and 87% (20/23) respectively in the p190 and p210 group, no significant difference was seen (P = 0.732). The time from induction to the first complete remission (CR1) was not significantly different either (28 days vs 29 days) (P = 0.922). The recurrence rate was 61% (20/33) in the p190 group and 43% (9/21) in the p210 group, but the difference was not significantly different (P = 0.202). However, the duration of remission in p190 group was shorter than that in p210 group, whether from the time of initial diagnosis to relapse (212 days vs 274 days) (P = 0.077) or from the time of CR1 to relapse (146 days vs 242 days) (P = 0.084). For the prognosis, the p190 group presented with a shorter 5 year-survival rate (P = 0.016) as well as event-free survival rate (P = 0.085). CONCLUSION: The p190 group tends to have lower peripheral blood platelet count and higher percentage of leukemic blasts in bone marrow at diagnosis; while the CR rate and the time from induction to CR1 are not significantly different; however, the p190 group is more likely to relapse at a relatively early stage, and the 5 year-survival rate and event-free survival rate are lower in p190 group than that in p210 group, indicating that the patients carrying p190 transcript are probably necessary to receive more intensive therapy such as HSCT as early as possible after achieving CR1, which can promisingly improve the overall prognosis of the Ph(+) ALL patients.","['Qiu, Lan-Lan', 'Lu, Ye-Jian', 'Jing, Yu', 'Yu, Li', 'Liu, Dai-Hong', 'Wang, Li-Li']","['Qiu LL', 'Lu YJ', 'Jing Y', 'Yu L', 'Liu DH', 'Wang LL']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hosipital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hosipital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hosipital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hosipital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hosipital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hosipital, Beijing 100853, China.

METHODS: The HL-60 cells of human AML was transfected by small molecular analog miR-181a, the cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8 method after electroporation in HL-60 cell lines. Target genes of miR-181a were predicted and analyzed by the bioinformatics software and database. Target genes were confirmed by HL-60 cell line and the patient leukemia cells. RESULTS: Overexpressed miR-181a in HL-60 cell line significantly enhanced cell proliferation compared with that in control (P < 0.05). Dual luciferase reporter gene assay showed that miR-181a significantly suppressed the reporter gene activity containing ATM 3'-UTR by about 56.8% (P < 0.05), but it didn't suppress the reporter gene activity containing 3'-UTR ATM mutation. Western blot showed that miR-181a significantly downregulated the expression of ATM in human leukemia cells. It is also found that miR-181a was significantly increased in AML, which showed a negative correlation with ATM expression. CONCLUSION: miR-181a promotes cell proliferation in AML by regulating the tumor suppressor ATM, thus it plays the role as oncogene in pathogenesis of AML.","['Hua, Jia-Ye', 'Feng, Ying', 'Pang, Ying', 'Zhou, Xu-Hong', 'Xu, Bing', 'Yan, Mu-Xia']","['Hua JY', 'Feng Y', 'Pang Y', 'Zhou XH', 'Xu B', 'Yan MX']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510260, Guangdong Province, China.

METHODS: Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of Pim-3 in bone marrow of 47 newly diagnosed and untreated patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 18 patients with AML after treatment with chemotherapy. At the same time, the bone marrow of 10 cases of non-hematologic malignancies was used as normal control. The difference of the Pim-3 gene expression in bone marrows among the 3 groups was also compared. RESULTS: According to the RT-PCR detection results, the Pim-3 expression level in bone marrow of AML patients before chemotherapy were all significantly lower than those in patients with non-hematologic malignancies (P < 0.01). After chemotherapy, there were no significant differences of the Pim-3 expression level between the patients with acute myeloid leukemia and non-hematologic malignancies (P > 0.05), but the Pim-3 expression level was significantly lower in patients before chemotherapy as compared with that in patients post chemotherapy (P < 0.01). The comparison of Pim-3 expression before and after chemotherapy in remission group showed that Pim-3 expression levels before chemotherapy were all significantly lower than those after chemotherapy (P < 0.01), but there were no significant differences of Pim-3 expression levels between patients before and after chemotherapy in non-remission group (P > 0.05). The Pim-3 expression levels of non-remission patients after chemotherapy were all significantly lower than those of the remission patients after chemotherapy (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Pim-3 gene is abnormally expressed in the AML patients before and after chemotherapy, and this gene may be involved in the genesis and development of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Zhou, Zhen-Cang', 'Tian, Zu-Guo', 'Yuan, Zhong']","['Zhou ZC', 'Tian ZG', 'Yuan Z']","[""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Zunyi, Zunyi 563003, Guizhou Province, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College, Zunyi 563003, Guizhou Province, China.

The Morita-Baylis-Hillman adducts (MBHA) are a new class of bioactive compounds and highlight its potentialities to the discovery of new cheaper and efficient drugs, e.g. as anti-Leishmania chagasi and Leishmania amazonensis, anti- Trypanosoma cruzi, anti-Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium berghei, lethal against Biomphalaria glabrata, antibacterial, antifungal, herbicide and others. METHODS: The goal of this work is to describe the primary cytotoxic activities against strains of human leukemia HL-60 cell line for thirty-four Morita-Baylis- Hillman adducts (MBHA), followed by a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships study (QSAR). RESULTS: The conventional or microwave-assisted syntheses of MBHA, derived from substituted aromatics or Isatin, were performed in good to excellent yields (70-100%) in short reaction times, using protocols recently developed by us. Isatin derivatives, MBHA 31 and 32, were the most active in this congener series of compounds, with IC50 values of 10.8 muM and 7.8 muM, respectively. The primary cytotoxic activities against chronic leukemia cells (K562) were also evaluated to these two most active compounds (MBHA 31 and 32), presenting IC50 values of 53 muM and 43 muM respectively. QSAR study was performed considering 3D, 2D and constitutional molecular descriptors. These were selected from Ordered Predictor Selection algorithm and submitted to Partial Least Squares Modeling. CONCLUSION: We present an interesting investigation about cytotoxic activities on human leukemia cell line (HL-60) for 34 synthetic MBHA. In a good way we discovered that the most cytotoxic compounds (31-32, 10.8 muM and 7.8 muM respectively) were also prepared quantitatively (100% yields) in a short reaction time using microwave irradiation. We demonstrate that 31 and 32 induced apoptosis and not necrosis in HL-60 cells, observed by externalization of PS and increase Anexin-V positive cells. Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships considering 3D, 2D and constitutional descriptors provided a robust and predictive PLS model, in accordance with SAR observations.","['Lima-, Claudio G', 'Faheina-Martins, Glaucia V', 'Bomfim, Caio C B', 'Dantas, Bruna B', 'Silva, Everton P', 'Araujo, Demetrius A M de', 'Filho, Edilson B A', 'Vasconcellos, Mario L A A']","['Lima- CG', 'Faheina-Martins GV', 'Bomfim CC', 'Dantas BB', 'Silva EP', 'Araujo DA', 'Filho EB', 'Vasconcellos ML']","['Laboratorio de Sintese Organica Medicinal da Paraiba (LASOM-PB), Departamento de Quimica, Universidade Federal da Paraiba, Campus I, Joao Pessoa, PB 58059-900, Brazil. mlaav@quimica.ufpb.br.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Med Chem,Medicinal chemistry (Shariqah (United Arab Emirates)),101240303,IM,"['Acrylates/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Acrylonitrile/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', '*Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship']",2016/05/07 06:00,2017/07/05 06:00,['2016/05/07 06:00'],"['2015/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/05 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/07 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Chem. 2016;12(7):602-612. doi: 10.2174/1573406412666160506150924.,,,"['0 (Acrylates)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'MP1U0D42PE (Acrylonitrile)']",,,,,"['MC-EPUB-75502 [pii]', '10.2174/1573406412666160506150924 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, the expression of PPARG was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) and HEK293 cells transfected with the mimics or inhibitors of miR128 or control RNA. Luciferase reporter assays were used to identify whether PPARG is a direct target of miR128. In vivo, miR128 was knocked down via ear vein injection of antagomir128 in a rabbit myocardial I/R injury model. Western blotting investigated the activation of Akt [phosphorylated (p)Akt] and the expression of totalAkt, PPARG and myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein1 (Mcl1) in the myocardium. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was examined with transmission electron microscropy and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining. PPARG mRNA and protein were downregulated in NRVMs transfected with miR128 mimics, but upregulated by antagomir128 compared with control. This indicates that PPARG is a direct miR128 target. Activation of Akt (pAkt), Mcl1 and PPARG expression in the myocardium were increased by miR128 inhibition. Furthermore, miR128 antagomirs significantly reduced apoptosis in hearts subjected to I/R injury, which was blocked by the PPARG inhibitor GW9662. In conclusion, miR128 inhibition attenuated I/R injuryinduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis by the targeted activation of PPARG signaling.","['Zeng, Xiao Cong', 'Li, Lang', 'Wen, Hong', 'Bi, Qi']","['Zeng XC', 'Li L', 'Wen H', 'Bi Q']","['Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi 530021, P.R.

However, essential ingredients in TCM herbs have not been fully identified, and their precise mechanisms and targets are not elucidated. In this study, a new strategy combining comprehensive two-dimensional K562/cell membrane chromatographic system and in silico target identification was established to characterize active components from Indigo naturalis, a famous TCM herb that has been widely used for the treatment of leukemia in China, and their targets. Three active components, indirubin, tryptanthrin and isorhamnetin, were successfully characterized and their anti-leukemia effects were validated by cell viability and cell apoptosis assays. Isorhamnetin, with undefined cancer related targets, was selected for in silico target identification. Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase (Src) was identified as its membrane target and the dissociation constant (Kd) between Src and isorhamnetin was 3.81 muM. Furthermore, anti-leukemia effects of isorhamnetin were mediated by Src through inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest. The results demonstrated that the integrated strategy could efficiently characterize active components in TCM and their targets, which may bring a new light for a better understanding of the complex mechanism of herbal medicines.","['Wu, Xunxun', 'Chen, Xiaofei', 'Dan, Jia', 'Cao, Yan', 'Gao, Shouhong', 'Guo, Zhiying', 'Zerbe, Philipp', 'Chai, Yifeng', 'Diao, Yong', 'Zhang, Lei']","['Wu X', 'Chen X', 'Dan J', 'Cao Y', 'Gao S', 'Guo Z', 'Zerbe P', 'Chai Y', 'Diao Y', 'Zhang L']","['School of Biomedical Science, Institute of Molecular Medicine, Huaqiao University, Quanzhou 362021, PR China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, PR China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, PR China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, PR China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, PR China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, PR China.', 'School of Biomedical Science, Institute of Molecular Medicine, Huaqiao University, Quanzhou 362021, PR China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, PR China.', 'Department of Plant Biology, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.', 'School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, PR China.', 'School of Biomedical Science, Institute of Molecular Medicine, Huaqiao University, Quanzhou 362021, PR China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Membrane/*chemistry/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'China', 'Chromatography', 'Computational Biology', 'Humans', 'Indigofera/*chemistry', 'K562 Cells/chemistry/drug effects', 'Plant Structures/chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas']",2016/05/07 06:00,2018/02/10 06:00,['2016/05/07 06:00'],"['2015/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/10 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 May 6;6:25491. doi: 10.1038/srep25491.,10.1038/srep25491 [doi],20160506,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']",PMC4858665,,,,"['srep25491 [pii]', '10.1038/srep25491 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,['Sci Rep. 2016 Aug 26;6:30103.

Therefore, we established the AGORA data- and biobank in the Netherlands. In this study, we describe its rationale, design, and ongoing data collection. METHODS: Children diagnosed with and/or treated for a structural birth defect or childhood cancer and their parents are invited to participate in the AGORA data- and biobank. Controls are recruited through random sampling from municipal registries. The parents receive questionnaires about demographics, family and pregnancy history, health status, prescribed medication, lifestyle, and occupational exposures before and during the index pregnancy. In addition, blood or saliva is collected from children and parents, while medical records are reviewed for diagnostic information. RESULTS: So far, we have collected data from over 6,860 families (3,747 birth defects, 905 childhood cancers, and 2,208 controls). The types of birth defects vary widely and comprise malformations of the digestive, respiratory, and urogenital tracts as well as facial, cardiovascular, kidney, skeletal, and central nervous system anomalies. The most frequently occurring childhood cancer types are acute lymphatic leukemia, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Wilms' tumor, and brain and spinal cord tumors. Our genetic and/or epidemiologic studies have been focused on hypospadias, anorectal malformations, congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), and orofacial clefts. CONCLUSION: The large AGORA data- and biobank offers great opportunities for investigating genetic and nongenetic risk factors for disorders in children and is open to collaborative initiatives.

GLO I has been reported to be overexpressed in various types of cancer cells, and has been expected as an attractive target for the development of new anticancer drugs. We previously discovered a novel inhibitor of hGLO I, named TLSC702, by our in silico screening method. Here, we show that TLSC702 inhibits the proliferation of human leukemia HL-60 cells and induces apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, TLSC702 more significantly inhibits the proliferation of human lung cancer NCI-H522 cells, which highly express GLO I, than that of GLO I lower-expressing human lung cancer NCI-H460 cells. Furthermore, this antiproliferative effect of TLSC702 on NCI-H522 cells is in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These results suggest that TLSC702 can induce apoptosis in tumor cells by GLO I inhibition, which lead to accumulation of MG. Taken together, TLSC702 could become a unique seed compound for the generation of novel chemotherapeutic drugs targeting GLO I-dependent human tumors.","['Takasawa, Ryoko', 'Shimada, Nami', 'Uchiro, Hiromi', 'Takahashi, Satoshi', 'Yoshimori, Atsushi', 'Tanuma, Sei-Ichi']","['Takasawa R', 'Shimada N', 'Uchiro H', 'Takahashi S', 'Yoshimori A', 'Tanuma S']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Humans', 'Lactoylglutathione Lyase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology']",2016/05/07 06:00,2017/01/28 06:00,['2016/05/07 06:00'],"['2016/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2016;39(5):869-73. doi: 10.1248/bpb.b15-00710.,10.1248/bpb.b15-00710 [doi],,"['0 (3-(1,3-benzothiazol-2-yl)-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)but-3-enoic acid)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 4.4.1.5 (Lactoylglutathione Lyase)']",,,,,['10.1248/bpb.b15-00710 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CML is a clonal disease, originated at the level of Hematopoietic Stem Cells with the Philadelphia chromosome resulting from a reciprocal translocation between the chromosomes 9 and 22t(9;22)-(q34;q11). This translocation produces a fusion gene known as BCR-ABL which acquires uncontrolled tyrosine kinase activity, constantly turning on its downstream signaling molecules/pathways, and promoting proliferation of leukemia cell through anti-apoptosis and acquisition of additional mutations. To evaluate the role of each critical downstream signaling molecule of BCR-ABL and test therapeutic drugs in vivo, it is important to use physiological mouse disease models. Here, we describe a mouse model of CML induced by BCR-ABL retrovirus (MSCV-BCR-ABL-GFP; MIG-BCR-ABL) and how to use this model in translational research.Moreover, to expand the application of this retrovirus induced CML model in a lot of conditional knockout mouse strain, we modified this vector to a triple gene coexpression vector in which we can co-express BCR-ABL, GFP, and a third gene which will be tested in different systems. To apply this triple gene system in conditional gene knockout strains, we can validate the CML development in the knockout mice and trace the leukemia cell following the GFP marker. In this protocol, we also describe how we utilize this triple gene system to prove the function of Pten as a tumor suppressor in leukemogenesis. Overall, this triple gene system expands our research spectrum in current conditional gene knockout strains and benefits our CML translational research.","['Peng, Cong', 'Li, Shaoguang']","['Peng C', 'Li S']","['School of Dental Medicine, Tufts University, 1 Kneeland Street, Boston, 02111, MA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, 364 Plantation Street, Worcester, MA, 01605, USA. shaoguang.li@umassmed.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Translational Research, Biomedical/*methods']",2016/05/07 06:00,2017/12/19 06:00,['2016/05/07 06:00'],"['2016/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2016;1438:225-43. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-3661-8_13.,10.1007/978-1-4939-3661-8_13 [doi],,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)', '*Hematopoietic stem cell', '*Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+ chromosome)', '*Retroviral mouse model', '*Translational research']",,['10.1007/978-1-4939-3661-8_13 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These included two adult regimens (ECOG2993 and hyper-CVAD) and a childhood regimen (BFM-90). These intensive drug regimens are mainly used to treat childhood and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. They included induction, consolidation, and maintenance chemotherapy protocols and were administered over the course of 2 years. Seventy-five patients (80%) achieved a complete remission (CR). Within a median follow-up time of 31 months (range: 5-152 months), the 5-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 47.7% (95% CI, 35.0-69.8%) and 45.7% (95% CI, 27.6-56.6%), respectively. Shorter survival was associated with age > 40 years, poor ECOG PS and bone marrow involvement.

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a well-conserved serine/threonine phosphatase, plays a critical role as a tumor suppressor. Perphenazine (PPZ) is one of the phenothiazines and widely used as an antipsychotic drug. Recently, it is reported that PPZ directly binds with scaffolding subunit of PP2A complex and exerts anti-tumor effects on human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, the effect of PPZ on canine lymphoma has not been studied. Here, we investigated the potential therapeutic role of PPZ and its molecular mechanism in canine T-cell lymphoma. In canine T-cell lymphoma cell lines, UL-1 and Ema, PPZ decreased cell survival in a dose-dependent manner. Increased caspase 3 activity and Annexin V positive cells suggested that PPZ induced apoptosis. PPZ dephosphorylated Akt, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. Akt inhibitor, but not MEK1/2 inhibitor and ERK1/2 inhibitor, induced cell death, indicating the importance of Akt dephosphorylation for the anti-tumor effect of PPZ. Finally, we observed enhanced PP2A activity by PPZ treatment. The present results for the first time revealed that PPZ induced canine lymphoma cells apoptosis through Akt dephosphorylation via PP2A activation. Our study suggests the possible therapeutic application of phenothiazines for canine T-cell lymphoma.","['Tsuji, Shunya', 'Yabe, Ryotaro', 'Usui, Tatsuya', 'Mizuno, Takuya', 'Ohama, Takashi', 'Sato, Koichi']","['Tsuji S', 'Yabe R', 'Usui T', 'Mizuno T', 'Ohama T', 'Sato K']","['Laboratory of Veterinary Pharmacology, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, 1677-1 Yoshida, Yamaguchi 753-8515, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Vet Med Sci,The Journal of veterinary medical science,9105360,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dog Diseases/*drug therapy', 'Dogs', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry/veterinary', 'Immunoblotting/veterinary', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*veterinary', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/drug therapy/veterinary', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/drug effects/metabolism', 'Perphenazine/*therapeutic use', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/drug effects']",2016/05/07 06:00,2017/06/16 06:00,['2016/05/07 06:00'],"['2016/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,J Vet Med Sci. 2016 Sep 1;78(8):1293-8. doi: 10.1292/jvms.15-0707.

We have evaluated the capacity of MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) to mitigate radiation injury to marrow stem cells at 4 h to 7 days after irradiation. Significant restoration of marrow stem cell engraftment at 4, 24 and 168 h post irradiation by exposure to MSC-EVs was observed at 3 weeks to 9 months after transplant and further confirmed by secondary engraftment. Intravenous injection of MSC-EVs to 500cGy exposed mice led to partial recovery of peripheral blood counts and restoration of the engraftment of marrow. The murine hematopoietic cell line, FDC-P1 exposed to 500cGy, showed reversal of growth inhibition, DNA damage and apoptosis on exposure to murine or human MSC-EVs. Both murine and human MSC-EVs reverse radiation damage to murine marrow cells and stimulate normal murine marrow stem cell/progenitors to proliferate.

A mathematical model of the insulin signaling network (ISN) is proposed and used to investigate the dose-response curves of components of this network. Experimental data of C2C12 myoblasts with phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) suppressed and data of L6 myotubes with induced insulin resistance have been analyzed by the model. We focused particularly on single and double Akt phosphorylation and pointed out insulin signaling changes related to insulin resistance. Moreover, a new characterization of the upstream signaling of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) is presented. As it is widely recognized that ISN proteins have a crucial role also in cell proliferation and death, the ISN model was linked to a cell population model and applied to data of a cell line of acute myeloid leukemia treated with a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor with antitumor activity. The analysis revealed simple relationships among the concentrations of ISN proteins and the parameters of the cell population model that characterize cell cycle progression and cell death.","['Bertuzzi, Alessandro', 'Conte, Federica', 'Mingrone, Geltrude', 'Papa, Federico', 'Salinari, Serenella', 'Sinisgalli, Carmela']","['Bertuzzi A', 'Conte F', 'Mingrone G', 'Papa F', 'Salinari S', 'Sinisgalli C']","['Institute of Systems Analysis and Computer Science ""A.

Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) locating at PIP4K2A locus were identified to be associated with ALL susceptibility through genome-wide association studies, however, followed by inconsistent reports in replication studies. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association status of the top independent SNPs (rs7088318 and rs4748793) with ALL susceptibility by combining the data from 6 independent studies, totally including 3508 cases and 12,446 controls with multiethnic populations. Consistent association with ALL risk of both SNPs were observed (odds ratio [OR] 1.28 and 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-1.36 and 1.19-1.40, respectively). Considering clinic characteristics, rs7088318 is more related to patients with African ancestry (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.21-1.80) and hyperdiploid subtype (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.25-1.61). Moreover, several SNPs (eg, rs45469096) were identified to be in high linage disequilibrium with rs7088318, and affected PIP4K2A expression in lymphocytes probably by altering the binding affinity of some transcriptional factors. In conclusion, we systematically investigated the relationship between SNPs at PIP4K2A locus and ALL susceptibility, and further found potential causal variant candidates, thus better elucidating the role of PIP4K2A gene in leukemogenesis.","['Liao, Fei', 'Yin, Dandan', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Hou, Qianqian', 'Zheng, Zhaoyue', 'Yang, Li', 'Shu, Yang', 'Xu, Heng', 'Li, Yu']","['Liao F', 'Yin D', 'Zhang Y', 'Hou Q', 'Zheng Z', 'Yang L', 'Shu Y', 'Xu H', 'Li Y']","[""From the Department of Laboratory Medicine (FL, DY, QH, ZZ, LY, YS, HX), National Key Laboratory of Biotherapy/Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; Department of Thoracic Oncology and Cancer Center (YZ), West China Hospital, West China Medical School, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; and Department of Oncology (YL), The First People's Hospital of Lianyungang, Lianyungang, Jiangsu, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,IM,"['Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Linkage Disequilibrium/genetics', 'Male', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",2016/05/07 06:00,2017/02/06 06:00,['2016/05/06 06:00'],"['2016/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2016 May;95(18):e3542. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000003542.,10.1097/MD.0000000000003542 [doi],,"['EC 2.7.1.- (PIP4K2A protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))']",PMC4863780,,,,"['10.1097/MD.0000000000003542 [doi]', '00005792-201605030-00028 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As dominant missense alterations in DNMT3A mutations, R882 mutations cause the focal hypomethylation phenotype. However, there remains debate on the influence of R882 mutations on AML prognosis. Thus, this meta-analysis aimed at further illustrating the prognostic power of DNMT3A R882 mutations in AML patients.Eligible studies were identified from 5 databases containing PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Clinical Trials, and the Cochrane Library (up to October 25, 2015). Effects (hazard ratios [HRs] with 95% confidence interval [CI]) of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were pooled to estimate the prognostic power of mutant DNMT3A R882 in overall patients and subgroups of AML patients.Eight competent studies with 4474 AML patients including 694 with DNMT3A R882 mutations were included. AML patients with DNMT3A R882 mutations showed significant shorter RFS (HR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.24-1.59, P < 0.001) and OS (HR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.17-1.86, P = 0.001) in the overall population.

However, treatment outcomes remain suboptimal with relapses frequently observed. Among the mechanisms of treatment failure is multidrug resistance (MDR) mediated by the ABCB1, ABCC1, and ABCG2 drug-efflux transporters. Although genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity between leukemic blast cells is a well-recognized phenomenon, there remains minimal data on differences in MDR activity at the individual cell level. Specifically, functional assays that can distinguish the variability in MDR activity between individual leukemic blasts are lacking. Here, we outline a new dielectrophoretic (DEP) chip-based assay. This assay permits measurement of drug accumulation in single cells, termed same-single-cell analysis in the accumulation mode (SASCA-A). Initially, the assay was optimized in pretherapy samples from 20 adults with AML whose leukemic blasts had MDR activity against the anthracyline daunorubicin (DNR) tested using multiple MDR inhibitors. Parameters tested were initial drug accumulation, time to achieve signal saturation, fold-increase of DNR accumulation with MDR inhibition, ease of cell trapping, and ease of maintaining the trapped cells stationary. This enabled categorization into leukemic blast cells with MDR activity (MDR(+)) and leukemic blast cells without MDR activity (MDR(-ve)). Leukemic blasts could also be distinguished from benign white blood cells (notably these also lacked MDR activity). MDR(-ve) blasts were observed to be enriched in samples taken from patients who went on to enter complete remission (CR), whereas MDR(+) blasts were frequently observed in patients who failed to achieve CR following front-line chemotherapy. However, pronounced variability in functional MDR activity between leukemic blasts was observed, with MDR(+) cells not infrequently seen in some patients that went on to achieve CR. Next, we tested MDR activity in two paired AML patient samples. Pretherapy samples taken from patients that achieved CR to front-line chemotherapy were compared with samples taken at time of subsequent relapse. MDR(+) cells were frequently observed in leukemic blast cells in both pretherapy and relapsed samples, consistent with MDR as a mechanism of relapse in these patients. We demonstrate the ability of a new DEP microfluidic chip-based assay to identify heterogeneity in MDR activity in leukemic blasts. The test provides a platform for future studies to characterize the mechanistic basis for heterogeneity in MDR activity at the individual cell level.","['Khamenehfar, Avid', 'Gandhi, Maher K', 'Chen, Yuchun', 'Hogge, Donna E', 'Li, Paul C H']","['Khamenehfar A', 'Gandhi MK', 'Chen Y', 'Hogge DE', 'Li PC']","['The University of Queensland , Diamantina Institute, 37 Kent Street, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency , 675 West 10th Avenue, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophoresis/instrumentation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', '*Microfluidic Analytical Techniques/instrumentation', '*Single-Cell Analysis', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2016/05/06 06:00,2018/08/25 06:00,['2016/05/06 06:00'],"['2016/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/25 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Anal Chem. 2016 Jun 7;88(11):5680-8. doi: 10.1021/acs.analchem.5b04446.

Despite the differences, these disorders share treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib. Despite the success of imatinib, the response rates vary among different individuals and pharmacogenetics may play an important role in the final clinical outcome. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors provide an overview of the pharmacogenetic literature analyzing the role of polymorphisms in both GIST and CML treatment efficacy and toxicity. EXPERT OPINION: So far, several polymorphisms influencing the pharmacokinetic determinants of imatinib have been identified. However, the data are not yet conclusive enough to translate pharmacogenetic tests in clinical practice. In this context, the major obstacles to pharmacogenetic test validation are represented by the small sample size of most studies, ethnicity and population admixture as confounding source, and uncertainty related to genetic variants analyzed. In conclusion, a combination of different theoretical approaches, experimental model systems and statistical methods is clearly needed, in order to appreciate pharmacogenetics applied to clinical practice in the near future.","['Ravegnini, Gloria', 'Sammarini, Giulia', 'Angelini, Sabrina', 'Hrelia, Patrizia']","['Ravegnini G', 'Sammarini G', 'Angelini S', 'Hrelia P']","['a Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology , University of Bologna , Bologna , Italy.', 'a Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology , University of Bologna , Bologna , Italy.', 'a Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology , University of Bologna , Bologna , Italy.', 'a Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology , University of Bologna , Bologna , Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol,Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,101228422,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2016/05/06 06:00,2017/02/12 06:00,['2016/05/06 06:00'],"['2016/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/12 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol. 2016 Jul;12(7):733-42. doi: 10.1080/17425255.2016.1184649.

The cellular expression and function of these kinases has implicated them as potential drug targets for the treatment of both malignant and autoimmune diseases. Most attention has focused on inhibitors of BTK kinase with ibrutinib already approved for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Multiple BTK inhibitors are being developed for both oncology and autoimmune disease indications. AREAS COVERED: BTK inhibitors being evaluated in rheumatoid arthritis are considered. Both inhibitors which have progressed to early clinical development, and those demonstrating activity in rodent models of arthritis are reviewed. These include both reversible and irreversible inhibitors of the kinase, most of which target the cysteine-481 residue of BTK. The selectivity of these inhibitors for Tec family kinases is considered. EXPERT OPINION: Developing inhibitors of any kinase to treat of rheumatoid arthritis has proved problematic with regard to both efficacy and selectivity. It is anticipated that the more selective BTK inhibitors may prove more useful in treating arthritis, with the use of reversible inhibitors possibly offering a better strategy. Chronic dosing may exacerbate the emergence of drug resistance, with resistant mutations already observed in ibrutinib-treated patients.","['Norman, Peter']",['Norman P'],"['a Norman Consulting , Burnham Bucks , UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Animals', 'Arthritis, Experimental/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drugs, Investigational/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2016/05/06 06:00,2017/03/11 06:00,['2016/05/06 06:00'],"['2016/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/11 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2016 Aug;25(8):891-9. doi: 10.1080/13543784.2016.1182499.

Bone marrow pathology was consistent with a diagnosis of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AML M7), and biopsy of an anterior mediastinal mass was consistent with a nonseminomatous GCT. Prior studies have described associations between hematological malignancies, including AML M7 and nonseminomatous GCTs, and it was recently suggested that a common founding clone initiated both cancers. We performed enhanced exome sequencing on the GCT and the AML M7 from our patient to define the clonal relationship between the two cancers. We found that both samples contained somatic mutations in PTEN (C136R missense) and TP53 (R213 frameshift). The mutations in PTEN and TP53 were present at approximately 100% variant allele frequency (VAF) in both tumors. In addition, we detected and validated five other shared somatic mutations. The copy-number analysis of the AML exome data revealed an amplification of Chromosome 12p. We also identified a heterozygous germline variant in FANCA (S858R), which is known to be associated with Fanconi anemia but is of uncertain significance here. In summary, our data not only support a common founding clone for these cancers but also suggest that a specific set of distinct genomic alterations (in PTEN and TP53) underlies the rare association between GCT and AML. This association is likely linked to the treatment resistance and extremely poor outcome of these patients. We cannot resolve the clonal evolution of these tumors given limitations of our data.","['Lu, Charles', 'Riedell, Peter', 'Miller, Christopher A', 'Hagemann, Ian S', 'Westervelt, Peter', 'Ozenberger, Bradley A', ""O'Laughlin, Michelle"", 'Magrini, Vincent', 'Demeter, Ryan T', 'Duncavage, Eric J', 'Griffith, Malachi', 'Griffith, Obi L', 'Wartman, Lukas D']","['Lu C', 'Riedell P', 'Miller CA', 'Hagemann IS', 'Westervelt P', 'Ozenberger BA', ""O'Laughlin M"", 'Magrini V', 'Demeter RT', 'Duncavage EJ', 'Griffith M', 'Griffith OL', 'Wartman LD']","['McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA;', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA;', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA;; Division of Genomics and Bioinformatics, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA;', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA;', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA;', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA;', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA;', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA;', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA;', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA;; Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA;', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA;; Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA;']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cold Spring Harb Mol Case Stud,Cold Spring Harbor molecular case studies,101660017,,,2016/05/06 06:00,2016/05/06 06:01,['2016/05/06 06:00'],"['2016/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/06 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Cold Spring Harb Mol Case Stud. 2016 Jan;2(1):a000687. doi: 10.1101/mcs.a000687.,10.1101/mcs.a000687 [doi],,,PMC4849848,['NOTNLM'],"['hematological neoplasm', 'neoplasm of the genitourinary tract']",,"['10.1101/mcs.a000687 [doi]', 'LuMCS000687 [pii]']",,,"['K08 CA166229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K22 CA188163/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe the case of a patient with relapsed/refractory early T-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL) who achieved a complete hematologic response following treatment with the GSI BMS-906024. Whole-exome sequencing of leukemic blasts revealed heterozygous gain-of-function driver mutations in NOTCH1, CSF3R, and PTPN11, and a homozygous/hemizygous loss-of-function mutation in DNMT3A. The three gain-of-function mutations were absent from remission marrow cells, but the DNMT3A mutation persisted in heterozygous form in remission marrow, consistent with an origin for the patient's ETP-ALL from clonal hematopoiesis. Ex vivo culture of ETP-ALL blasts confirmed high levels of activated NOTCH1 that were repressed by GSI treatment, and RNA-seq documented that GSIs downregulated multiple known Notch target genes. Surprisingly, one potential target gene that was unaffected by GSIs was MYC, a key Notch target in GSI-sensitive T-ALL of cortical T-cell type. H3K27ac super-enhancer landscapes near MYC showed a pattern previously reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that is sensitive to BRD4 inhibitors, and in line with this ETP-ALL blasts downregulated MYC in response to the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1. To our knowledge, this is the first example of complete response of a Notch-mutated ETP-ALL to a Notch antagonist and is also the first description of chromatin landscapes associated with ETP-ALL.

This case highlights how next-generation sequencing can augment currently standard testing to establish diagnoses in difficult cases, and in doing so help guide selection of therapy.","['Kluk, Michael J', 'Abo, Ryan P', 'Brown, Ronald D', 'Kuo, Frank C', 'Dal Cin, Paola', 'Pozdnyakova, Olga', 'Morgan, Elizabeth A', 'Lindeman, Neal I', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Aster, Jon C']","['Kluk MJ', 'Abo RP', 'Brown RD', 'Kuo FC', 'Dal Cin P', 'Pozdnyakova O', 'Morgan EA', 'Lindeman NI', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Aster JC']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA;"", 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA;"", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA;"", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA;"", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA;"", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA;"", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA;"", 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA;""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cold Spring Harb Mol Case Stud,Cold Spring Harbor molecular case studies,101660017,,,2016/05/06 06:00,2016/05/06 06:01,['2016/05/06 06:00'],"['2016/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/06 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Cold Spring Harb Mol Case Stud. 2015 Oct;1(1):a000307. doi: 10.1101/mcs.a000307.,10.1101/mcs.a000307 [doi],,,PMC4850893,['NOTNLM'],"['dysplastic granulopoiesis', 'leukemia']",,"['10.1101/mcs.a000307 [doi]', 'KlukMCS000307 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In ""physiologically hypoxic"" stem cell niches, low oxygen tension restrains the clonal expansion of stem cells without blocking their cycling, thereby contributing substantially to favor their self-renewal. The capacity of stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells in particular, to reside in low oxygen is likely due to their specific metabolic profile. A strong drive to the characterization of this profile emerges from the notion that cancer stem cells (CSC), like normal stem cells, most likely rely on metabolic cues for the balance between self-renewal/maintenance and clonal expansion/differentiation. Accordingly, CSC homing to low oxygen stem cell niches is the best candidate mechanism to sustain the so-called minimal residual disease. Thus, the metabolic profile of CSC impacts long-term cancer response to therapy. On that basis, strategies to target CSC are intensely sought as a means to eradicate neoplastic diseases. Our ""metabolic"" approach to this challenge was based on two different experimental models: (A) the Yoshida's ascites hepatoma AH130 cells, a highly homogeneous cancer cell population expressing stem cell features, used to identify, in CSC adapted to oxygen and/or nutrient shortage, metabolic features of potential therapeutic interest; (B) chronic myeloid leukemia, used to evaluate the impact of oxygen and/or nutrient shortage on the expression of an oncogenetic protein, the loss of which determines the refractoriness of CSC to oncogene-targeting therapies.","['Cipolleschi, Maria Grazia', 'Marzi, Ilaria', 'Rovida, Elisabetta', 'Dello Sbarba, Persio']","['Cipolleschi MG', 'Marzi I', 'Rovida E', 'Dello Sbarba P']","['Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", Universita degli Studi di Firenze , Florence , Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", Universita degli Studi di Firenze , Florence , Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", Universita degli Studi di Firenze , Florence , Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", Universita degli Studi di Firenze , Florence , Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,2016/05/06 06:00,2016/05/06 06:01,['2016/05/06 06:00'],"['2016/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/06 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Oncol. 2016 Apr 14;6:95. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2016.00095. eCollection 2016.,10.3389/fonc.2016.00095 [doi],20160414,,PMC4830810,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer stem cells', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'glucose shortage', 'hypoxia', 'metabolism', 'microenvironment']",,['10.3389/fonc.2016.00095 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an expanded phase 1 trial, CC-486 demonstrated clinical and biological activity in patients with International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) lower-risk (low- and intermediate-1-risk) myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with poor prognostic features including anemia and/or thrombocytopenia who may have required red blood cell or platelet transfusions. The overall response rate was 40 %, including hematologic improvement in 28 % of patients and RBC transfusion independence sustained for 56 days in 47 % of patients with baseline transfusion dependence. Based on the results of this study, the randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 QUAZAR Lower-Risk MDS trial (AZA-MDS-003) was initiated. The design and rationale for this trial comparing CC-486 with placebo for the treatment of patients with IPSS lower-risk MDS with poor prognostic features are described. METHODS: Patients must have IPSS lower-risk MDS with red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent anemia and thrombocytopenia. Eligible patients are randomized 1:1 to receive 300 mg of CC-486 or placebo once daily for the first 21 days of 28-day treatment cycles. Disease status assessments occur at the end of cycle 6 and patients may continue to receive treatment unless there is evidence of progressive disease, lack of efficacy, or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint is RBC transfusion independence for >/= 84 days, assessed according to International Working Group 2006 criteria. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, hematologic response including platelet response and erythroid response, RBC transfusion independence for >/= 56 days, duration of RBC transfusion independence, time to RBC transfusion independence, rate of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) progression, time to AML progression, clinically significant bleeding events, safety, health-related quality of life, and healthcare resource utilization. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide data on the efficacy and safety of CC-486 in the treatment of IPSS lower-risk MDS with poor prognosis due to the presence of both RBC transfusion-dependent anemia and thrombocytopenia. Positive results of the AZA-MDS-003 study may expand treatment options for patients with IPSS lower-risk MDS.

Although NK cell numbers generally reconstitute within a month, the acquisition of mature NK cell phenotype and full functional competency can take 6 months or more, and is influenced by graft composition, concurrent pharmacologic immunosuppression, graft-versus-host disease, and other clinical factors. In addition, cytomegalovirus infection and reactivation have a dominant effect on NK cell memory imprinting following allogeneic HSCT just as it does in healthy individuals. Our understanding of NK cell education and licensing has evolved in the years since the ""missing self"" hypothesis for NK-mediated graft-versus-leukemia effect was first put forward. For example, we now know that NK cell ""re-education"" can occur, and that unlicensed NK cells can be more protective than licensed NK cells in certain settings, thus raising new questions about how best to harness graft-versus-leukemia effect. Here, we review current understanding of the functional reconstitution of NK cells and NK cell education following allogeneic HSCT, highlighting a conceptual framework for future research.","['Ullah, Md Ashik', 'Hill, Geoffrey R', 'Tey, Siok-Keen']","['Ullah MA', 'Hill GR', 'Tey SK']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute , Brisbane, QLD , Australia.', ""Bone Marrow Transplant Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; Department of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Brisbane, QLD, Australia."", ""Bone Marrow Transplant Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; Department of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; School of Medicine, University of Queensland, Herston, QLD, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,2016/05/06 06:00,2016/05/06 06:01,['2016/05/06 06:00'],"['2016/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/06 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Front Immunol. 2016 Apr 15;7:144. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2016.00144. eCollection 2016.,10.3389/fimmu.2016.00144 [doi],20160415,,PMC4831973,['NOTNLM'],"['NK cell', 'NK cell education', 'allogeneic HSCT', 'cytomegalovirus', 'memory NK cell']",,['10.3389/fimmu.2016.00144 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Glycoproteins from diverse viral families can be incorporated into nonnative viral particles in a process termed pseudotyping; however, the molecular mechanisms governing acquisition of these glycoproteins are poorly understood. For murine leukemia virus envelope (MLV Env) glycoprotein, incorporation into foreign viral particles has been shown to be an active process, but it does not appear to be caused by direct interactions among viral proteins. In this study, we coupled in vivo selection systems with Illumina next-generation sequencing (NGS) to test hundreds of thousands of MLV Env mutants for the ability to be enriched in viral particles and to perform other glycoprotein functions. NGS analyses on a subset of these mutants predicted that the residues important for incorporation are in the membrane-proximal external region (MPER), particularly W127 and W137, and the residues in the membrane-spanning domain (MSD) and also immediately flanking it (T140 to L163). These predictions were validated by directly measuring the impact of mutations in these regions on fusogenicity, infectivity, and incorporation. We suggest that these two regions dictate pseudotyping through interactions with specific lipid environments formed during viral assembly. IMPORTANCE: Researchers from numerous fields routinely exploit the ability to manipulate viral tropism by swapping viral surface proteins. However, this process, termed pseudotyping, is poorly understood at the molecular level. For murine leukemia virus envelope (MLV Env) glycoprotein, incorporation into foreign viral particles is an active process, but it does not appear to occur through direct viral protein-protein interactions. In this study, we tested hundreds of thousands of MLV Env mutants for the ability to be enriched in viral particles as well as perform other glycoprotein functions. Our analyses on a subset of these mutants predict that the glycoprotein regions embedded in and immediately flanking the viral membrane dictate active incorporation into viral particles. We suggest that pseudotyping occurs through specific lipid-protein interactions at the viral assembly site.","['Salamango, Daniel J', 'Alam, Khalid K', 'Burke, Donald H', 'Johnson, Marc C']","['Salamango DJ', 'Alam KK', 'Burke DH', 'Johnson MC']","['Department of Biochemistry, Bond Life Sciences Center, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Bond Life Sciences Center, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Bond Life Sciences Center, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri, USA Department of Biochemistry, Bond Life Sciences Center, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Bond Life Sciences Center, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri, USA marcjohnson@health.missouri.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Fusion', 'HEK293 Cells/*virology', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Virus Assembly', '*Virus Internalization']",2016/05/06 06:00,2017/05/19 06:00,['2016/05/06 06:00'],"['2016/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,J Virol. 2016 Jun 24;90(14):6502-14. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00804-16.

However, little is known whether PD-1/PD-L1 could directly activates intracellular oncogenic signaling pathways in tumor cells. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether intracellular AKT/mTOR signaling could be directly activated by PD-1/PD-L1 during the malignant progression in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Detection of the expression of PD-L1 and p-AKT by immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that both proteins were overexpressed in 54% and 48% DLBCL cases, respectively. Spearman test showed that PD-L1 expression was correlated with p-AKT expression (R=0.244, chi2=5.962; P=0.017) and the expression of PD-L1 and p-AKT were also correlated with clinic-pathological characteristics. In addition, survival analysis showed that DLBCL patients who co-expressed PD-L1 and p-AKT had significantly poorer outcome than patients with single positive or both negative expression (P<0.05). In vitro, total PD-L1 and membrane PD-L1 (mPD-L1) proteins were overexpressed in five DLBCL cell lines by western blot and flow cytometry. We observed that AKT/mTOR pathway was activated in DLBCL cells after stimulated with human recombination PD-1/Fc. Taken together, these results suggested that the combination of PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies and AKT/mTOR inhibitor might be a promising and novel therapeutic approach for DLBCL in the future.","['Dong,

It was recently reported that RDW is a prognostic factor for infection diseases, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, as well as some neoplasms. Moreover, RDW is remarkably strong predictor of longevity, including all causes of death, for adults aged 45 years and older. To explain this occurrence it was proposed that persistent IGFs/mTOR signaling is one of the factors that play a role in affecting the RDW and mortality.The above observations induced us to analyze the prognostic role of RDW in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) being the most frequent type of adult leukemia in Western countries. The obtained results have shown that RDW may be considered as a potential CLL prognostic marker. Elevated RDW level at the moment of diagnosis was associated with advanced disease and presence of other poor prognostic factors. It is also connected with overall survival indicating shorter time in patients with elevated RDW. It is possible that the presently observed correlation between mortality and RDW of the CLL patients is affected by their metabolic (IGF-1/mTOR driven)- rather than chronological- aging. The patients with high level of RDW are expected to have an increased persistent level of IGF-1/mTOR signaling. Within the framework of personalized therapy, these CLL patients therefore would be expected to be more sensitive to the treatment with mTOR inhibitors.","['Podhorecka, Monika', 'Halicka, Dorota', 'Szymczyk, Agnieszka', 'Macheta, Arkadiusz', 'Chocholska, Sylwia', 'Hus, Marek', 'Darzynkiewicz, Zbigniew']","['Podhorecka M', 'Halicka D', 'Szymczyk A', 'Macheta A', 'Chocholska S', 'Hus M', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Department of Hematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Pathology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA.', 'Department of Hematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Pathology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Erythrocyte Indices', '*Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/metabolism', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/blood']",2016/05/06 06:00,2017/12/27 06:00,['2016/05/06 06:00'],"['2016/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/27 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 May 31;7(22):32846-53. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9055.,10.18632/oncotarget.9055 [doi],,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (IGF1 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",PMC5078056,['NOTNLM'],"['CD38', 'CLL', 'RDW', 'ZAP-70', 'mTOR']","['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest with the contents of', 'this article.']","['9055 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9055 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lesion had been present for many years, but had recently begun to grow and become pruritic and painful. Excisional biopsy revealed a large nodular aggregate of variably sized CD20(dim), CD5(+), CD23(+), BCL-2(+) atypical lymphocytes in the dermis without epidermotropism. The lymphocytes were negative for BCL-1/cyclinD1, BCL-6, and CD10, and no other background lesion was identified. This constellation of biopsy findings was consistent with CLL/SLL.

Over the last decade, scientific discoveries have unraveled specific pathways involved in the complex pathophysiology of MDS. Prominent examples include aberrations in cytokines and their signaling pathways (such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, SMAD proteins), mutations in genes encoding the RNA splicing machinery (SF3B1, SRSF2, ZRSR2, and U2AF1 genes), mutations in genes disrupting the epigenetic machinery (TET2, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, EZH2, ASXL1). In addition, abnormalities in regulatory T-cell dynamics and atypical interactions between the bone marrow microenvironment, stroma and progenitor cells, and abnormal maintenance of telomeres are also notable contributors to the complex pathogenesis of MDS. These pathways represent potential targets for novel therapies. Specific therapies include drugs targeting aberrant DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling, modulating/activating the immune system to enhance tumor-specific cellular immune responses and reduce anomalous cytokine signaling, and blocking abnormal interaction between hematopoietic progenitors and stromal cells.","['Zahid, Mohammad Faizan', 'Patnaik, Mrinal M', 'Gangat, Naseema', 'Hashmi, Shahrukh K', 'Rizzieri, David A']","['Zahid MF', 'Patnaik MM', 'Gangat N', 'Hashmi SK', 'Rizzieri DA']","['Medical graduate, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan. faizanzahid91@hotmail.com.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic Transplant Center, Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic Transplant Center, Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies & Cellular Therapy, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cellular Microenvironment/genetics/immunology', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics/immunology', 'Cytokines/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Immune System Diseases/complications', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA Splicing', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cells/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Telomere/genetics/metabolism']",2016/05/06 06:00,2017/02/07 06:00,['2016/05/06 06:00'],"['2016/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2016 Oct;97(4):313-20. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12771.

This study was designed to determine the safety and toxicity profile of intraventricular etoposide administration and was affiliated with the prospective, multicenter, nonblinded, nonrandomized, multi-armed HIT-REZ-97 trial. The study enrolled 68 patients, aged 1.1-34.6 (median age 11 years). Adverse events that could possibly be related to intraventricular etoposide therapy were documented and analyzed. Intraventricular etoposide was simultaneously administered with either oral or intravenous chemotherapy in 426 courses according to three major schedules varying in dosing (0.25-1 mg), frequency of administration (bolus injection, every 12 or 24 h), course duration (5-10 days) and length of interval between courses (2-5 weeks). Potential treatment-related adverse effects included transient headache, seizures, infection of the reservoir, nausea and neuropsychological symptoms. Hematological side effects were not observed. One patient, with history of multiple prior therapies, who received long-term intraventricular and oral etoposide treatment developed acute myeloid leukemia as a secondary malignancy. Overall intraventricular etoposide is well tolerated.

However, the essential transcription factor for gene expression of HOTAIRM1 is still unknown. FINDINGS: Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that PU.1 constitutively bound to the regulatory region of HOTAIRM1. Co-expression of PU.1 led to the transactivation of the regulatory region of HOTAIRM1 in a reporter assay. Detailed analysis showed that two PU.1 motifs, which were located around +1100 bp downstream of the transcriptional start site of the HOTAIRM1 promoter, were responsible for the PU.1-dependent transactivation. The induction of HOTAIRM1 by ATRA was dependent on PU.1, and ectopic expression of PU.1 significantly up-regulated HOTAIRM1. Furthermore, low HOTAIRM1 expression was observed in APL cells, which was attributed to the reduced PU.1 expression rather than the repression by PML-RARalpha via the direct binding. CONCLUSION: PU.1 directly activates the expression of HOTAIRM1 through binding to the regulatory region of HOTAIRM1 during granulocytic differentiation.

In recent years, management of lung cancer has been moving towards molecular-guided treatment, and the best example of this new approach is the use of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in patients with mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The identification of molecular predictors of response can allow the selection of patients who will be the most likely to respond to these tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) are frequently observed in patients receiving EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy and are most impactful on the patient's quality of life. Dermatologic side effects are also relatively common among patients treated with EGFR inhibitors. Evidence has emerged in recent years to suggest that the incidence and severity of rash, positively correlated with response to treatment.These skin disorders are generally mild or moderate in severity and can be managed by appropriate interventions or by reducing or interrupting the dose. Appropriate and timely management make it possible to continue a patient's quality of life and maintain compliance; however if these adverse events (AEs) are not managed appropriately, and become more severe, treatment cessation may be warranted compromising clinical outcome. Strategies to improve the assessment and management of TKI related skin AEs are therefore essential to ensure compliance with TKI therapy, thereby enabling patients to achieve optimal benefits. This article provides a consensus on practical recommendation for the prevention and management of diarrhoea and rash in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving TKIs.","['Parikh, P', 'Prabhash, K', 'Naik, R', 'Vaid, A K', 'Goswami, C', 'Rajappa, S', 'Noronha, V', 'Joshi, A', 'Chacko, R T', 'Aggarwal, S', 'Doval, D C']","['Parikh P', 'Prabhash K', 'Naik R', 'Vaid AK', 'Goswami C', 'Rajappa S', 'Noronha V', 'Joshi A', 'Chacko RT', 'Aggarwal S', 'Doval DC']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Lung/Head and Neck Cancer, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Diarrhea/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'ErbB Receptors/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Exanthema/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/therapeutic use']",2016/05/06 06:00,2017/04/22 06:00,['2016/05/06 06:00'],"['2016/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/22 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Indian J Cancer. 2016 Jan-Mar;53(1):87-91. doi: 10.4103/0019-509X.180863.,10.4103/0019-509X.180863 [doi],,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",,,,,"['IndianJournalofCancer_2016_53_1_87_180863 [pii]', '10.4103/0019-509X.180863 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This descriptive retrospective study was based on secondary data from Hadhramout Cancer Registry, Hadhramout, Yemen. All Yemeni children under age of 15 years, who were diagnosed with cancer were included. The International Childhood Cancer Classification system was used to categorize cancer types. RESULTS: A total of 406 childhood cancers of both gender less than 15 years of age were reported. These represented 8.5% of all cases registered. The mean age was 7.34 +/- 4.18 years. There were 240 males (59.1%) and 166 females (40.9%) with a male to female ratio of 1.4:1. Calculated incidence of cancer in children in this population is 1.9 per 100,000. The predominant age group was 5-9 years (35%) followed by 10-14 years (33.7%), and 0-4 years group (31%). The most common group of malignancies were hematological malignancies accounting for 47% of cases, followed by nervous system malignancies (15%). The most frequently reported cancer types were lymphoma (24%), leukemia (23%), carcinoma (13.1%), and central nervous system (CNS) tumors (11.6%). CONCLUSIONS: There is a lower frequency of childhood cancer in Hadhramout Sector when compared with developed countries. The most common cancers among children were lymphoma, leukemia, carcinoma, and CNS tumors.","['Jawass, Mazin A', 'Al-Ezzi, Jalil I', 'Bin Gouth, Hanan S', 'Bahwal, Saleh A', 'Bamatraf, Fawzia F', ""Ba'amer, Abubakir A""]","['Jawass MA', 'Al-Ezzi JI', 'Bin Gouth HS', 'Bahwal SA', 'Bamatraf FF', ""Ba'amer AA""]","['Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Hadhramout University, Al-Mukalla, Hadhramout, Yemen.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study conducted on October, 2013 - March, 2014, including patients diagnosed with Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia on treatment with imatinib in the hospital. Therapeutic adherence was assessed through the standard Morisky-Green Questionnaire and the medication dispensing record. Those patients who did not complete 6 months of treatment and/or did not complete the questionnaire were excluded. Therapeutic response was assessed following clinical guidelines. The descriptive analysis of variables and correlation was conducted through Pearsons's Chi-Square Test. RESULTS: The study included 31 patients. When assessing the level of association between response variables and therapeutic adherence: 1. The highest molecular response was reached by 68.4% of those patients with high adherence, and by 75% of those patients with intermediate adherence. 2. Complete molecular response was achieved by 57.9% of patients with high adherence, and by 58.3% of patients with intermediate adherence. No statistically significant differences were found in response variables between patients with high and intermediate therapeutic adherence. No association was observed between level of adherence and therapeutic response. CONCLUSIONS: We cannot confirm that a different level of therapeutic adherence might have an impact on response to imatinib, though this should be taken into account in cases of therapeutic failure or sub-optimal response.","['Garcia-Queiruga, Marta', 'Martinez-Lopez, Laura Maria', 'Martin-Herranz, Maria Isabel', 'Seoane-Pillado, Teresa', 'Fernandez-Gabriel, Elena', 'Calleja-Chucla, Teresa']","['Garcia-Queiruga M', 'Martinez-Lopez LM', 'Martin-Herranz MI', 'Seoane-Pillado T', 'Fernandez-Gabriel E', 'Calleja-Chucla T']","['Servicio de Farmacia.

DISCERN takes two expression datasets as input: an expression dataset of diseased tissues from patients with a disease of interest and another expression dataset from matching normal tissues. DISCERN estimates the extent to which each gene is perturbed-having distinct regulator connectivity in the inferred gene-regulator dependencies between the disease and normal conditions. This approach has distinct advantages over existing methods. First, DISCERN infers conditional dependencies between candidate regulators and genes, where conditional dependence relationships discriminate the evidence for direct interactions from indirect interactions more precisely than pairwise correlation. Second, DISCERN uses a new likelihood-based scoring function to alleviate concerns about accuracy of the specific edges inferred in a particular network. DISCERN identifies perturbed genes more accurately in synthetic data than existing methods to identify perturbed genes between distinct states. In expression datasets from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast cancer and lung cancer, genes with high DISCERN scores in each cancer are enriched for known tumor drivers, genes associated with the biological processes known to be important in the disease, and genes associated with patient prognosis, in the respective cancer. Finally, we show that DISCERN can uncover potential mechanisms underlying network perturbation by explaining observed epigenomic activity patterns in cancer and normal tissue types more accurately than alternative methods, based on the available epigenomic data from the ENCODE project.","['Grechkin, Maxim', 'Logsdon, Benjamin A', 'Gentles, Andrew J', 'Lee, Su-In']","['Grechkin M', 'Logsdon BA', 'Gentles AJ', 'Lee SI']","['Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', 'Sage Bionetworks, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', 'Center for Cancer Systems Biology, Department of Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', 'Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics', '*Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Prognosis']",2016/05/06 06:00,2017/03/21 06:00,['2016/05/05 06:00'],"['2015/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/21 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2016 May 4;12(5):e1004888. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004888. eCollection 2016 May.,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004888 [doi],20160504,,PMC4856318,,,,"['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004888 [doi]', 'PCOMPBIOL-D-15-00211 [pii]']",,,['U54 CA149145/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-2265-3881'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD26 has recently been described as a specific marker of CML LSCs. In the current study, we investigated this marker in a cohort of 31 unselected CML patients. BCR/ABL1 positivity was analyzed in highly enriched stem cell fractions using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The proportion of CD26+ LSCs and CD26- HSCs varied considerably among the patients analyzed, and the percentage of CD26+ cells correlated with leukocyte count. The CD26 expression robustly discriminated LSCs from HSCs. This required a strict gating of the stem cell compartment. Thus, in patients with very low LSC or HSC numbers, only the highly sensitive RT-PCR method discriminated between clonal and non-clonal cells, while a robust FISH analysis required larger numbers of cells in both compartments. Finally, our data show that the numbers of CD26+ CML LSCs correlate with responses to treatment with BCR-ABL1 inhibitors.","['Culen, Martin', 'Borsky, Marek', 'Nemethova, Veronika', 'Razga, Filip', 'Smejkal, Jiri', 'Jurcek, Tomas', 'Dvorakova, Dana', 'Zackova, Daniela', 'Weinbergerova, Barbora', 'Semerad, Lukas', 'Sadovnik, Irina', 'Eisenwort, Gregor', 'Herrmann, Harald', 'Valent, Peter', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Racil, Zdenek']","['Culen M', 'Borsky M', 'Nemethova V', 'Razga F', 'Smejkal J', 'Jurcek T', 'Dvorakova D', 'Zackova D', 'Weinbergerova B', 'Semerad L', 'Sadovnik I', 'Eisenwort G', 'Herrmann H', 'Valent P', 'Mayer J', 'Racil Z']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Polymer Institute of the Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovak Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Polymer Institute of the Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovak Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Haematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Haematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Haematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Haematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Prognosis']",2016/05/05 06:00,2018/02/13 06:00,['2016/05/05 06:00'],"['2015/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/13 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 May 31;7(22):33016-24. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9108.,10.18632/oncotarget.9108 [doi],,"['EC 3.4.14.5 (DPP4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)']",PMC5078071,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'DPPIV/CD26', 'FACS', 'FISH', 'LSC']","['P.V. has received research funding and honoraria from BMS, Novartis and Ariad.', 'The other authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose in this study.']","['9108 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9108 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure to MPEMFs may affect brain physiology and lead to various health hazards including brain tumors. Earlier studies with positron emission tomography (PET) have found alterations in cerebral blood flow (CBF) after acute exposure to MPEMFs. It is widely accepted that DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and their misrepair in stem cells are critical events in the multistage origination of various leukemia and tumors, including brain tumors such as gliomas. Both significant misbalance in DSB repair and severe stress response have been triggered by MPEMFs and EMFs from cell towers. It has been shown that stem cells are most sensitive to microwave exposure and react to more frequencies than do differentiated cells. This may be important for cancer risk assessment and indicates that stem cells are the most relevant cellular model for validating safe mobile communication signals. Recently developed technology for recording the human bio-electromagnetic (BEM) field using Electron photonic Imaging (EPI) or Gas Discharge Visualisation (GDV) technique provides useful information about the human BEM.

Herein, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) and transcriptome sequencing (RNASeq) on 7 CDC samples (CDC1 -7). Among the 7 samples, 4 samples with matched non-tumor tissue were used for copy number analysis by SNP array data. No recurrent somatic SNVs were observed except for MLL, which was found to be mutated (p.V297I and p.F407C) in 2 samples. We identified somatic SNVs in 14 other cancer census genes including: ATM, CREBBP, PRDM1, CBFB, FBXW7, IKZF1, KDR, KRAS, NACA, NF2, NUP98, SS18, TP53, and ZNF521. SNP array data identified a CDKN2A homozygous deletion in 3 samples and SNV analysis showed a non-sense mutation of the CDKN2A gene with unknown somatic status. To estimate the recurrent rate of CDKN2A abnormalities, we performed FISH screening of additional samples and confirmed the frequent loss (62.5%) of CDKN2A expression. Since cisplatin based therapy is the common treatment option for CDC, we investigated the expression of solute carrier (SLC) family transporters and found 45% alteration. In addition, SLC7A11 (cystine transporter, xCT), a cisplatin resistance associated gene, was found to be overexpressed in 4 out of 5 (80%) cases of CDC tumors tested, as compared to matched non-tumor tissue.

We have examined this directly by a comparative RNA-Seq analysis of KBM-7 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells and KBM-7 cells in which the NUDT2 Ap4A hydrolase gene had been disrupted (NuKO cells), causing a 175-fold increase in intracellular Ap4A. 6,288 differentially expressed genes were identified with P < 0.05. Of these, 980 were up-regulated and 705 down-regulated in NuKO cells with a fold-change >/= 2. Ingenuity(R) Pathway Analysis (IPA(R)) was used to assign these genes to known canonical pathways and functional networks. Pathways associated with interferon responses, pattern recognition receptors and inflammation scored highly in the down-regulated set of genes while functions associated with MHC class II antigens were prominent among the up-regulated genes, which otherwise showed little organization into major functional gene sets. Tryptophan catabolism was also strongly down-regulated as were numerous genes known to be involved in tumor promotion in other systems, with roles in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Conversely, some pro-apoptotic genes were up-regulated. Major upstream factors predicted by IPA(R) for gene down-regulation included NFkappaB, STAT1/2, IRF3/4 and SP1 but no major factors controlling gene up-regulation were identified. Potential mechanisms for gene regulation mediated by Ap4A and/or NUDT2 disruption include binding of Ap4A to the HINT1 co-repressor, autocrine activation of purinoceptors by Ap4A, chromatin remodeling, effects of NUDT2 loss on transcript stability, and inhibition of ATP-dependent regulatory factors such as protein kinases by Ap4A. Existing evidence favors the last of these as the most probable mechanism. Regardless, our results suggest that the NUDT2 protein could be a novel cancer chemotherapeutic target, with its inhibition potentially exerting strong anti-tumor effects via multiple pathways involving metastasis, invasion, immunosuppression and apoptosis.","['Marriott, Andrew S', 'Vasieva, Olga', 'Fang, Yongxiang', 'Copeland, Nikki A', 'McLennan, Alexander G', 'Jones, Nigel J']","['Marriott AS', 'Vasieva O', 'Fang Y', 'Copeland NA', 'McLennan AG', 'Jones NJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Functional and Comparative Genomics, Institute of Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Functional and Comparative Genomics, Institute of Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Biomedical and Life Sciences, University of Lancaster, Lancaster, Lancashire, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*deficiency/genetics']",2016/05/06 06:00,2017/07/18 06:00,['2016/05/05 06:00'],"['2015/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/18 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 May 4;11(5):e0154674. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0154674. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0154674 [doi],20160504,"['0 (Dinucleoside Phosphates)', '5542-28-9 (diadenosine tetraphosphate)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.17 (NUDT2 protein, human)']",PMC4856261,,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0154674 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-53418 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many stem cell markers were expressed in both CSN and CS12 cells, but LGR5 and NANOG were expressed only in CS12 cells. Increased expression of homeobox A13 (HoxA13) and its downstream cascades was significant for the tumorigenic activity of CS12 cells, and was associated with recruitment of E2F-1 to HoxA13 promoter accompanied with increased trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) at the hypomethylated E2F motifs. Knockdown of HoxA13 caused the downregulation of long non-coding RNA HOTTIP and insulin growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) genes, indicating that both were targets of HoxA13. Concurrent regulation of HoxA13-HOTTIP was mediated by the mixed lineage leukemia-WD repeat domain 5 complex, which caused the trimethylation of H3K4 and then stimulated cell proliferation. HoxA13 transactivated the IGFBP-3 promoter through the HOX-binding site. Activation of IGFBP-3 stimulated the oncogenic potential and invasion activity. Increased expression of HoxA13 (63.2%) and IGFBP-3 (28.6%) was detected in human gastric cancer tissues and was found in the gastric cancer data of The Cancer Genome Atlas.

We recently showed that AML cells in established culture treated with Cytarabine (AraC) and a differentiation agent combination show enhancement of AraC cytotoxicity. Here we elucidate molecular changes which underlie this observation with focus on AML blasts in primary culture. The cells were treated with AraC at concentrations achievable in clinical settings, and followed by the addition of Doxercalciferol, a vitamin D2 derivative (D2), together with Carnosic acid (CA), a plant-derived antioxidant. Importantly, although AraC is also toxic to normal bone marrow cell population, the enhanced cell kill by D2/CA was limited to malignant blasts. This enhancement of cell death was associated with activation of the monocytic differentiation program as shown by molecular markers, and the increased expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR). Apoptosis elicited by this treatment is caspase-dependent, and the optimal blast killing required the increased expression of the apoptosis regulator Bim.

However, understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying BCR/ABL gene regulation remains incomplete. While BCR/ABL kinase inhibitors have shown unprecedented efficacy in the clinic, most patients relapse. In this study, we demonstrated that the Sp1 oncogene functions as a positive regulator for BCR/ABL expression. Inactivation of Sp1 by genetic and pharmacological approaches abrogated BCR/ABL expression, leading to suppression of BCR/ABL kinase signaling and CML cell proliferation. Because of potential adverse side effects of bortezomib (BORT) in imatinib-refractory CML patients, we designed a transferrin (Tf)-targeted liposomal formulation (Tf-L-BORT) for BORT delivery. Cellular uptake assays showed that BORT was efficiently delivered into K562 cells, with the highest efficacy obtained in Tf-targeted group. After administered into mice, L-BORT exhibited slower clearance with less toxicity compared to free BORT. Furthermore, L-BORT exposure significantly blocked BCR/ABL kinase activities and sensitized CML cell lines, tumor cells and doxorubicin (DOX) resistant cells to DOX. This occurred through the more pronounced inhibition of BCR/ABL activity by L-BORT and DOX. Collectively, these findings highlight the therapeutic relevance of disrupting BCR/ABL protein expression and strongly support the utilization of L-BORT alone or in combination with DOX to treat CML patients with overexpressing BCR/ABL.","['Yang, Xiaojuan', 'Pang, Jiuxia', 'Shen, Na', 'Yan, Fei', 'Wu, Lai-Chu', 'Al-Kali, Aref', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Peng, Yong', 'Lee, Robert J', 'Liu, Shujun']","['Yang X', 'Pang J', 'Shen N', 'Yan F', 'Wu LC', 'Al-Kali A', 'Litzow MR', 'Peng Y', 'Lee RJ', 'Liu S']","['The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN 55912, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Pharmacology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN 55912, USA.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN 55912, USA.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN 55912, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Pharmacology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University/Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu, 610041, China.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN 55912, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Bortezomib/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Liposomes/chemistry', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism']",2016/05/05 06:00,2017/12/28 06:00,['2016/05/05 06:00'],"['2016/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/28 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/05 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jun 14;7(24):36382-36394. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.8871.,10.18632/oncotarget.8871 [doi],,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sp1 protein, human)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",PMC5095007,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR/ABL', 'bortezomib', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'liposome', 'nanoparticle']",['The authors state no conflicts of interest.'],"['8871 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.8871 [doi]']",,,"['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA149623/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA155915/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1 has been described as the more clinically significant one, being associated with diseases such as adult T-cell leukemia and tropical spastic paraparesis. We report here a case of tropical spastic paraparesis in an HIV-positive patient who did not report any history of travel or residence in an HTLV endemic area. A 57 year old African-American male was admitted to the hospital due to bilateral upper and lower extremity weakness associated with stiffness. He had recently been diagnosed with HIV. His physical examination showed mild to moderate decreased motor strength, in both upper extremities and marked loss in both lower extremities. This was associated with hyperreflexia and clonus. Sensory function was intact. He looked cachectic and had several psoriatic plaques on both lower and upper extremities. Laboratory work-up showed a CD4 count decreased to 94 cells/mm(3) and a HIV viral load of 273,000 copies/mL. Based on serum positivity for HTLV type 1 and the patient's clinical presentation suggestive of upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction, the diagnosis of tropical spastic paraparesis was made. HTLV and HIV share the same routes of transmission and the same tropism for T-lymphocytes. Co-infection occurs probably more frequently than we are aware, since testing for HTLV is not routinely performed in outpatient HIV clinics.","['Isache, Carmen', 'Sands, Michael', 'Guzman, Nilmarie', 'Figueroa, Danisha']","['Isache C', 'Sands M', 'Guzman N', 'Figueroa D']","['University of Florida, Division of General Internal Medicine, Jacksonville, FL, United States.', 'University of Florida, Division of Infectious Disease, Jacksonville, FL, United States.', 'University of Florida, Division of Infectious Disease, Jacksonville, FL, United States.', 'University of Florida, Division of Infectious Disease, Jacksonville, FL, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Case Reports']",Netherlands,IDCases,IDCases,101634540,,,2016/05/05 06:00,2016/05/05 06:01,['2016/05/05 06:00'],"['2016/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/17 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/05 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,IDCases. 2016 Apr 7;4:53-5. doi: 10.1016/j.idcr.2016.03.002. eCollection 2016.,10.1016/j.idcr.2016.03.002 [doi],20160407,,PMC4840448,['NOTNLM'],"['*Co-infection', '*HIV', '*HTLV', '*Tropical spastic paraparesis']",,"['10.1016/j.idcr.2016.03.002 [doi]', 'S2214-2509(16)30014-2 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report the development of a cellular programming approach to render alloreactive T cells incapable of causing severe GVHD in both major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched and MHC-identical but minor histocompatibility antigen-mismatched mouse models. We established a novel platform that produced delta-like ligand 4-positive dendritic cells (Dll4(hi)DCs) from murine bone marrow using Flt3 ligand and Toll-like receptor agonists. Upon allogeneic Dll4(hi)DC stimulation, CD4(+) naive T cells underwent effector differentiation and produced high levels of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-17 in vitro, depending on Dll4 activation of Notch signaling. Following transfer, allogeneic Dll4(hi)DC-induced T cells were unable to mediate severe GVHD but preserved antileukemic activity, significantly improving the survival of leukemic mice undergoing allogeneic HSCT. This effect of Dll4(hi)DC-induced T cells was associated with their impaired expansion in GVHD target tissues. IFN-gamma was important for Dll4(hi)DC programming to reduce GVHD toxicities of alloreactive T cells. Absence of T-cell IFN-gamma led to improved survival and expansion of Dll4(hi)DC-induced CD4(+) T cells in transplant recipients and caused lethal GVHD. Our findings demonstrate that Dll4(hi)DC programming can overcome GVHD toxicity of donor T cells and produce leukemia-reactive T cells for effective immunotherapy.","['Mochizuki, Kazuhiro', 'Meng, Lijun', 'Mochizuki, Izumi', 'Tong, Qing', 'He, Shan', 'Liu, Yongnian', 'Purushe, Janaki', 'Fung, Henry', 'Zaidi, M Raza', 'Zhang, Yanyun', 'Reshef, Ran', 'Blazar, Bruce R', 'Yagita, Hideo', 'Mineishi, Shin', 'Zhang, Yi']","['Mochizuki K', 'Meng L', 'Mochizuki I', 'Tong Q', 'He S', 'Liu Y', 'Purushe J', 'Fung H', 'Zaidi MR', 'Zhang Y', 'Reshef R', 'Blazar BR', 'Yagita H', 'Mineishi S', 'Zhang Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI;', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA; Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China;', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI;', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA;', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA;', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA;', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA;', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Temple Health, Philadelphia, PA;', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA;', 'Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China;', 'Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA;', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics and Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN;', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan; and.', 'Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', '*Cellular Reprogramming', 'Cellular Reprogramming Techniques/*methods', 'Dendritic Cells/*metabolism/physiology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2016/05/05 06:00,2017/08/03 06:00,['2016/05/05 06:00'],"['2015/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jun 23;127(25):3270-80. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-05-644476.

In the current study, the authors evaluated treatment with single-agent blinatumomab in adults aged >/=65 years with r/r ALL. METHODS: A total of 261 adults with r/r ALL who were examined across two phase 2 studies received blinatumomab in cycles of 4-week continuous infusion and 2-week treatment-free intervals. The primary endpoint in each study was complete remission (CR) or CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) during the first 2 cycles. Data were pooled and analyzed according to patient age at screening (aged >/=65 years vs aged <65 years). RESULTS: Of 36 older adults, 56% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 38%-72%) achieved CR/CRh during the first 2 cycles compared with 46% (225 patients) (95% CI, 40%-53%) of younger adults. Complete minimal residual disease responses were 60% in older and 70% in younger responders. Three older responders (15%) and 61 younger responders (59%) proceeded to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Kaplan-Meier curves overlapped for relapse-free and overall survival for both age groups. Older adults were found to have a similar incidence of grade >/=3 adverse events (AEs) as younger adults (86% vs 80%) but more grade >/=3 neurologic events (28% vs 13%). Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 7 older (19%) (1 case of grade 3) and 23 younger (10%) (4 cases of grade >/=3) adults. There were no treatment-related fatal AEs reported. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with r/r ALL who were treated with single-agent blinatumomab were found to have similar hematologic response rates and incidence of grade >/=3 AEs compared with younger adults but had more neurologic events, which were reversible and primarily resolved with treatment interruption.

The leaky vasculature in combination with poor lymphatic drainage has been demonstrated to lead to the accumulation of liposomes via the enhanced permeation and retention effect. However, only very limited information exists on the disposition of such delivery systems in the bone marrow compartment, the primary site of tumor cell origination and growth for many hematological malignancies. In this review we discuss the biological properties of anionic low-cholesterol liposome formulations and their potential for passively accumulating within the bone marrow and being selectively engulfed by leukemia cells compared to normal bone marrow cells. The therapeutic implications for preferential bone marrow delivery as well as the potential routes for the internalization of drug-encapsulated liposomes into cells in the absence of a targeting ligand are reviewed.","['Tardi, Paul', 'Wan, Chung Ping Leon', 'Mayer, Lawrence']","['Tardi P', 'Wan CP', 'Mayer L']","['a Celator Pharmaceuticals , Vancouver , BC , Canada.', 'a Celator Pharmaceuticals , Vancouver , BC , Canada.', 'a Celator Pharmaceuticals , Vancouver , BC , Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Drug Target,Journal of drug targeting,9312476,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*physiology', 'Cholesterol/*chemistry', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Liposomes/*chemistry']",2016/05/05 06:00,2018/01/24 06:00,['2016/05/05 06:00'],"['2016/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/05 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Drug Target. 2016 Nov;24(9):797-804. doi: 10.1080/1061186X.2016.1184669.

METHODS: From our nested case-control study cohort of MDS patients, we chose 11 paired transformed and non-transformed MDS patients. TUBB gene expression was tested by quantitative real-time PCR. TUBB-siRNA transfection was used to down-regulate TUBB gene expression in SKM-1 cell line. The function of TUBB gene in SKM-1 cell line was evaluated by cell proliferation, soft agar clone formation and electron microscope. RESULTS: TUBB gene expression in MDS patients in transformed group were significantly higher than that in control group (2.91+/-0.41 vs 0.90+/-0.23, P<0.01). After TUBB-siRNA transfection, A450/630nm of SKM-1 cells at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h were 0.299+/-0.045, 0.526+/-0.034 and 0.652+/-0.035, respectively, which were significantly decreased than those in negative-siRNA group(0.438+/-0.074, 0.858+/-0.064 and 0.974+/-0.044)(P<0.05). Soft agar clone formation in TUBB-siRNA group was (7.0+/-0.2)%, which was significantly reduced than that of negative-siRNA group (25.0+/-0.2)% (P<0.01). Electron microscope showed significant apoptotic signs in TUBB-siRNA group, including vacuoles in cytoplasm and karyorrhexis. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that TUBB gene may play a role in the transformation of MDS into acute leukemia by affecting the proliferation of malignant clones.","['Ma, Y', 'Chen, B B', 'Xu, X P', 'Lin, G W']","['Ma Y', 'Chen BB', 'Xu XP', 'Lin GW']","['Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan Universtiy, Shanghai 200040, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cohort Studies', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', '*RNA, Small Interfering', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Transfection', 'Tubulin/*genetics']",2016/05/05 06:00,2017/01/11 06:00,['2016/05/05 06:00'],"['2016/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/11 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2016 May 1;55(5):377-80. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0578-1426.2016.05.009.,10.3760/cma.j.issn.0578-1426.2016.05.009 [doi],,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tubulin)']",,,,,['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0578-1426.2016.05.009 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) offer a promising addition to immunosuppressive drugs (ISD), while NK-cells are increasingly used as effector cells in graft-versus-leukemia. Combined therapy of ISD, NK-cells and/or MSCs is used in clinical practice. Here, we examined the effects of MSCs and selected ISD (tacrolimus, cyclosporin A, mycophenolic acid, dexamethasone) treatment on early NK-cell activation. We assessed STAT4 and STAT5 phosphorylation triggered by IL-12 and IL-2, respectively. Furthermore, we determined IFNgamma, perforin production and the expression pattern of selected NK-cell receptors. Of all drugs tested, only dexamethasone inhibited NK-cell STAT4 and STAT5 phosphorylation. All ISD, with the exception of MPA, significantly inhibited IFNgamma, and only dexamethasone inhibited upregulation of early activation markers CD69 and CD25 (IL-2 condition only). MSCs inhibited IL-2 induced NK cell STAT5 phosphorylation, IFNgamma production and CD69 upregulation, and IL-12 induced IFNgamma and perforin production. While MSCs mediated inhibition of CD69 expression was cell contact dependent, inhibition of IFNgamma and perforin production, as well as STAT5 phosphorylation was cell-contact independent. Importantly, dexamethasone augmented MSCs mediated inhibition of both IL-12 and IL-2 induced CD69 expression and IFNgamma production, as well as IL-2 induced STAT5 phosphorylation. Taken together, these novel insights may help the design of future NK-cell and MSCs based immunotherapy.","['Michelo, Clive M', 'Fasse, Esther', 'van Cranenbroek, Bram', 'Linda, Katrin', 'van der Meer, Arnold', 'Abdelrazik, Heba', 'Joosten, Irma']","['Michelo CM', 'Fasse E', 'van Cranenbroek B', 'Linda K', 'van der Meer A', 'Abdelrazik H', 'Joosten I']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

Conventional relapsed leukemia treatment includes second allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), which in most cases mediate, at best, a modest graft-versus-leukemia effect, although their clinical efficacy is still limited. Although allo-HSCT following myeloablative conditioning is a curative treatment option for younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in a first complete remission (CR), allo-HSCT as a clinical treatment is usually limited because of treatment-related toxicity. The overall DLI remission rate is only 15%-42% and 2-year overall survival (OS) is approximately 15%-20%, with a high (40%-60%) incidence of DLI-related graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Therefore, development of new, targeted treatment strategies for relapsed and refractory AL patients is ongoing. Adoptive transfer of T cells with genetically engineered chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) is an encouraging approach for treating hematological malignancies. These T cells are capable of selectively recognizing tumor-associated antigens and may overcome many limitations of conventional therapies, inducing remission in patients with chemotherapy-refractory or relapsed AL. In this review, we aimed to highlight the current understanding of this promising treatment modality, discussing its adverse effects and efficacy.","['Ding, Guoliang', 'Chen, Hu']","['Ding G', 'Chen H']","['Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100853, China. chenhu217@aliyun.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",China,Sci China Life Sci,Science China.

Systemic and intrathecal methotrexate, commonly used for CNS-directed treatment, have been associated with cognitive problems during and after treatment. The cortex, hippocampus, and caudate putamen, important brain regions for learning and memory, may be involved in methotrexate-induced brain injury. Objectives of this study were to (1) quantify neuronal degeneration in selected regions of the cortex, hippocampus, and caudate putamen and (2) measure changes in the expression of genes with known roles in oxidant defense, apoptosis/inflammation, and protection from injury. Male Sprague Dawley rats were administered 2 or 4 mg/kg of methotrexate diluted in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) or aCSF only into the left cerebral lateral ventricle. Gene expression changes were measured using customized reverse transcription (RT)(2) polymerase chain reaction arrays. The greatest percentage of degenerating neurons in methotrexate-treated animals was in the medial region of the cortex; percentage of degenerating neurons in the dentate gyrus and cornu ammonis 3 regions of the hippocampus was also greater in rats treated with methotrexate compared to perfusion and vehicle controls. There was a greater percentage of degenerating neurons in the inferior cortex of control versus methotrexate-treated animals. Eight genes involved in protection from injury, oxidant defense, and apoptosis/inflammation were significantly downregulated in different brain regions of methotrexate-treated rats. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate methotrexate-induced injury in selected brain regions and gene expression changes using a rat model of intraventricular drug administration.","['Moore, Ida M Ki', 'Merkle, Carrie J', 'Byrne, Howard', 'Ross, Adam', 'Hawkins, Ashley M', 'Ameli, Sara S', 'Montgomery, David W']","['Moore IM', 'Merkle CJ', 'Byrne H', 'Ross A', 'Hawkins AM', 'Ameli SS', 'Montgomery DW']","['College of Nursing, The University of Arizona, Tucson AZ, USA imoore@email.arizona.edu.', 'College of Nursing, The University of Arizona, Tucson AZ, USA.', 'College of Nursing, The University of Arizona, Tucson AZ, USA.', 'Southern Arizona VA Healthcare System, Tucson AZ, USA.', 'College of Nursing, The University of Arizona, Tucson AZ, USA.', 'College of Nursing, The University of Arizona, Tucson AZ, USA Southern Arizona VA Healthcare System, Tucson AZ, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biol Res Nurs,Biological research for nursing,9815758,IM,"['Animals', 'Brain Injuries/*drug therapy', 'Caudate Nucleus/*drug effects/*physiopathology', 'Cerebellar Cortex/*drug effects/*physiopathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Hippocampus/drug effects/*physiopathology', 'Infusions, Intraventricular', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",2016/05/05 06:00,2017/09/19 06:00,['2016/05/05 06:00'],"['2016/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/19 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Biol Res Nurs. 2016 Oct;18(5):505-14. doi: 10.1177/1099800416644780.

To avoid deshydratation of skin, we used prophylactic application of hydrating lotion, replaced by corticosteroid cream in case of skin toxicity of chemotherapy or conditioning. RESULTS: We studied 15 consecutive admissions of 12 patients. Daily chlorhexidine bathing never needed to be interrupted, even though 53% of patients were treated with intravenous cytarabine. Patients were satisfied with the skin treatment and reported few unwanted effects.

Therefore, the authors sought to determine correlations between microbiome composition and infectious outcomes in patients with AML who were receiving induction chemotherapy (IC). METHODS: Buccal and fecal specimens (478 samples) were collected twice weekly from 34 patients with AML who were undergoing IC. Oral and stool microbiomes were characterized by 16S ribosomal RNA V4 sequencing using an Illumina MiSeq system. Microbial diversity and genera composition were associated with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Baseline stool alpha-diversity was significantly lower in patients who developed infections during IC compared with those who did not (P = .047). Significant decreases in both oral and stool microbial alpha-diversity were observed over the course of IC, with a linear correlation between alpha-diversity change at the 2 sites (P = .02). Loss of both oral and stool alpha-diversity was associated significantly with the receipt of a carbapenem P < 0.001. Domination events by the majority of genera were transient (median duration, 1 sample), whereas the number of domination events by pathogenic genera increased significantly over the course of IC (P = .002). Moreover, patients who lost microbial diversity over the course of IC were significantly more likely to contract a microbiologically documented infection within the 90 days after IC neutrophil recovery (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: The current data present the largest longitudinal analyses to date of oral and stool microbiomes in patients with AML and suggest that microbiome measurements could assist with the mitigation of infectious complications of AML therapy.

A series of aryl maleimides (AMI) was synthesized and evaluated theoretically for global and local reactivity, showing their selectivity for thiol groups, due to a reaction of the vinyl moiety (a soft acid) with thiols (a soft base). Two AMI that are benzoic acid derivatives (1f and 1h) were tested with an in vitro and ex vivo model to evaluate their reactivity with thiols and their activity in L5178-Y cells. The in vitro reactions clearly showed a selective Michael type 1,4-addition reaction between thiols (glutathione and N-acetylcysteine, which are nucleophiles) and the AMI (1f and 1h, which are electrophiles). In cell cultures, the compounds induced a decreasing cellular viability and an apoptotic effect of up to 59.8% at 48 h. The ex vivo experimental model showed an important reduction of thiol levels in cells treated with 1h. Decreased cellular viability and increased apoptosis were confirmed by flow cytometry, DNA fragmentation and microscopy analysis (cytological studies). The increase in apoptosis on L5178-Y cells probably occurred, at least in part, by a decrease in glutathione levels and an increase in free radicals concentration. The decreased glutathione levels seem to make cancer cells more susceptible to death by apoptosis, and should certainly make them more vulnerable to a less aggressive treatment.","['Andrade-Jorge, Erik', 'Godinez-Victoria, Marycarmen', 'Sanchez-Torres, Luvia Enid', 'Fabila-Castillo, Luis Humberto', 'Trujillo-Ferrara, Jose G']","['Andrade-Jorge E', 'Godinez-Victoria M', 'Sanchez-Torres LE', 'Fabila-Castillo LH', 'Trujillo-Ferrara JG']","['Department of biochemistry, Medicine School, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Mexico City 11340, Mexico. jtrujillo@ipn.mx.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Maleimides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Quantum Theory', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2016/05/05 06:00,2017/06/15 06:00,['2016/05/05 06:00'],"['2015/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/13 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/05 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2016;16(12):1615-1621. doi: 10.2174/1871520615666160504094417.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Maleimides)']",,,,,"['ACAMC-EPUB-75370 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520615666160504094417 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cattle are the natural host of BLV where it integrates into B-cells, producing a lifelong infection. Most infected animals remain asymptomatic but following a protracted latency period about 5 % develop an aggressive leukemia/lymphoma, mirroring the disease trajectory of HTLV-1. The mechanisms by which these viruses provoke cellular transformation remain opaque. In both viruses little or no transcription is observed from the 5'LTR in tumors, however the proviruses are not transcriptionally silent. In the case of BLV a cluster of RNA polymerase III transcribed microRNAs are highly expressed, while the HTLV-1 antisense transcript HBZ is consistently found in all tumors examined. RESULTS: Here, using RNA-seq, we demonstrate that the BLV provirus also constitutively expresses antisense transcripts in all leukemic and asymptomatic samples examined. The first transcript (AS1) can be alternately polyadenylated, generating a transcript of ~600 bp (AS1-S) and a less abundant transcript of ~2200 bp (AS1-L). Alternative splicing creates a second transcript of ~400 bp (AS2). The coding potential of AS1-S/L is ambiguous, with a small open reading frame of 264 bp, however the transcripts are primarily retained in the nucleus, hinting at a lncRNA-like role. The AS1-L transcript overlaps the BLV microRNAs and using high throughput sequencing of RNA-ligase-mediated (RLM) 5'RACE, we show that the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) cleaves AS1-L. Furthermore, experiments using altered BLV proviruses with the microRNAs either deleted or inverted point to additional transcriptional interference between the two viral RNA species. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of novel viral antisense transcripts shows the BLV provirus to be far from silent in tumors. Furthermore, the consistent expression of these transcripts in both leukemic and nonmalignant clones points to a vital role in the life cycle of the virus and its tumorigenic potential. Additionally, the cleavage of the AS1-L transcript by the BLV encoded microRNAs and the transcriptional interference between the two viral RNA species suggest a shared role in the regulation of BLV.","['Durkin, Keith', 'Rosewick, Nicolas', 'Artesi, Maria', 'Hahaut, Vincent', 'Griebel, Philip', 'Arsic, Natasa', 'Burny, Arsene', 'Georges, Michel', 'Van den Broeke, Anne']","['Durkin K', 'Rosewick N', 'Artesi M', 'Hahaut V', 'Griebel P', 'Arsic N', 'Burny A', 'Georges M', 'Van den Broeke A']","['Unit of Animal Genomics, GIGA-R, Universite de Liege (ULg), 4000, Liege, Belgium.', 'Unit of Animal Genomics, GIGA-R, Universite de Liege (ULg), 4000, Liege, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), 1000, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Unit of Animal Genomics, GIGA-R, Universite de Liege (ULg), 4000, Liege, Belgium.', 'Unit of Animal Genomics, GIGA-R, Universite de Liege (ULg), 4000, Liege, Belgium.', 'Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, S7N 2Z4, Canada.', 'School of Public Health, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, S7N 2Z4, Canada.', 'Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, S7N 2Z4, Canada.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), 1000, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Unit of Animal Genomics, GIGA-R, Universite de Liege (ULg), 4000, Liege, Belgium.', 'Unit of Animal Genomics, GIGA-R, Universite de Liege (ULg), 4000, Liege, Belgium. anne.vandenbroeke@bordet.be.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), 1000, Brussels, Belgium. anne.vandenbroeke@bordet.be.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/virology', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*virology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*virology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Antisense/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics', 'Sheep', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2016/05/05 06:00,2017/05/16 06:00,['2016/05/05 06:00'],"['2016/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2016 May 3;13(1):33. doi: 10.1186/s12977-016-0267-8.,10.1186/s12977-016-0267-8 [doi],20160503,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",PMC4855707,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bovine Leukemia Virus', '*Deltaretrovirus', '*High throughput sequencing', '*Leukemogenesis', '*Noncoding RNA', '*Oxford Nanopore minION', '*RNA-seq']",,"['10.1186/s12977-016-0267-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-016-0267-8 [pii]']",,,,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5422-0549'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a master regulator of several cell cycle events, has arisen as an intriguing target in this research field. The observed overexpression of Plk1 in a broad range of human malignancies has given rise to the development of several potent and specific small molecule inhibitors targeting the kinase. In this review, we focus on volasertib (BI6727), the lead agent in category of Plk1 inhibitors at the moment. Numerous preclinical experiments have demonstrated that BI6727 is highly active across a variety of carcinoma cell lines, and the inhibitor has been reported to induce tumor regression in several xenograft models. Moreover, volasertib has shown clinical efficacy in multiple tumor types. As a result, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently awarded volasertib the Breakthrough Therapy status after significant benefit was observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients treated with the Plk1 inhibitor. Here, we discuss both preclinical and clinical data available for volasertib administered as monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer therapies in a broad range of tumor types.","['Van den Bossche, J', 'Lardon, F', 'Deschoolmeester, V', 'De Pauw, I', 'Vermorken, J B', 'Specenier, P', 'Pauwels, P', 'Peeters, M', 'Wouters, A']","['Van den Bossche J', 'Lardon F', 'Deschoolmeester V', 'De Pauw I', 'Vermorken JB', 'Specenier P', 'Pauwels P', 'Peeters M', 'Wouters A']","['Center for Oncological Research (CORE) Antwerp, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Center for Oncological Research (CORE) Antwerp, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Center for Oncological Research (CORE) Antwerp, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Department of Pathology, Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, Belgium.', 'Center for Oncological Research (CORE) Antwerp, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Center for Oncological Research (CORE) Antwerp, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology, Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, Belgium.', 'Center for Oncological Research (CORE) Antwerp, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology, Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, Belgium.', 'Center for Oncological Research (CORE) Antwerp, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Department of Pathology, Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, Belgium.', 'Center for Oncological Research (CORE) Antwerp, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology, Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, Belgium.', 'Center for Oncological Research (CORE) Antwerp, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Med Res Rev,Medicinal research reviews,8103150,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pteridines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",2016/05/04 06:00,2017/10/05 06:00,['2016/05/04 06:00'],"['2015/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/05 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Med Res Rev. 2016 Jul;36(4):749-86. doi: 10.1002/med.21392.

Surgical excision or thermal ablation of renal mass is generally recommended in view of concern for tumor progression in immunosuppressed patients. We report our management decision experience in patients and literature review on concomitant renal and hematologic malignancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective medical record review of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and a hematologic malignancy over 3 years at our University Hospital was performed. Data were collected including patients demographics, renal tumor and hematologic malignancy characteristics (stage, pathologic subtype, time of diagnosis, treatment type and prognosis). Surgical and medical management of each malignancy was reviewed and perioperative and overall outcomes are reported. RESULTS: In total, 6 patients were identified with RCC and a hematologic malignancy of which 4 were on immunosuppressive therapy. A total of 5 patients had leukemia and 1 patient had multiple myeloma. Most kidney tumors were stage I, 83%; and 80% were Fuhrman grade II. There was equal distribution of clear cell and papillary-type RCC. All but 1 patient had undergone nephron-sparing surgery. Overall, 50% of our patients died within 1 year after renal surgery for pT1a tumors from causes that are unrelated to renal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our small cohort showed significant mortality in patients with hematologic malignancy on immunosuppression, who had their renal mass treated with surgical excision or thermal ablation. However, this mortality was not secondary to surgical procedure itself. The prognosis of the hematologic malignancy might dictate the management of RCC.","['Johnson, Lewis', 'Bylund, Jason', 'Strup, Stephen', 'Howard, Dianne', 'Gul, Zartash', 'Khan, Muhammad Waqas', 'Venkatesh, Ramakrishna']","['Johnson L', 'Bylund J', 'Strup S', 'Howard D', 'Gul Z', 'Khan MW', 'Venkatesh R']","['Department of Urology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky.', 'Department of Urology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky.', 'Department of Urology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky.', 'Division of Hematology Blood & Marrow Transplantation, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky.', 'Division of Hematology Blood & Marrow Transplantation, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky.

The aim of the present study was to analyze the factors affecting the outcome of patients with AML who failed to initial chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 311 adults with de novo AML. RESULTS: Compared with 179 patients showing complete remission (CR), 132 patients who failed to achieve CR were older with poorer prognostic stratification, higher proportion of FLT3-ITD mutations, higher expression rates of CD9, lower expression rates of cMPO and CD64 and poorer overall survival (OS). The 2-year OS rate of the non-CR groups was inferior to that of the CR groups (28.3% versus 53.3%, P < 0.001). However, there was no dramatic difference in 2-year OS rate between initial and reinduction chemotherapy if patients achieved a same remission status. The 2-year OS rate significantly improved following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant in patients who failed to initial treatment. The survival of patients with similar remission status was affected by FLT3-ITD mutation instead of CD9(+) expression. CONCLUSIONS: Initial induction failure or poorer prognostic stratification seriously affected the survival of patients with de novo AML. The allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant is an alternative strategy to improve the survival of patients resistant to initial treatment.","['Wu, Sijing', 'Yang, Shijia', 'Zhu, Li', 'Wang, Ying', 'Zhang, Yicheng', 'Zhou, Jianfeng', 'Li, Dengju']","['Wu S', 'Yang S', 'Zhu L', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhou J', 'Li D']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.

Exposure to the C6-ceramide-tamoxifen combination elicited decreases in mitochondrial membrane potential and complex I respiration, increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS), and release of mitochondrial proapoptotic proteins. Decreases in ATP levels, reduced glycolytic capacity, and reduced expression of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins also resulted. Cytotoxicity of the drug combination was mitigated by exposure to antioxidant. Cells metabolized C6-ceramide by glycosylation and hydrolysis, the latter leading to increases in long-chain ceramides. Tamoxifen potently blocked glycosylation of C6-ceramide and long-chain ceramides. N-desmethyltamoxifen, a poor antiestrogen and the major tamoxifen metabolite in humans, was also effective with C6-ceramide, indicating that traditional antiestrogen pathways are not involved in cellular responses. We conclude that cell death is driven by mitochondrial targeting and ROS generation and that tamoxifen enhances the ceramide effect by blocking its metabolism. As depletion of ATP and targeting the ""Warburg effect"" represent dynamic metabolic insult, this ceramide-containing combination may be of utility in the treatment of leukemia and other cancers.","['Morad, Samy A F', 'Ryan, Terence E', 'Neufer, P Darrell', 'Zeczycki, Tonya N', 'Davis, Traci S', 'MacDougall, Matthew R', 'Fox, Todd E', 'Tan, Su-Fern', 'Feith, David J', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr', 'Kester, Mark', 'Claxton, David F', 'Barth, Brian M', 'Deering, Tye G', 'Cabot, Myles C']","['Morad SA', 'Ryan TE', 'Neufer PD', 'Zeczycki TN', 'Davis TS', 'MacDougall MR', 'Fox TE', 'Tan SF', 'Feith DJ', 'Loughran TP Jr', 'Kester M', 'Claxton DF', 'Barth BM', 'Deering TG', 'Cabot MC']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC.', 'Cancer Center, Division of Hematology Oncology, Department of Medicine Department of Pharmacology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, South Valley University, Qena, Egypt.', 'Cancer Center, Division of Hematology Oncology, Department of Medicine Oncology, Department of Medicine.', 'Cancer Center, Division of Hematology Oncology, Department of Medicine Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, South Valley University, Qena, Egypt.', 'Cancer Center, Division of Hematology Oncology, Department of Medicine.', 'Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, The Pennsylvania State University, Hershey, PA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Biomedical Sciences, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH.', 'East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC cabotm@ecu.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Lipid Res,Journal of lipid research,0376606,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Ceramides/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Synergism', 'Electron Transport Complex I/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tamoxifen/*administration & dosage']",2016/05/04 06:00,2017/08/25 06:00,['2016/05/04 06:00'],"['2016/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,J Lipid Res. 2016 Jul;57(7):1231-42. doi: 10.1194/jlr.M067389.

Mutations in human SERT are associated with psychiatric disorders and autism. Some of these mutations affect the regulation of SERT activity by cGMP-dependent phosphorylation. Here we provide direct evidence that this phosphorylation occurs at Thr276, predicted to lie near the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane helix 5 (TM5). Using membranes from HeLa cells expressing SERT and intact rat basophilic leukemia cells, we show that agents such as Na(+) and cocaine that stabilize outward-open conformations of SERT decreased phosphorylation and agents that stabilize inward-open conformations (e.g., 5-HT, ibogaine) increased phosphorylation. The opposing effects of the inhibitors cocaine and ibogaine were each reversed by an excess of the other inhibitor. Inhibition of phosphorylation by Na(+) and stimulation by ibogaine occurred at concentrations that induced outward opening and inward opening, respectively, as measured by the accessibility of cysteine residues in the extracellular and cytoplasmic permeation pathways, respectively. The results are consistent with a mechanism of SERT regulation that is activated by the transport of 5-HT, which increases the level of inward-open SERT and may lead to unwinding of the TM5 helix to allow phosphorylation.","['Zhang, Yuan-Wei', 'Turk, Benjamin E', 'Rudnick, Gary']","['Zhang YW', 'Turk BE', 'Rudnick G']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520 gary.rudnick@yale.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Cocaine/pharmacology', 'Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Ibogaine/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Conformation, alpha-Helical', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Serotonin/pharmacology', 'Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2016/05/04 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/05/04 06:00'],"['2016/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 May 17;113(20):E2776-83. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1603282113.

We assessed the feasibility of the AML profiler (Skyline Array) in genetic stratification of patients with de novo AML and compared the results with those obtained using the standard cytogenetic and molecular approach. Diagnostic bone marrow from 31 consecutive de novo AML cases was used to test MLL-PTD, FLT3-ITD and TKD, NPM1 and CEBPAdm mutations. Purified RNA was used to assess RUNX1-RUNX1T1, PML-RARalpha and CBFbeta-MYH11 rearrangements. RNA remnants underwent gene expression profiling analysis using the AML profiler, which detects chromosomal aberrations: t(8;21), t(15;17), inv(16), mutations (CEBPAdm, ABD-NPM1) and BAALC and EVI1 expression. Thirty cases were successfully analysed with both methods. Five cases had FLT3-ITD. In one case, a t(8;21) was correctly detected by both methods. Four cases had inv(16); in one, the RNA quality was unsatisfactory and it was not hybridized, and in the other three, the AML profiler detected the genetic lesion - this being a rare type I translocation in one case. Two cases with acute promyelocytic leukaemia were diagnosed by both methods. Results for NPM1 mutations were concordant in all but two cases (2/11, non-ABD mutations). Analysis of costs and turnaround times showed that the AML profiler was no more expensive than the conventional molecular approach. These results suggest that the AML profiler could be useful in multicentre trials to rapidly identify patients with AML with a good prognosis.

Here we report on a nationwide analysis of facial allograft donor surgery experience and long-term outcomes of the concomitantly recovered solid organs and their recipients. METHODS: There were 10 facial VCA procurements in organ donors between December 2008 and October 2014. We identified the population of subjects who received solid organs from these 10 donors using the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. We retrospectively reviewed operative characteristics, intraoperative parameters, and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: Six of 10 donor surgeries were performed at outside institutions, all on brain-dead donors. Mean operative duration for facial VCA recovery was 6.9 hours (range, 4-13.25 hours). A total of 36 solid organs were recovered and transplanted into 35 recipients. Survival rates for kidney and liver recipients were 100% and 90% at a median follow-up of 33 and 27.5 months, respectively (range, 6-72 months). Graft survival rates for kidneys and livers were 15 of 16 (94%) and 9 of 10 (90%), respectively.

Until recently, the gold standard was based on the utilization of rituximab combined with chemotherapy (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide), but patients often relapse. Next, with our better understanding of mAb engineering, anti-CD20 mAb therapy has evolved with the development of new mAb permitting significant clinical responses by improving pharmacokinetics, safety, activity and immunogenicity. Last but not least, the development of key tumoral tyrosine kinase inhibitors and their association with anti-CD20 mAb is a work in progress with promising results.","['Bagacean, Cristina', 'Zdrenghea, Mihnea', 'Tempescul, Adrian', 'Cristea, Victor', 'Renaudineau, Yves']","['Bagacean C', 'Zdrenghea M', 'Tempescul A', 'Cristea V', 'Renaudineau Y']","['Research Unit INSERM ESPRI, ERI29/EA2216 Immunotherapy & B Cell Diseases, Reseau epigenetique et Reseau canaux ioniques du Canceropole Grand Ouest, Labex IGO, European University of Brittany, Brest, France.', ""'Iuliu Hatieganu' University of Medicine & Pharmacy, 8 Babes Street, 400012, Cluj-Napoca, Romania."", ""'Iuliu Hatieganu' University of Medicine & Pharmacy, 8 Babes Street, 400012, Cluj-Napoca, Romania."", ""'Ion Chiricuta' Institute of Oncology, 34-36 Republicii Street, 400015 Cluj-Napoca, Romania."", 'Research Unit INSERM ESPRI, ERI29/EA2216 Immunotherapy & B Cell Diseases, Reseau epigenetique et Reseau canaux ioniques du Canceropole Grand Ouest, Labex IGO, European University of Brittany, Brest, France.', 'Department of Hematology, CHRU Morvan, Brest, France.', ""'Iuliu Hatieganu' University of Medicine & Pharmacy, 8 Babes Street, 400012, Cluj-Napoca, Romania."", 'Research Unit INSERM ESPRI, ERI29/EA2216 Immunotherapy & B Cell Diseases, Reseau epigenetique et Reseau canaux ioniques du Canceropole Grand Ouest, Labex IGO, European University of Brittany, Brest, France.', 'Laboratory of Immunology & Immunotherapy, CHRU Morvan, Brest, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunotherapy,Immunotherapy,101485158,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Rituximab/*therapeutic use']",2016/05/04 06:00,2017/06/27 06:00,['2016/05/04 06:00'],"['2016/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/27 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Immunotherapy. 2016 May;8(5):569-81. doi: 10.2217/imt-2015-0015.,10.2217/imt-2015-0015 [doi],,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD20', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*immunotherapy', '*obinutuzumab', '*ofatumumab', '*rituximab']",,['10.2217/imt-2015-0015 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In zebrafish, the lack of cell surface antibodies has compelled researchers to use fluorescent transgenic reporter lines to label specific blood cell fractions. However, these approaches are limited by the availability of transgenic lines and fluorescent protein combinations that can be distinguished. Here, we have transcriptionally profiled single hematopoietic cells from zebrafish to define erythroid, myeloid, B, and T cell lineages. We also used our approach to identify hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and a novel NK-lysin 4(+) cell type, representing a putative cytotoxic T/NK cell. Our platform also quantified hematopoietic defects in rag2(E450fs) mutant fish and showed that these fish have reduced T cells with a subsequent expansion of NK-lysin 4(+) cells and myeloid cells. These data suggest compensatory regulation of the innate immune system in rag2(E450fs) mutant zebrafish.

However, the acquired resistance occurred in cancer cells limits the clinical application of cisplatin. MCL-1, which is an important member in the pro-survival Bcl-2 family, plays a critical role in multidrug resistance (MDR). The aim of the present study is to investigate the value of Pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor as sensitizer for the chemotherapy of cisplatin-resistant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. We found the obatoclax but not the ABT-737 significantly decreased the IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) of cisplatin in cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the mechanism of obatoclax-promoted cell death induced by cisplatin was dependent on the inhibition of MCL-1, which couldn't be inhibited by ABT-737 but is the target of obatoclax. Moreover, inhibition of MCL-1 recovered the function of NOXA and BAK in cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cells, leading to the promotion of mitochondrial apoptosis induced by cisplatin. Interestingly, our date indicated the obatoclax also reversed the cross-resistance in cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cells. Therefore, we demonstrated that the targeted therapy with MCL-1 inhibitors, such as obatoclax, may represent a novel strategy for cancer therapy.","['Ma, Jun', 'Zhao, Zhenxian', 'Wu, Kaiming', 'Xu, Zhe', 'Liu, Kuanzhi']","['Ma J', 'Zhao Z', 'Wu K', 'Xu Z', 'Liu K']","['Thoracic Surgery Department, 1st Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen Univesity, Guangzhou 510080, China.', 'Pancreato-Biliary Surgery Department, 1st Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen Univesity, Guangzhou 510080, China.', 'Colorectal Surgery Department, 1st Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen Univesity, Guangzhou 510080, China.', 'Division of Cardiac Surgery, 1st Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen Univesity, Guangzhou 510080, China.', 'Department of Anaesthesiology, 1st Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen Univesity, Guangzhou 510080, China.

Migratory and self-renewal capabilities are integral components of invasion, metastasis and recurrence of TNBC. Elevated hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) expression is associated with aggressiveness of cancer. Nonetheless, how HIF-1alpha expression is regulated and how HIF-1alpha induces aggressive phenotype are not completely understood in TNBC. The cytotoxic effects of farnesyltransferase (FTase) inhibitors (FTIs) have been studied in cancer and leukemia cells. In contrast, the effect of FTIs on HIF-1alpha expression has not yet been studied. Here, we show that clinically relevant low-dose FTI, tipifarnib (300 nM), decreased HIF-1alpha expression, migration and tumorsphere formation in human MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells under a normoxic condition. In contrast, the low-dose FTIs did not inhibit cell growth and activity of the Ras pathway in MDA-MB 231 cells. Tipifarnib-induced decrease in HIF-1alpha expression was associated with amelioration of the Warburg effect, hypermetabolic state, increases in Snail expression and ATP release, and suppressed E-cadherin expression, major contributors to invasion, metastasis and recurrence of TBNC. These data suggest that FTIs may be capable of ameliorating the aggressive phenotype of TNBC by suppressing the HIF-1alpha-Snail pathway. J. Cell. Physiol. 232: 192-201, 2017.

Master regulatory transcription factors are vital components of the machinery that transduce these stimuli into cellular responses. This is exemplified by the GATA family of transcription factors that establish cell type-specific genetic networks and control the development and homeostasis of systems including blood, vascular, adipose, and cardiac. Dysregulated GATA factor activity/expression underlies anemia, immunodeficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and leukemia. Parameters governing the capacity of a GATA factor expressed in multiple cell types to generate cell type-specific transcriptomes include selective coregulator usage and target gene-specific chromatin states. As knowledge of GATA-1 mechanisms in erythroid cells constitutes a solid foundation, we will focus predominantly on GATA-1, while highlighting principles that can be extrapolated to other master regulators. GATA-1 interacts with ubiquitous and lineage-restricted transcription factors, chromatin modifying/remodeling enzymes, and other coregulators to activate or repress transcription and to maintain preexisting transcriptional states. Major unresolved issues include: how does a GATA factor selectively utilize diverse coregulators; do distinct epigenetic landscapes and nuclear microenvironments of target genes dictate coregulator requirements; and do gene cohorts controlled by a common coregulator ensemble function in common pathways.

Scl specifies lateral plate mesoderm to a hematopoietic fate and establishes boundaries by inhibiting the cardiac lineage. A combinatorial interaction between Scl and Vegfa/Flk1 sets in motion the first wave of primitive hematopoiesis. Subsequently, definitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) emerge from the embryo proper via an endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition controlled by Runx1, acting with Scl and Gata2. Past this stage, Scl in steady state HSCs is redundant with Lyl1, a highly homologous factor. However, Scl is haploinsufficient in stress response, when a rare subpopulation of HSCs with very long term repopulating capacity is called into action. SCL activates transcription by recruiting a core complex on DNA that necessarily includes E2A/HEB, GATA1-3, LIM-only proteins LMO1/2, LDB1, and an extended complex comprising ETO2, RUNX1, ERG, or FLI1. These interactions confer multifunctionality to a complex that can control cell proliferation in erythroid progenitors or commitment to terminal differentiation through variations in single component. Ectopic SCL and LMO1/2 expression in immature thymocytes activates of a stem cell gene network and reprogram cells with a finite lifespan into self-renewing preleukemic stem cells (pre-LSCs), an initiating event in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias. Interestingly, fate conversion of fibroblasts to hematoendothelial cells requires not only Scl and Lmo2 but also Gata2, Runx1, and Erg, indicating a necessary collaboration between these transcription factors for hematopoietic reprogramming. Nonetheless, full reprogramming into self-renewing multipotent HSCs may require additional factors and most likely, a permissive microenvironment.","['Hoang, T', 'Lambert, J A', 'Martin, R']","['Hoang T', 'Lambert JA', 'Martin R']","['Laboratory of Hematopoiesis and Leukemia, Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.

While thousands to millions of any given cis-element resides in a genome, how transcriptional regulators select these sites and how site attributes dictate functional output is not well understood. An instructive system to address this problem involves the GATA family of transcription factors that control vital developmental and physiological processes and are linked to multiple human pathologies. Although GATA factors bind DNA motifs harboring the sequence GATA, only a very small subset of these abundant motifs are occupied in genomes. Mechanistic studies revealed a unique configuration of a GATA factor-regulated cis-element consisting of an E-box and a downstream GATA motif separated by a short DNA spacer. GATA-1- or GATA-2-containing multiprotein complexes at these composite elements control transcription of genes critical for hematopoietic stem cell emergence in the mammalian embryo, hematopoietic progenitor cell regulation, and erythroid cell maturation. Other constituents of the complex include the basic helix-loop-loop transcription factor Scl/TAL1, its heterodimeric partner E2A, and the Lim domain proteins LMO2 and LDB1. This chapter reviews the structure/function of E-box-GATA composite cis-elements, which collectively constitute an important sector of the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell cistrome.","['Hewitt, K J', 'Johnson, K D', 'Gao, X', 'Keles, S', 'Bresnick, E H']","['Hewitt KJ', 'Johnson KD', 'Gao X', 'Keles S', 'Bresnick EH']","['UW-Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, United States; UW-Madison Blood Research Program, Madison, WI, United States.', 'UW-Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, United States; UW-Madison Blood Research Program, Madison, WI, United States.', 'UW-Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, United States; UW-Madison Blood Research Program, Madison, WI, United States.', 'University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, United States.', 'UW-Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, United States; UW-Madison Blood Research Program, Madison, WI, United States.

RUNX1 mutations were found in 245 of 2439 (10%) patients; were almost mutually exclusive of AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities; and they co-occurred with a complex pattern of gene mutations, frequently involving mutations in epigenetic modifiers (ASXL1, IDH2, KMT2A, EZH2), components of the spliceosome complex (SRSF2, SF3B1) and STAG2, PHF6, BCOR. RUNX1 mutations were associated with older age (16-59 years: 8.5%; 60 years: 15.1%), male gender, more immature morphology and secondary AML evolving from myelodysplastic syndrome. In univariable analyses, RUNX1 mutations were associated with inferior event-free (EFS, P<0.0001), relapse-free (RFS, P=0.0007) and overall survival (OS, P<0.0001) in all patients, remaining significant when age was considered. In multivariable analysis, RUNX1 mutations predicted for inferior EFS (P=0.01). The effect of co-mutation varied by partner gene, where patients with the secondary genotypes RUNX1(mut)/ASXL1(mut) (OS, P=0.004), RUNX1(mut)/SRSF2(mut) (OS, P=0.007) and RUNX1(mut)/PHF6(mut) (OS, P=0.03) did significantly worse, whereas patients with the genotype RUNX1(mut)/IDH2(mut) (OS, P=0.04) had a better outcome. In conclusion, RUNX1-mutated AML is associated with a complex mutation cluster and is correlated with distinct clinico-pathologic features and inferior prognosis.","['Gaidzik, V I', 'Teleanu, V', 'Papaemmanuil, E', 'Weber, D', 'Paschka, P', 'Hahn, J', 'Wallrabenstein, T', 'Kolbinger, B', 'Kohne, C H', 'Horst, H A', 'Brossart, P', 'Held, G', 'Kundgen, A', 'Ringhoffer, M', 'Gotze, K', 'Rummel, M', 'Gerstung, M', 'Campbell, P', 'Kraus, J M', 'Kestler, H A', 'Thol, F', 'Heuser, M', 'Schlegelberger, B', 'Ganser, A', 'Bullinger, L', 'Schlenk, R F', 'Dohner, K', 'Dohner, H']","['Gaidzik VI', 'Teleanu V', 'Papaemmanuil E', 'Weber D', 'Paschka P', 'Hahn J', 'Wallrabenstein T', 'Kolbinger B', 'Kohne CH', 'Horst HA', 'Brossart P', 'Held G', 'Kundgen A', 'Ringhoffer M', 'Gotze K', 'Rummel M', 'Gerstung M', 'Campbell P', 'Kraus JM', 'Kestler HA', 'Thol F', 'Heuser M', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Ganser A', 'Bullinger L', 'Schlenk RF', 'Dohner K', 'Dohner H']","['Klinik fur Innere Medizin III, Universitatsklinikum Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin III, Universitatsklinikum Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Cancer Genome Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin III, Universitatsklinikum Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin III, Universitatsklinikum Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin III, Universitatsklinikum Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin III, Universitatsklinikum Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin III, Universitatsklinikum Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie und Onkologie, Klinikum Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik III, Universitatsklinikum Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin I, Universitatskliniken des Saarlandes, Homburg, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und Klinische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik III, Stadtisches Klinikum Karlsruhe gGmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany.', 'III.

Different technologies have been established for patient screening. Various next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms facilitating sensitive detection and quantitative monitoring of mutations in the ABL1-kinase domain (KD) have been introduced recently, and are expected to become the preferred technology in the future. However, broad clinical implementation of NGS methods has been hampered by the limited accessibility at different centers and the current costs of analysis which may not be regarded as readily affordable for routine diagnostic monitoring. It is therefore of interest to determine whether NGS platforms can be adequately substituted by other methodological approaches. We have tested three different techniques including pyrosequencing, LD (ligation-dependent)-PCR and NGS in a series of peripheral blood specimens from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients carrying single or multiple mutations in the BCR-ABL1 KD. The proliferation kinetics of mutant subclones in serial specimens obtained during the course of TKI-treatment revealed similar profiles via all technical approaches, but individual specimens showed statistically significant differences between NGS and the other methods tested. The observations indicate that different approaches to detection and quantification of mutant subclones may be applicable for the monitoring of clonal kinetics, but careful calibration of each method is required for accurate size assessment of mutant subclones at individual time points.","['Preuner, Sandra', 'Barna, Agnes', 'Frommlet, Florian', 'Czurda, Stefan', 'Konstantin, Byrgazov', 'Alikian, Mary', 'Machova Polakova, Katerina', 'Sacha, Tomasz', 'Richter, Johan', 'Lion, Thomas', 'Gabriel, Christian']","['Preuner S', 'Barna A', 'Frommlet F', 'Czurda S', 'Konstantin B', 'Alikian M', 'Machova Polakova K', 'Sacha T', 'Richter J', 'Lion T', 'Gabriel C']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Zimmermannplatz 10, A-1090 Vienna, Austria. sandra.preuner@ccri.at."", 'Red Cross Transfusion Service for Upper Austria, A-4017 Linz, Austria. agnes.barna@o.roteskreuz.at.', 'Department for Medical Statistics, Medical University of Vienna, A-1090 Vienna, Austria. florian.frommlet@meduniwien.ac.at.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Zimmermannplatz 10, A-1090 Vienna, Austria. stefan.czurda@ccri.at."", ""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Zimmermannplatz 10, A-1090 Vienna, Austria. konstantin.byrgazov@ccri.at."", 'Imperial Molecular Pathology Laboratory, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare National Health Service (NHS) Trust, London W12 0HS, UK. m.alikian@imperial.ac.uk.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, 128 20 Prague, Czech Republic. katerina.machova@lf1.cuni.cz.', 'Hematology Department, Jagiellonian University, 31-501 Krakow, Poland. sachatom@gmail.com.', 'Section for Hematology, Department of Medicine, University Hospital of Lund, 221 00 Lund, Sweden. johan.richter@med.lu.se.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Zimmermannplatz 10, A-1090 Vienna, Austria. thomas.lion@ccri.at."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Medical University Vienna, A-1090 Vienna, Austria. thomas.lion@ccri.at.', 'Red Cross Transfusion Service for Upper Austria, A-4017 Linz, Austria. christian.gabriel@o.roteskreuz.at.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,"['Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'DNA/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/*genetics', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Sequence Analysis, DNA']",2016/05/03 06:00,2017/02/17 06:00,['2016/05/03 06:00'],"['2016/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/20 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/17 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2016 Apr 29;17(5). pii: ijms17050642. doi: 10.3390/ijms17050642.,10.3390/ijms17050642 [doi] E642 [pii],20160429,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",PMC4881468,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'CML', 'LD-PCR', 'NGS', 'pyrosequencing', 'quantitative analysis of mutant subclones']",,"['ijms17050642 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms17050642 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, independent studies indicated either neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) or Tissue Factor (TF) involvement in cancer biology and associated thrombosis. However, their individual or combined role in colonic adenocarcinoma is still unexplored. METHODS: Colectomy tissue specimens and variable number of draining lymph nodes were obtained from ten patients with adenocarcinoma of the colon. NETs deposition and neutrophil presence as well as TF expression were examined by immunostaining. The effect of NETs on cancer cell growth was studied in in vitro co-cultures of Caco-2 cell line and acute myeloid leukemia primary cells. Proliferation and apoptosis/necrosis of cancer cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: TF-bearing NETs and neutrophil localization were prominent in tumour sections and the respective metastatic lymph nodes. Interestingly, neutrophil infiltration and NETs concentration were gradually reduced from the tumour mass to the distal margin. The in vitro-generated NETs impeded growth of cancer cell cultures by inducing apoptosis and/or inhibiting proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: These data support further the role of neutrophils and NETs in cancer biology. We also suggest their involvement on cancer cell growth.","['Arelaki, Stella', 'Arampatzioglou, Athanasios', 'Kambas, Konstantinos', 'Papagoras, Charalampos', 'Miltiades, Paraskevi', 'Angelidou, Iliana', 'Mitsios, Alexandros', 'Kotsianidis, Ioannis', 'Skendros, Panagiotis', 'Sivridis, Efthimios', 'Maroulakou, Ioanna', 'Giatromanolaki, Alexandra', 'Ritis, Konstantinos']","['Arelaki S', 'Arampatzioglou A', 'Kambas K', 'Papagoras C', 'Miltiades P', 'Angelidou I', 'Mitsios A', 'Kotsianidis I', 'Skendros P', 'Sivridis E', 'Maroulakou I', 'Giatromanolaki A', 'Ritis K']","['Department of Pathology, University General Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Genetics, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Department of Pathology, University General Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Genetics, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Department of Pathology, University General Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Caco-2 Cells', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*immunology/*pathology', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*immunology/*pathology', 'Extracellular Traps/immunology/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Neutrophil Infiltration/*immunology/*physiology', 'Neutrophils/*immunology/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2016/05/03 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2016/05/03 06:00'],"['2016/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 May 2;11(5):e0154484. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0154484. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0154484 [doi],20160502,,PMC4852909,,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0154484 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-08808 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the cytotoxic action of selected CD56+ cell subpopulations against a human chronic myeloid leukaemia (K562) cell line. RESULTS: After immunomagnetic selection of the CD56+ cell fraction, NK bright cells (CD3-CD56+ bright) and two subsets of NK-like T cells (CD3+CD56+), called NK-like T CD56 dim and NK-like T CD56 bright, could be identified. The cytotoxic effect against K562 cells was mainly exerted by the NK bright subpopulation and resulted to be inversely correlated with the percentage of NK-like T CD56 dim cells in the culture. The lytic action appeared to be independent of cell degranulation as suggested by the lack of change in the expression of CD107a.

RECENT FINDINGS: NOTCH mutations arise in a broad spectrum of lymphoid malignancies and are increasingly scrutinized as putative therapeutic targets. In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), NOTCH1 mutations affect the extracellular negative regulatory region and lead to constitutive Notch activation, although mutated receptors remain sensitive to Notch ligands. Other NOTCH1 mutations in T-ALL and NOTCH1/2 mutations in multiple B-cell malignancies truncate the C-terminal proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine (S), threonine (T)-rich (PEST) domain, leading to decreased Notch degradation after ligand-mediated activation. Thus, targeting Notch ligand-receptor interactions could provide therapeutic benefits. In addition, we discuss recent reports on clinical testing of Notch inhibitors in T-ALL that influenced contemporary thinking on the challenges of targeting Notch in cancer. We review advances in the laboratory to address these challenges in regards to drug targets, the Notch-driven metabolome, and the sophisticated protein-protein interactions at Notch-dependent superenhancers that underlie oncogenic Notch functions. SUMMARY: Notch signaling is a recurrent oncogenic pathway in multiple T- and B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.

Gain-of-function mutations in the genes encoding CBM proteins or their upstream regulators are associated with lymphoid malignancies, whereas loss-of-function mutations lead to immunodeficiency. This review reports on recent findings advancing our understanding of how CBM proteins contribute to malignant and nonmalignant hematological diseases in humans. RECENT FINDINGS: Somatic gain-of-function mutations of CARMA1 (also known as CARD11), originally described for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, have recently been identified in patients with acute T-cell leukemia/lymphoma or Sezary syndrome, and in patients with a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder known as BENTA. Loss-of-function mutations of CARMA1 and MALT1, on the other hand, have been reported to underlie human immunodeficiency. Lately, it has become clear that CBM-dependent signaling promotes lymphomagenesis not only via NF-kappaB activation, but also via the AP-1 family of transcription factors. The identification of new substrates of the protease MALT1 and the characterization of mice expressing catalytically inactive MALT1 have deepened our understanding of how the CBM complex controls lymphocyte proliferation through promoting MALT1's protease activity. SUMMARY: The discovery of CARMA1 gain-of-function mutations in T-cell malignancies and BENTA patients, as well as the association of CARMA1 and MALT1 mutations with human immunodeficiency highlight the importance of CBM proteins in the regulation of lymphocyte functions, and suggest that the protease activity of MALT1 might be targeted to treat specific lymphoid malignancies.","['Juilland, Melanie', 'Thome, Margot']","['Juilland M', 'Thome M']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Lausanne, Epalinges, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein', 'CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism', 'Guanylate Cyclase/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma Translocation 1 Protein', 'Multiprotein Complexes/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism']",2016/05/03 06:00,2017/10/20 06:00,['2016/05/03 06:00'],"['2016/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2016 Jul;23(4):402-9. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000257.,10.1097/MOH.0000000000000257 [doi],,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein)', '0 (BCL10 protein, human)', '0 (CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (MALT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma Translocation 1 Protein)', 'EC 4.6.1.2 (CARD11 protein, human)', 'EC 4.6.1.2 (Guanylate Cyclase)']",PMC4900422,,,,['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000257 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review highlights experimental and clinical evidence for a role of ILC in GVHD pathogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS: ILC are well known for their role in epithelial homeostasis and innate immunity. In addition, recent studies identified ILC as architects of intestinal responses to tissue damage after experimental radio and chemotherapy. Group 3 ILC, and their signature cytokine IL-22, can enhance intestinal stem cell regeneration and protect the stem cell niche from damage during experimental HSCT. Moreover, in leukemia patients undergoing HSCT conditioning, appearance of activated group 3 ILC prior to transplant is correlated to reduced incidence of acute GVHD. SUMMARY: ILC have a profound impact on the recovery from tissue damage and severity of GVHD in experimental models. Together with the available data from leukemia patients, this argues for in-depth analysis of the mechanisms of ILC function and the translation of experimental findings to clinical application. Ultimately, control of ILC activation, or of the cytokines they produce, could be employed to reduce GVHD lesion in patients receiving allogeneic HSCT.","['Karrich, Julien J', 'Cupedo, Tom']","['Karrich JJ', 'Cupedo T']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia/complications/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2016/05/03 06:00,2017/10/20 06:00,['2016/05/03 06:00'],"['2016/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2016 Jul;23(4):410-5. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000262.,10.1097/MOH.0000000000000262 [doi],,['0 (Cytokines)'],,,,,['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000262 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The IMDCs morphologically and phenotypically resembled human immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (IMMoDCs). However, the permissiveness of IMDCs to DENV2 was lower than that of IMMoDCs. RT-PCR arrays showed that a group of type I interferon (IFN) -inducible genes, especially IFIT1, IFITM1, and IFI27, were significantly up-regulated in IMMoDCs but not in IMDCs after DENV2 infection. Further investigation revealed that IFIT genes were spontaneously expressed at both transcriptional and protein levels in the naive IMDCs but not in the naive IMMoDCs. It is possible that the poor permissiveness of IMDCs to DENV2 was a result of the high basal levels of IFIT proteins. We conclude that the IMDC model, although less permissive to DENV2, is a useful platform for studying the suppression mechanism of DENV2 and we expand the knowledge of cellular factors that modulate DENV2 infection in the human body.","['Zhang, Jingshu', 'Sze, Daniel Man-Yuen', 'Yung, Benjamin Yat-Ming', 'Tang, Petrus', 'Chen, Wei-June', 'Chan, Kwok-Hung', 'Leung, Polly Hang-Mei']","['Zhang J', 'Sze DM', 'Yung BY', 'Tang P', 'Chen WJ', 'Chan KH', 'Leung PH']","['Department of Health Technology and Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China.', 'HKU-Pasteur Research Pole, School of Public Health, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Health Technology and Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China.', 'School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Health Technology and Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China.', 'Molecular Regulation and Bioinformatics Laboratory, Department of Public Health and Parasitology, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Tao-Yuan, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Chang Gung University, Kwei-San, Tao-Yuan, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Chang Gung University, Kwei-San, Tao-Yuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Public Health and Parasitology, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Kwei-San, Tao-Yuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Health Technology and Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Antigens, Differentiation/genetics/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Dendritic Cells/physiology/*virology', 'Dengue/genetics/*immunology', 'Dengue Virus/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Interferon Type I/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/physiology/*virology', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Transcriptome', 'Up-Regulation']",2016/05/03 06:00,2017/05/06 06:00,['2016/05/03 06:00'],"['2015/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/02 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Immunology. 2016 Aug;148(4):363-76. doi: 10.1111/imm.12615.,10.1111/imm.12615 [doi],,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (IFI27 protein, human)', '0 (IFIT1 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (leu-13 antigen)']",PMC4948034,['NOTNLM'],"['*MUTZ-3', '*dendritic cells', '*dengue virus']",,['10.1111/imm.12615 [doi]'],"['GENBANK/NM_000395', 'GENBANK/NM_000566', 'GENBANK/NM_001548', 'GENBANK/NM_001549', 'GENBANK/NM_001565', 'GENBANK/NM_001572', 'GENBANK/NM_001992', 'GENBANK/NM_002038', 'GENBANK/NM_002053', 'GENBANK/NM_002198', 'GENBANK/NM_002199', 'GENBANK/NM_002201', 'GENBANK/NM_002463', 'GENBANK/NM_002534', 'GENBANK/NM_002535', 'GENBANK/NM_002744', 'GENBANK/NM_002759', 'GENBANK/NM_002838', 'GENBANK/NM_003641', 'GENBANK/NM_003877', 'GENBANK/NM_004219', 'GENBANK/NM_004688', 'GENBANK/NM_005101', 'GENBANK/NM_005419', 'GENBANK/NM_005531', 'GENBANK/NM_005532', 'GENBANK/NM_005902', 'GENBANK/NM_006084', 'GENBANK/NM_006435', 'GENBANK/NM_007315', 'GENBANK/NM_018191', 'GENBANK/NM_022168']",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main predictors of mortality in patients with AML reported in the literature were analyzed in our population. The primary objective was to analyze overall survival. The secondary objective was to determine treatment-related mortality, defined as death within eight weeks of starting treatment. It was designed as a retrospective study. A total of 133 treatment naive patients were included, from January 1991 to August 2014. The adjusted analysis showed that the most important variables to determine overall survival were the WBC count = 30 000 at diagnosis [adjusted HR 2.19 (1.06-4.53), p = 0.03)] and the Performance Status (ECOG) 3 or 4 [aHR 4.63 (1.69-12.68), p < 0.001)]. Performance Status 3-4 was the only variable that conditioned treatment related mortality, showing in the univariate analysis an OR 5.44 (CI 1.93-15.28, p < 0.001). It was also the only variable that kept its statistical power in the multivariate analysis adjusted OR (aOR) 12.40 (IC 1.12-137.17, p = 0.04). The inherent poor outcome in elderly patients diagnosed with AML is not fully understood. The best way of assessing these elderly patients should probably include not only age but the best way of assessing these elderly patients should probably include not only age but laboratory, genetic and molecular studies. Especially designed comorbidity and fragility indices should be included, along with functional status. Leukocytosis and poor quality of life were identified as the most powerfull factors for predicting mortality in our study.","['Gimenez Conca, Alberto D', 'Arbelbide, Jorge A', 'Schutz, Natalia', 'Otero, Victoria', 'Fantl, Dorotea', 'Ferreyro, Bruno']","['Gimenez Conca AD', 'Arbelbide JA', 'Schutz N', 'Otero V', 'Fantl D', 'Ferreyro B']","['Seccion Hematologia, Servicio de Clinica Medica, Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, Argentina.

We report the outcomes of 82 patients (median age 61 years) treated with the RFC combination. Twenty-five patients were treatment-naive. RFC was administered every 4 weeks, for a median of five cycles. At treatment discontinuation, the overall response rate was 85.4%. The responses improved after treatment discontinuation in 25 patients, with a median time to best response achievement of 10.8 months, raising the major response rate (PR, VGPR and CR) from 64.6% to 76.8%. With a median follow-up of 47 months, the median progression-free survival time had not been reached (67% PFS at 48 months) and was influenced by age and treatment status before RFC. Likewise, the median time to next therapy had not been reached. Two cases of myelodysplastic syndrome/AML and 3 cases of transformation to aggressive lymphoma occurred. Thirteen patients died. The 3-year overall survival rate was 90%. Long-lasting cytopenias occurred in 19 patients. The RFC combination thus gave a high response rate and durable responses, even in heavily treatment-experienced patients.

PROCEDURE: This retrospective study examined the prognostic significance of CXCR4+ in pediatric AML patients enrolled in the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group AML-05 study. RESULTS: In the total cohort (n = 248), no significant differences were observed between CXCR4+ patients (n = 81) and CXCR4- patients (n = 167) in terms of 3-year overall survival (OS) (69.4% vs. 75.2%, P = 0.44). However, there was a significant difference in 3-year OS between CXCR4+ and CXCR4- patients in the low-risk (LR) group (n = 93; 79.2% vs. 98.3%, P = 0.007). CXCR4+ patients in the t(8;21) AML without KIT mutation group had a significantly worse 3-year OS than CXCR4- patients (n = 44; 76.1% vs. 100.0%, P = 0.01). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified CXCR4+ as a poor prognostic factor for OS in LR AML patients (hazard ratio, 11.47; P = 0.01). Consistent with the data for survival analysis, CXCR4+ patients in the t(8;21) AML group had a higher incidence of splenomegaly than CXCR4- patients (25.9% vs. 5.9%, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CXCR4+ is a poor prognostic factor for LR patients, particularly t(8;21) patients without KIT mutation. The poor outcome was only applicable to OS, not relapse-free survival (RFS); thus, CXCR4+ may be associated with a poor prognosis after recurrence. Intensive therapy, including administration of CXCR4 antagonists, may be promising for pediatric AML patients with LR.","['Matsuo, Hidemasa', 'Nakamura, Naomi', 'Tomizawa, Daisuke', 'Saito, Akiko Moriya', 'Kiyokawa, Nobutaka', 'Horibe, Keizo', 'Nishinaka-Arai, Yoko', 'Tokumasu, Mayu', 'Itoh, Hiroshi', 'Kamikubo, Yasuhiko', 'Nakayama, Hideki', 'Kinoshita, Akitoshi', 'Taga, Takashi', 'Tawa, Akio', 'Taki, Tomohiko', 'Tanaka, Shiro', 'Adachi, Souichi']","['Matsuo H', 'Nakamura N', 'Tomizawa D', 'Saito AM', 'Kiyokawa N', 'Horibe K', 'Nishinaka-Arai Y', 'Tokumasu M', 'Itoh H', 'Kamikubo Y', 'Nakayama H', 'Kinoshita A', 'Taga T', 'Tawa A', 'Taki T', 'Tanaka S', 'Adachi S']","['Department of Human Health Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', ""Division of Leukemia and Lymphoma, Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Clinical Research Center, National Nagoya Hospital, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Nagoya Hospital, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Application, Center for iPS Cell Research and Application, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Hospital Organization, Fukuoka-Higashi Medical Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Osaka National Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Diagnostics and Therapeutics, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacoepidemiology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Splenomegaly/pathology', 'Survival Analysis']",2016/05/03 06:00,2017/03/28 06:00,['2016/05/03 06:00'],"['2016/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/28 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Aug;63(8):1394-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26035.

These mutations recurrently affect specific amino acid residues, leading to perturbed normal splice site and exon recognition. Spliceosomal gene mutations are always heterozygous and rarely occur together with one another, suggesting that cells may tolerate only a partial deviation from normal splicing activity. To test this hypothesis, we engineered mice to express a mutated allele of serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (Srsf2(P95H))-which commonly occurs in individuals with MDS and AML-in an inducible, hemizygous manner in hematopoietic cells. These mice rapidly succumbed to fatal bone marrow failure, demonstrating that Srsf2-mutated cells depend on the wild-type Srsf2 allele for survival. In the context of leukemia, treatment with the spliceosome inhibitor E7107 (refs. 7,8) resulted in substantial reductions in leukemic burden, specifically in isogenic mouse leukemias and patient-derived xenograft AMLs carrying spliceosomal mutations. Whereas E7107 treatment of mice resulted in widespread intron retention and cassette exon skipping in leukemic cells regardless of Srsf2 genotype, the magnitude of splicing inhibition following E7107 treatment was greater in Srsf2-mutated than in Srsf2-wild-type leukemia, consistent with the differential effect of E7107 on survival. Collectively, these data provide genetic and pharmacologic evidence that leukemias with spliceosomal gene mutations are preferentially susceptible to additional splicing perturbations in vivo as compared to leukemias without such mutations. Modulation of spliceosome function may thus provide a new therapeutic avenue in genetically defined subsets of individuals with MDS or AML.","['Lee, Stanley Chun-Wei', 'Dvinge, Heidi', 'Kim, Eunhee', 'Cho, Hana', 'Micol, Jean-Baptiste', 'Chung, Young Rock', 'Durham, Benjamin H', 'Yoshimi, Akihide', 'Kim, Young Joon', 'Thomas, Michael', 'Lobry, Camille', 'Chen, Chun-Wei', 'Pastore, Alessandro', 'Taylor, Justin', 'Wang, Xujun', 'Krivtsov, Andrei', 'Armstrong, Scott A', 'Palacino, James', 'Buonamici, Silvia', 'Smith, Peter G', 'Bradley, Robert K', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar']","['Lee SC', 'Dvinge H', 'Kim E', 'Cho H', 'Micol JB', 'Chung YR', 'Durham BH', 'Yoshimi A', 'Kim YJ', 'Thomas M', 'Lobry C', 'Chen CW', 'Pastore A', 'Taylor J', 'Wang X', 'Krivtsov A', 'Armstrong SA', 'Palacino J', 'Buonamici S', 'Smith PG', 'Bradley RK', 'Abdel-Wahab O']","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Computational Biology Program, Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Basic Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U1170, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'H3 Biomedicine, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Computational Biology Program, Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Basic Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/genetics', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Failure Disorders', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Epoxy Compounds/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Knock-In Techniques', 'Hemizygote', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Macrolides/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'RNA Splicing/drug effects/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors/*genetics', 'Spliceosomes/*genetics']",2016/05/03 06:00,2017/08/08 06:00,['2016/05/03 06:00'],"['2016/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2016 Jun;22(6):672-8. doi: 10.1038/nm.4097.

However, alpha-ESA moderately inhibited phytohemagglutinin-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC; IC50 = 31.0 microM). These results suggest that BGSE-derived alpha-ESA has potential as a functional food constituent because of its activity against ATL, particularly against ED cells. Moreover, alpha-ESA might be effective for the prevention of moderate adverse effects of ATL on normal T cells.","['Kai, Hisahiro', 'Akamatsu, Ena', 'Torii, Eri', 'Kodama, Hiroko', 'Yukizaki, Chizuko', 'Akagi, Isao', 'Ino, Hisatoshi', 'Sakakibara, Yoichi', 'Suiko, Masahito', 'Yamamoto, Ikuo', 'Okayama, Akihiko', 'Morishita, Kazuhiro', 'Kataoka, Hiroaki', 'Matsuno, Koji']","['Kai H', 'Akamatsu E', 'Torii E', 'Kodama H', 'Yukizaki C', 'Akagi I', 'Ino H', 'Sakakibara Y', 'Suiko M', 'Yamamoto I', 'Okayama A', 'Morishita K', 'Kataoka H', 'Matsuno K']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Health Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University of Health and Welfare, 1714-1 Yoshino-machi, Nobeoka, Miyazaki 882-8508, Japan. hkai@phoenix.ac.jp.', 'Research Promotion Bureau for Collaboration of Regional Entities, Miyazaki Prefectural Industrial Support Foundation, 16500-2 Higashi-Kaminaka, Sadowara-cho, Miyazaki, Miyazaki 880-0303, Japan. hkai@phoenix.ac.jp.', 'Research Promotion Bureau for Collaboration of Regional Entities, Miyazaki Prefectural Industrial Support Foundation, 16500-2 Higashi-Kaminaka, Sadowara-cho, Miyazaki, Miyazaki 880-0303, Japan. rojopino@mac.com.', 'Research Promotion Bureau for Collaboration of Regional Entities, Miyazaki Prefectural Industrial Support Foundation, 16500-2 Higashi-Kaminaka, Sadowara-cho, Miyazaki, Miyazaki 880-0303, Japan. ushio16@fc.miyazaki-u.ac.jp.', 'Research Promotion Bureau for Collaboration of Regional Entities, Miyazaki Prefectural Industrial Support Foundation, 16500-2 Higashi-Kaminaka, Sadowara-cho, Miyazaki, Miyazaki 880-0303, Japan. yukizaki@iri.pref.miyazaki.jp.', 'Miyazaki Prefectural Food Research and Development Center, 16500-2 Higashi-Kaminaka, Sadowara-cho, Miyazaki, Miyazaki 880-0303, Japan. yukizaki@iri.pref.miyazaki.jp.', 'Miyazaki Prefectural Food Research and Development Center, 16500-2 Higashi-Kaminaka, Sadowara-cho, Miyazaki, Miyazaki 880-0303, Japan. yukizaki@iri.pref.miyazaki.jp.', 'Research Promotion Bureau for Collaboration of Regional Entities, Miyazaki Prefectural Industrial Support Foundation, 16500-2 Higashi-Kaminaka, Sadowara-cho, Miyazaki, Miyazaki 880-0303, Japan. akagi046@chem.agri.kagoshima-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Biochemical Science and Technology, Faculty of Agriculture, Kagoshima University, 1-21-24 Korimoto, Kagoshima, Kagoshima 890-0065, Japan. akagi046@chem.agri.kagoshima-u.ac.jp.', 'Miyazaki Agricultural Experiment Station, 5805 Shimonaka, Sadowara-cho, Miyazaki, Miyazaki 880-0212, Japan. ino-hisatoshi@pref.miyazaki.lg.jp.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Applied Biosciences, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Miyazaki, 1-1 Gakuenkibanadai-nishi, Miyazaki, Miyazaki 889-2192, Japan. ysakaki@cc.miyazaki-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Applied Biosciences, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Miyazaki, 1-1 Gakuenkibanadai-nishi, Miyazaki, Miyazaki 889-2192, Japan. msuiko@cc.miyazaki-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Infectious Diseases and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara Kiyotake, Miyazaki, Miyazaki 889-1692, Japan. yamamoto@fc.miyazaki-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Infectious Diseases and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara Kiyotake, Miyazaki, Miyazaki 889-1692, Japan. okayama@med.miyazaki-u.ac.jp.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara Kiyotake, Miyazaki, Miyazaki 889-1692, Japan. kmorishi@fc.miyazaki-u.ac.jp.', 'Section of Oncopathology and Regenerative Biology, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara Kiyotake, Miyazaki, Miyazaki 889-1692, Japan. mejina@med.miyazaki-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Health Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University of Health and Welfare, 1714-1 Yoshino-machi, Nobeoka, Miyazaki 882-8508, Japan. kjmtsn@phoenix.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Plants (Basel),"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",101596181,,,2013/01/01 00:00,2013/01/01 00:01,['2016/05/03 06:00'],"['2013/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/18 00:00 [revised]', '2013/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",epublish,Plants (Basel). 2013 Dec 27;3(1):18-26. doi: 10.3390/plants3010018.,10.3390/plants3010018 [doi],20131227,,PMC4844309,['NOTNLM'],"['adult T-cell leukemia', 'bitter gourd seed extract', 'phytohemagglutinin-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cell', 'alpha-eleostearic acid']",,"['plants3010018 [pii]', '10.3390/plants3010018 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The construction of the test is motivated by the behavior of the coefficient of variation of the population size. When immigration is time-homogeneous, we find that this coefficient converges to a constant, whereas when immigration is time-inhomogeneous we find that it is time-dependent, at least transiently. Thus, we test the assumption that the immigration process is time-homogeneous by verifying that the sample coefficient of variation does not vary significantly over time. The test is simple to implement and does not require specification or fitting any branching process to the data. Simulations and an application to real data on the progression of leukemia are presented to illustrate the approach.","['Hyrien, Ollivier', 'Yanev, Nikolay M', 'Jordan, Craig T']","['Hyrien O', 'Yanev NM', 'Jordan CT']","['University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA.', 'Institute of Mathematics and Informatics, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'University of Colorado, Denver, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Electron J Stat,Electronic journal of statistics,101480209,,,2015/01/01 00:00,2015/01/01 00:01,['2016/05/03 06:00'],"['2016/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Electron J Stat. 2015;9(1):898-925. doi: 10.1214/15-EJS1024.

Bi-allelic loss of Dnmt3a in mice results in leukemia and lymphoma, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Here, we investigate whether mono-allelic loss of Dnmt3a is sufficient to induce disease. We show that, by 16 months of age, 65% of Dnmt3a(+/-) mice develop a CLL-like disease, and 15% of mice develop non-malignant myeloproliferation. Genome-wide methylation analysis reveals that reduced Dnmt3a levels induce promoter hypomethylation at similar loci in Dnmt3a(+/-) and Dnmt3a(Delta/Delta) CLL, suggesting that promoters are particularly sensitive to Dnmt3a levels. Gene expression analysis identified 26 hypomethylated and overexpressed genes common to both Dnmt3a(+/-) and Dnmt3a(Delta/Delta) CLL as putative oncogenic drivers. Our data provide evidence that Dnmt3a is a haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor in CLL and highlights the importance of deregulated molecular events in disease pathogenesis.","['Haney, Staci L', 'Upchurch, G Michael', 'Opavska, Jana', 'Klinkebiel, David', 'Hlady, Ryan A', 'Suresh, Abhinav', 'Pirruccello, Samuel J', 'Shukla, Vipul', 'Lu, Runqing', 'Costinean, Stefan', 'Rizzino, Angie', 'Karpf, Adam R', 'Joshi, Shantaram', 'Swanson, Patrick', 'Opavsky, Rene']","['Haney SL', 'Upchurch GM', 'Opavska J', 'Klinkebiel D', 'Hlady RA', 'Suresh A', 'Pirruccello SJ', 'Shukla V', 'Lu R', 'Costinean S', 'Rizzino A', 'Karpf AR', 'Joshi S', 'Swanson P', 'Opavsky R']","['Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA; Center for Leukemia and Lymphoma Research, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA; Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA; Center for Leukemia and Lymphoma Research, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Creighton University, Omaha, NE 68102, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA; Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA; Center for Leukemia and Lymphoma Research, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.

However, rearrangement of JAK2 is a rare event. We report a case of myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable (MPN-U) with BCR-JAK2 fusion confirmed by molecular studies. Conventional chromosome analysis (CC) revealed t(9;22)(p24;q11.2) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed a JAK2 gene rearrangement in 88% of interphase nuclei. The BCR-JAK2 fusion was confirmed by multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and demonstrated two in-frame 5'BCR/3'JAK2 transcripts with BCR exon 1 juxtaposed to JAK2 exon 15 and exon 17, respectively. Our results, together with literature review, reveal BCR-JAK2 fusions as oncogenic genetic alterations that are associated with myeloid or lymphoid neoplasms and are frequently characterized by eosinophilia. Further, patients with BCR-JAK2 are candidates for JAK2 inhibitor therapy.

However, imatinib, the first approved BCR-ABL inhibitor, must be discontinued in many patients because of resistance or intolerance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present retrospective, pooled analysis of phase II and III data explored the extent of cross-intolerance between imatinib and dasatinib, a second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitor, in 271 CML imatinib-intolerant patients. RESULTS: Overall, 47 patients (17%) had cross-intolerance to dasatinib, determined by recurrence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs). Of the 228 patients who discontinued imatinib because of nonhematologic intolerance, 10 (4%) experienced the same severe nonhematologic AEs with dasatinib, with 4 of these patients (2%) discontinuing dasatinib because of cross-intolerance. Of the 43 patients who discontinued imatinib because of hematologic intolerance, 37 (86%) experienced a recurrence of grade 3 or 4 hematologic AEs with dasatinib, with 8 patients (19%) discontinuing dasatinib because of cross-intolerance. Of the 43 patients taking dasatinib at the optimized dose of 100 mg/d, 1 (2%) discontinued therapy because of recurrence of nonhematologic AEs and 3 (7%) because of recurrence of hematologic AEs. With a median treatment duration of 22 months, the estimated rates of progression-free survival and overall survival at 2 years were greater for patients with nonhematologic versus hematologic intolerance to imatinib who switched to dasatinib (progression-free survival, 94% vs. 68%, respectively; overall survival, 98% vs. 88%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Dasatinib could be an appropriate treatment option for imatinib-intolerant patients with CML, with cross-intolerance resulting in discontinuation in a few patients.","['Khoury, Hanna J', 'Goldberg, Stuart L', 'Mauro, Michael J', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Deininger, Michael W', 'Bradley-Garelik, M Brigid', 'Mohamed, Hesham', 'Guilhot, Francois']","['Khoury HJ', 'Goldberg SL', 'Mauro MJ', 'Stone RM', 'Deininger MW', 'Bradley-Garelik MB', 'Mohamed H', 'Guilhot F']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, GA.

Therefore, it is important to improve risk assessment at diagnosis. We conducted a retrospective study in a large cohort of SMM patients, in order to investigate the role of Bence Jones (BJ) proteinuria at diagnosis in the progression to active MM. We found that SMM patients presenting with BJ proteinuria had a significantly shorter median time to progression (TTP) to MM compared with patients without BJ proteinuria (22 vs 88 months, respectively; hazard ratio=2.3, 95% confidence interval=1.4-3.9, P=0.002). We also identified risk subgroups based on the amount of BJ proteinuria: 500 mg/24 h, <500 mg/24 h and without it, with a significantly different median TTP (13, 37 and 88 months, P<0.001). Thus, BJ proteinuria at diagnosis is an independent variable of progression to MM that identifies a subgroup of high-risk SMM patients (51% risk of progression at 2 years) and 500 mg of BJ proteinuria may allow, if validated in another series, to reclassify these patients to MM requiring therapy before the end-organ damage development.","['Gonzalez-Calle, V', 'Davila, J', 'Escalante, F', 'de Coca, A G', 'Aguilera, C', 'Lopez, R', 'Barez, A', 'Alonso, J M', 'Hernandez, R', 'Hernandez, J M', 'de la Fuente, P', 'Puig, N', 'Ocio, E M', 'Gutierrez, N C', 'Garcia-Sanz, R', 'Mateos, M V']","['Gonzalez-Calle V', 'Davila J', 'Escalante F', 'de Coca AG', 'Aguilera C', 'Lopez R', 'Barez A', 'Alonso JM', 'Hernandez R', 'Hernandez JM', 'de la Fuente P', 'Puig N', 'Ocio EM', 'Gutierrez NC', 'Garcia-Sanz R', 'Mateos MV']","['Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca, Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca, Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Leon, Leon, Spain.', 'Hospital Clinico Universitario de Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain.', 'Hospital del Bierzo, Ponferrada, Spain.', 'Hospital Virgen Del Puerto, Plasencia, Spain.', 'Hospital Nuestra Senora de Sonsoles, Avila, Spain.', 'Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Palencia, Palencia, Spain.', 'Complejo Asistencial de Zamora, Zamora, Spain.', 'Complejo Asistencial de Segovia, Segovia, Spain.', 'Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Burgos, Burgos, Spain.', 'Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca, Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca, Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca, Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca, Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca, Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bence Jones Protein/*urine', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/urine', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*diagnosis/urine', 'Proteinuria', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Time Factors']",2016/05/03 06:00,2017/08/08 06:00,['2016/05/03 06:00'],"['2016/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/03 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Oct;30(10):2026-2031. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.123.

Survival of responders is approaching that of the general population but lifelong treatment is still recommended. In several trials, TKI treatment has been stopped successfully in approximately half of the patients with deep molecular response. This has prompted the development of a new concept in the evaluation of CML patients known as 'treatment-free remission'. The future in CML treatment will be to define criteria for the safe and most promising discontinuation of TKI on one hand, and, on the other, to increase the number of patients available for such an attempt. Until safe criteria have been defined, discontinuation of therapy is still experimental and should be restricted to clinical trials or registries. This review will provide an overview of current knowledge as well as an outlook on future challenges.","['Saussele, S', 'Richter, J', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Mahon, F-X']","['Saussele S', 'Richter J', 'Hochhaus A', 'Mahon FX']","['III.

Abnormal DNA methylation is involved in the initiation and progression of AML. The de novo methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are responsible for the generation of genomic methylation patterns. While DNMT3A is frequently mutated in hematological malignancies, DNMT3B is rarely mutated. Although it has been previously reported that Dnmt3b functions as a tumor suppressor in a mouse model of Myc-induced lymphomagenesis, its function in AML is yet to be determined. In this study, we demonstrated that deletion of Dnmt3b accelerated the progression of MLL-AF9 leukemia by increasing stemness and enhancing cell cycle progression. Gene profiling analysis revealed upregulation of the oncogenic gene set and downregulation of the cell differentiation gene set. Furthermore, loss of Dnmt3b was able to synergize with Dnmt3a deficiency in leukemia development. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Dnmt3b plays a tumor suppressive role in MLL-AF9 AML progression, thereby providing new insights into the roles of DNA methylation in leukemia development.","['Zheng, Y', 'Zhang, H', 'Wang, Y', 'Li, X', 'Lu, P', 'Dong, F', 'Pang, Y', 'Ma, S', 'Cheng, H', 'Hao, S', 'Tang, F', 'Yuan, W', 'Zhang, X', 'Cheng, T']","['Zheng Y', 'Zhang H', 'Wang Y', 'Li X', 'Lu P', 'Dong F', 'Pang Y', 'Ma S', 'Cheng H', 'Hao S', 'Tang F', 'Yuan W', 'Zhang X', 'Cheng T']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Biodynamic Optical Imaging Center, College of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Biodynamic Optical Imaging Center, College of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Differentiation, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Medicine, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/deficiency/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2016/05/03 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2016/05/03 06:00'],"['2015/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/20 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/03 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Dec;30(12):2373-2384. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.112.

The starting dose of PegIFN was 15 mug/week and it increased to 25 mug/week at M6 until M15. The combination was well tolerated with manageable toxicity. Of the patients, 84% remained on PegIFN at M12 and 91% (DAS) and 73% (PegIFN) of assigned dose was given. Only one patient had a pleural effusion during first year, and three more during the second year. After introduction of PegIFN we observed a steep increase in response rates.

The JAK2(V617F) mutation is present in hematopoietic cells in a majority of patients with MPNs, but the mechanism(s) responsible for MPN stem cell expansion remain incomplete. One hallmark feature of the marrow in patients with MPNs is megakaryocyte (MK) hyperplasia. We report here that mice bearing a human JAK2(V617F) gene restricted exclusively to the MK lineage develop many of the features of a MPN. Specifically, these mice exhibit thrombocytosis, splenomegaly, increased numbers of marrow and splenic hematopoietic progenitors and a substantial expansion of HSPCs. In addition, wild-type mice transplanted with cells from JAK2(V617F)-bearing MK marrow develop a myeloproliferative syndrome with thrombocytosis and erythrocytosis as well as pan-hematopoietic progenitor and stem cell expansion. As marrow histology in this murine model of myeloproliferation reveals a preferentially perivascular localization of JAK2(V617F)-mutant MKs and an increased marrow sinusoid vascular density, it adds to accumulating data that MKs are an important component of the marrow HSPC niche, and that MK expansion might indirectly contribute to the critical role of the thrombopoietin/c-Mpl signaling pathway in HSPC maintenance and expansion.","['Zhan, H', 'Ma, Y', 'Lin, C H S', 'Kaushansky, K']","['Zhan H', 'Ma Y', 'Lin CH', 'Kaushansky K']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Northport VA Medical Center, Northport, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'Office of the Sr Vice President, Health Sciences, Stony Brook Medicine, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Megakaryocytes/*metabolism', 'Mice', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/pathology', 'Stem Cell Niche']",2016/05/03 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2016/05/03 06:00'],"['2015/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/03 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Dec;30(12):2332-2341. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.114.

We analysed the kinetics of promyelocytic leukaemia-retinoic acid receptor-alpha (PML-RARalpha) transcripts by real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) in bone marrow samples from 184 patients and assessed the prognostic impact of fms-related tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) in 159 patients enrolled in this trial in Italy. After induction therapy, the reduction of PML-RARalpha transcripts was significantly greater in patients receiving ATRA-CHT as compared with those treated with ATRA-ATO (3.4 vs 2.9 logs; P=0.0182). Conversely, at the end of consolidation, a greater log reduction of PML-RARalpha transcripts was detected in the ATRA-ATO as compared with the ATRA-CHT group (6.3 vs 5.3 logs; P=0.0024). FLT3-ITD mutations had no significant impact on either event-free survival (EFS) or cumulative incidence of relapse in patients receiving ATRA-ATO, whereas a trend for inferior EFS was observed in FLT3-ITD-positive patients receiving ATRA-CHT. Our study shows at the molecular level that ATRA-ATO exerts at least equal and probably superior antileukaemic efficacy compared with ATRA-CHT in low-intermediaterisk APL.

Clinical whole-exome sequencing (WES) has proven to be a powerful tool for the identification of pathogenic variants leading to Mendelian disorders, among which NDD represent a significant percentage. Performing WES with a trio-approach has proven to be extremely effective in identifying de novo pathogenic variants as a common cause of NDD. Here we report six unrelated individuals with a common phenotype consisting of NDD with severe speech delay, hypotonia, and facial dysmorphism. These patients underwent WES with a trio approach and de novo heterozygous predicted pathogenic novel variants in the KAT6A gene were identified. The KAT6A gene encodes a histone acetyltransfrease protein and it has long been known for its structural involvement in acute myeloid leukemia; however, it has not previously been associated with any congenital disorder. In animal models the KAT6A ortholog is involved in transcriptional regulation during development. Given the similar findings in animal models and our patient's phenotypes, we hypothesize that KAT6A could play a role in development of the brain, face, and heart in humans.

Inadequate invasion by trophoblast cells may lead to poor perfusion of the placenta, even result in preeclampsia. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying placentation facilitates the better intervention of preeclampsia. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is involved in the physiological and pathological processes. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is an important regulator in the establishment of pregnancy. However, the expression of uPAR in preeclamptic patients and its relationship with LIF remains unclear. In the current study, we found that the level of uPAR was relatively lower in the placentas from preeclamptic patients as compared with normal pregnant women. LIF promoted trophoblast cell outgrowth by upregulating uPAR in an explants culture, and LIF also enhanced migration and invasion potential through uPAR in trophoblast JAR and JEG-3 cell lines, and with increased gelatinolytic activities of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2). The effect of LIF and uPAR on trophoblast migration and invasion was mediated by PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Our data indicates the roles of LIF in promoting trophoblast migration and invasion through uPAR and suggest that abnormal expression of uPAR might be associated with the etiology of preeclampsia.","['Zheng, Qin', 'Dai, Kuixing', 'Cui, Xinyuan', 'Yu, Ming', 'Yang, Xuesong', 'Yan, Bin', 'Liu, Shuai', 'Yan, Qiu']","['Zheng Q', 'Dai K', 'Cui X', 'Yu M', 'Yang X', 'Yan B', 'Liu S', 'Yan Q']","[""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalian Medical University, Liaoning Provincial Core Lab of Glycobiology and Glycoengineering, Dalian 116044, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalian Medical University, Liaoning Provincial Core Lab of Glycobiology and Glycoengineering, Dalian 116044, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalian Medical University, Liaoning Provincial Core Lab of Glycobiology and Glycoengineering, Dalian 116044, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalian Medical University, Liaoning Provincial Core Lab of Glycobiology and Glycoengineering, Dalian 116044, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalian Medical University, Liaoning Provincial Core Lab of Glycobiology and Glycoengineering, Dalian 116044, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The first Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116000, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalian Medical University, Liaoning Provincial Core Lab of Glycobiology and Glycoengineering, Dalian 116044, People's Republic of China.

We established two sorafenib-resistant cell lines carrying FLT3/ITD mutations, including the murine BaF3/ITD-R and human MV4-11-R cell lines. Gene expression profile analysis of the resistant and parental cells suggests that the highest ranked molecular and cellular functions of the differentially expressed genes are related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Both murine and human resistant cell lines display a longer doubling time, along with a significant inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain activity and substantial upregulation of glycolysis. The sorafenib-resistant cells exhibit increased expression of a majority of glycolytic enzymes, including hexokinase 2, which is also highly expressed in the mitochondrial fraction and is associated with resistance to apoptotic cell death. The sorafenib-resistant cells are collaterally sensitive to a number of glycolytic inhibitors including 2-deoxyglucose and 3-bromopyruvate propylester. Our study reveals a metabolic signature of sorafenib-resistant cells and suggests that glycolytic inhibition may override such resistance and warrant further clinical investigation.","['Huang, Amin', 'Ju, Huai-Qiang', 'Liu, Kaiyan', 'Zhan, Guilian', 'Liu, Daolu', 'Wen, Shijun', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Huang, Peng', 'Hu, Yumin']","['Huang A', 'Ju HQ', 'Liu K', 'Zhan G', 'Liu D', 'Wen S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Huang P', 'Hu Y']","['Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China; Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China; Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

In this study, its anti-cancer activity and underlying mechanism of this action were investigated in leukemia cells like KG-1a, HL60, U937, and K562. The results showed that POA1 inhibited dose-/time-dependently cell growth and induced apoptosis in leukemia cells. Also, POA1 caused cleavages of caspase-3, 8, 9 and PARP1, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, up-regulations of phosphorylated p38 and JNK, and activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). Furthermore, 4-PBA (an ER stress inhibitor) but not SP600125 and SB203580 (JNK and p38 inhibitor, respectively) could largely inhibit POA1-induced growth suppression. Additionally, 4-PBA obstructed mitochondrial depolarization and cleavage of PARP1. These data suggested that ER stress pathway might be an important mediator in POA1-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, POA1 may have antitumor effects in leukemia cells through the induction of ER stress pathway.","['Wang, Jie', 'Wang, Qiao-Li', 'Nong, Xu-Hua', 'Zhang, Xiao-Yong', 'Xu, Xin-Ya', 'Qi, Shu-Hua', 'Wang, Yi-Fei']","['Wang J', 'Wang QL', 'Nong XH', 'Zhang XY', 'Xu XY', 'Qi SH', 'Wang YF']","['Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, RNAM Center for Marine Microbiology, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Marine Material Medical, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 164 West Xingang Road, Guangzhou 510301, China.', 'Guangzhou Jinan Biomedicine Research and Development Center, National Engineering Research Center of Genetic Medicine, Jinan University, 601 West Huangpu Road, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, RNAM Center for Marine Microbiology, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Marine Material Medical, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 164 West Xingang Road, Guangzhou 510301, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, RNAM Center for Marine Microbiology, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Marine Material Medical, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 164 West Xingang Road, Guangzhou 510301, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, RNAM Center for Marine Microbiology, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Marine Material Medical, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 164 West Xingang Road, Guangzhou 510301, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology, RNAM Center for Marine Microbiology, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Marine Material Medical, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 164 West Xingang Road, Guangzhou 510301, China; South China Sea Bio-Resource Exploitation and Utilization Collaborative Innovation Center, Guangzhou 510301, China.

However, the mechanisms have not been fully clarified yet. The present study was designed to investigate the therapeutic effect of RPP against cerebral ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats models, and more importantly, to explore the underlying mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cerebral ischemia and reperfusion was established through the classic middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2h, followed by 24h reperfusion. Rats were orally given different doses of n-butyl alcohol extracts (NBES) of RPP or saline for one week before induction of ischemia. Neurological defect scoring, cerebral infarct volume, oxidative stress markers, inflammatory reaction and nerve cell apoptosis were then estimated. RESULTS: It showed that NBES could alleviate in a dose-dependent manner neurological deficit and reduce the infarct volume in vivo. The protective effects of NBES were associated with increased Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and decreased malonaldehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) levels. In addition, ischemia-induced neuron apoptosis was inhibited by NBES pretreatment, and western blot showed NBES upregulated expressions of B-cell leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and downregulated Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) expression. CONCLUSION: NBES prevent cerebral I/R injury by alleviating neuronal oxidative injury, inflammatory reaction and neuron apoptosis. The research for the traditional use of RPP provided certain theoretical basis.","['Ye, Yujie', 'Li, Juan', 'Cao, Xiaolu', 'Chen, Yajun', 'Ye, Congjin', 'Chen, Keli']","['Ye Y', 'Li J', 'Cao X', 'Chen Y', 'Ye C', 'Chen K']","['Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education on Traditional Chinese Medicine Resource and Compound Prescription & College of Pharmacy, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Wuhan 430065, PR China; The Department of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430065, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education on Traditional Chinese Medicine Resource and Compound Prescription & College of Pharmacy, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Wuhan 430065, PR China.', 'The Department of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430065, PR China.', 'The Department of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430065, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education on Traditional Chinese Medicine Resource and Compound Prescription & College of Pharmacy, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Wuhan 430065, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education on Traditional Chinese Medicine Resource and Compound Prescription & College of Pharmacy, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Wuhan 430065, PR China.

We have generated a SALL4 transgenic (SALL4B Tg) mouse model with pre-leukemic MDS-like symptoms that transform to AML over time. This makes our mouse model applicable for studying human MDS/AML diseases. Characterization of the leukemic initiation population in this model leads to the discovery that Fancl (Fanconi anemia, complementation group L) is downregulated in SALL4B Tg leukemic and pre-leukemic cells. Similar to the reported Fanconi anemia (FA) mouse model, chromosomal instability with radial changes can be detected in pre-leukemic SALL4B Tg bone marrow (BM) cells after DNA damage challenge. Results from additional studies using DNA damage repair reporter assays support a role of SALL4 in inhibiting the homologous recombination pathway. Intriguingly, unlike the FA mouse model, after DNA damage challenge, SALL4B Tg BM cells can survive and generate hematopoietic colonies. We further elucidated that the mechanism by which SALL4 promotes cell survival is through Bcl2 activation. Overall, our studies demonstrate for the first time that SALL4 has a negative impact in DNA damage repair, and support the model of dual functional properties of SALL4 in leukemogenesis through inhibiting DNA damage repair and promoting cell survival.","['Wang, F', 'Gao, C', 'Lu, J', 'Tatetsu, H', 'Williams, D A', 'Muller, L U', 'Cui, W', 'Chai, L']","['Wang F', 'Gao C', 'Lu J', 'Tatetsu H', 'Williams DA', 'Muller LU', 'Cui W', 'Chai L']","[""Department of Pathology, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', ""Department of Pathology, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', ""Department of Pathology, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chromosomal Instability/drug effects', 'Cluster Analysis', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA End-Joining Repair', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein/genetics', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group L Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Homologous Recombination', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitomycin/pharmacology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2016/05/03 06:00,2017/09/07 06:00,['2016/05/03 06:00'],"['2015/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/25 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/03 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2016 Nov 24;35(47):6087-6095. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.146.

This work was also of major importance to support the idea that cytogenetic changes were drivers of leukemogenesis. John Goldman originally made seminal contributions to the use of autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation from the late 1970s onwards. Then, in collaboration with Brian Druker, he led efforts to develop ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in the late 1990s. He also led the global efforts to develop and harmonize methodology for molecular monitoring, and was an indefatigable organizer of international conferences. These conferences brought together clinicians and scientists, and accelerated the adoption of new therapies. The abundance of praise, tributes and testimonies expressed by many serve to illustrate the indelible impressions these two passionate and affable scholars made on so many people's lives. This tribute provides an outline of the remarkable story of chronic myeloid leukemia, and in writing it, it is clear that the historical triumph of biomedical science over this leukemia cannot be considered without appreciating the work of both Janet Rowley and John Goldman.","['Mughal, Tariq I', 'Radich, Jerald P', 'Deininger, Michael W', 'Apperley, Jane F', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Daley, George Q']","['Mughal TI', 'Radich JP', 'Deininger MW', 'Apperley JF', 'Hughes TP', 'Harrison CJ', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Saglio G', 'Cortes J', 'Daley GQ']","['Tufts University Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA tmughal911@hotmail.com tmughal@tuftsmedicalcenter.org.', 'Fredrick Hutchinson Cancer Center, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'University of Utah, Huntsman Cancer, Institute, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, UK.', 'University of Adelaide, Australia.', 'Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'University of Turin, Italy.', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', ""Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medicine, School, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Biography', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Portrait', 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/history/methods', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/history/methods', 'Mutation', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Research/history']",2016/05/02 06:00,2017/07/08 06:00,['2016/05/02 06:00'],"['2015/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/08 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2016 May;101(5):541-58. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2015.139337.,10.3324/haematol.2015.139337 [doi],,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",PMC5004358,,,,"['haematol.2015.139337 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2015.139337 [doi]']",,['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],['R01 CA178397/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical signs and symptoms in MCAD vary depending on disease subtype and result from excessive mediator release by MCs and, in aggressive forms, from organ failure related to MC infiltration. In most cases, treatment of MCAD is directed primarily at controlling the symptoms associated with MC mediator release. In advanced forms, such as aggressive SM and MCL, agents targeting MC proliferation such as kinase inhibitors may be provided. Targeted therapies aimed at blocking mutant protein variants and/or downstream signaling pathways are currently being developed. Other targets, such as specific surface antigens expressed on neoplastic MCs, might be considered for the development of future therapies. Since clinicians are often underprepared to evaluate, diagnose, and effectively treat this clinically heterogeneous disease, we seek to familiarize clinicians with MCAD and review current and future treatment approaches.","['Molderings, Gerhard J', 'Haenisch, Britta', 'Brettner, Stefan', 'Homann, Jurgen', 'Menzen, Markus', 'Dumoulin, Franz Ludwig', 'Panse, Jens', 'Butterfield, Joseph', 'Afrin, Lawrence B']","['Molderings GJ', 'Haenisch B', 'Brettner S', 'Homann J', 'Menzen M', 'Dumoulin FL', 'Panse J', 'Butterfield J', 'Afrin LB']","['Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital of Bonn, Sigmund-Freud-Strasse 25, 53127, Bonn, Germany. molderings@uni-bonn.de.', 'German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Bonn, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Palliative Care, Kreiskrankenhaus Waldbrol, Waldbrol, Germany.', 'Allgemeine Innere Medizin, Gastroenterologie und Diabetologie, Gemeinschaftskrankenhaus, Bonn, Germany.', 'Allgemeine Innere Medizin, Gastroenterologie und Diabetologie, Gemeinschaftskrankenhaus, Bonn, Germany.', 'Allgemeine Innere Medizin, Gastroenterologie und Diabetologie, Gemeinschaftskrankenhaus, Bonn, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Program for the Study of Mast Cell and Eosinophil Disorders, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,0326264,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Histamine Antagonists/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2016/05/02 06:00,2017/02/28 06:00,['2016/05/02 06:00'],"['2016/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/28 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol. 2016 Jul;389(7):671-94. doi: 10.1007/s00210-016-1247-1.

We retrospectively analyzed pretreatment characteristics and post-induction response in a cohort of AML patients to determine if adding clinical and laboratory characteristics can improve the predictive value of the D14 BM evaluation. Among 297 patients treated for AML at the single institution 183 patients (61%) had leukemia-positive D14 BM. Of those, 94 were given reinduction chemotherapy and 89 were not. Of the 89 patients who did not receive reinduction, 32 (36%) subsequently achieved complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi), and 57 (64%) had persistent disease. Persistent disease after positive D14 BM was more likely associated with higher percentage of D14 myeloblasts, a history of relapsed disease before induction, and higher risk disease compared to patients who subsequently achieved CR. Age, diagnostic white blood cell count, and the D14 BM cellularity did not influence the subsequent likelihood of achieving remission in patients with a positive D14 BM. A new mathematical equation was created and resulted in a positive predictive value of 83%, negative predictive value 90% and accuracy 88% for correctly identifying remission status after positive D14 BM in AML. The accuracy of predicting response using these additional parameters was significantly higher than without (0.88 vs. 0.80, P=0.002). Our new model provides better accuracy for predicting the likelihood of achieving remission and if validated in future studies may be useful for managing AML patients.","['Norkin, Maxim', 'Chang, Myron', 'An, Qi', 'Leather, Helen', 'Katragadda, Lakshmikanth', 'Li, Ying', 'Moreb, Jan S', 'May, W Stratford', 'Brown, Randy A', 'Hsu, Jack W', 'Hiemenz, John W', 'Wingard, John R', 'Cogle, Christopher R']","['Norkin M', 'Chang M', 'An Q', 'Leather H', 'Katragadda L', 'Li Y', 'Moreb JS', 'May WS', 'Brown RA', 'Hsu JW', 'Hiemenz JW', 'Wingard JR', 'Cogle CR']","['University of Florida, College of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, United States.

Mutations in the basic leucine zipper domain (bZip) of C/EBPalpha are associated with acute myeloid leukemia. A widely used murine transforming C/EBPalpha basic region mutant (BRM2) entails two bZip point mutations (I294A/R297A). BRM2 has been discordantly described as defective for DNA binding or defective for interaction with E2F. We have separated the two BRM2 mutations to shed light on the intertwined reciprocity between C/EBPalpha-E2F-DNA interactions. Both, C/EBPalpha I294A and R297A retain transactivation capacity and interaction with E2F-DP. The C/EBPalpha R297A mutation destabilized DNA binding, whereas the C/EBPalpha I294A mutation enhanced binding to DNA. The C/EBPalpha R297A mutant, like BRM2, displayed enhanced interaction with E2F-DP but failed to repress E2F-dependent transactivation although both mutants were readily suppressed by E2F1 for transcription through C/EBP cis-regulatory sites. In contrast, the DNA binding enhanced C/EBPalpha I294A mutant displayed increased repression of E2F-DP mediated transactivation and resisted E2F-DP mediated repression. Thus, the efficient repression of E2F dependent S-phase genes and the activation of differentiation genes reside in the balanced DNA binding capacity of C/EBPalpha.","['Kowenz-Leutz, Elisabeth', 'Schuetz, Anja', 'Liu, Qingbin', 'Knoblich, Maria', 'Heinemann, Udo', 'Leutz, Achim']","['Kowenz-Leutz E', 'Schuetz A', 'Liu Q', 'Knoblich M', 'Heinemann U', 'Leutz A']","['Tumorigenesis and Cell Differentiation, Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association, Berlin, Germany.', 'Protein Sample Production Facility, Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association, Berlin, Germany.', 'Tumorigenesis and Cell Differentiation, Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association, Berlin, Germany; Institute of Biology, Humboldt University of Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Tumorigenesis and Cell Differentiation, Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association, Berlin, Germany.', 'Protein Sample Production Facility, Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association, Berlin, Germany; Chemistry and Biochemistry Institute, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Tumorigenesis and Cell Differentiation, Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association, Berlin, Germany; Institute of Biology, Humboldt University of Berlin, Berlin, Germany.

Deuterated (R,S)-2-hydroxyglutaric acid, disodium salt was used as internal standard and added to samples before a solid phase extraction on Phenomenex STRATA-XL-A (200mg-3mL) 33mum cartridges. A derivatization step with (+)- o,o'-diacetyl-l-tartaric anhydride permitted to separate the two resulting diastereoisomers without chiral stationary phase, on a C18 column combined to a Xevo TQ-MS Waters mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. This method allows standard curves to be linear over the range 0.34-135.04muM with r(2) values>0.999 and low matrix effects (<11.7%). This method, which was validated according to current EMA guidelines, is accurate between-run (<3.1%) and within-run (<7.9%) and precise between-run (<5.3CV%) and within-run (<6.2CV%), and is suitable for clinical and preclinical applications.","['Poinsignon, Vianney', 'Mercier, Lionel', 'Nakabayashi, Koichi', 'David, Muriel D', 'Lalli, Alexandre', 'Penard-Lacronique, Virginie', 'Quivoron, Cyril', 'Saada, Veronique', 'De Botton, Stephane', 'Broutin, Sophie', 'Paci, Angelo']","['Poinsignon V', 'Mercier L', 'Nakabayashi K', 'David MD', 'Lalli A', 'Penard-Lacronique V', 'Quivoron C', 'Saada V', 'De Botton S', 'Broutin S', 'Paci A']","['Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus Grand Paris, Service de Pharmacologie, Departement de Biologie et Pathologie Medicales, Villejuif 94805, France.', 'Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus Grand Paris, Service de Pharmacologie, Departement de Biologie et Pathologie Medicales, Villejuif 94805, France.', 'INSERM U 1170, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif 94805, France.', 'INSERM U 1170, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif 94805, France.', 'Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus Grand Paris, Service de Pharmacologie, Departement de Biologie et Pathologie Medicales, Villejuif 94805, France.', 'INSERM U 1170, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif 94805, France.', 'INSERM U 1170, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif 94805, France.', 'INSERM U 1170, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif 94805, France.', 'INSERM U 1170, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif 94805, France.', 'Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus Grand Paris, Service de Pharmacologie, Departement de Biologie et Pathologie Medicales, Villejuif 94805, France.', 'Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus Grand Paris, Service de Pharmacologie, Departement de Biologie et Pathologie Medicales, Villejuif 94805, France; Universite Paris-Sud, Laboratoire de Vectorologie et Therapeutiques Anticancereuses, UMR 8203, Villejuif 94805, France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Laboratoire de Vectorologie et Therapeutiques Anticancereuses, UMR 8203, Villejuif 94805, France; Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus Grand Paris, Laboratoire de Vectorologie et Therapeutiques Anticancereuses, UMR 8203, Villejuif 94805, France.

Thus, integrated clustering of multiple types of omics data is essential for developing individual-based treatments and precision medicine. However, while rapid progress has been made, methods for integrated clustering are lacking an intuitive web interface that facilitates the biomedical researchers without sufficient programming skills. Here, we present a web tool, named Integrated Clustering of Multi-dimensional biomedical data (ICM), that provides an interface from which to fuse, cluster and visualize multi-dimensional biomedical data and knowledge. With ICM, users can explore the heterogeneity of a disease or a biological process by identifying subgroups of patients. The results obtained can then be interactively modified by using an intuitive user interface. Researchers can also exchange the results from ICM with collaborators via a web link containing a Project ID number that will directly pull up the analysis results being shared. ICM also support incremental clustering that allows users to add new sample data into the data of a previous study to obtain a clustering result. Currently, the ICM web server is available with no login requirement and at no cost at http://biotech.bmi.ac.cn/icm/.","['He, Song', 'He, Haochen', 'Xu, Wenjian', 'Huang, Xin', 'Jiang, Shuai', 'Li, Fei', 'He, Fuchu', 'Bo, Xiaochen']","['He S', 'He H', 'Xu W', 'Huang X', 'Jiang S', 'Li F', 'He F', 'Bo X']","['Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 100850, P.

Experience of hematologists on the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of SDRPL is extremely limited. The aim of our report was to characterize the clinical and immunomorphologic features of SDRPL on our own observations. During 2013-2014, in National Research Center for Hematology, 87 spleen specimens removed from various B-cell lymphomas were analyzed. In four (4.6%) cases, the diagnosis SDRPL was made based on morphologic, immunohistochemical, immunophenotypic, molecular examination of spleen biopsies, blood and bone marrow samples. In all cases of SDRPL were observed significant splenomegaly, lymphocytosis from 56% to 94% (in two cases with leukocytosis 55.000 and 75.000 109/l). The circulating ""villous"" lymphocytes phenotype was CD20+ (bright), CD11c+/+/-, CD103 (weakly)+/+/-, LAIR-1+, CD25-, CD5-, CD10-, and CD23-. Mutation BRAFV600E was not detected. Bone marrow with minor lymphoid CD20+, CD25-, Annexin1-, Cyclin D1- cell infiltration. The average weight of the spleen was 3900 g (1450-9500 g), and morphologically, there was revealed lymphoid infiltration of red pulp with phenotype CD20+, DBA.44+, CD25-, Annexin1-, Cyclin D1-, CD103-, CD123-, CD27-, focal SD11c+/- and TRAP+/-. Now patients are observed in remission: two patients after splenectomy, two after splenectomy and cladribine+rituximab chemotherapy. SRDPL-a rare lymphoma that is suspected in the cases with significant splenomegaly and lymphocytosis with villous lymphocytes forms that have only a part of the classic markers HCL, with minor bone marrow infiltration.

Recently, the halving time (velocity of early BCR-ABL1 transcript elimination) has been shown to represent an additional prognostic index. Our objective was the evaluation of the prognostic significance of the 3-month point in our population. We retrospectively collected BCR-ABL1 transcript data at different time points, events, and survival data of patients with CML treated at the Division of Hematology, San Luigi Hospital, University of Turin, Turin, Italy. Of 71 patients diagnosed from January 2005 to March 2015 in our center and treated with front-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib), we selected those who had undergone a molecular evaluation at 3 months. The event-free survival (EFS) by the median follow-up time was the primary endpoint. The data from 50 patients with CML chronic phase were analyzed. Overall, 34 of the 50 patients (68%) had a transcript </= 10% at 3 months. Of those in the > 10% group, 63% had experienced an event compared with 12% in the </= 10% group by the median follow-up point (P < .001). The halving time threshold for discriminating between EFS was 17 days. None of the patients with a transcript > 10% at 3 months had a halving time of </= 17 days. Patients with BCR-ABL1 </= 10% and a halving time of </= 17 days had significantly better EFS than that of patients with BCR-ABL1 </= 10% and a halving time > 17 days and of patients with BCR-ABL1 > 10% (96% group 1 vs. 60% group 2 vs. 27% group 3; P < .001). Irrespective of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor used, the prognosis was significantly superior for patients with BCR-ABL1 </= 10% and halving time of </= 17 days. Our data revealed that the use of ABL1 as a control gene is reliable for the determination of the halving time in the clinical setting and highlight the importance of measuring the BCR-ABL1 transcript at CML diagnosis.","['Fava, Carmen', 'Rege-Cambrin, Giovanna', 'Dogliotti, Irene', 'Gottardi, Enrico', 'Berchialla, Paola', 'Di Gioacchino, Bruno', 'Crasto, Francesca', 'Lorenzatti, Roberta', 'Volpengo, Alessandro', 'Daraio, Filomena', 'Fantino, Cristina', 'Saglio, Giuseppe']","['Fava C', 'Rege-Cambrin G', 'Dogliotti I', 'Gottardi E', 'Berchialla P', 'Di Gioacchino B', 'Crasto F', 'Lorenzatti R', 'Volpengo A', 'Daraio F', 'Fantino C', 'Saglio G']","['Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria San Luigi Gonzaga, Orbassano (TO), Italy.

We have previously reported that idarubicin (IDA) intensified BUCY2 regimen could reduce relapse and improve survival for high-risk hematological malignancies undergoing allo-HSCT. However, there is no published study comparing the efficacy of IDA-BUCY2 regimen for high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) versus acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). We further retrospectively compared therapeutic outcomes of intensified conditioning regimen on 140 high-risk AML and ALL patients in the data analyses.

For high-risk AML, cumulative probabilities of 3-year relapse rates in IDA-BUCY2 and traditional BUCY2 regimens were 16.9%, 43.3% (P=0.016). Cumulative probabilities of 3-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 69.2% vs 44.0% (P=0.024), and 66.9% vs 38.2% (P=0.01). However, two regimens showed no significant differences for high-risk ALL. Multivariate analysis also indicated that IDA intensified BUCY2 conditioning was the favorable variable to reduce relapse and elevate survival for high-risk AML patients. In conclusion, IDA-BUCY2 regimen reduces relapse and improves survival for high-risk AML undergoing allo-HSCT, but not presenting uniform therapeutic effects for high-risk ALL.","['Fang, Jun', 'Zhang, Ran', 'Wang, Huafang', 'Hong, Mei', 'Wu, Qiuling', 'Nie, Dimin', 'You, Yong', 'Zhong, Zhaodong', 'Li, Weiming', 'Hu, Yu', 'Xia, Linghui']","['Fang J', 'Zhang R', 'Wang H', 'Hong M', 'Wu Q', 'Nie D', 'You Y', 'Zhong Z', 'Li W', 'Hu Y', 'Xia L']","['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430022, China.

However, previous studies show that RA treatment of cells cultured in the presence of a leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) also result in the upregulation of a gene called Zscan4, whose transient expression is a marker for undifferentiated ESCs. We explored the balance between these two seemingly antagonistic effects of RA. ESCs indeed differentiated in the presence of LIF after RA treatment, but colonies of undifferentiated ESCs eventually emerged from these differentiated cells - even in the presence of RA. These colonies, named secondary colonies, consist of three cell types: typical undifferentiated ESCs expressing pluripotency genes such as Pou5f1, Sox2, and Nanog; cells expressing Zscan4; and endodermal-like cells located at the periphery of the colony. The capacity to form secondary colonies was confirmed for all eight tested ESC lines. Cells from the secondary colonies - after transfer to the standard ESC medium - retained pluripotency, judged by their strong alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, typical colony morphology, gene expression profile, stable karyotype, capacity to differentiate into all three germ layers in embryoid body formation assays, and successful contribution to chimeras after injection into blastocysts. Based on flow cytometry analysis (FACS), the proportion of Zscan4-positive cells in secondary colonies was higher than in standard ESC colonies, which may explain the capacity of ESCs to resist the differentiating effects of RA and instead form secondary colonies of undifferentiated ESCs. This hypothesis is supported by cell-lineage tracing analysis, which showed that most cells in the secondary colonies were descendents of cells transiently expressing Zscan4.","['Sharova, Lioudmila V', 'Sharov, Alexei A', 'Piao, Yulan', 'Stagg, Carole A', 'Amano, Tomokazu', 'Qian, Yong', 'Dudekula, Dawood', 'Schlessinger, David', 'Ko, Minoru S H']","['Sharova LV', 'Sharov AA', 'Piao Y', 'Stagg CA', 'Amano T', 'Qian Y', 'Dudekula D', 'Schlessinger D', 'Ko MS']","['National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD, 21224, USA.', 'National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD, 21224, USA.', 'National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD, 21224, USA.', 'National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD, 21224, USA.', 'National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD, 21224, USA.', 'National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD, 21224, USA.', 'National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD, 21224, USA.', 'National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD, 21224, USA.', 'National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD, 21224, USA. ko.minoru@keio.jp.', 'Department of Systems Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan. ko.minoru@keio.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

Competition models of cellular species help to elucidate stem cell dynamics in the bone marrow microenvironment (or niche), and to determine how these dynamics impact leukaemia progression. Here we develop two models that target acute myeloid leukaemia with particular focus on the mechanisms that control proliferation via feedback signalling. It is within regions of parameter space permissive of coexistence that the effects of competition are most subtle and the clinical outcome least certain. Steady state and linear stability analyses identify parameter regions that allow for coexistence to occur, and allow us to characterise behaviour near critical points. Where analytical expressions are no longer informative, we proceed statistically and sample parameter space over a coexistence region. We find that the rates of proliferation and differentiation of healthy progenitors exert key control over coexistence. We also show that inclusion of a regulatory feedback onto progenitor cells promotes healthy haematopoiesis at the expense of leukaemia, and that - somewhat paradoxically - within the coexistence region feedback increases the sensitivity of the system to dominance by one lineage over another.","['Crowell, Helena L', 'MacLean, Adam L', 'Stumpf, Michael P H']","['Crowell HL', 'MacLean AL', 'Stumpf MP']","['Theoretical Systems Biology, Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London, London SW7 2AZ, UK.', 'Theoretical Systems Biology, Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London, London SW7 2AZ, UK.', 'Theoretical Systems Biology, Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London, London SW7 2AZ, UK.

METHODS: The results of 28 hips of 21 patients (16 male, 5 female) who underwent FVFG for treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head were retrospectively reviewed. Mean age of patients at time of surgery was 30.7 years (range: 15-53 years). Mean follow-up duration was 7.6 years (range: 5-9.2 years). RESULTS: During follow-up, 1 patient died because of leukemia, and 1 patient was lost. The remaining 26 hips of 19 patients were evaluated. According to Ficat classification, at time of surgery, 17 hips were grade II, and 9 hips were grade III, 3 hips underwent total hip arthroplasty. Postoperative Harris Hip Score (HHS) in grade II disease was excellent in 12 patients, good in 3 patients, and fair in 1 patient. In grade III disease, 1 patient was excellent, 5 patients were good, and 1 patient was fair. There was a significant increase in HHS scores from preoperatively to postoperatively (61+/-9.7 vs 84+/-17.8, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: FVFG yields extremely good results, particularly in pre-collapse stages of the disease in young patients. The operation time does not markedly increase if the surgical team is knowledgeable of the procedure and the residual fibular defect of the donor site does not impair functions of daily living.","['Unal, Mehmet Bekir', 'Cansu, Eren', 'Parmaksizoglu, Fatih', 'Cift, Hakan', 'Gurcan, Serkan']","['Unal MB', 'Cansu E', 'Parmaksizoglu F', 'Cift H', 'Gurcan S']","['Goztepe Medicalpark Hospital, Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Marmara University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Yeni Yuzyil University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Istanbul Medipol University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Istanbul, Turkey. hakanturancift@yahoo.com.', 'Private Medicana Hospital, Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Turkey,Acta Orthop Traumatol Turc,Acta orthopaedica et traumatologica turcica,9424806,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip/*methods', 'Bone Transplantation/*methods', 'Female', 'Femur Head/*surgery', 'Femur Head Necrosis/diagnostic imaging/*surgery', 'Fibula/*transplantation', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiography', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Autologous/methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Turkey', 'Young Adult']",2016/05/01 06:00,2017/02/10 06:00,['2016/05/01 06:00'],"['2016/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/10 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Acta Orthop Traumatol Turc. 2016;50(3):323-9. doi: 10.3944/AOTT.2015.15.0328.,10.3944/AOTT.2015.15.0328 [doi],,,,,,,['10.3944/AOTT.2015.15.0328 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a conditional hematopoietic-specific Trim33 knock-out (Trim33(Delta/Delta)) mouse, we showed previously that Trim33 deficiency in hematopoietic stem cells leads to severe defects in hematopoiesis, resembling the main features of human chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. We also demonstrated that Trim33 is involved in hematopoietic aging through TGFbeta signaling. Nevertheless, how Trim33 contributes to the terminal stages of myeloid differentiation remains to be clarified. We reveal here the crucial role of Trim33 expression in the control of mature granulomonocytic differentiation. An important component of Trim33-deficient mice is the alteration of myeloid differentiation, as characterized by dysplastic features, abnormal granulocyte and monocyte maturation, and the expansion of CD11b(+)Ly6G(high)Ly6C(low) myeloid cells, which share some features with polymorphonuclear-myeloid-derived suppressor cells.

The introduction of chemoimmunotherapy regimens has resulted in an improvement in the management of this disease, and consolidation of responses with autologous stem cell transplantation appears efficacious. Many patients are not eligible for high-dose therapy, however. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) has demonstrated single-agent efficacy in HT and can be used safely as consolidation after chemoimmunotherapy. For these reasons, RIT consolidation after chemoimmunotherapy induction has been our standard treatment approach at the University of Rochester for patients with HT who were ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed to describe the clinical outcomes of these patients. Twenty-one patients were identified who received RIT consolidation. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the distributions of overall survival and progression-free survival. Comparisons were made between patients with pathologic HT and the combination of clinical HT and composite lymphoma using the log-rank test to compare survival curves. RESULTS: The median overall survival of the cohort was 84 months, and progression-free survival was 38 months. The major toxicity was myelosuppression, and 2 deaths were attributed to therapy. One case of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia was noted. CONCLUSION: In a population of patients ineligible for high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell support, consolidation of response to chemoimmunotherapy with RIT was well tolerated and should be considered in patients with disease responsive to induction therapy.","['Reagan, Patrick M', 'Baran, Andrea', 'Kelly, Jennifer L', 'Barr, Paul M', 'Casulo, Carla', 'Chengazi, Vaseem U', 'Friedberg, Jonathan W']","['Reagan PM', 'Baran A', 'Kelly JL', 'Barr PM', 'Casulo C', 'Chengazi VU', 'Friedberg JW']","['Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY.

AML cells strictly depend on the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) in which they reside. Classical AML cell cultures fail to mimic the BMM and, therefore, drug discovery studies are dominated by in vivo models. However, animal models are time consuming, labour intensive, provide limited mechanistic insight, and are unsuited for high-throughput studies, necessitating the development of novel AML models. The evolving ex vivo BMM-mimicking culture systems aim to fill this gap, with increasing success. Here, we discuss how AML-microenvironment co-culture models advance our understanding of this disease, and highlight their future potential for translational AML research.","['Dhami, Sukhraj Pal S', 'Kappala, Shanthi S', 'Thompson, Alexander', 'Szegezdi, Eva']","['Dhami SPS', 'Kappala SS', 'Thompson A', 'Szegezdi E']","['Apoptosis Research Centre, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland.', ""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University, Belfast, United Kingdom."", 'Apoptosis Research Centre, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland.

Although a number of CD5 positive HCL and HCL-v cases have been reported, but these are far and few in between. We aimed to review the reported cases of CD5 positive HCL and its variant. METHOD: We hereby report a case of CD5 positive HCL, with variations in PIK3CA and PDGFRA gene, along with a brief review of literature of the cases of CD5 positive HCL and its variant. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The current case was positive for CD103, CD11c, CD25, and CD123 which has led the diagnosis to be of typical HCL. With the extensive literature review we found that only 26 cases of hairy cell leukemia [HCL and HCL-v] bearing CD5 expression have been reported so far. The positivity of CD5 is more common in HCL-v as compared to HCL. Additional prospective studies of CD5+ HCL and its variants are required to show whether they are a clinically significant subgroup of lymphoid malignancies.

An immune phenotype characterized by increased immune activation, systemic inflammation, and accumulation of late-differentiated memory CD57(+) CD28(-) T cells has been associated with comorbidities in the elderly. Here, we explored if this phenotype was present in young adult leukemia survivors following an average of 19 years from chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy completion, and compared this with that in age-matched controls. We found that markers of systemic inflammation-IL-6 and human C-reactive protein and immune activation-CD38 and HLA-DR on T cells, soluble CD (sCD)163 from monocytes and macrophages-were increased in survivors compared to controls. T-cell responses specific to cytomegalovirus (CMV) were also increased in survivors compared to controls while CMV IgG levels in survivors were comparable to levels measured in the elderly (>50years) and correlated with IL-6, human C-reactive protein, sCD163, and CD57(+) CD28(-) memory T cells. Immune activation and inflammation markers correlated poorly with prior chemotherapy and radiotherapy exposure. These data suggest that CMV infection/reactivation is strongly correlated with the immunological phenotype seen in young childhood leukemia survivors and these changes may be associated with the early onset of age-related comorbidities in this group.","['Azanan, Mohamad Shafiq', 'Abdullah, Noor Kamila', 'Chua, Ling Ling', 'Lum, Su Han', 'Abdul Ghafar, Sayyidatul Syahirah', 'Kamarulzaman, Adeeba', 'Kamaruzzaman, Shahrul', 'Lewin, Sharon R', 'Woo, Yin Ling', 'Ariffin, Hany', 'Rajasuriar, Reena']","['Azanan MS', 'Abdullah NK', 'Chua LL', 'Lum SH', 'Abdul Ghafar SS', 'Kamarulzaman A', 'Kamaruzzaman S', 'Lewin SR', 'Woo YL', 'Ariffin H', 'Rajasuriar R']","['University Malaya Cancer Research Institute, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Paediatric Oncology Unit, University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Centre of Excellence for Research in AIDS, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'University Malaya Cancer Research Institute, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Paediatric Oncology Unit, University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'University Malaya Cancer Research Institute, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Centre of Excellence for Research in AIDS, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Alfred Hospital and Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'University Malaya Cancer Research Institute, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Centre of Excellence for Research in AIDS, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'University Malaya Cancer Research Institute, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Paediatric Oncology Unit, University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Centre of Excellence for Research in AIDS, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood/immunology', 'Biomarkers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunity', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood/immunology', 'Inflammation/etiology', 'Leukemia/complications/diagnosis/*immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Factors', '*Survivors', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2016/05/01 06:00,2017/07/01 06:00,['2016/05/01 06:00'],"['2016/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/01 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2016 Jul;46(7):1715-26. doi: 10.1002/eji.201646356.

METHODS: Children and young adults (3-21 years) with cancer or HIV infection were randomized to receive 2 doses of high-dose (HD) trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) or of standard-dose (SD) TIV. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers were measured against H1, H3, and B antigens after each dose and 9 months later. Seroconversion was defined as >/=4-fold rise in HAI titer comparing pre- and post-vaccine sera. Seroprotection was defined as a post-vaccine HAI titer >/=1:40. Reactogenicity events (RE) were solicited using a structured questionnaire 7 and 14 days after each dose of vaccine, and adverse events by medical record review for 21 days after each dose of vaccine. RESULTS: Eighty-five participants were enrolled in the study; 27 with leukemia, 17 with solid tumor (ST), and 41 with HIV. Recipients of HD TIV had significantly greater fold increase in HAI titers to B antigen in leukemia group and to H1 antigen in ST group compared to SD TIV recipients. This increase was not documented in HIV group. There were no differences in seroconversion or seroprotection between HD TIV and SD TIV in all groups. There was no difference in the percentage of solicited RE in recipients of HD TIV (54% after dose 1 and 38% after dose 2) compared to SD TIV (40% after dose 1 and 20% after dose 2, p=0.27 and 0.09 after dose 1 and 2, respectively). CONCLUSION: HD TIV was more immunogenic than SD TIV in children and young adults with leukemia or ST, but not with HIV. HD TIV was safe and well-tolerated in children and young adults with leukemia, ST, or HIV.","['Hakim, Hana', 'Allison, Kim J', 'Van de Velde, Lee-Ann', 'Tang, Li', 'Sun, Yilun', 'Flynn, Patricia M', 'McCullers, Jonathan A']","['Hakim H', 'Allison KJ', 'Van de Velde LA', 'Tang L', 'Sun Y', 'Flynn PM', 'McCullers JA']","[""Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA; Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA.

EVI1 is a zinc finger oncoprotein involved in the development of acute myeloid leukemia; previous work has shown it to interfere with the maturation of granulocytes from immature precursors. Here we investigate the mechanism by which that occurs, using an immortalized hematopoietic progenitor cell line, EML-C1, as a model system. We document that overexpression of EVI1 abrogates retinoic acid-induced maturation of EML cells into committed myeloid cells, a process that can be documented by the down-regulation of stem cell antigen-1 and acquisition of responsiveness to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. We show that this requires DNA binding capacity of EVI1, suggesting that downstream target genes are involved. We identify the myeloid regulator Cebpa as a target gene and identify two EVI1 binding regions within evolutionarily conserved enhancer elements at +35 and +37 kb relative to the gene. EVI1 can strongly suppress Cebpa transcription, and add-back of Cebpa into EVI1-expressing EML cells partially corrects the block in maturation. We identify the DNA sequences to which EVI1 binds at +35 and +37 kb and show that mutation of one of these releases Cebpa from EVI1-induced suppression. We observe a more complex picture in primary bone marrow cells, where EVI1 suppresses Cebpa in stem cells but not in more committed progenitors. Our data thus identify a regulatory node by which EVI1 contributes to leukemia, and this represents a possible therapeutic target for treatment of EVI1-expressing leukemia.","['Wilson, Michael', 'Tsakraklides, Vasiliki', 'Tran, Minh', 'Xiao, Ying-Yi', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Perkins, Archibald S']","['Wilson M', 'Tsakraklides V', 'Tran M', 'Xiao YY', 'Zhang Y', 'Perkins AS']","['From the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York 14642 and.', 'the Department of Pathology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520.', 'the Department of Pathology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520.', 'the Department of Pathology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520.', 'From the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York 14642 and yi_zhang@urmc.rochester.edu.', 'From the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York 14642 and archibald_perkins@urmc.rochester.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', '*Response Elements', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2016/04/30 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/04/30 06:00'],"['2016/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2016 Jun 24;291(26):13591-607. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M115.708156.

Nuclear antigen Sp100 (SPECKLED, 100 kDa), a constitutive component of the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies, plays key roles in intrinsic immunity and transcriptional repression. Sp100C, a splicing isoform specifically up-regulated upon interferon stimulation, harbors a unique tandem plant homeodomain (PHD) finger and bromodomain at its C terminus. Combining structural, quantitative binding, and cellular co-localization studies, we characterized Sp100C PHD finger as an unmethylated histone H3 Lys(4) (H3K4me0) reader that tolerates histone H3 Thr(3) phosphorylation (H3T3ph), histone H3 Lys(9) trimethylation (H3K9me3), and histone H3 Ser(10) phosphorylation (H3S10ph), hallmarks associated with the mitotic chromosome. In contrast, whereas H3K4me0 reader activity is conserved in Sp140, an Sp100C paralog, the multivalent tolerance of H3T3ph, H3K9me3, and H3S10ph was lost for Sp140. The complex structure determined at 2.1 A revealed a highly coordinated lysine -amine recognition sphere formed by an extended N-terminal motif for H3K4me0 readout. Interestingly, reader pocket rigidification by disulfide bond formation enhanced H3K4me0 binding by Sp100C. An additional complex structure solved at 2.7 A revealed that H3T3ph is recognized by the arginine residue, Arg(713), that is unique to the PHD finger of Sp100C. Consistent with a restrictive cellular role of Sp100C, these results establish a direct chromatin targeting function of Sp100C that may regulate transcriptional gene silencing and promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body-mediated intrinsic immunity in response to interferon stimulation.","['Zhang, Xiaojie', 'Zhao, Dan', 'Xiong, Xiaozhe', 'He, Zhimin', 'Li, Haitao']","['Zhang X', 'Zhao D', 'Xiong X', 'He Z', 'Li H']","['From the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Structural Biology, Department of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084 and.', 'From the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Structural Biology, Department of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084 and.', 'From the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Structural Biology, Department of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084 and.', 'From the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Structural Biology, Department of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084 and.', 'From the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Structural Biology, Department of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084 and; the Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.

Therefore, they operate under low oxygen conditions (hypoxia) in inflammatory and tumor environments. In vitro studies of NK cells are, however, commonly performed in ambient air (normoxia). We used global gene expression profiling to evaluate changes in transcriptional pathways in primary human NK cells following short term culture under hypoxia compared with normoxia and in response to interleukin 15 (IL-15) priming using a 2 x 2 factorial design. The largest contrasts observed were priming dependences for associations between hypoxia and the hypoxia-inducible factor (Hif) 1 signaling and glycolysis pathways. RT-PCR confirmed positive synergistic hypoxia/IL-15 interactions for genes of key regulatory and metabolic enzymes. IL-15 primes NK cells for effector functions, which were recently demonstrated to depend on glycolytic switching. We did not, however, observe important increases in glycolytic flux through hypoxia and priming alone. Chemical Hif-1alpha inhibition suggested equal importance of this transcription factor for glycolysis and energy production under normoxia and hypoxia. Hypoxia promoted secretion of CC chemokines Ccl3/4/5 and macrophage migration inhibitory factor. Unexpectedly, hypoxia also stimulated migration of NK cells through the extracellular matrix and shifted amounts of susceptible leukemia target cells toward late apoptosis in a cell killing assay. We conclude that short term hypoxia supports these activities by positively interacting with NK cell priming at the level of glycolytic gene transcription. Hypoxic conditioning of NK cells may thus benefit their use in cell-based immunotherapy of cancer.","['Velasquez, Sonia Y', 'Killian, Doreen', 'Schulte, Jutta', 'Sticht, Carsten', 'Thiel, Manfred', 'Lindner, Holger A']","['Velasquez SY', 'Killian D', 'Schulte J', 'Sticht C', 'Thiel M', 'Lindner HA']","['From the Department of Anesthesiology and Surgical Intensive Care Medicine, and.', 'From the Department of Anesthesiology and Surgical Intensive Care Medicine, and.', 'From the Department of Anesthesiology and Surgical Intensive Care Medicine, and.', 'Medical Research Center, University Medical Center Mannheim, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'From the Department of Anesthesiology and Surgical Intensive Care Medicine, and.', 'From the Department of Anesthesiology and Surgical Intensive Care Medicine, and holger.lindner@medma.uni-heidelberg.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Adoptive Transfer', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Survival', 'Chemokines/metabolism', 'Glycolysis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1/metabolism', 'Interleukin-15/*physiology', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*metabolism', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2016/04/30 06:00,2016/11/15 06:00,['2016/04/30 06:00'],"['2016/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/15 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2016 Jun 17;291(25):12960-77. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M116.721753.

We propose that some cancers may evade cell death by regulating 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which is associated with pro-apoptotic signaling. We hypothesize that leukemic cells possess mechanisms that efflux cAMP from the cytoplasm, thus protecting them from apoptosis. Accordingly, cAMP efflux inhibition should result in: cAMP accumulation, activation of cAMP-dependent downstream signaling, viability loss, and apoptosis. We developed a novel assay to assess cAMP efflux and performed screens to identify inhibitors. In an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model, several identified compounds reduced cAMP efflux, appropriately modulated pathways that are responsive to cAMP elevation (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein phosphorylation, and deactivation of Very Late Antigen-4 integrin), and induced mitochondrial depolarization and caspase activation. Blocking adenylyl cyclase activity was sufficient to reduce effects of the most potent compounds. These compounds also decreased cAMP efflux and viability of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cell lines and primary patient samples, but not of normal primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our data suggest that cAMP efflux is a functional feature that could be therapeutically targeted in leukemia.

Furthermore, hematological characteristics, cytogenetic abnormalities, and genetic mutation status were analyzed, followed by assessment of clinical impact. Our findings demonstrated that CTNNA1 hypermethylation was observed in 25% AML patients. Hypermethylation of the CTNNA1 promoter was associated with unfavorable karyotype, and also possessed the higher frequency of coexisting with ASXL1 and RUNX1 mutations. Patients with CTNNA1 hypermethylation exhibited the shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in the whole AML and non-M3 AML patients. Moreover, patients with the higher methylation levels had more aggressive course than those with relative lower levels. In multivariate analyses, CTNNA1 hypermethylation was an independent factor predicting for poor RFS, but not for OS.

Here, we present a young woman who developed ovarian failure after the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia with bone marrow transplant and preceding irradiation and chemotherapy and who was diagnosed with thin endometrial lining while seeking infertility therapy.","['Kudesia, Rashmi', 'Kuokkanen, Satu']","['Kudesia R', 'Kuokkanen S']","['a Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine , Bronx , NY , USA.', 'c RMA NY, Icahn School of Medicine , NY , USA.', 'a Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine , Bronx , NY , USA.', 'b Long Island IVF , Melville , NY , USA , and.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Gynecol Endocrinol,Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology,8807913,IM,"['Adult', 'Embryo Transfer', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/*etiology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*radiotherapy', 'Oocyte Donation', 'Pregnancy', 'Primary Ovarian Insufficiency/*etiology', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', '*Uterine Diseases/drug therapy/etiology/pathology']",2016/04/30 06:00,2017/05/11 06:00,['2016/04/30 06:00'],"['2016/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gynecol Endocrinol. 2016 Sep;32(9):701-703. doi: 10.1080/09513590.2016.1177813.

While m-CLL and n-CLL patients at large corresponded to patients carrying mutated and unmutated IGHV genes, respectively, limited information exists regarding the less defined i-CLL group. Using pyrosequencing, we investigated the prognostic impact of the proposed 5 CpG signature in a well-characterized CLL cohort (135 cases), including IGHV-mutated and unmutated patients as well as clinically aggressive stereotyped subset #2 patients. Overall, we confirmed the signature's association with established prognostic markers. Moreover, in the presence of the IGHV mutational status, the epigenetic signature remained independently associated with both time-to-first-treatment and overall survival in multivariate analyses. As a prime finding, we observed that subset #2 patients were predominantly classified as i-CLL, probably reflecting their borderline IGHV mutational status (97-99% germline identity), though having a similarly poor prognosis as n-CLL patients. In summary, we validated the epigenetic classifier as an independent factor in CLL prognostication and provide further evidence that subset #2 is a member of the i-CLL group, hence supporting the existence of a third, intermediate epigenetic subgroup.","['Bhoi, Sujata', 'Ljungstrom, Viktor', 'Baliakas, Panagiotis', 'Mattsson, Mattias', 'Smedby, Karin E', 'Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Mansouri, Larry']","['Bhoi S', 'Ljungstrom V', 'Baliakas P', 'Mattsson M', 'Smedby KE', 'Juliusson G', 'Rosenquist R', 'Mansouri L']","['a Department of Immunology , Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University , Sweden.', 'a Department of Immunology , Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University , Sweden.', 'a Department of Immunology , Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University , Sweden.', 'a Department of Immunology , Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University , Sweden.', 'b Department of Medical Sciences , Uppsala University , Uppsala , Sweden.', 'c Department of Medicine Solna , Clinical Epidemiology Unit, Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden.', 'd Department of Laboratory Medicine , Stem Cell Center, Hematology and Transplantation, Lund University , Lund , Sweden.', 'a Department of Immunology , Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University , Sweden.', 'a Department of Immunology , Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University , Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*standards', '*DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, B-Cell/*classification/diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",2016/04/30 06:00,2017/06/01 06:00,['2016/04/30 06:00'],"['2016/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Epigenetics. 2016 Jun 2;11(6):449-55. doi: 10.1080/15592294.2016.1178432.

The timing when these presentations start to occur prior to diagnosis is less clear. METHODS: In this nested case-control study, 1,025 and 334 children with lymphoid and myeloid leukaemia, respectively, were matched (1:30) to population-based controls by sex, region and year of birth. An index date was assigned for each control when the matched case was diagnosed. Healthcare access records of cases and controls in the year before the index date were extracted. RESULTS: Children with lymphoid leukaemia started to visit doctors more often at least 2 months before leukaemia diagnosis (P < 0.05). Various presentations were recorded in these visits: rates of haematological presentations, musculoskeletal presentations, and injuries started to increase significantly at least 3 months before diagnosis; rates of respiratory, gastrointestinal and urinary tract presentations did not increase significantly until the last month. The findings for myeloid lymphoma were less clear, but children appeared to visit doctors more often at least 4 months before diagnosis, and the rate of haematological presentations also started to increase at least 4 months before leukaemia diagnosis. Although haematological presentations were most strongly associated with undiagnosed leukaemia (odds ratio > 290 in the last month), the majority (>96%) of children with haematological presentations did not have leukaemia if they had not been diagnosed in their first visit. CONCLUSIONS: We described a clinical picture in the year before leukaemia diagnosis. These findings revealed ongoing difficulties in early diagnosis of childhood leukaemia in healthcare settings.","['Yang, TienYu Owen', 'Liu, Yen-Lin', 'Huang, Wan-Ting', 'Chen, Mei-Huei', 'Chen, Pau-Chung']","['Yang TO', 'Liu YL', 'Huang WT', 'Chen MH', 'Chen PC']","['Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei City, Taiwan.', 'Ph.D. Program in Translational Medicine, National Taiwan University and Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei City, Taiwan.', 'Office of Preventive Medicine, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, Taipei City, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, Yun-Lin Branch, Yunlin County, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, Taipei City, Taiwan.', 'Department of Public Health, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, Taipei City, Taiwan.', 'Department of Environmental and Occupational Medicine, College of Medicine and Hospital, National Taiwan University, Taipei City, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Lung Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Registries', 'Taiwan', 'Urologic Diseases/*diagnosis']",2016/04/30 06:00,2017/03/28 06:00,['2016/04/30 06:00'],"['2016/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/28 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Aug;63(8):1387-93. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26029.

Here, we report a retrospective international multicenter study of CLL patients treated with BR as front-line therapy. The cohort included 279 patients with progressive CLL from 33 centers (29 Italian, 3 Israeli and 1 German) who received at least 1 cycle of BR as first-line treatment during the 2008-2014 period. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BR administered as front-line therapy, outside of controlled clinical trials. Median age was 70 years (range, 43-86 years); 62.4% were males and 35.8% had Binet stage C. Forty-two patients (15.2%) were unfit (cumulative illness rating scale [CIRS] score >/=7), and 140 (50.2%) had creatinine clearance </=70 ml/min. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation analysis, available for 192 cases, showed that 21 (10.9%) had del11q and 18 (9.4%) del17p. The overall response rate (ORR) was 86.4%, with a complete remission rate of 28%. Patients with del17p had an ORR of 66.7%. After median follow-up of 24 months, the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 69.9%; CIRS >/=7, immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region (IGHV) unmutated status, del17p and BR dose intensity <80% were independently associated with shorter PFS. Grade III or IV neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia were observed in 25.9%, 15.4%, and 15.1% of patients, respectively. Twenty-four patients (8.6%) had severe infections. BR is also an effective and safe regimen for untreated CLL patients, outside of controlled clinical trials.","['Gentile, Massimo', 'Zirlik, Katja', 'Ciolli, Stefania', 'Mauro, Francesca R', 'Di Renzo, Nicola', 'Mastrullo, Lucia', 'Angrilli, Francesco', 'Molica, Stefano', 'Tripepi, Giovanni', 'Giordano, Annamaria', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Selleri, Carmine', 'Coscia, Marta', 'Musso, Maurizio', 'Orsucci, Lorella', 'Mannina, Donato', 'Rago, Angela', 'Giannotta, Angela', 'Ferrara, Felicetto', 'Herishanu, Yair', 'Shvidel, Lev', 'Tadmor, Tamar', 'Scortechini, Ilaria', 'Ilariucci, Fiorella', 'Murru, Roberta', 'Guarini, Attilio', 'Musuraca, Gerardo', 'Mineo, Giuseppe', 'Vincelli, Iolanda', 'Arcari, Annalisa', 'Tarantini, Giuseppe', 'Caparrotti, Giuseppe', 'Chiarenza, Annalisa', 'Levato, Luciano', 'Villa, Maria Rosaria', 'De Paolis, Maria Rosaria', 'Zinzani, Pier Luigi', 'Polliack, Aaron', 'Morabito, Fortunato']","['Gentile M', 'Zirlik K', 'Ciolli S', 'Mauro FR', 'Di Renzo N', 'Mastrullo L', 'Angrilli F', 'Molica S', 'Tripepi G', 'Giordano A', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Selleri C', 'Coscia M', 'Musso M', 'Orsucci L', 'Mannina D', 'Rago A', 'Giannotta A', 'Ferrara F', 'Herishanu Y', 'Shvidel L', 'Tadmor T', 'Scortechini I', 'Ilariucci F', 'Murru R', 'Guarini A', 'Musuraca G', 'Mineo G', 'Vincelli I', 'Arcari A', 'Tarantini G', 'Caparrotti G', 'Chiarenza A', 'Levato L', 'Villa MR', 'De Paolis MR', 'Zinzani PL', 'Polliack A', 'Morabito F']","['UOC Ematologia, Ospedale Annunziata, Cosenza, Italy.

We have previously demonstrated that B-cell receptor (BCR) engagement resulted in CXCR4 down-regulation in CLL cells, correlating with a shorter progression-free survival in patients. In this study, we show a simultaneous down-regulation of CXCR4, CXCR5 and CD62L upon BCR triggering. While concomitant CXCR4 and CXCR5 down-regulation involves PKDs, CD62L release relies on PKC activation. BCR engagement induces PI3K-delta-dependent phosphorylation of PKD2 and 3, which in turn phosphorylate CXCR4 Ser324/325. Moreover, upon BCR triggering, PKD phosphorylation levels correlate with the extent of membrane CXCR4 decrease. Inhibition of PKD activity restores membrane expression of CXCR4 and migration towards CXCL12 in BCR-responsive cells in vitro. In terms of pathophysiology, BCR-dependent CXCR4 down-regulation is observed in leukemic cells from patients with enlarged lymph nodes, irrespective of their IGHV mutational status. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PKD-mediated CXCR4 internalization induced by BCR engagement in B-CLL is associated with lymph node enlargement and suggest PKD as a potential druggable target for CLL therapeutics.","['Saint-Georges, Stephane', 'Quettier, Maude', 'Bouyaba, Marouane', 'Le Coquil, Stephanie', 'Lauriente, Vanessa', 'Guittat, Lionel', 'Levy, Vincent', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista, Florence', 'Varin-Blank, Nadine', 'Le Roy, Christine', 'Ledoux, Dominique']","['Saint-Georges S', 'Quettier M', 'Bouyaba M', 'Le Coquil S', 'Lauriente V', 'Guittat L', 'Levy V', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista F', 'Varin-Blank N', 'Le Roy C', 'Ledoux D']","['INSERM U978, Bobigny, France.', 'Universite Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Labex ""Inflamex"", Bobigny, France.', 'INSERM U978, Bobigny, France.', 'Universite Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Labex ""Inflamex"", Bobigny, France.', 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Avicenne, Unite de Recherche Clinique, Bobigny, France.', 'INSERM U978, Bobigny, France.', 'Universite Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Labex ""Inflamex"", Bobigny, France.', 'INSERM U978, Bobigny, France.', 'Universite Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Labex ""Inflamex"", Bobigny, France.', 'INSERM U978, Bobigny, France.', 'Universite Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Labex ""Inflamex"", Bobigny, France.', 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Avicenne, Unite de Recherche Clinique, Bobigny, France.', 'INSERM U978, Bobigny, France.', 'Universite Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Labex ""Inflamex"", Bobigny, France.', ""Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Avicenne, Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Bobigny, France."", 'INSERM U978, Bobigny, France.', 'Universite Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Labex ""Inflamex"", Bobigny, France.', 'INSERM U978, Bobigny, France.', 'Universite Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Labex ""Inflamex"", Bobigny, France.', 'INSERM U978, Bobigny, France.', 'Universite Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Labex ""Inflamex"", Bobigny, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphadenopathy/complications/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2016/04/30 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2016/04/30 06:00'],"['2015/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jul 5;7(27):41031-41046. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9031.,10.18632/oncotarget.9031 [doi],,"['0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'EC 2.7.10.- (protein kinase D)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",PMC5173040,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell receptor', 'CLL', 'CXCR4/CXCR5', 'lymphadenopathy', 'protein kinase D']","['CONFLICTS OF INTERESTSSG, MQ, MB, SLC, VLa, LG, NVB, CLR and DL declare no', 'conflict of interest concerning this article.

In serum containing conventional culture, an exogenous cytokine, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), is absolutely essential for the maintenance of pluripotency. In contrast, in serum-free culture with simultaneous inhibition of Map-kinase and Gsk3 (so called 2i-culture), LIF is no longer required.

The type of interaction between alpha-TOS and SSe was evaluated and levels of oxidative stress and apoptotic and autophagic markers were determined. SSe alone showed varying degrees of cytotoxicity on all the tested cell lines. Its combination with alpha-TOS was antagonistic in vitro in MCF7 and in vivo in mice bearing Ehrlich tumor compared to alpha-TOS-treated one. Combination of TOS with 2 muM of SSe increased the level of glutathione without changes in antiapoptotic markers Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 at 16 and 48 hrs. SSe decreased caspase 3 activity and protein level of caspases 7 and 9, while it increased autophagic markers beclin-1 and LC3B protein levels of MCF7 cells treated with alpha-TOS.

Recent evidence indicates that microvesicles (MVs) released from cancer stem cells can promote tumor growth and invasion. In this study, we investigated whether LSCs-released MVs (LMVs) can regulate the malignance of AML cells and whether overexpression of tumor suppressive microRNA (miR), miR34a, is able to interrupt this process. LSCs were transfected with miRNA control (miRCtrl) or miR34a mimic for producing LMVs, respectively, defined as LMVs(miRCtrl) and LMVs(miR34a). The effect of miR34a transfection on LSC proliferation and the effects of LMVs(miRCtrl) or LMVs(miR34a) on the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of AML cells (after LSC depletion) were determined. The levels of miR34a targets, caspase-3 and T cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (Tim-3), were analyzed. Results showed that (1) LMVs(miRCtrl) promoted proliferation and migration and inhibited apoptosis of AML cells, which were associated with miR34a deficit; (2) transfection of miR34a mimic inhibited LSC proliferation and increased miR34a level in LMVs(miR34a); (3) LMVs(miR34a) produced opposite effects as compared with LMVs(miRCtrl), which were associated with the changes of caspase-3 and Tim-3 levels. In summary, LMVs support AML cell malignance and modulating miR34a could offer a new approach for the management of AML.","['Wang, Yue', 'Cheng, Qian', 'Liu, Jing', 'Dong, Min']","['Wang Y', 'Cheng Q', 'Liu J', 'Dong M']","['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical College, Guilin, Guangxi 541001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha 410013, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha 410013, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical College, Guilin, Guangxi 541001, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Stem Cells Int,Stem cells international,101535822,,,2016/04/30 06:00,2016/04/30 06:01,['2016/04/30 06:00'],"['2016/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/30 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Stem Cells Int. 2016;2016:9313425. doi: 10.1155/2016/9313425.

In this study, we demonstrated that a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) agonist-fused antigen increased antigen presentation via TLR2 signaling and induced effector memory-like CD8+ T cells against cancer after immunization. The N-terminus of ovalbumin (OVA) was biologically fused with a bacterial lipid moiety TLR2 agonist to produce a recombinant lipidated ovalbumin (rlipo-OVA). We demonstrated that rlipo-OVA activated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DCs) maturation and increased antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I via TLR2. After immunization, rlipo-OVA skewed the immune response towards T helper (Th) 1 and induced OVA-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. Moreover, immunization with rlipo-OVA induced higher numbers of effector memory (CD44+CD62L-) CD8+ T cells compared with recombinant ovalbumin (rOVA) alone or rOVA mixed with the TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4. Accordingly, the CD27+CD43+ effector memory CD8+ T cells expressed high levels of the long-lived CD127 marker. The administration of rlipo-OVA could inhibit tumor growth, but the anti-tumor effects were lost after the depletion of CD8 or CD127 cells in vivo. These findings suggested that the TLR2 agonist-fused antigen induced long-lived memory CD8+ T cells for efficient cancer therapy.","['Wu, Chiao-Chieh', 'Liu, Shih-Jen', 'Chen, Hsin-Wei', 'Shen, Kuan-Yin', 'Leng, Chih-Hsiang']","['Wu CC', 'Liu SJ', 'Chen HW', 'Shen KY', 'Leng CH']","['Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei 114, Taiwan.', 'National Institute of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology, National Health Research Institutes, Miaoli County 350, Taiwan.', 'National Institute of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology, National Health Research Institutes, Miaoli County 350, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Immunology, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan.', 'National Institute of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology, National Health Research Institutes, Miaoli County 350, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Immunology, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan.', 'National Institute of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology, National Health Research Institutes, Miaoli County 350, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei 114, Taiwan.', 'National Institute of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology, National Health Research Institutes, Miaoli County 350, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Immunology, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'CD8 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Interleukin-7 Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Lipopeptides/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/genetics', 'Ovalbumin/*immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/*agonists/genetics/metabolism']",2016/04/30 06:00,2017/12/30 06:00,['2016/04/30 06:00'],"['2015/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 May 24;7(21):30804-19. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9001.,10.18632/oncotarget.9001 [doi],,"['0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Interleukin-7 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Myd88 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)', '0 (Pam(3)CSK(4) peptide)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tlr2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)']",PMC5058719,['NOTNLM'],"['Toll-like receptor 2', 'antigen presentation', 'memory T cells', 'rlipo-immunogen', 'tumor regression']",['No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.'],"['9001 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9001 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMMARY: More than one dozen oral oncology medications are being used for hematologic malignancies and afford patients increased convenience and the potential to improve their quality of life. These agents include ibrutinib, idelalisib, imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, ponatinib, thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, panobinostat, ixazomib, and vorinostat. Despite the benefits of an autonomous-driven patient care plan, these high-risk, high-cost treatments are not without their challenges. Oral oncology medications are associated with significant barriers to adherence, including low health literacy, patient forgetfulness, complex administration instructions, troublesome adverse effects, and high copayments. Many outpatient cancer center pharmacies associated with large academic medical centers are now applying for specialty pharmacy designation. This affords the onsite dispensing pharmacy access to once-limited oral oncology medications that can be dispensed to clinic patients. In addition, the specialty pharmacy services offered within these cancer centers bridge an important gap in patient care and improve the care provided to oncology patients. CONCLUSION: As oral oncology agents continue to be approved by FDA, oncology treatment teams must establish a comprehensive plan for their management. Because of their pharmacologic expertise, access to patients' medical records, and unique position within ambulatory care oncology teams, pharmacists can play an important role in patient education, laboratory monitoring, medication adherence, and cost saving.","['Fajardo, Susan', 'Zook, Felicia', 'Dotson, Emily']","['Fajardo S', 'Zook F', 'Dotson E']","['Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, IA susan-fajardo@uiowa.edu.', 'Froedtert and the Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', 'James Cancer Hospital, Ohio State Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Am J Health Syst Pharm,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,9503023,IM,"['Academic Medical Centers/*methods/trends', 'Administration, Oral', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Dasatinib/administration & dosage', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Pharmaceutical Services/trends', '*Pharmacists/trends', 'Pharmacy Service, Hospital/*methods/trends']",2016/04/30 06:00,2017/01/21 06:00,['2016/04/30 06:00'],"['2016/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/21 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2016 Jun 1;73(11):797-809. doi: 10.2146/ajhp150749.

METHODS: Using ten human AML cell lines, we conducted a high-throughput screen to identify antimalarial agents with antileukemic activity. We evaluated effects of ART and DHA on cell viability, cytotoxicity, apoptosis, lysosomal integrity, and combination effects with cytarabine in cell lines and primary patient blasts. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies and efficacy of single-agent ART or combination with cytarabine were evaluated in three xenograft models. RESULTS: ART and DHA had the most potent activity in a panel of AML cell lines, with selectivity toward samples harboring MLL rearrangements and FLT3-ITD mutations. Combination of ART or DHA was synergistic with cytarabine. Single-dose ART (120 mg/kg) produced human equivalent exposures, but multiple dose daily administration required for in vivo efficacy was not tolerated. Combination treatment produced initial regression, but did not prolong survival in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacology of artemisinins is problematic and should be considered in designing AML treatment strategies with currently available agents. Artemisinins with improved pharmacokinetic properties may offer therapeutic benefit in combination with conventional therapeutic strategies in AML.","['Drenberg, Christina D', 'Buaboonnam, Jassada', 'Orwick, Shelley J', 'Hu, Shuiying', 'Li, Lie', 'Fan, Yiping', 'Shelat, Anang A', 'Guy, R Kiplin', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey', 'Baker, Sharyn D']","['Drenberg CD', 'Buaboonnam J', 'Orwick SJ', 'Hu S', 'Li L', 'Fan Y', 'Shelat AA', 'Guy RK', 'Rubnitz J', 'Baker SD']","['Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, 500 W. 12th St., Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, 500 W. 12th St., Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Chemical Biology and Therapeutics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Chemical Biology and Therapeutics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, 500 W. 12th St., Columbus, OH, 43210, USA. baker.2480@osu.edu.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA. baker.2480@osu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Artemisinins/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Artesunate', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lysosomes/drug effects/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2016/04/30 06:00,2017/02/09 06:00,['2016/04/30 06:00'],"['2015/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2016 Jun;77(6):1231-43. doi: 10.1007/s00280-016-3038-2.

It can occur in any organ. Common sites are skin, bone, lymph nodes, and soft tissue. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is very uncommon. We report 12 new pathology-confirmed cases of CNS MS with literature review. Median age was 42.5 years (range: 0 - 84 years). Bone marrow involvement by hematologic neoplasia was co-incidental (n = 8) or occurred 8 - 51 months prior to CNS MS (n = 3). Abnormal radiological findings detected in all patients, included hemorrhagic (n = 5) or enhancing (n = 2) lesions, with multiple ring-enhancing dura-based masses in 1 patient. Seven tumors had abnormal cytogenetics including: t(11; 19) (q23; p13.3), +8, inv (16), t(9; 22), t(8; 21), del(5q), and +21. One had a complex karyotype and 2 were cytogenetically normal. One MS had the JAK2V617F mutation. Treatment modalities included surgery for decompression (n = 2), radiotherapy (n = 2), chemotherapy (n = 6), and stem cell transplant (n = 2). Nine patients died days to 12 months post CNS MS diagnosis (median = 4 months). Two patients were alive without evidence of disease at 16 and 50 months following MS diagnosis and one was lost to follow-up. The clinical and imaging features for CMS MS overlap with those of intracranial hemorrhage and primary CNS tumors. It is therefore important to maintain a high index of suspicion and perform a biopsy whenever clinically appropriate. A meticulous workup is necessary to avoid misdiagnosis of other hematopoietic or nonhematopoietic neoplasms. Since CNS MS is potentially curable, timely recognition is paramount.","['Olar, Adriana', 'Lapadat, Razvan', 'Davidson, Christian J', 'Stein, Thor D', 'Dahiya, Sonika', 'Perry, Arie', 'Gheorghe, Gabriela']","['Olar A', 'Lapadat R', 'Davidson CJ', 'Stein TD', 'Dahiya S', 'Perry A', 'Gheorghe G']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Clin Neuropathol,Clinical neuropathology,8214420,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*pathology']",2016/04/30 06:00,2017/02/09 06:00,['2016/04/30 06:00'],"['2016/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Clin Neuropathol. 2016 Sep-Oct;35(5):314-25. doi: 10.5414/NP300949.,10.5414/NP300949 [doi],,,,,,,"['14367 [pii]', '10.5414/NP300949 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peptide concentrates were obtained by hydrolysis of spent brewer's yeast proteins followed by a filtration process. In order to prove the possible protection of gastric mucosa, an animal model with ulcerative lesions caused by oral administration of absolute ethanol was used. The peptide fraction <3 kDa was able to reduce gastric injuries to significant levels (p < 0.001) and the effective dose (DE50) was 816 mg per kg bw. The cytoprotective effect appears to depend on a prostaglandin-mediated mechanism and also on a nonspecific mechanism. The antiproliferative activity of the extract in nine different human tumoral cell lines was tested. The results exhibited a promising antiproliferative activity against the cell line K-562 (leukemia).

The trafficking of puromycin-conjugated (puromycylated) immature polypeptides within cell has, however, remained elusive. In this study, using O-propargyl-puromycin (OP-Puro), the distribution of puromycylated polypeptides was assessed in HeLa cells by click chemistry. Under standard culture conditions, OP-Puro signals were detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus with the highest concentrations in the nucleolus. Intriguingly, when proteasome activities were aborted using MG132, OP-Puro signals began to accumulate at promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) in addition to the nucleolus. We also found promiscuous association of OP-Puro signals with SUMO-2/3 and ubiquitin at PML-NBs, but not at the nucleolus, during abortive proteasome activities. This study reveals a previously unknown distribution of OP-Puro that argues for a nuclear function in regulating immature protein homeostasis.","['Uozumi, Naoki', 'Matsumoto, Hotaru', 'Saitoh, Hisato']","['Uozumi N', 'Matsumoto H', 'Saitoh H']","['Course for Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Course for Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Course for Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.

Single-use technology can offer significant benefits over stainless such as operational flexibility, reduced capital infrastructure costs, and increased efficiency by minimizing the time and validation requirements associated with hardware cleaning. This study qualifies a single-use bag system for solvent/detergent (S/D) virus inactivation. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Human plasma and immunoglobulin test materials were S/D-treated in Mobius single-use bags using 1% tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP) with 1% Triton X-100 or 1% Tween 80 at 31 degrees C for 4 to 6 hours to evaluate the impact on protein quality. Volatile and nonvolatile organic leachables from low-density polyethylene film (Pureflex film) used in 1-L-scale studies after exposure to S/D in phosphate-buffered saline were identified compared to controls in glass containers. Virus inactivation studies were performed with xenotropic murine leukemia virus (XMuLV) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) to determine the kinetics of virus inactivation, measured using infectivity assays. RESULTS: S/D treatment in Mobius bags did not impact the protein content and profile of plasma and immunoglobulin, including proteolytic enzymes and thrombin generation. Cumulative leachable levels after exposure to S/D were 1.5 and 1.85 ppm when using 0.3% TnBP combined with 1% Tween 80 or 1% Triton X-100, respectively. Efficient inactivation of both XMuLV and BVDV was observed, with differences in the rate of inactivation dependent on both virus and S/D mixture. CONCLUSION: Effective S/D virus inactivation in single-use container technology is achievable. It does not alter plasma proteins and induces minimal release of leachables.","['Hsieh, Yao-Ting', 'Mullin, Lori', 'Greenhalgh, Patricia', 'Cunningham, Michael', 'Goodrich, Elizabeth', 'Shea, Jessica', 'Youssef, Eric', 'Burnouf, Thierry']","['Hsieh YT', 'Mullin L', 'Greenhalgh P', 'Cunningham M', 'Goodrich E', 'Shea J', 'Youssef E', 'Burnouf T']","['Graduate Institute of Biomedical Materials and Tissue Engineering, College of Biomedical Engineering, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan;', 'Virology and Microbiological Sciences, EMD Millipore Corporation, Bedford, Massachusetts;', 'Virology and Microbiological Sciences, EMD Millipore Corporation, Bedford, Massachusetts;', 'Biomanufacturing Sciences Network, Application Engineering Group, and, EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, Massachusetts.', 'Biomanufacturing Sciences Network, Application Engineering Group, and, EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, Massachusetts.', 'Provantage Lab Services, EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, Massachusetts.', 'Merck KGaA Life Sciences, Molsheim, France.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Materials and Tissue Engineering, College of Biomedical Engineering, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Detergents/*pharmacology', 'Diarrhea Viruses, Bovine Viral', 'Humans', 'Industry', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Mice', 'Plasma/microbiology', 'Solvents/pharmacology', 'Virus Inactivation/*drug effects']",2016/04/30 06:00,2017/06/22 06:00,['2016/04/30 06:00'],"['2015/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2016 Jun;56(6):1384-93. doi: 10.1111/trf.13619.

We used NSG mice in which ceramic scaffolds seeded with human mesenchymal stromal cells were implanted to generate a human bone marrow (huBM-sc)-like niche. We observed that, in contrast to the murine bone marrow (mBM) niche, the expression of BCR-ABL or MLL-AF9 was sufficient to induce both primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Stemness was preserved within the human niches as demonstrated by serial transplantation assays. Efficient engraftment of AML MLL-AF9 and blast-crisis chronic myeloid leukemia patient cells was also observed, whereby the immature blast-like phenotype was maintained in the huBM-sc niche but to a much lesser extent in mBM niches. We compared transcriptomes of leukemias derived from mBM niches versus leukemias from huBM-like scaffold-based niches, which revealed striking differences in the expression of genes associated with hypoxia, mitochondria and metabolism. Finally, we utilized the huBM-sc MLL-AF9 B-ALL model to evaluate the efficacy of the I-BET151 inhibitor in vivo. In conclusion, we have established human niche models in which the myeloid and lymphoid features of BCR-ABL(+) and MLL-AF9(+) leukemias can be studied in detail.","['Sontakke, P', 'Carretta, M', 'Jaques, J', 'Brouwers-Vos, A Z', 'Lubbers-Aalders, L', 'Yuan, H', 'de Bruijn, J D', 'Martens, A C M', 'Vellenga, E', 'Groen, R W J', 'Schuringa, J J']","['Sontakke P', 'Carretta M', 'Jaques J', 'Brouwers-Vos AZ', 'Lubbers-Aalders L', 'Yuan H', 'de Bruijn JD', 'Martens AC', 'Vellenga E', 'Groen RW', 'Schuringa JJ']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen (CRCG), University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen (CRCG), University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen (CRCG), University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen (CRCG), University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Xpand Biotechnology BV, Bilthoven, The Netherlands.', 'Queen Mary University of London, School of Engineering and Materials Science (SEMS), London, UK.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen (CRCG), University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen (CRCG), University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Disease Models, Animal', '*Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', '*Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2016/04/30 06:00,2017/08/08 06:00,['2016/04/30 06:00'],"['2015/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Oct;30(10):2064-2073. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.108.

We here found that Notch1 activation at the fetal liver (FL) stage expanded the hematopoietic progenitor population and conferred it transplantable leukemic-initiating capacity. However, leukemogenesis and leukemic-initiating cell capacity induced by Notch1 was critically dependent on the levels of beta-Catenin in both FL and adult bone marrow contexts. In addition, inhibition of beta-Catenin compromised survival and proliferation of human T-ALL cell lines carrying activated Notch1. By transcriptome analyses, we identified the MYC pathway as a crucial element downstream of beta-Catenin in these T-ALL cells and demonstrate that the MYC 3' enhancer required beta-Catenin and Notch1 recruitment to induce transcription.

We show here that BMI1 expression is important for proliferation and survival of Ph+ ALL cells and for leukemogenesis of Ph+ cells in vivo. Levels of BIM, interferon-alpha (IFNalpha)-regulated genes and E2F7 were upregulated in BMI1-silenced cells, suggesting that repressing their expression is important for BMI1 biological effects. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that: (i) downregulation of BIM or E2F7 abrogated apoptosis or rescued, in part, the reduced proliferation and colony formation of BMI1 silenced BV173 cells; (ii) BIM/E2F7 double silencing further enhanced colony formation and in vivo leukemogenesis of BMI1-silenced cells; (iii) overexpression of BIM and E2F7 mimicked the effect of BMI1 silencing in BV173 and SUP-B15 cells; and (iv) treatment with IFNalpha suppressed proliferation and colony formation of Ph+ ALL cells. These studies indicate that the growth-promoting effects of BMI1 in Ph+ ALL cells depend on suppression of multiple pathways and support the use of IFNalpha in the therapy of Ph+ ALL.","['Mariani, S A', 'Minieri, V', 'De Dominici, M', 'Iacobucci, I', 'Peterson, L F', 'Calabretta, B']","['Mariani SA', 'Minieri V', 'De Dominici M', 'Iacobucci I', 'Peterson LF', 'Calabretta B']","['Department of Cancer Biology and Sydney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Sydney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Sydney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Sydney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacokinetics', 'Mice', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology']",2016/04/30 06:00,2017/08/29 06:00,['2016/04/30 06:00'],"['2015/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/03 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/29 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Aug;30(8):1682-90. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.70.

Since tablets may be difficult for children and elderly patients to swallow, many pharmacists have compounded mercaptopurine suspensions. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved a commercial suspension, but it is not widely available at this time. Therefore, pharmacists may still need to compound mercaptopurine suspension for use in areas where it is not available or if the commercial suspension is in short supply. Stability studies must be conducted in order to assign appropriate beyond-use dates for compounded preparations. The objective of this study was to evaluate the stability of extemporaneously compounded suspensions using commercially available mercaptopurine tablets, as well as active pharmaceutical ingredient in a vehicle of Ora-Sweet and Ora-Plus (1:1) stored in plastic and glass containers at room temperature. Each mercaptopurine preparation was analyzed using a validated stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography method at the following time points: 0, 7, 14, 21, 30, 60, and 90 days. Suspensions were also observed for changes in appearance or odor, and pH was tested at each time point. The suspension compounded from Roxane generic tablets was extremely viscous and was therefore eliminated from the study. All other suspensions showed no observed physical changes and maintained greater than 93% of initial concentration of mercaptopurine for the entire study period.","['Peacock, Gina F', 'Sauvageot, Jurgita', 'Hill, Ashley', 'Killian, Alyssa']","['Peacock GF', 'Sauvageot J', 'Hill A', 'Killian A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",United States,Int J Pharm Compd,International journal of pharmaceutical compounding,9706294,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical/methods', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*methods', 'Drug Compounding/*methods', 'Drug Packaging', 'Drug Stability', 'Drug Storage', 'Excipients/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Suspensions', 'Tablets', 'Time Factors', 'Viscosity']",2016/04/30 06:00,2016/05/14 06:00,['2016/04/30 06:00'],"['2016/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Int J Pharm Compd. 2016 Jan-Feb;20(1):81-5.,,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Excipients)', '0 (Suspensions)', '0 (Tablets)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We describe 14 patients with PEL that represented progression from a preexisting myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, n = 8) or myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN, n = 6), three of which manifested as erythroblastic sarcoma (EBS), a rare entity. These patients had a highly complex karyotype with prominent clonal evolution and a very aggressive clinical course. RESULTS: Patients with PEL from MDS showed a more rapid progression time to PEL and had lower platelet counts compared with PEL from MPN. No other significant differences were found between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data represent the largest cohort of patients with PEL and an antecedent CMN, as well as the largest series of EBS reported to date, and underscore the unique morphologic, cytogenetic, immunophenotypic, and clinical features of this uncommon entity.","['Li, Hongmei', 'Hasserjian, Robert P', 'Kroft, Steven H', 'Harrington, Alexandra M', 'Wheaton, Susan E', 'Pildain, Alex', 'Ewalt, Mark D', 'Gratzinger, Dita', 'Hosking, Paul', 'Olteanu, Horatiu']","['Li H', 'Hasserjian RP', 'Kroft SH', 'Harrington AM', 'Wheaton SE', 'Pildain A', 'Ewalt MD', 'Gratzinger D', 'Hosking P', 'Olteanu H']","['From the Department of Pathology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.', 'From the Department of Pathology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.', 'From the Department of Pathology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.', 'Department of Pathology, Allina Health, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Department of Pathology, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, Dallas.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'From the Department of Pathology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.', 'From the Department of Pathology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee holteanu@mcw.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*pathology']",2016/04/29 06:00,2017/02/24 06:00,['2016/04/29 06:00'],"['2016/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2016 Apr;145(4):538-51. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqw033.

Our aim was to characterize cases of isolated del(20q) in bone marrow biopsy specimens from patients with a history of chemotherapy with morphologic findings insufficient for a diagnosis of MDS. METHODS: In this retrospective study from one institution, we identified 22 patients with isolated del(20q) and no or minimal dysplasia and evaluated clinical and pathologic characteristics. RESULTS: Eleven of the patients had a history of chemotherapy for mostly lymphoproliferative disorders. There were no statistically significant differences in peripheral blood or bone marrow features between patients with a history of chemotherapy and those without. Three patients with a history of chemotherapy had died at last follow-up; cause of death was recurrent nonmyeloid neoplasm. None of the patients with a history of chemotherapy subsequently developed a high-grade myeloid neoplasm, whereas one of the patients who had not received prior chemotherapy developed refractory anemia with excess blasts 2. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of del(20q) as an isolated bone marrow cytogenetic abnormality in the absence of morphologic findings sufficient for a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia, myeloproliferative neoplasm, or MDS portends an indolent clinical course, regardless of previous exposure to chemotherapy.","['Courville, Elizabeth L', 'Singh, Charanjeet', 'Yohe, Sophia', 'Linden, Michael A', 'Naemi, Kaveh', 'Berger, Michael', 'Ustun, Celalettin', 'McKenna, Robert W', 'Dolan, Michelle']","['Courville EL', 'Singh C', 'Yohe S', 'Linden MA', 'Naemi K', 'Berger M', 'Ustun C', 'McKenna RW', 'Dolan M']","['From the Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology.', 'From the Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology.', 'From the Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology.', 'From the Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology.', 'From the Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology.', 'From the Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology.', 'Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.', 'From the Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology.', 'From the Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology dolan009@umn.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/genetics/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/29 06:00,2017/02/24 06:00,['2016/04/29 06:00'],"['2016/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2016 Apr;145(4):459-66. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqw024.

We evaluate the utility of NGS in myeloid malignancies. METHODS: A 42-gene panel was used to sequence 109 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, n = 38), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML, n = 14), myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN, n = 24), and MDS and/or MPN transformed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n = 33). RESULTS: At least one pathogenic mutation was identified in 74% of cases of MDS, 100% of CMMLs, and 96% of MPNs. In contrast, only 47% of cases of MDS (18/38) and 7% (1/14) of CMMLs exhibited abnormal cytogenetics. In diagnostically difficult cases of MDS or CMML with normal cytogenetics, NGS identified a pathogenic mutation and was critical in establishing the correct diagnosis. Spliceosomal genes and epigenetic modifiers were frequently mutated. Spliceosome mutations were also frequently detected in AML arising from MDS, CMML, or MPN (39%) compared with the reported rate in de novo AML (7%-14%). CONCLUSIONS: In difficult cases of MDS or MPN, NGS facilitates diagnosis by detection of gene mutations to confirm clonality, and AMLs evolving from MDS or MPN carry frequent mutations in spliceosomal genes.","['Reinig, Erica', 'Yang, Fei', 'Traer, Elie', 'Arora, Ranjana', 'Brown, Shari', 'Rattray, Rogan', 'Braziel, Rita', 'Fan, Guang', 'Press, Richard', 'Dunlap, Jennifer']","['Reinig E', 'Yang F', 'Traer E', 'Arora R', 'Brown S', 'Rattray R', 'Braziel R', 'Fan G', 'Press R', 'Dunlap J']","['From the Department of Pathology.', 'Knight Cancer Institute.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland.', 'From the Department of Pathology, Knight Cancer Institute.', 'From the Department of Pathology, Knight Cancer Institute.', 'Knight Cancer Institute.', 'From the Department of Pathology, Knight Cancer Institute.', 'From the Department of Pathology, Knight Cancer Institute.', 'From the Department of Pathology, Knight Cancer Institute.', 'From the Department of Pathology, Knight Cancer Institute, dunlapj@ohsu.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods', 'Female', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Spliceosomes', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/29 06:00,2017/02/24 06:00,['2016/04/29 06:00'],"['2016/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2016 Apr;145(4):497-506. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqw016.

The histopathologic features of CALR-mutated MPNs are unknown. METHODS: We identified 71 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), and post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (post-ET MF) with available CALR status. CALR was assessed using capillary electrophoresis followed by Sanger sequencing confirmation. CALR status was correlated with histopathologic features. RESULTS: The megakaryocytes of CALR-mutated PMF more often were hyperchromatic (20/21) compared with CALR-wt cases (10/14) (P = .05). CALR-mutated ET showed more megakaryocytic clustering (7/7) compared with CALR-wt cases (5/9) (P = 03). Megakaryocytes of CALR-mutated post-ET MF (8/8) had a predominance of convoluted nuclei compared with CALR-wt cases (2/4) (P = .03). CALR mutations were more frequent in post-ET MF compared with ET (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: CALR-mutated MPNs have a higher frequency of megakaryocytic aberrancies compared with CALR-wt cases.

The establishment of CMV-specific immunity controls viral reactivation and leads to the accumulation of very large numbers of virus-specific T cells which come to dominate the immune repertoire. There is concern that this may reduce the immune response to heterologous infections and HCMV infection has been associated with reduced survival in elderly people. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) suffer from a state of immune suppression but have a paradoxical increase in the magnitude of the CMV-specific T cell and humoral immune response. As such, there is now considerable interest in how CMV infection impacts on the clinical outcome of patients with B-CLL. Utilizing a large prospective cohort of patients with B-CLL (n = 347) we evaluated the relationship between HCMV seropositivity and patient outcome. HCMV seropositive patients had significantly worse overall survival than HCMV negative patients in univariate analysis (HR = 2.28, 95% CI: 1.34-3.88; P = 0.002). However, CMV seropositive patients were 4 years older than seronegative donors and this survival difference was lost in multivariate modeling adjusted for age and other validated prognostic markers (P = 0.34). No significant difference was found in multivariate modeling between HCMV positive and negative patients in relation to the time to first treatment (HR = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.68-1.84; P = 0.65). These findings in a second independent cohort of 236 B-CLL patients were validated. In conclusion no evidence that HCMV impacts on the clinical outcome of patients with B-CLL was found. Am. J.

Here, we report a computational method to evaluate the nucleosome sensitivity for a transcription factor over a given stretch of the genome. Sensitive factors are predicted to be those with binding sites preferentially contained within nucleosome boundaries and lacking 10 bp periodicity. Based on these criteria, the Acute Myeloid Leukemia-1a (AML-1a) transcription factor, a regulator of immune gene expression, was identified as potentially sensitive to nucleosomal regulation within the mouse Ly49 gene family. This result was confirmed in RMA, a cell line with natural expression of Ly49, using MNase-Seq to generate a nucleosome map of chromosome 6, where the Ly49 gene family is located. Analysis of this map revealed a specific depletion of nucleosomes at AML-1a binding sites in the expressed Ly49A when compared to the other, silent Ly49 genes. Our data suggest that nucleosome-based regulation contributes to the expression of Ly49 genes, and we propose that this method of predicting nucleosome sensitivity could aid in dissecting the regulatory role of nucleosomes in general.","['Wight, Andrew', 'Yang, Doo', 'Ioshikhes, Ilya', 'Makrigiannis, Andrew P']","['Wight A', 'Yang D', 'Ioshikhes I', 'Makrigiannis AP']","['Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute of Systems Biology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute of Systems Biology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Computational Biology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Multigene Family', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily A/*genetics', 'Nucleosomes/*genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",2016/04/29 06:00,2017/03/21 06:00,['2016/04/29 06:00'],"['2015/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/21 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2016 Apr 28;12(4):e1004894. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004894. eCollection 2016 Apr.,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004894 [doi],20160428,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily A)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",PMC4849748,,,,"['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004894 [doi]', 'PCOMPBIOL-D-15-02147 [pii]']",,,,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3116-8722'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Downstream targets of MLL are aberrantly upregulated and include the developmentally important HOX genes and MEIS1, as well as multiple microRNAs (miRNAs), including the miR-17 approximately 92 cluster. Here we examined the contribution of specific miRNAs to MLL leukemias through knockdown studies utilizing custom anti-microRNA oligonucleotides. Combinatorial treatment against miR-17-5p and miR-19a-3p of the miR-17 approximately 92 cluster dramatically reduces colony forming ability of MLL-fusion containing cell lines relative to non-MLL acute myeloid leukemia (AML) controls. To determine the mechanism by which these miRNAs contribute to leukemia, we validated PKNOX1 as a target of both miR-17-5p and miR-19a-3p. MEIS1 and PKNOX1 are TALE domain proteins that participate in ternary complexes with HOX and PBX partners. Here we establish the competitive relationship between PKNOX1 and MEIS1 in PBX-containing complex formation and determine the antagonistic role of PKNOX1 to leukemia in a murine MLL-AF9 model. These data implicate the miR-17 approximately 92 cluster as part of a regulatory mechanism necessary to maintain MEIS1/HOXA9 -mediated transformation in MLL leukemia, indicating that targeting multiple non-homologous miRNAs may be utilized as a novel therapeutic regimen.","['Mian, Yousaf A', 'Zeleznik-Le, Nancy J']","['Mian YA', 'Zeleznik-Le NJ']","['Molecular Biology Program, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL 60153, United States.', 'Molecular Biology Program, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL 60153, United States; Department of Medicine, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL 60153, United States.

Most studies on alloSCT in elderly AML report results of highly selected patient cohorts. Hardly any data exist on the effectiveness of prospective strategies intended to bring as many patients as possible to transplant. Between 2006 and 2011 we implemented a treatment algorithm for all newly diagnosed AML patients aged 61-75 years, consisting of intensive chemotherapy cycles to induce complete remission, followed by alloSCT. 44 of 60 (73%) newly diagnosed elderly AML patients started with chemotherapy. By meticulously following our algorithm in almost all patients, we could induce complete remission (CR) in 66% of patients starting with chemotherapy, and transplant 32% of these patients in continuous CR. Main reasons for failure were early relapse (16%), early death (14%), primary refractory disease (9%), and patient or physician decision to stop treatment (16%). Patients in continuous CR after first induction benefit most with 36% long-term survival. Patients not in CR after first induction benefit less; although additional chemotherapy induces CR in 45% of these patients, only 23% are transplanted and no long-term survival is observed, mainly due to relapse.

HTLV-1 genome encodes a viral transforming protein named Tax, which constitutively activates the canonical IkappaB kinases (IKK), the central regulator of NF-kappaB signaling. However, the role of the non-canonical IkappaB kinases, TBK1 and IKKepsilon, in the pathogenesis of HTLV-1-associated leukemia has not been evaluated. We here show that TBK1/IKKepsilon are crucial pro-survival molecules by maintaining persistent activity of Stat3. Consistent with this finding, silencing Stat3 by the specific shRNA or by the chemical inhibitor ruxolitinib results in drastic impediment of leukemia cell growth. We further find that in HTLV-1-transformed T cells expressing Tax, TBK1 co-localizes with the canonical IkappaB kinases and Tax in the lipid raft microdomains. The wild type Tax, but not the Tax mutant defective in activating the canonical IKK, promotes the lipid raft translocation of TBK1. This phenomenon correlates with Tax activation of both NF-kappaB and Stat3. Tax does not interact directly with TBK1/IKKepsilon, and it rather engages a molecular crosstalk between the canonical IKKs and TBK1/IKKepsilon. Our data, therefore, demonstrate a key role of TBK1/IKKepsilon in the survival and proliferation of HTLV-1-transformed T cells and implicate a potential therapy targeting TBK1/IKKepsilon and Stat3 in controlling HTLV-1-mediated oncogenesis.","['Zhang, Huan', 'Chen, Li', 'Cai, Shao-Hui', 'Cheng, Hua']","['Zhang H', 'Chen L', 'Cai SH', 'Cheng H']","['School of Pharmacy, Jinan University, 601 Huangpu Avenue West, Guangzhou 510632, PR China; Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.', 'Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.', 'School of Pharmacy, Jinan University, 601 Huangpu Avenue West, Guangzhou 510632, PR China.', 'Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA; Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA; Departments of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA; Microbiology and Immunology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.

This study aimed to investigate the clinical utility of the immunochemical expression of the proliferative cell marker Ki-67 and the apoptotic blocker Mcl-1 in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). METHODS: We built a tissue microarray with 282 thyroid specimens. There were 59 PTCs including 35 classic (CPTC), 3 tall cell (TCPTC) and 21 follicular variants (FVPTC); 79 benign thyroid diseases (22 follicular adenomas; 57 adenomatoid hyperplasia); 33 Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) specimens; and 111 normal thyroid tissues. Clinical history and ultrasound data were retrospectively obtained by chart review. RESULTS: Mcl-1 overexpression was evident in 66.7% of the PTC tissues compared to 32% of the benign thyroid diseases. Mcl-1 strong staining distinguished benign from malignant thyroid lesions (sensitivity=61.3%; specificity=72.8%; negative predictive value, NPV=68%; positive predictive value, PPV=66.7% and 67.5% accuracy). Positive nuclear Ki-67 staining was observed in 34% of PTCs vs. 19% of thyroid adenomas (P=0.031). Strong Mcl-1 and Ki-67 co-expression was identified in 57.5% of PTCs with a higher PPV (75.8%). Mcl-1 and Ki-67 expression was not associated with any clinicopathological feature of malignancy. No deaths occurred during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Mcl-1 immunochemical overexpression allowed differentiating low-risk PTC from the benign thyroid lesions. We suggest that Mcl-1 expression may help differentiate follicular patterned thyroid lesions. The influence of the Mcl-1 expression on several features of tumor aggressiveness has to be studied in large series of high-risk thyroid carcinomas.","['Maia, F F R', 'Vassallo, J', 'Pinto, G A', 'Pavin, E J', 'Matos, P S', 'Zantut-Wittmann, D E']","['Maia FF', 'Vassallo J', 'Pinto GA', 'Pavin EJ', 'Matos PS', 'Zantut-Wittmann DE']","['Endocrinology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical Science School, University of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Specialized Pathology, CAISM, University of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Endocrinology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical Science School, University of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Endocrinology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Exp Clin Endocrinol Diabetes,"Experimental and clinical endocrinology & diabetes : official journal, German Society of Endocrinology [and] German Diabetes Association",9505926,IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Papillary', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Thyroid Cancer, Papillary', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*metabolism']",2016/04/29 06:00,2017/03/11 06:00,['2016/04/29 06:00'],"['2016/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/11 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Exp Clin Endocrinol Diabetes. 2016 Apr;124(4):209-14. doi: 10.1055/s-0035-1569363.

Coronary heart disease was known from the medical history. The patient reported recurrent ostealgia and susceptibility for infection during the last months before admission. INVESTIGATIONS: A 75% stenosis of the circumflex branch was treated with a drug eluting stent. Platelet aggregation was inhibited with acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel. Due to persisting ostealgia and inflammatory state, spondylodiscitis was excluded in MRI. However, platelets remained low after successful treatment of the infection. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: Bone marrow biopsy revealed an acute lymphoblastic leukemia with positive detection of the Philadelphia chromosome. After chemotherapy and allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation the patient remains in remission of his acute lymphoblastic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Especially in patients with documented history of coronary heart disease, the differential diagnosis of chest pain can be challenging. In this case, the chest pain was based on a subacute coronary ischemia as well as on proliferation of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Here, we show that FAK1 is upregulated in Ph(+) B-ALL with further overexpression in IKZF1-altered cells and that the FAK inhibitor VS-4718 potently inhibits aberrant FAK signaling and leukemic cell adhesion, potentiating responsiveness to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, inducing cure in vivo. Thus, targeting FAK with VS-4718 is an attractive approach to overcome the deleterious effects of FAK overexpression in Ph(+) B-ALL, particularly in abrogating the adhesive phenotype induced by Ikaros alterations, and warrants evaluation in clinical trials for Ph(+) B-ALL, regardless of IKZF1 status.","['Churchman, Michelle L', 'Evans, Kathryn', 'Richmond, Jennifer', 'Robbins, Alissa', 'Jones, Luke', 'Shapiro, Irina M', 'Pachter, Jonathan A', 'Weaver, David T', 'Houghton, Peter J', 'Smith, Malcolm A', 'Lock, Richard B', 'Mullighan, Charles G']","['Churchman ML', 'Evans K', 'Richmond J', 'Robbins A', 'Jones L', 'Shapiro IM', 'Pachter JA', 'Weaver DT', 'Houghton PJ', 'Smith MA', 'Lock RB', 'Mullighan CG']","[""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."", 'Verastem Inc., Needham, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Verastem Inc., Needham, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Verastem Inc., Needham, Massachusetts, USA.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA."", 'Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,JCI Insight,JCI insight,101676073,,,2016/04/29 06:00,2016/04/29 06:01,['2016/04/29 06:00'],"['2016/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/29 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,JCI Insight. 2016;1(4). pii: 86082. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.86082.

Chronic myeloid leukemia is a hematological malignancy caused by expression of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase oncogene, product of the t(9;22) Philadelphia translocation. Accelerated phase of this disease marks the onset of advanced rapidly progressive disease unresponsive to many therapies. Pregnancy limits broad number of therapies on patients because of their potential teratogenic effects. We report the case of a pregnant 34-year-old patient on accelerated phase successively managed by imatinib. She achieved a safe pregnancy and delivered at 39 weeks a healthy baby without congenital abnormalities. Our case is unusual because of the accelerated phase of the disease. Case Presentation. A 34-year-old African female with history of chronic phase of myeloid leukemia on imatinib, lost to follow-up for 4 months, presented to the hematological department for abdominal discomfort. Accelerated phase of chronic myeloid leukemia was diagnosed. Complete hematological response was achieved on high doses of imatinib. At the completion of 39 weeks, she delivered a healthy child without congenital anomalies. Conclusion.

Translocations involving the immunoglobulin (IG) genes are regularly identified. From 2000 to 2014, we identified an IG gene translocation in 18 of the 396 patients investigated at diagnosis (4.6%) and in 17 of the 275 analyzed during follow-up (6.2%). A total of 4 patients in whom the IG translocation was identified at follow-up did not carry the translocation at diagnosis. The IG heavy locus (IGH) was involved in 27 translocations (77.1%), the IG kappa locus (IGK) in 1 (2.9%) and the IG lambda locus (IGL) in 7 (20.0%). The chromosome band partners of the IG translocations were 18q21 in 16 cases (45.7%), 11q13 and 19q13 in 4 cases each (11.4% each), 8q24 in 3 cases (8.6%), 7q21 in 2 cases (5.7%), whereas 6 other bands were involved once (2.9% each). At present, 35 partner chromosomal bands have been described, but the partner gene has solely been identified in 10 translocations. CLL associated with IG gene translocations is characterized by atypical cell morphology, including plasmacytoid characteristics, and the propensity of being enriched in prolymphocytes. The IG heavy chain variable region (IGHV) mutational status varies between translocations, those with unmutated IGHV presumably involving cells at an earlier stage of B-cell lineage. All the partner genes thus far identified are involved in the control of cell proliferation and/or apoptosis. The translocated partner gene becomes transcriptionally deregulated as a consequence of its transposition into the IG locus. With the exception of t(14;18)(q32;q21) and its variants, prognosis appears to be poor for the other translocations. Therefore, searching for translocations involving not only IGH, but also IGL and IGK, by banding and molecular cytogenetics is required. Furthermore, it is important to identify the partner gene to ensure the patients receive the optimal treatment.","['DE Braekeleer, Marc', 'Tous, Corine', 'Gueganic, Nadia', 'LE Bris, Marie-Josee', 'Basinko, Audrey', 'Morel, Frederic', 'Douet-Guilbert, Nathalie']","['DE Braekeleer M', 'Tous C', 'Gueganic N', 'LE Bris MJ', 'Basinko A', 'Morel F', 'Douet-Guilbert N']","['Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Brest, Brest, France; National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM U1078), Brest, France; Department of Cytogenetics and Reproductive Biology, Morvan Hospital, Regional University Hospital Center of Brest (CHRU), Brest, France.', 'Department of Cytogenetics and Reproductive Biology, Morvan Hospital, Regional University Hospital Center of Brest (CHRU), Brest, France.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Brest, Brest, France; National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM U1078), Brest, France.', 'Department of Cytogenetics and Reproductive Biology, Morvan Hospital, Regional University Hospital Center of Brest (CHRU), Brest, France.', 'National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM U1078), Brest, France; Department of Cytogenetics and Reproductive Biology, Morvan Hospital, Regional University Hospital Center of Brest (CHRU), Brest, France.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Brest, Brest, France; National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM U1078), Brest, France; Department of Cytogenetics and Reproductive Biology, Morvan Hospital, Regional University Hospital Center of Brest (CHRU), Brest, France.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Brest, Brest, France; National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM U1078), Brest, France; Department of Cytogenetics and Reproductive Biology, Morvan Hospital, Regional University Hospital Center of Brest (CHRU), Brest, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mol Clin Oncol,Molecular and clinical oncology,101613422,,,2016/04/29 06:00,2016/04/29 06:01,['2016/04/29 06:00'],"['2015/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/29 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Mol Clin Oncol. 2016 May;4(5):682-694. doi: 10.3892/mco.2016.793.

In addition to the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene, the baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 3 (BIRC3) gene is also located in the region. BIRC3 encodes a negative regulator of the non-canonical nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) protein. Disruption of BIRC3 is known to be restricted to CLL fludarabine-refractory patients. The aim of the present study was to determine the frequency of copy number changes of BIRC3 and to assess its association with two known predictors of negative CLL outcome, ATM and tumor protein 53 (TP53) gene deletions. To evaluate the specificity of BIRC3 alterations to CLL, BIRC3 copy numbers were assessed in 117 CLL patients in addition to 45 B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) patients. A commercially available multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification kit, which includes four probes for the detection of TP53 and four probes for ATM gene region, was applied. Interphase-directed fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to apply commercially available probes for BIRC3, ATM and TP53. High resolution array-comparative genomic hybridization was conducted in selected cases. Genetic abnormalities of BIRC3 were detected in 23/117 (~20%) of CLL and 2/45 (~4%) of B-ALL cases. Overall, 20 patients with CLL and 1 with B-ALL possessed a BIRC3 deletion, whilst 3 patients with CLL and 1 with B-ALL harbored a BIRC3 duplication. All patients with an ATM deletion also carried a BIRC3 deletion. Only 2 CLL cases possessed deletions in BIRC3, ATM and TP53 simultaneously. Evidently, the deletion or duplication of BIRC3 may be observed rarely in B-ALL patients. BIRC3 duplication may occur in CLL patients, for which the prognosis requires additional studies in the future. The likelihood that TP53 deletions occur simultaneously with BIRC3 and/or ATM aberrations is low. However, as ATM deletions may, but not always, associate with BIRC3 deletions, each region should be considered in the future diagnostics of CLL in order to aid treatment decisions, notably whether to treat with or without fludarabine.","['Alhourani, Eyad', 'Othman, Moneeb A K', 'Melo, Joana B', 'Carreira, Isabel M', 'Grygalewicz, Beata', 'Vujic, Dragana', 'Zecevic, Zeljko', 'Joksic, Gordana', 'Glaser, Anita', 'Pohle, Beate', 'Schlie, Cordula', 'Hauke, Sven', 'Liehr, Thomas']","['Alhourani E', 'Othman MA', 'Melo JB', 'Carreira IM', 'Grygalewicz B', 'Vujic D', 'Zecevic Z', 'Joksic G', 'Glaser A', 'Pohle B', 'Schlie C', 'Hauke S', 'Liehr T']","['Institute of Human Genetics, Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena D-07743, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena D-07743, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Genomics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra 3000-548, Portugal; Research Centre for Environment, Genetics and Oncobiology, Coimbra 3000-548, Portugal.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Genomics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra 3000-548, Portugal; Research Centre for Environment, Genetics and Oncobiology, Coimbra 3000-548, Portugal.', 'Cytogenetic Laboratory, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Centre and Institute, Warsaw 02-781, Poland.', ""Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; Institute for Medical Care of Mother and Child of Serbia 'Dr Vukan Cupic', Belgrade 11070, Serbia."", ""Institute for Medical Care of Mother and Child of Serbia 'Dr Vukan Cupic', Belgrade 11070, Serbia."", 'Vinca Institute of Nuclear Sciences, Belgrade 11001, Serbia.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena D-07743, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena D-07743, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena D-07743, Germany.', 'ZytoVision GmbH, Bremerhaven D-27572, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena D-07743, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,2016/04/29 06:00,2016/04/29 06:01,['2016/04/29 06:00'],"['2015/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/29 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2016 May;11(5):3240-3246. doi: 10.3892/ol.2016.4388.

Many studies indicate that hgs might be a favourable prognostic factor. We thus considered it important to determine whether hgs are also a prognostic factor for Chinese adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (aml) and whether the hg-positive and hg-negative groups show any serologic or phenotypic differences. METHODS: Chinese adult aml patients (n = 177) who were all initially hg-negative underwent standard chemotherapy and were thereafter divided into hg-positive and hg-negative groups according to hg levels in bone marrow during their first remission. RESULTS: The follow-up study confirmed that survival duration (both leukemia-free and overall) was significantly greater in the hg-positive group than in the hg-negative group and was accompanied by a lower relapse rate. A retrospective study of patient characteristics at the time of first diagnosis revealed some differences between the hg-positive and the hg-negative groups, including elevations in white blood cells, lactate dehydrogenase, and beta2-microglobulin in the hg-negative group. Retrospective phenotypic analysis revealed a significantly lower proportion of abnormal chromosome karyotype and CD34 expression in hg-positive patients. Finally, we evaluated whether additional intensive chemotherapy after standard chemotherapy could further increase hgs. CONCLUSIONS: The present work verified the validity of hgs as a prognostic factor for Chinese adult patients with aml. Compared with hg-negative patients, hg-positive patients not only experienced longer survival and a lower relapse rate, but they also had some serologic and phenotypic characteristics that are all considered indicators of better outcome. Additional intensive chemotherapy could further increase the level of hgs, which might imply better clinical results.","['Li, L', 'Fu, R', 'Zhang, T', 'Xie, X', 'Liu, J', 'Tao, J', 'Song, J', 'Liu, H', 'Zhang, W', 'Lu, W', 'Shao, Z']","['Li L', 'Fu R', 'Zhang T', 'Xie X', 'Liu J', 'Tao J', 'Song J', 'Liu H', 'Zhang W', 'Lu W', 'Shao Z']","['Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, P.R.C.;', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, P.R.C.;', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, P.R.C.;', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, P.R.C.;', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, P.R.C.;', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, P.R.C.;', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, P.R.C.;', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, P.R.C.;', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, P.R.C.;', 'Department of Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, P.R.C.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, P.R.C.;']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Curr Oncol,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",9502503,,,2016/04/29 06:00,2016/04/29 06:01,['2016/04/29 06:00'],"['2016/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/29 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Curr Oncol. 2016 Apr;23(2):e123-30. doi: 10.3747/co.23.2877.

Patients who fail to respond to, or progress on first-line DNA hypomethylating agents (HMA) have a poor prognosis. Conventionally dosed lenalidomide has activity in 5q-MDS. In other subtypes, it may reduce RBC transfusion requirements but does not result in cytogenetic responses. We previously reported that high-dose lenalidomide induction (50 mg/day) results in complete remissions in a high fraction of patients.

Polyphenols from Korean E. supina (PES) which include quercetin and kaempferol derivatives have anticancer properties. Hence, we investigated the anticancer effects of PES on U937 human leukemic cells. Firstly, PES significantly inhibited the proliferation of U937 cells in a dose-dependent manner. PES induced accumulation of the sub-G1 DNA content (apoptotic cell population), apoptotic bodies and chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation in the U937 cells. PES also induced activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9, subsequent cleavage of PARP, and significantly suppressed XIAP, cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, PES activated Bid, and induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP, DeltaPsim) along with upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and Bad), and downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and cytochrome c release. The Fas receptor was upregulated by PES in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the extrinsic pathway was also involved in the PES-induced apoptosis. Moreover, the PES-induced apoptosis was at least in part associated with extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in the U937 human leukemic cells. This study provides evidence that PES may be useful in the treatment of leukemia.","['Han, Min-Ho', 'Lee, Won Sup', 'Nagappan, Arulkumar', 'Kim, Hye Jung', 'Park, Cheol', 'Kim, Gi-Young', 'Hong, Sang Hoon', 'Kim, Nam Deuk', 'Kim, Gonsup', 'Ryu, Chung Ho', 'Shin, Sung Chul', 'Choi, Yung Hyun']","['Han MH', 'Lee WS', 'Nagappan A', 'Kim HJ', 'Park C', 'Kim GY', 'Hong SH', 'Kim ND', 'Kim G', 'Ryu CH', 'Shin SC', 'Choi YH']","['Natural Products Research Team, National Marine Biodiversity Institute of Korea, Seocheon 325-902, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Institute of Health Sciences, Gyeongsang National University School of Medicine, Jinju 660-702, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Institute of Health Sciences, Gyeongsang National University School of Medicine, Jinju 660-702, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Health Sciences, Gyeongsang National University School of Medicine, Jinju 660-702, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences and Human Ecology, Dongeui University, Busan 614-714, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Marine Life Sciences, Jeju National University, Jeju 690-756, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Dongeui University College of Korean Medicine, Busan 614-052, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Pusan National University, Busan 609-735, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Veterinary Medicine, Research Institute of Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 660-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Applied Life Science (BK 21 Program), Research Institute of Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 660-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Chemistry, Research Institute of Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 660-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Dongeui University College of Korean Medicine, Busan 614-052, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/metabolism', 'Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Euphorbia/*chemistry', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phytochemicals/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Polyphenols/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Republic of Korea', 'U937 Cells', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/biosynthesis', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/biosynthesis']",2016/04/29 06:00,2017/03/14 06:00,['2016/04/29 06:00'],"['2016/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2016 Jul;36(1):99-107. doi: 10.3892/or.2016.4778.

The preclinical studies discussed herein show compelling evidence that Vitamin D Derivatives (VDDs) can convert some cancer and leukemia cells to a benign phenotype, by differentiation/maturation, cell cycle arrest, or induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, there is considerable, though still evolving, knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes. However, the attempts to clearly document that the treatment outcomes of human neoplastic diseases can be positively influenced by VDDs have been, so far, disappointing. The clinical trials to date of VDDs, alone or combined with other agents, have not shown consistent results. It is our contention, shared by others, that there were limitations in the design or execution of these trials which have not yet been fully addressed. Based on the connection between upregulation of JNK by VDDs and DNA repair, we propose a new avenue of attack on cancer cells by increasing the toxicity of the current, only partially effective, cancer chemotherapeutic drugs by combining them with VDDs. This can impair DNA repair and thus kill the malignant cells, warranting a comprehensive study of this novel concept. J. Cell. Biochem. 117: 1733-1744, 2016.

There is a critical need to develop efficient methods to recover these important mutational events. RESULTS: In this paper we introduce ITD Assembler, a novel approach that rapidly evaluates all unmapped and partially mapped reads from whole exome NGS data using a De Bruijn graphs approach to select reads that harbor cycles of appropriate length, followed by assembly using overlap-layout-consensus. We tested ITD Assembler on The Cancer Genome Atlas AML dataset as a truth set. ITD Assembler identified the highest percentage of reported FLT3-ITDs when compared to other ITD detection algorithms, and discovered additional ITDs in FLT3, KIT, CEBPA, WT1 and other genes. Evidence of polymorphic ITDs in 54 genes were also found. Novel ITDs were validated by analyzing the corresponding RNA sequencing data. CONCLUSIONS: ITD Assembler is a very sensitive tool which can detect partial, large and complex tandem duplications. This study highlights the need to more effectively look for ITD's in other cancers and Mendelian diseases.","['Rustagi, Navin', 'Hampton, Oliver A', 'Li, Jie', 'Xi, Liu', 'Gibbs, Richard A', 'Plon, Sharon E', 'Kimmel, Marek', 'Wheeler, David A']","['Rustagi N', 'Hampton OA', 'Li J', 'Xi L', 'Gibbs RA', 'Plon SE', 'Kimmel M', 'Wheeler DA']","['Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.

Deregulation of histone acetylation caused by aberrant expression of HDACs plays a key role in tumour onset and progression making these enzymes as candidate targets for anticancer drugs and therapy. Small-molecules namely histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) modulating the biological function of HDACs have shown multiple biological effects including differentiation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumour models. HDACi in general have been described in plethora of reviews with respect to various cancers. However, no review article is available describing thoroughly the role of inhibitor givinostat (ITF2357 or [6-(diethylaminomethyl) naphthalen-2-yl] methyl N-[4-(hydroxycarbamoyl) phenyl] carbamate) in haematological malignancies. Thus, the present review explores the intricate role of novel inhibitor givinostat in the defined malignancies including multiple myeloma, acute myelogenous leukaemia, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma apart from myeloproliferative neoplasms. The distinct molecular mechanisms triggered by this small-molecule inhibitor in these cancers to exert cytotoxic effect have also been dealt with.

In contrast, adverse events (AEs) are often reported as infrequent, minor, tolerable and manageable, but they are increasingly important as therapy is potentially lifelong and multiple TKIs are available. For this reason, the European LeukemiaNet panel for CML management recommendations presents an exhaustive and critical summary of AEs emerging during CML treatment, to assist their understanding, management and prevention. There are five major conclusions. First, the main purpose of CML treatment is the antileukemic effect. Suboptimal management of AEs must not compromise this first objective. Second, most patients will have AEs, usually early, mostly mild to moderate, and which will resolve spontaneously or are easily controlled by simple means. Third, reduction or interruption of treatment must only be done if optimal management of the AE cannot be accomplished in other ways, and frequent monitoring is needed to detect resolution of the AE as early as possible. Fourth, attention must be given to comorbidities and drug interactions, and to new events unrelated to TKIs that are inevitable during such a prolonged treatment. Fifth, some TKI-related AEs have emerged which were not predicted or detected in earlier studies, maybe because of suboptimal attention to or absence from the preclinical data. Overall, imatinib has demonstrated a good long-term safety profile, though recent findings suggest underestimation of symptom severity by physicians. Second and third generation TKIs have shown higher response rates, but have been associated with unexpected problems, some of which could be irreversible. We hope these recommendations will help to minimise adverse events, and we believe that an optimal management of them will be rewarded by better TKI compliance and thus better CML outcomes, together with better quality of life.","['Steegmann, J L', 'Baccarani, M', 'Breccia, M', 'Casado, L F', 'Garcia-Gutierrez, V', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Kim, D-W', 'Kim, T D', 'Khoury, H J', 'Le Coutre, P', 'Mayer, J', 'Milojkovic, D', 'Porkka, K', 'Rea, D', 'Rosti, G', 'Saussele, S', 'Hehlmann, R', 'Clark, R E']","['Steegmann JL', 'Baccarani M', 'Breccia M', 'Casado LF', 'Garcia-Gutierrez V', 'Hochhaus A', 'Kim DW', 'Kim TD', 'Khoury HJ', 'Le Coutre P', 'Mayer J', 'Milojkovic D', 'Porkka K', 'Rea D', 'Rosti G', 'Saussele S', 'Hehlmann R', 'Clark RE']","['Servicio de Hematologia y Grupo 44 IIS-IP, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology 'L. and A.

However, the effect has not been compared among them. Cell viability was determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, and ultra-structural characteristics were observed under transmission electron microscopy. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry (FCM). Real-time fluorescence quantitativePCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to measure the expression of beta-catenin, TCF4, cyclin D1 and NF-kappaBp65. beta-catenin/TCF4 target gene transcription were observed by ChIP-PCR assay. We found that 20(S)-ginsenoside Rh2 [(S)Rh2] inhibited the proliferation of KG-1a cells more efficiently than the other monomers. Moreover, (S)Rh2 arrested KG-1a cells in the G0/G1 phase and induced apoptosis. In addition, the levels of beta-catenin, TCF4, cyclin D1 mRNA and protein were decreased. The ChIP-PCR showed that (S)Rh2 downregulated the transcription of beta-catenin/TCF4 target genes, such as cyclin D1 and c-myc. These results indicated that (S)Rh2 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, demonstrating its potential as a chemotherapeutic agent for leukemia therapy.","['Chen, Yi', 'Liu, Ze-Hong', 'Xia, Jing', 'Li, Xiao-Peng', 'Li, Ke-Qiong', 'Xiong, Wei', 'Li, Jing', 'Chen, Di-Long']","['Chen Y', 'Liu ZH', 'Xia J', 'Li XP', 'Li KQ', 'Xiong W', 'Li J', 'Chen DL']","['Laboratory of Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering, Department of Histology and Embryology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, P.R.

We investigated dasatinib, another potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in combination with low-intensity chemotherapy. Patients older than age 55 years were included in the European Working Group on Adult ALL (EWALL) study number 01 for Ph(+) ALL (EWALL-PH-01 international study) and were treated with dasatinib 140 mg/day (100 mg/day over 70 years) with intrathecal chemotherapy, vincristine, and dexamethasone during induction. Patients in complete remission continued consolidation with dasatinib, sequentially with cytarabine, asparaginase, and methotrexate for 6 months. Maintenance therapy was dasatinib and vincristine/dexamethasone reinductions for 18 months followed by dasatinib until relapse or death. Seventy-one patients with a median age of 69 years were enrolled; 77% had a high comorbidity score. Complete remission rate was 96% and 65% of patients achieved a 3-log reduction in BCR-ABL1 transcript levels during consolidation. Only 7 patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. At 5 years, overall survival was 36% and up to 45% taking into account deaths unrelated to disease or treatment as competitors. Thirty-six patients relapsed, 24 were tested for mutation by Sanger sequencing, and 75% were T315I-positive. BCR-ABL1(T315I) was tested by allele-specific oligonucleotide reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 43 patients and detection was associated with short-term relapses. Ten patients (23%) were positive before any therapy and 8 relapsed, all with this mutation. In conclusion, dasatinib combined with low-intensity chemotherapy was well-tolerated and gave long-term survival in 36% of elderly patients with Ph(+) ALL. Monitoring of BCR-ABL1(T315I) from diagnosis identified patients with at high risk of early relapse and may help to personalize therapy.","['Rousselot, Philippe', 'Coude, Marie Magdelaine', 'Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Gambacorti Passerini, Carlo', 'Hayette, Sandrine', 'Cayuela, Jean-Michel', 'Huguet, Francoise', 'Leguay, Thibaut', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Salanoubat, Celia', 'Bonmati, Caroline', 'Alexis, Magda', 'Hunault, Mathilde', 'Glaisner, Sylvie', 'Agape, Philippe', 'Berthou, Christian', 'Jourdan, Eric', 'Fernandes, Jose', 'Sutton, Laurent', 'Banos, Anne', 'Reman, Oumedaly', 'Lioure, Bruno', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff, Marina', 'Bornand, Anne', 'Morisset, Laure', 'Robin, Valerie', 'Pfeifer, Heike', 'Delannoy, Andre', 'Ribera, Josep', 'Bassan, Renato', 'Delord, Marc', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Ottmann, Oliver G']","['Rousselot P', 'Coude MM', 'Gokbuget N', 'Gambacorti Passerini C', 'Hayette S', 'Cayuela JM', 'Huguet F', 'Leguay T', 'Chevallier P', 'Salanoubat C', 'Bonmati C', 'Alexis M', 'Hunault M', 'Glaisner S', 'Agape P', 'Berthou C', 'Jourdan E', 'Fernandes J', 'Sutton L', 'Banos A', 'Reman O', 'Lioure B', 'Thomas X', 'Ifrah N', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff M', 'Bornand A', 'Morisset L', 'Robin V', 'Pfeifer H', 'Delannoy A', 'Ribera J', 'Bassan R', 'Delord M', 'Hoelzer D', 'Dombret H', 'Ottmann OG']","['Hemato-Oncology Unit, Centre Hospitalier de Versailles, Le Chesnay, France; Universite Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, EA4340, Universite Paris-Saclay, Communaute Paris-Saclay, France;', 'Laboratory of Hematology, University Hospital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France; EA3518, University Paris Diderot, Paris, France;', 'Medicine Department II, Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universitat, Frankfurt, Germany;', 'Department of Internal Medicine/Experimental Oncology, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy;', 'Division of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, INSERM U1052-Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR 5286, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Pierre Benite, France;', 'Laboratory of Hematology, University Hospital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France; EA3518, University Paris Diderot, Paris, France;', 'Division of Hematology, Institut Universitaire de Cancerologie, Toulouse, France;', 'Division of Hematology, Hopital du Haut-Leveque, Pessac, France;', 'Hematology Department, CHU Hotel-Dieu, Nantes, France;', 'Division of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Sud Francilien, Corbeil Essonne, France;', 'Division of Hematology, Hopital de Brabois, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nancy, Nancy, France;', ""Service d'Oncologie et d'Hematologie, Hopital de la Source, Orleans, France;"", ""Division of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire d'Angers, Angers, France; INSERM U892/Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 6299, Angers, France;"", 'Division of Hematology, Institut Curie-Hopital Rene Huguenin, Saint-Cloud, France;', 'Division of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Departemental Felix Guyon, Saint Denis, La Reunion, France;', 'Division of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Brest, Brest, France;', 'Division of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nimes, Nimes, France;', 'Division of Hematology, Hotel Dieu, Valenciennes, France;', 'Division of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Victor Dupouy, Argenteuil, France;', 'Division of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier de la Cote Basque, Bayonne, France;', 'Division of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Caen, France;', 'Division of Hematology, Hopital de Hautepierre, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France;', 'Division of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, INSERM U1052-Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR 5286, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Pierre Benite, France;', ""Division of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire d'Angers, Angers, France; INSERM U892/Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 6299, Angers, France;"", 'Laboratoire de Cytogenetique Onco-Hematologique, CHU Timone Enfants, Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France;', 'Service de Geriatrie Aigue Polyvalente and.', ""Delegation a la Recherche Clinique et a l'Innovation, Hopital Mignot, Le Chesnay, France;"", 'Division of Hematology, CHR Mons-Hainaut, Mons, Belgium;', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany;', ""Departement d'Hematologie, d'Oncologie Medicale et de Radiotherapie Oncologique, Centre Hospitalier de Jolimont-Lobbes, Haine Saint Paul, Belgium;"", 'Department of Clinical Hematology, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Jose Carreras Research Institute, Badalona, Spain;', 'Azienda ULSS 12 ""Veneziana"" Direttore U.O.C.

Advances in cancer genomics have identified numerous recurrent mutations with clear prognostic and/or therapeutic significance to different cancers. In myeloid malignancies, there is a clinical imperative to test for such mutations in mainstream diagnosis; however, progress toward this has been slow and piecemeal. Here we describe Karyogene, an integrated targeted resequencing/analytical platform that detects nucleotide substitutions, insertions/deletions, chromosomal translocations, copy number abnormalities, and zygosity changes in a single assay. We validate the approach against 62 acute myeloid leukemia, 50 myelodysplastic syndrome, and 40 blood DNA samples from individuals without evidence of clonal blood disorders. We demonstrate robust detection of sequence changes in 49 genes, including difficult-to-detect mutations such as FLT3 internal-tandem and mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) partial-tandem duplications, and clinically significant chromosomal rearrangements including MLL translocations to known and unknown partners, identifying the novel fusion gene MLL-DIAPH2 in the process. Additionally, we identify most significant chromosomal gains and losses, and several copy neutral loss-of-heterozygosity mutations at a genome-wide level, including previously unreported changes such as homozygosity for DNMT3A R882 mutations. Karyogene represents a dependable genomic diagnosis platform for translational research and for the clinical management of myeloid malignancies, which can be readily adapted for use in other cancers.","['McKerrell, Thomas', 'Moreno, Thaidy', 'Ponstingl, Hannes', 'Bolli, Niccolo', 'Dias, Joao M L', 'Tischler, German', 'Colonna, Vincenza', 'Manasse, Bridget', 'Bench, Anthony', 'Bloxham, David', 'Herman, Bram', 'Fletcher, Danielle', 'Park, Naomi', 'Quail, Michael A', 'Manes, Nicla', 'Hodkinson, Clare', 'Baxter, Joanna', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Foukaneli, Theodora', 'Warren, Alan J', 'Chi, Jianxiang', 'Costeas, Paul', 'Rad, Roland', 'Huntly, Brian', 'Grove, Carolyn', 'Ning, Zemin', 'Tyler-Smith, Chris', 'Varela, Ignacio', 'Scott, Mike', 'Nomdedeu, Josep', 'Mustonen, Ville', 'Vassiliou, George S']","['McKerrell T', 'Moreno T', 'Ponstingl H', 'Bolli N', 'Dias JM', 'Tischler G', 'Colonna V', 'Manasse B', 'Bench A', 'Bloxham D', 'Herman B', 'Fletcher D', 'Park N', 'Quail MA', 'Manes N', 'Hodkinson C', 'Baxter J', 'Sierra J', 'Foukaneli T', 'Warren AJ', 'Chi J', 'Costeas P', 'Rad R', 'Huntly B', 'Grove C', 'Ning Z', 'Tyler-Smith C', 'Varela I', 'Scott M', 'Nomdedeu J', 'Mustonen V', 'Vassiliou GS']","['Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, United Kingdom;

Genetic abnormalities are found in approximately 50% of patients with AA and, except for PIGA mutations and copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity, or uniparental disomy (UPD) in 6p (6pUPD), are most frequently represented by mutations involving genes commonly mutated in myeloid malignancies, including DNMT3A, ASXL1, and BCOR/BCORL1 Mutations exhibit distinct chronological profiles and clinical impacts. BCOR/BCORL1 and PIGA mutations tend to disappear or show stable clone size and predict a better response to IST and a significantly better clinical outcome compared with mutations in DNMT3A, ASXL1, and other genes, which are likely to increase their clone size, are associated with a faster progression to MDS/AML, and predict an unfavorable survival. High frequency of 6pUPD and overrepresentation of PIGA and BCOR/BCORL1 mutations are unique to AA, suggesting the role of autoimmunity in clonal selection. By contrast, DNMT3A and ASXL1 mutations, also commonly seen in CH in the general population, indicate a close link to CH in the aged bone marrow, in terms of the mechanism for selection. Detection and close monitoring of somatic mutations/evolution may help with prediction and diagnosis of clonal evolution of MDS/AML and better management of patients with AA.","['Ogawa, Seishi']",['Ogawa S'],"['Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['*Anemia, Aplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/metabolism', '*Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2016/04/29 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2016/04/29 06:00'],"['2016/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jul 21;128(3):337-47. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-01-636381.

The aim of the present study was to elucidate the cause for chemotherapy failure and the resistance of CSCs to apoptosis. A total of ~2.3% cluster of differentiation (CD)133+ cancer stemlike side population (SP) cells were identified in cases of uterine cervical cancer. These CD133+ SP cells were found to potently initiate tumor growth and invasion, as they exhibit transcriptional upregulation of stemness genes, including octamerbinding transcription factor4, Bcellspecific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site1, epithelial cell adhesion molecule, (sex determining region Y)box 2, Nestin and antiapoptotic B cell lymphoma2. In addition, the CD133+ SP cells showed resistance to multidrug treatment and apoptosis. The present study further showed that the secretion of interleukin4 (IL4) in CD133+ cervical cancer SP cells promoted cell proliferation and prevented the SP cells from apoptosis. Following the neutralization of IL4 with antiIL4 antibody, the CD133+ SP cells were more sensitive to drug treatment and apoptosis. Therefore, the data obtained in the present study suggested that the autocrine secretion of IL4 promotes increased survival and resistance to cell death in CSCs.","['Liu, Chun-Tao', 'Xin, Ying', 'Tong, Chun-Yan', 'Li, Bing', 'Bao, Hong-Li', 'Zhang, Cai-Yun', 'Wang, Xue-Hui']","['Liu CT', 'Xin Y', 'Tong CY', 'Li B', 'Bao HL', 'Zhang CY', 'Wang XH']","['Department of Gynecology, The Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University, Dalian, Liaoning 116001, P.R.

In this study, we investigated the yield of EBUS-TBNA for diagnosis of lymphoma and reviewed the literature since the British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines were published. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated our database for patients who underwent EBUS between March 2011 and December 2014. One hundred eighty-nine patients with isolated mediastinal lymphadenopathy were included in the study. Patients with other causes of lymphadenopathy, such as lung cancer or extrathoracic malignancy, and those with pulmonary lesions accompanying mediastinal lymphadenopathy were excluded from the study. Patients with final diagnosed lymphoma were included in the study on the basis of a history of lymphoma or newly evaluated mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of EBUS-TBNA were calculated. RESULTS: There were 13 patients with the final diagnosis of lymphoma. Eleven of them were new diagnoses and 2 patients were known chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and underwent EBUS-TBNA for determination of recurrence. Twelve EBUS-TBNA procedures were performed for suspected new cases. Three (25%) were diagnostic, 2 (16.7%) were suspicious for lymphoma and underwent further interventions for definite diagnosis, and 7 (58.3%) were false negative. All 3 patients diagnosed with EBUS-TBNA were non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). None of the Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) cases could be diagnosed with EBUS-TBNA. The overall diagnostic sensitivity and NPV of EBUS-TBNA in detecting lymphoma was 65% and 96.1%, respectively. For the newly diagnosed lymphoma cases, EBUS-TBNA had a sensitivity of 61.1%. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we believe that since the publication of the BTS guidelines, the value of EBUS-TBNA in the diagnosis of lymphoma still remains controversial. EBUS-TBNA can be the first diagnostic modality in diagnosis of recurrent lymphomas. However, for suspected new cases, especially for HL, the diagnostic yield of EBUS-TBNA is low and negative results do not exclude lymphoma. Further interventions such as mediastinoscopy should be performed for high-suspicion patients.","['Erer, Onur Fevzi', 'Erol, Serhat', 'Anar, Ceyda', 'Aydogdu, Zekiye', 'Ozkan, Serir Aktogu']","['Erer OF', 'Erol S', 'Anar C', 'Aydogdu Z', 'Ozkan SA']","['Department of Chest Diseases, Izmir Dr. Suat Seren Chest Diseases and Surgery Training Hospital, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Chest Diseases, Izmir Dr. Suat Seren Chest Diseases and Surgery Training Hospital, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Chest Diseases, Izmir Dr. Suat Seren Chest Diseases and Surgery Training Hospital, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Pathology, Izmir Dr. Suat Seren Chest Diseases and Surgery Training Hospital, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Chest Diseases, Izmir Dr. Suat Seren Chest Diseases and Surgery Training Hospital, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Endosc Ultrasound,Endoscopic ultrasound,101622292,,,2016/04/29 06:00,2016/04/29 06:01,['2016/04/29 06:00'],"['2016/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/29 06:01 [medline]', '2016/04/29 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Endosc Ultrasound. 2017 Sep-Oct;6(5):317-322. doi: 10.4103/2303-9027.180762.,10.4103/2303-9027.180762 [doi],,,PMC5664852,,,,"['180762 [pii]', '10.4103/2303-9027.180762 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reasons for the failure of the mechanisms of resistance of these inhibitors are unclear, but may involve factors of the tumor microenvironment such as limited glucose availability and hypoxia. It was therefore examined whether glucose and oxygen influenced the response of glioma cells to EGFR inhibition. Decreased levels of glucose and oxygen led to resistance against the EGFR inhibitor PD153035, whereas high glucose amounts and normoxia sensitised glioma cells towards the inhibitor. Low levels of glucose and oxygen stimulated AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) in glioma cells. 2DG, an inhibitor of glycolysis, and the AMPK activator A769662 reduced glucose consumption, induced phosphorylation of AMPK and mimicked the effects of low glucose availability on the toxicity of PD153035. Similarly, 2DG reduced toxicity of imatinib in K562 leukemia cells. In contrast, inhibition of AMPK by compound C or by short-hairpin (sh)-mediated gene suppression increased cell death induced by the EGFR inhibitor and reverted the protective effects of 2DG and A769662. In conclusion, cytotoxicity of EGFR inhibition can be diminished by AMPK activation in glioma cells. These results may provide one explanation for the low activity of EGFR inhibitors in clinical trials and suggest antagonism of AMPK or of AMPK-regulated metabolic alterations as a promising approach to enhance their therapeutic efficacy.","['Hartel, Ines', 'Ronellenfitsch, Michael', 'Wanka, Christina', 'Wolking, Stefan', 'Steinbach, Joachim P', 'Rieger, Johannes']","['Hartel I', 'Ronellenfitsch M', 'Wanka C', 'Wolking S', 'Steinbach JP', 'Rieger J']","['Dr. Senckenberg Institute of Neurooncology, Goethe University Frankfurt, D-60528 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Dr. Senckenberg Institute of Neurooncology, Goethe University Frankfurt, D-60528 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Dr. Senckenberg Institute of Neurooncology, Goethe University Frankfurt, D-60528 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Neurology and Epileptology, Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.', 'Dr. Senckenberg Institute of Neurooncology, Goethe University Frankfurt, D-60528 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Dr. Senckenberg Institute of Neurooncology, Goethe University Frankfurt, D-60528 Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds', 'Cell Hypoxia/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'ErbB Receptors/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Glioma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage', 'K562 Cells', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pyrones/*administration & dosage', 'Quinazolines/*administration & dosage', 'Thiophenes/*administration & dosage']",2016/04/29 06:00,2017/03/31 06:00,['2016/04/29 06:00'],"['2015/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2016 Jul;49(1):173-80. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2016.3498.

The pathogenesis of some of these lymphoid malignancies is characterized by distinct translocations, for example t(11;14) in the majority of cases of MCL and t(14;18) in most cases of FL, whereas other entities are associated with a variety of recurrent but nonspecific numeric chromosomal abnormalities, as exemplified by del(13q14), del(11q22), and +12 in CLL, and yet others such as LPL and HCL that lack recurrent or specific cytogenetic aberrations. The recent surge in next generation sequencing (NGS) technology has shed more light on the genetic landscape of SBCLs through characterization of numerous driver mutations including SF3B1 and NOTCH1 in CLL, ATM and CCND1 in MCL, KMT2D and EPHA7 in FL, MYD88 (L265P) in LPL, KLF2 and NOTCH2 in splenic MZL (SMZL) and BRAF (V600E) in HCL. The identification of distinct genetic lesions not only provides greater insight into the molecular pathogenesis of these disorders but also identifies potential valuable biomarkers for prognostic stratification, as well as specific targets for directed therapy.

BAG3 (Bcl-2-associated athanogene 3) is one of six BAG family proteins, which are involved in such cellular processes as proliferation, migration and apoptosis. In addition, expression of BAG3 with Mcl-1, a Bcl-2 family protein, reportedly associates with resistance to chemotherapy. Our aim in this study was to evaluate the functional role of BAG3 and Mcl-1 in ovarian cancer chemoresistance and explore possible new targets for treatment. We found that combined expression of BAG3 and Mcl-1 was significantly associated with a poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients. In vitro, BAG3 knockdown in ES2 clear ovarian cancer cells significantly increased the efficacy of paclitaxel in combination with the Mcl-1 antagonist MIM1, with or without the Bcl-2 family antagonist ABT737. Moreover, BAG3 was found to positively regulate Mcl-1 levels by binding to and inhibiting USP9X. Our data show that BAG3 and Mcl-1 are key mediators of resistance to chemotherapy in ovarian cancer. In BAG3 knockdown ES2 clear ovarian cancer cells, combination with ABT737 and MIM1 enhanced the efficacy of paclitaxel. These results suggest that inhibiting BAG3 in addition to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins may be a useful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of chemoresistant ovarian cancers.","['Habata, Shutaro', 'Iwasaki, Masahiro', 'Sugio, Asuka', 'Suzuki, Miwa', 'Tamate, Masato', 'Satohisa, Seiro', 'Tanaka, Ryoichi', 'Saito, Tsuyoshi']","['Habata S', 'Iwasaki M', 'Sugio A', 'Suzuki M', 'Tamate M', 'Satohisa S', 'Tanaka R', 'Saito T']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo 060-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo 060-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo 060-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo 060-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo 060-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo 060-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo 060-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo 060-8543, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2016/04/29 06:00,2017/03/31 06:00,['2016/04/29 06:00'],"['2016/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2016 Jul;49(1):402-10. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2016.3494.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as imatinib, have been demonstrated to be effective therapies for F/P mutated disease. The aim of this study was to analyze the treatment response and long term prognosis in patients with F/P mutated CEL. METHODS: The clinical features and treatment responses of 33 consecutive patients with F/P mutated CEL between August 2006 and October 2014 were analyzed. The 33 cases received imatinib therapy at an initial dose of 100 mg/day (30 patients) or 200 mg/day (3 patients); the maintenance dose depended on the response condition and patient willingness. Through the follow up, the molecular responses were regularly monitored. RESULTS: With a median follow up of 64 months, 94% of the 33 patients with F/P mutated CEL achieved a complete hematologic remission (CHR), and 97% achieved a complete molecular remission (CMR) after a median of 3 (1.5-12) months. Twenty-four cases received maintenance therapy, with a median CMR duration of 43 (5-88) months. Imatinib therapy was discontinued in 8 cases, including 4 cases who experienced relapse, and 4 patients who maintained CHR or CMR after discontinuing therapy with a median time of 47 (2-74) months. One case exhibited primary resistance with a PDGFRA T674I mutation. CONCLUSIONS: F/P mutated CEL has an excellent long-term prognosis following imatinib therapy. A 100 mg daily dose of imatinib is sufficient to induce remission, and a single 100 mg weekly dose maintains a durable remission. A subgroup of patients may maintain a durable remission after discontinuing therapy with a CMR.","['Qu, Shi-Qiang', 'Qin, Tie-Jun', 'Xu, Ze-Feng', 'Zhang, Yue', 'Ai, Xiao-Fei', 'Li, Bing', 'Zhang, Hong-Li', 'Fang, Li-Wei', 'Pan, Li-Juan', 'Hu, Nai-Bo', 'Xiao, Zhi-Jian']","['Qu SQ', 'Qin TJ', 'Xu ZF', 'Zhang Y', 'Ai XF', 'Li B', 'Zhang HL', 'Fang LW', 'Pan LJ', 'Hu NB', 'Xiao ZJ']","['MDS and MPN Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'MDS and MPN Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'MDS and MPN Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'MDS and MPN Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'MDS and MPN Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'MDS and MPN Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'MDS and MPN Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'MDS and MPN Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'MDS and MPN Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'MDS and MPN Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'China', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Fusion', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/*genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/*genetics']",2016/04/28 06:00,2017/12/19 06:00,['2016/04/28 06:00'],"['2016/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 May 31;7(22):33229-36. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.8906.,10.18632/oncotarget.8906 [doi],,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (FIP1L1 protein, human)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'Pdgfra-Associated Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia']",PMC5078089,['NOTNLM'],"['FIP1L1-PDGFRA', 'chronic eosinophilic leukemia', 'eosinophilia', 'imatinib']",['The authors declare there are no competing financial interests.'],"['8906 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.8906 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous in vivo studies have suggested the antitumor activities of IL-27 in animal models, whereas clinical observations indicate the link of IL-27 in tumor progression. IL-27 has recently been shown to cause inhibition of proliferation on primary leukemic cells from pediatric patients, but information on its role in human leukemic cell lines is limited. In the present study, we investigated the ability of IL-27 to regulate cell growth and survival of various human leukemic cell lines. Our results showed that in human leukemic cell lines coexpressing both IL-27R chains, IL-27Ralpha and gp130, IL-27 did not inhibit cell growth, but caused dose-dependent proliferation of the acute myeloid leukemic cell line, OCI-AML5, and the erythroleukemic cell lines, TF-1, UT-7, and UT-7/EPO. Consistent with this, IL-27 promoted cell survival and reduced TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis of the leukemic cell lines. IL-27 also decreased the responsiveness of the leukemic cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, cytarabine and daunorubicin. We observed that IL-27 induced the activation of STAT1/3 and ERK1/2 in the leukemic cells. Growth stimulation by IL-27 was suppressed by the specific MEK inhibitor, U0126, indicating that IL-27-induced cell proliferation is mainly mediated through the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. The present study is the first demonstration of the proliferative and antichemotherapeutic properties of IL-27 in human leukemic cell lines, suggesting that IL-27 can play an unfavorable role in tumor growth and can be an important determinant in the chemoresponsiveness of certain subtypes of human leukemia.","['Jia, Haiyan', 'Dilger, Paula', 'Bird, Chris', 'Wadhwa, Meenu']","['Jia H', 'Dilger P', 'Bird C', 'Wadhwa M']","['Cytokines and Growth Factors Section, Biotherapeutics Group, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control , Potters Bar, United Kingdom .', 'Cytokines and Growth Factors Section, Biotherapeutics Group, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control , Potters Bar, United Kingdom .', 'Cytokines and Growth Factors Section, Biotherapeutics Group, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control , Potters Bar, United Kingdom .', 'Cytokines and Growth Factors Section, Biotherapeutics Group, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control , Potters Bar, United Kingdom .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-27/genetics/*immunology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2016/04/28 06:00,2017/11/04 06:00,['2016/04/28 06:00'],"['2016/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/04 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2016 May;36(5):302-16. doi: 10.1089/jir.2015.0091.

MLL fusions are also hallmark oncogenic events in secondary acute myeloid leukemia. They are a direct consequence of mis-repaired DNA double strand breaks (DNA-DSBs) due to defects in the DNA damage response associated with exposure to topoisomerase-II poisons such as etoposide. It has been suggested that MLL fusions render cells susceptible to additional chromosomal damage upon exposure to etoposide. Conversely, the genome-wide mutational landscape in MLL-rearranged infant B-ALL has been reported silent. Thus, whether MLL fusions compromise the recognition and/or repair of DNA damage remains unanswered. Here, the fusion proteins MLL-AF4 (MA4) and AF4-MLL (A4M) were CRISPR/Cas9-genome edited in the AAVS1 locus of HEK293 cells as a model to study MLL fusion-mediated DNA-DSB formation/repair. Repair kinetics of etoposide- and ionizing radiation-induced DSBs was identical in WT, MA4- and A4M-expressing cells, as revealed by flow cytometry, by immunoblot for gammaH2AX and by comet assay. Accordingly, no differences were observed between WT, MA4- and A4M-expressing cells in the presence of master proteins involved in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ; i.e.KU86, KU70), alternative-NHEJ (Alt-NHEJ; i.e.LigIIIa, WRN and PARP1), and homologous recombination (HR, i.e.RAD51). Moreover, functional assays revealed identical NHEJ and HR efficiency irrespective of the genotype. Treatment with etoposide consistently induced cell cycle arrest in S/G2/M independent of MA4/A4M expression, revealing a proper activation of the DNA damage checkpoints. Collectively, expression of MA4 or A4M does neither influence DNA signaling nor DNA-DSB repair.","['Castano, Julio', 'Herrero, Ana B', 'Bursen, Aldeheid', 'Gonzalez, Federico', 'Marschalek, Rolf', 'Gutierrez, Norma C', 'Menendez, Pablo']","['Castano J', 'Herrero AB', 'Bursen A', 'Gonzalez F', 'Marschalek R', 'Gutierrez NC', 'Menendez P']","['Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, University Hospital of Salamanca, IBSAL, IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Institute Pharmaceutical Biology, Goethe-University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'IBEC - Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute Pharmaceutical Biology, Goethe-University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Hematology Department, University Hospital of Salamanca, IBSAL, IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects/genetics/radiation effects', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/drug effects/radiation effects', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA End-Joining Repair', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Homologous Recombination', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Radiation, Ionizing']",2016/04/28 06:00,2017/12/19 06:00,['2016/04/28 06:00'],"['2016/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 May 24;7(21):30440-52. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.8938.,10.18632/oncotarget.8938 [doi],,"['0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",PMC5058691,['NOTNLM'],"['AF4.MLL', 'DSB', 'MLL.AF4', 't(4;11)']","['The authors have no conflict of interest to disclose.

The deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) enzyme limits its activation rate. Therefore, decreased expression levels of these genes may influence the response rate to this drug. METHODS: AML patients without previous treatment were enrolled. The expression of hENT1 and dCK genes was analyzed using RT-PCR. Clinical parameters were registered. All patients received Ara-C + doxorubicin as an induction regimen (7 + 3 schema). Descriptive statistics were used to analyze data. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to determine factors that influenced response and survival. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were included from January 2011 until December 2012. Median age was 36.5 years. All patients had an adequate performance status (43% with ECOG 1 and 57% with ECOG 2). Cytogenetic risk was considered unfavorable in 54% of the patients. Complete response was achieved in 53.8%. Cox regression analysis showed that a higher hENT1 expression level was the only factor that influenced response and survival. CONCLUSIONS: These results highly suggest that the pharmacogenetic analyses of Ara-C influx may be decisive in AML patients.","['Candelaria, Myrna', 'Corrales-Alfaro, Carmen', 'Gutierrez-Hernandez, Olga', 'Diaz-Chavez, Jose', 'Labardini-Mendez, Juan', 'Vidal-Millan, Silvia', 'Herrera, Luis A']","['Candelaria M', 'Corrales-Alfaro C', 'Gutierrez-Hernandez O', 'Diaz-Chavez J', 'Labardini-Mendez J', 'Vidal-Millan S', 'Herrera LA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/28 06:00,2017/02/09 06:00,['2016/04/28 06:00'],"['2015/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2016;61(6):313-8. doi: 10.1159/000445370.

The vast majority occurs within the adrenal glands, but several cases of extra-adrenal myelolipomas (EAMLs) have been reported.

CT scan of abdomen and pelvis showed a 6 cm x 5 cm, well-circumscribed, predominantly fatty mass in the presacral region. Histological examination of the pelvic mass revealed a myelolipoma heavily infiltrated by small lymphoid cell aggregates with immunophenotypic features of small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SLL/CLL). Review of the literature revealed that there is only one published report of SLL/CLL involving a myelolipoma, which was also an extra-adrenal myelolipoma, and, therefore, our case is the second case of a SLL/CLL involving a myelolipoma that is an extra-adrenal myelolipoma. Extra-adrenal myelolipomas seem to the preferred myelolipomas for involvement by SLL/CLL.","['Arora, Komal', 'Sidhu, Jagmohan']","['Arora K', 'Sidhu J']","['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'UHS Wilson Medical Center, 33-57 Harrison Street, Johnson City, NY 13790, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,2016/04/28 06:00,2016/04/28 06:01,['2016/04/28 06:00'],"['2015/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/28 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2016;2016:7364951. doi: 10.1155/2016/7364951.

However, as MSC also modulate the activity of NK cells, which play an important role in graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reaction, their administration could hamper this beneficial effect of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. MSC can be expanded from several sources, especially bone marrow and fat, but it is not well established if the cell source makes a difference in their immunoregulatory capacity. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the immunomodulatory effect of MSC derived from bone marrow (BM-CSM) or adipose tissue (AT-MSC) on NK cells, to determine whether the use of MSC from one or the other origin could be more favorable to preserve NK cell activity and, therefore, GVL. METHODS: Human NK cells were stimulated with IL-15 in the presence of BM-MSC or AT-MSC. The effect of both MSC populations on NK cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and CD56 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. Cytokine secretion was measured by ELISA, and cytotoxic activity was assessed by calcein release assays. RESULTS: Although both BM-MSC and AT-MSC induced a similar inhibition of NK cell proliferation, only BM-MSC decreased significantly NK cell cytotoxic activity and showed a trend for a higher reduction of IFN-gamma secretion. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that, in the context of GVHD inhibition, the use of AT-MSC rather than BM-MSC could further preserve NK cell activity and, thus, favor GVL.","['Blanco, Belen', 'Herrero-Sanchez, Maria Del Carmen', 'Rodriguez-Serrano, Concepcion', 'Garcia-Martinez, Maria Lourdes', 'Blanco, Juan F', 'Muntion, Sandra', 'Garcia-Arranz, Mariano', 'Sanchez-Guijo, Fermin', 'Del Canizo, Consuelo']","['Blanco B', 'Herrero-Sanchez MD', 'Rodriguez-Serrano C', 'Garcia-Martinez ML', 'Blanco JF', 'Muntion S', 'Garcia-Arranz M', 'Sanchez-Guijo F', 'Del Canizo C']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca - Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca - Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca - Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Cirugia Plastica, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca - Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Traumatologia y Ortopedia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca - Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca - Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Laboratorio de Terapia Celular, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Fundacion Jimenez Diaz (IIS-FJD) - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca - Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca - Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Adipose Tissue/*cytology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Communication/*immunology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunomodulation', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype']",2016/04/28 06:00,2017/02/07 06:00,['2016/04/28 06:00'],"['2016/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2016 Dec;97(6):528-537. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12765.

Clinical outcomes in younger patients have improved over the years but, unfortunately, there is little evidence for an equivalent improvement in outcome for older patients. Approximately 50 % of older patients who are able to receive intensive chemotherapy will achieve a complete remission; however, they face a much higher relapse rate than younger patients, and survival rates for this group are low. Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve outcomes in older patients with AML. In this article, we discuss current treatment paradigms for older patients with AML including the challenges faced when determining which patients are eligible for intensive chemotherapy. We then highlight new treatments in development that may benefit this patient group. Cytotoxic agents, hypomethylating agents, molecularly targeted agents, and cell cycle kinase inhibitors are discussed, with a focus on novel agents that have achieved an advanced stage of development. Overall, the treatment of AML in older patients remains a challenge and, whenever possible, treatment should be offered in the context of clinical trials and should be planned with curative intent.","['Sanz, Miguel A', 'Iacoboni, Gloria', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Venditti, Adriano']","['Sanz MA', 'Iacoboni G', 'Montesinos P', 'Venditti A']","['Hematology Department, Valencia University Medical School, Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Avinguda Fernando Abril Martorell, 106, Valencia, 46026, Spain. msanz@uv.es.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain. msanz@uv.es.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Tor Vergata University Hospital, Viale Oxford 81, 00133, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytotoxins/therapeutic use', 'Disease Management', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Therapies, Investigational', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2016/04/28 06:00,2017/01/28 06:00,['2016/04/28 06:00'],"['2016/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2016 Oct;95(10):1583-93. doi: 10.1007/s00277-016-2666-2.

Additionally, the majority of patients treated for relapsed disease demonstrate evidence of measurable disease. Eradication of minimal residual disease (MRD) results in improved PFS and overall survival. Maintenance therapy might result in eradication of MRD and improve response duration but might be associated with an increase in incidence of infectious complications. Flavopiridol is a broad cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor with established safety and efficacy in patients with relapsed CLL, particularly patients with high-risk cytogenetic features. A pharmacologically derived schedule was utilized as consolidation therapy in this phase I study to assess the safety and feasibility of outpatient therapy with flavopiridol in patients with low tumor burden. Flavopiridol was administered as a 30-min loading dose of 30 mg/m(2) followed by a 4-h infusion of 30 mg/m(2) once weekly for 3 weeks every 5 weeks (1 cycle) for planned 2 cycles in ten patients. Therapy was extremely well tolerated and no patient developed acute tumor lysis syndrome. The most common toxicities were gastrointestinal. Of the patients, 22 % improved their response from a PR to CR. Eighty-eight percent experienced a reduction in tumor burden as measured by extent of bone marrow involvement including patients with del17p and complex karyotype. The study establishes the safety and efficacy of flavopiridol as consolidation therapy after chemoimmunotherapy for patients with CLL. Further evaluation is required in larger trials for the utility of CDK inhibitors as consolidation or maintenance strategies.Registration number at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00377104.","['Awan, Farrukh T', 'Jones, Jeffrey A', 'Maddocks, Kami', 'Poi, Ming', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Johnson, Amy', 'Byrd, John C', 'Andritsos, Leslie A']","['Awan FT', 'Jones JA', 'Maddocks K', 'Poi M', 'Grever MR', 'Johnson A', 'Byrd JC', 'Andritsos LA']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, 320 W. 10th Avenue, Columbus, Ohio, 43210, USA.

Thus, developing novel strategies to enhance immune function merits further investigation as a possible therapy for CLL. METHODS: We generated a fusion cytokine (fusokine) arising from the combination of human GM-CSF and IL-4 (named GIFT4). Primary CLL cells were treated with GIFT4 or GM-CSG and IL-4 in vitro. GIFT4-triggered STAT5 signaling in CLL cells was examined by Western blot. The phenotype and secretome of GIFT4-treated CLL cells (GIFT4-CLL cells), and the immune stimulatory function of GIFT4-CLL cells on autologous T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and luminex assay. RESULTS: GIFT4-CLL up-regulated the expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD86 and adhesion molecule CD54. GIFT4-CLL cells secreted IL-1beta, IL-6, ICAM-1 and substantial IL-2 relative to unstimulated CLL cells. GIFT4 treatment led to JAK1, JAK2 and JAK3-mediated hyper-phosphorylation of STAT5 in primary CLL cells, which is essential for GIFT4-triggered conversion of CLL cells. GIFT4-CLL cells directly propelled the expansion of autologous IFN-gamma-producing CD314(+) cytotoxic T cells in vitro, and that these could lyse autologous CLL cells. Furthermore, administration of GIFT4 protein promoted the expansion of human T cells in NOD-scid IL2Rgamma(null) immune deficient mice adoptively pre-transferred with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from subjects with CLL. CONCLUSION: GIFT4 has potent capability to converts primary CLL cells into APC-like immune helper cells that initiate a T cell driven anti-CLL immune response.","['Deng, Jiusheng', 'Pennati, Andrea', 'Cohen, Jonathon B', 'Wu, Yuanqiang', 'Ng, Spencer', 'Wu, Jian Hui', 'Flowers, Christopher R', 'Galipeau, Jacques']","['Deng J', 'Pennati A', 'Cohen JB', 'Wu Y', 'Ng S', 'Wu JH', 'Flowers CR', 'Galipeau J']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, 1365B Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA. jdeng2@emory.edu.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, 1365B Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, 1365B Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, 1365B Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, 1365B Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, 1365B Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, 1365B Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA. jgalipe@emory.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cross-Priming/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Proteome/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/cytology/drug effects/*immunology']",2016/04/28 06:00,2017/10/17 06:00,['2016/04/28 06:00'],"['2015/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/17 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2016 Apr 27;14(1):106. doi: 10.1186/s12967-016-0865-1.,10.1186/s12967-016-0865-1 [doi],20160427,"['0 (Proteome)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",PMC4847253,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*GIFT4 fusokine', '*Immunotherapy', '*T cells']",,"['10.1186/s12967-016-0865-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12967-016-0865-1 [pii]']",,,"['P30 CA138292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI093881/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008169/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Crosstalk between CD4(+) T cells and proliferating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) tumor B cells occurs within lymphoid tissue pseudofollicles, and investigating these interactions is essential to understand both disease pathogenesis and the effects of immunotherapy. Tumor-derived extracellular vesicle (EV) shedding is emerging as an important mode of intercellular communication in the TME. In order to characterize tumor EVs released in response to T-cell-derived TME signals, we performed microRNA (miRNA [miR]) profiling of EVs released from CLL cells stimulated with CD40 and interleukin-4 (IL-4). Our results reveal an enrichment of specific cellular miRNAs including miR-363 within EVs derived from CD40/IL-4-stimulated CLL cells compared with parental cell miRNA content and control EVs from unstimulated CLL cells. We demonstrate that autologous patient CD4(+) T cells internalize CLL-EVs containing miR-363 that targets the immunomodulatory molecule CD69. We further reveal that autologous CD4(+) T cells that are exposed to EVs from CD40/IL-4-stimulated CLL cells exhibit enhanced migration, immunological synapse signaling, and interactions with tumor cells. Knockdown of miR-363 in CLL cells prior to CD40/IL-4 stimulation prevented the ability of CLL-EVs to induce increased synapse signaling and confer altered functional properties to CD4(+) T cells. Taken together, these data reveal a novel role for CLL-EVs in modifying T-cell function that highlights unanticipated complexity of intercellular communication that may have implications for bidirectional CD4(+) T-cell:tumor interactions within the TME.","['Smallwood, Dawn T', 'Apollonio, Benedetta', 'Willimott, Shaun', 'Lezina, Larissa', 'Alharthi, Afaf', 'Ambrose, Ashley R', 'De Rossi, Giulia', 'Ramsay, Alan G', 'Wagner, Simon D']","['Smallwood DT', 'Apollonio B', 'Willimott S', 'Lezina L', 'Alharthi A', 'Ambrose AR', 'De Rossi G', 'Ramsay AG', 'Wagner SD']","['Department of Cancer Studies, and Ernest and Helen Scott Haematology Research Institute, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom;', ""Department of Haemato-Oncology, Division of Cancer Studies, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, London, United Kingdom;"", 'Department of Cancer Studies, and Ernest and Helen Scott Haematology Research Institute, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom;', 'Department of Cancer Studies, and Ernest and Helen Scott Haematology Research Institute, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom;', 'Department of Cancer Studies, and Ernest and Helen Scott Haematology Research Institute, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom;', 'Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom; and.', 'Centre for Microvascular Research, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom.', ""Department of Haemato-Oncology, Division of Cancer Studies, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, London, United Kingdom;"", 'Department of Cancer Studies, and Ernest and Helen Scott Haematology Research Institute, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'CD40 Antigens/*immunology', 'Cell Communication/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*immunology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Secretory Vesicles/*immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2016/04/28 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2016/04/28 06:00'],"['2015/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jul 28;128(4):542-52. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-11-682377.

A study by the EBMT Chronic Malignancies Working Party.,2047-2054,"We describe the use and outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for multiple myeloma (MM) in Europe between January 1990 and December 2012. We identified 7333 patients, median age at allo-HSCT was 51 years (range: 18-78), of whom 4539 (62%) were males. We distinguished three groups: (1) allo-HSCT upfront (n=1924), (2) tandem auto-allo-HSCT (n=2004) and (3) allo-HSCT as a second line treatment and beyond (n=3405). Overall, there is a steady increase in numbers of allo-HSCT over the years. Upfront allo-HSCT use increased up to year 2000, followed by a decrease thereafter and represented 12% of allo-HSCTs performed in 2012. Tandem auto-allo-HSCT peaked around year 2004 and contributed to 19% of allo-HSCTs in 2012. Allo-HSCT as salvage after one or two or three autografts was steadily increasing over the last years and represented 69% of allo-HSCTs in 2012. Remarkable heterogeneity in using allo-HSCT was observed among the different European countries. The 5-year survival probabilities from time of allo-HSCT for the three groups after year 2004 were 42%, 54% and 32%, respectively. These results show that the use of allo-HSCT is increasing in Europe, especially as second line treatment and beyond. There is an unmet need for well-designed prospective studies investigating allo-HSCT as salvage therapy for MM.","['Sobh, M', 'Michallet, M', 'Gahrton, G', 'Iacobelli, S', 'van Biezen, A', 'Schonland, S', 'Petersen, E', 'Schaap, N', 'Bonifazi, F', 'Volin, L', 'Meijer, E', 'Niederwieser, D', 'El Cheikh, J', 'Tabrizi, R', 'Fegeux, N', 'Finke, J', 'Bunjes, D', 'Cornelissen, J', 'Einsele, H', 'Bruno, B', 'Potter, M', 'Fanin, R', 'Mohty, M', 'Garderet, L', 'Kroger, N']","['Sobh M', 'Michallet M', 'Gahrton G', 'Iacobelli S', 'van Biezen A', 'Schonland S', 'Petersen E', 'Schaap N', 'Bonifazi F', 'Volin L', 'Meijer E', 'Niederwieser D', 'El Cheikh J', 'Tabrizi R', 'Fegeux N', 'Finke J', 'Bunjes D', 'Cornelissen J', 'Einsele H', 'Bruno B', 'Potter M', 'Fanin R', 'Mohty M', 'Garderet L', 'Kroger N']","['Hematology Department, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Pierre Benite, France.', 'Hematology Department, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Pierre Benite, France.', 'Hematology Department, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Centro Interdipartimentale di Biostatistica e Bioinformatica, Universita Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'EBMT Data Office, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Hematology Department, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Hematology Department, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Hematology department, Radboud University-Nijmegen Medical Center, The Netherlands.', 'Hematology Department, Bologna University, S.Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, Bologna, Italy.', 'Hematology Department, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Department, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Hematology Department, University Hospital Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology Department, Hopital Haut-leveque, Pessac, France.', 'Hematology Department, CHU Lapeyronie, Montpellier, France.', 'Hematology Department, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Hematology Department, Universitatsklinikum Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Hematology Department, Erasmus MC-Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Hematology Department, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Hematology Department, Presidio Molinette, Torino, Italy.', 'Hematology Department, Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK.', 'Hematology Department, Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria di Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Saint Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Saint Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Hematology Department, University Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/trends', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/mortality/*therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/28 06:00,2017/08/08 06:00,['2016/04/28 06:00'],"['2015/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/11 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Oct;30(10):2047-2054. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.101.

Recent research has focused on targeting ubiquitin receptors upstream of 20S proteasome, with the aim of generating less toxic therapies. Here we show that 19S proteasome-associated ubiquitin receptor Rpn13 is more highly expressed in MM cells than in normal plasma cells. Rpn13-siRNA (small interfering RNA) decreases MM cell viability. A novel agent RA190 targets Rpn13 and inhibits proteasome function, without blocking the proteasome activity or the 19S deubiquitylating activity. CRISPR/Cas9 Rpn13-knockout demonstrates that RA190-induced activity is dependent on Rpn13. RA190 decreases viability in MM cell lines and patient MM cells, inhibits proliferation of MM cells even in the presence of bone marrow stroma and overcomes bortezomib resistance. Anti-MM activity of RA190 is associated with induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis and unfolded protein response-related apoptosis. MM xenograft model studies show that RA190 is well tolerated, inhibits tumor growth and prolongs survival. Combining RA190 with bortezomib, lenalidomide or pomalidomide induces synergistic anti-MM activity. Our preclinical data validates targeting Rpn13 to overcome bortezomib resistance, and provides the framework for clinical evaluation of Rpn13 inhibitors, alone or in combination, to improve patient outcome in MM.","['Song, Y', 'Ray, A', 'Li, S', 'Das, D S', 'Tai, Y T', 'Carrasco, R D', 'Chauhan, D', 'Anderson, K C']","['Song Y', 'Ray A', 'Li S', 'Das DS', 'Tai YT', 'Carrasco RD', 'Chauhan D', 'Anderson KC']","['LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzylidene Compounds/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib/therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Drug Synergism', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mice', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2016/04/28 06:00,2017/08/30 06:00,['2016/04/28 06:00'],"['2015/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/01 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Sep;30(9):1877-86. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.97.

Using an ENU-based forward genetic screen for mice with erythroid phenotypes, we identified a heterozygous mouse line carrying a mutation in the GTPase domain of Dnm2 (Dnm2(V265G)) that induced a microcytic anemia. In vitro assays using the V265G mutant demonstrated loss of GTPase activity and impaired endocytosis that was comparable to other DNM2 mutants identified in human T-ALL. To determine the effects of DNM2 mutations in T-ALL, we bred the Dnm2(V265G) mice with the Lmo2 transgenic mouse model of T-ALL. Heterozygous Dnm2 mutants lacking the Lmo2 transgene displayed normal T-cell development, and did not develop T-ALL. In contrast, compound heterozygotes displayed an accelerated onset of T-ALL compared with mice carrying the Lmo2 oncogene alone. The leukemias from these mice exhibited a more immature immunophenotype and an expansion in leukemic stem cell numbers. Mechanistically, the Dnm2 mutation impaired clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the interleukin (IL)-7 receptor resulting in increased receptor density on the surface of leukemic stem cells. These findings suggest that DNM2 mutations cooperate with T-cell oncogenes by enhancing IL-7 signalling.","['Tremblay, C S', 'Brown, F C', 'Collett, M', 'Saw, J', 'Chiu, S K', 'Sonderegger, S E', 'Lucas, S E', 'Alserihi, R', 'Chau, N', 'Toribio, M L', 'McCormack, M P', 'Chircop, M', 'Robinson, P J', 'Jane, S M', 'Curtis, D J']","['Tremblay CS', 'Brown FC', 'Collett M', 'Saw J', 'Chiu SK', 'Sonderegger SE', 'Lucas SE', 'Alserihi R', 'Chau N', 'Toribio ML', 'McCormack MP', 'Chircop M', 'Robinson PJ', 'Jane SM', 'Curtis DJ']","['Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', ""Cell Signalling Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Cancer and Haematology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', ""Cell Signalling Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", 'Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.', 'Cancer and Haematology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', ""Cell Signalling Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Cell Signalling Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Clinical Haematology, Alfred Hospital, Prahran, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Clinical Haematology, Alfred Hospital, Prahran, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics', 'Animals', 'Dynamin II/*genetics', 'Endocytosis/genetics', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-7/*metabolism', 'LIM Domain Proteins/genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Oncogenes', 'Signal Transduction']",2016/04/28 06:00,2017/08/08 06:00,['2016/04/28 06:00'],"['2015/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Oct;30(10):1993-2001. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.100.

Proteasome mutations were implicated as underlying mechanism, while an alternative hypothesis based on low activation status of the unfolded protein response was recently suggested (IRE1/XBP1-low model). We generated bortezomib- and carfilzomib-adapted, highly resistant multiple myeloma cell clones (AMO-BTZ, AMO-CFZ), which we analyzed in a combined quantitative and functional proteomic approach. We demonstrate that proteasome inhibitor-adapted myeloma cells tolerate subtotal proteasome inhibition, irrespective of a proteasome mutation, and uniformly show an 'IRE1/XBP1-low' signature. Adaptation of myeloma cells to proteasome inhibitors involved quantitative changes in >600 protein species with similar patterns in AMO-BTZ and AMO-CFZ cells: proteins involved in metabolic regulation, redox homeostasis, and protein folding and destruction were upregulated, while apoptosis and transcription/translation were downregulated. The quantitatively most upregulated protein in AMO-CFZ cells was the multidrug resistance protein (MDR1) protein ABCB1, and carfilzomib resistance could be overcome by MDR1 inhibition. We propose a model where proteasome inhibitor-adapted myeloma cells tolerate subtotal proteasome inhibition owing to metabolic adaptations that favor the generation of reducing equivalents, such as NADPH, which is supported by oxidative glycolysis. Proteasome inhibitor resistance may thus be targeted by manipulating the energy and redox metabolism.","['Soriano, G P', 'Besse, L', 'Li, N', 'Kraus, M', 'Besse, A', 'Meeuwenoord, N', 'Bader, J', 'Everts, B', 'den Dulk, H', 'Overkleeft, H S', 'Florea, B I', 'Driessen, C']","['Soriano GP', 'Besse L', 'Li N', 'Kraus M', 'Besse A', 'Meeuwenoord N', 'Bader J', 'Everts B', 'den Dulk H', 'Overkleeft HS', 'Florea BI', 'Driessen C']","['Gorlaeus Laboratories, Leiden Institute of Chemistry and Netherlands Proteomics Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Experimental Oncology and Hematology, Department of Oncology and Hematology, Kantonsspital St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland.', 'Gorlaeus Laboratories, Leiden Institute of Chemistry and Netherlands Proteomics Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Experimental Oncology and Hematology, Department of Oncology and Hematology, Kantonsspital St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland.', 'Experimental Oncology and Hematology, Department of Oncology and Hematology, Kantonsspital St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland.', 'Gorlaeus Laboratories, Leiden Institute of Chemistry and Netherlands Proteomics Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Experimental Oncology and Hematology, Department of Oncology and Hematology, Kantonsspital St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland.', 'Department of Parasitology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Gorlaeus Laboratories, Leiden Institute of Chemistry and Netherlands Proteomics Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Gorlaeus Laboratories, Leiden Institute of Chemistry and Netherlands Proteomics Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Gorlaeus Laboratories, Leiden Institute of Chemistry and Netherlands Proteomics Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Experimental Oncology and Hematology, Department of Oncology and Hematology, Kantonsspital St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/physiology', 'Adaptation, Biological', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clone Cells', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/genetics', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Proteomics']",2016/11/03 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2016/04/28 06:00'],"['2015/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Nov;30(11):2198-2207. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.102.

Novel therapies targeting the MM cell in its hypoxic BM milieu may overcome drug resistance. Recent studies led to the development of a novel molecule RRx-001 with hypoxia-selective epigenetic and nitric oxide-donating properties. Here, we demonstrate that RRx-001 decreases the viability of MM cell lines and primary patient cells, as well as overcomes drug resistance. RRx-001 inhibits MM cell growth in the presence of BM stromal cells. RRx-001-induced apoptosis is associated with: (i) activation of caspases; (ii) release of ROS and nitrogen species; (iii) induction of DNA damage via ATM/gamma-H2AX; and (iv) decrease in DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and global methylation. RNA interference study shows a predominant role of DNMT1 in MM cell survival versus DNMT3a or DNMT3b. The deubiquitylating enzyme USP7 stimulates DNMT1 activity, and conversely, USP7-siRNA reduced DNMT1 activity and decreased MM cell viability. RRx-001 plus USP7 inhibitor P5091 triggered synergistic anti-MM activity. MM xenograft studies show that RRx-001 is well tolerated, inhibits tumor growth and enhances survival. Combining RRx-001 with pomalidomide, bortezomib or SAHA induces synergistic anti-MM activity. Our results provide the rationale for translation of RRx-001, either alone or in combination, to clinical evaluation in MM.","['Das, D Sharma', 'Ray, A', 'Das, A', 'Song, Y', 'Tian, Z', 'Oronsky, B', 'Richardson, P', 'Scicinski, J', 'Chauhan, D', 'Anderson, K C']","['Das DS', 'Ray A', 'Das A', 'Song Y', 'Tian Z', 'Oronsky B', 'Richardson P', 'Scicinski J', 'Chauhan D', 'Anderson KC']","['LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Childrens Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'EpicentRx, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA.', 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'EpicentRx, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA.', 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Azetidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib/therapeutic use', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Epigenomics', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Nitro Compounds/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Thalidomide/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7']",2016/11/03 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2016/04/28 06:00'],"['2015/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/26 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Nov;30(11):2187-2197. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.96.

We generated a zebrafish model overexpressing CREB in the myeloid lineage, which showed an aberrant regulation of primitive hematopoiesis, and in 79% of adult CREB-zebrafish a block of myeloid differentiation, triggering to a monocytic leukemia akin the human counterpart. Gene expression analysis of CREB-zebrafish revealed a signature of 20 differentially expressed human homologous CREB targets in common with pediatric AML. Among them, we demonstrated that CREB overexpression increased CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein-delta (C/EBPdelta) levels to cause myeloid differentiation arrest, and the silencing of CREB-C/EBPdelta axis restored myeloid terminal differentiation. Then, C/EBPdelta overexpression was found to identify a subset of pediatric AML affected by a block of myeloid differentiation at monocytic stage who presented a significant higher relapse risk and the enrichment of aggressive signatures. Finally, this study unveils the aberrant activation of CREB-C/EBPdelta axis concurring to AML onset by disrupting the myeloid cell differentiation process.

MK terminal differentiation is enhanced by up-regulation of AS-RBM15 expression and attenuated by AS-RBM15 knockdown. At the molecular level, AS-RBM15 enhances RBM15 protein translation in a CAP-dependent manner. The region of the antisense AS-RBM15 RNA, which overlaps with the 5'UTR of RBM15, is sufficient for the up-regulation of RBM15 protein translation. In addition, we find that transcription of both RBM15 and AS-RBM15 is activated by the transcription factor RUNX1 and repressed by RUNX1-ETO, a leukemic fusion protein.

Disease relapse remains a major cause of transplant failure. T cell homeostasis is critical to determine the potency of the GVT effect. Recent studies have shown the association of the CTLA-4 polymorphisms with the outcome after HLA-identical sibling allogeneic HSCT. METHODS: In this study, we focused on four CTLA-4 polymorphisms, and analyzed the impact of donor genotypes and haplotypes on the conditions of 152 acute leukemia patients (ALL 83) after related HLA-haplotype- mismatched transplantation. The four SNP genotypes (-1661, -318, CT60 and +49) were determined by TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. RESULTS: ALL recipients of donors with +49 GG showed significantly lower OS (67.7 vs. 90.3 %, P = 0.015) than those with GA+AA. Multivariate analyses showed that +49 GG was an independent risk factor for OS (HR: 0.306, 95 % CI 0.111-0.842, P = 0.022) .23 ALL patients receiving mDLI showed significantly lower OS with +49 GG donor than those with GA+AA (30.0 vs. 83.1 %, P = 0.003). The haplotype analysis revealed only three haplotypes in the donor population -1661/-318/CT60/+49 i.e., ACGG, ACAA and GTGA, the frequencies were 64.1, 19.4 and 16.5 %, respectively. Donors with and without the ACGG/ACGG haplotype had the same effect on transplant outcomes as those with +49 GG and +49 GA+AA. CONCLUSION: In summary, the CTLA-4 +49 GG and the haplotype ACGG/ACGG reduced the overall survival in ALL after allo-HSCT from the related HLA-haplotype-mismatched donor, knowledge of the CTLA-4 polymorphism and haplotype may provide useful information for donor selection and individual application of immunosuppressive agents and immunotherapy.","['Qin, X-Y', 'Wang, Y', 'Li, G-X', 'Qin, Y-Z',

We retrospectively analysed the results of 259 adult AML patients treated as first salvage with FLAG-Ida or FLAG-Ida plus Gentuzumab-Ozogamicin (FLAGO-Ida) of the Programa Espanol de Tratamientos en Hematologia (PETHEMA) database, developing a prognostic score system of survival in this setting (SALFLAGE score). Overall, 221 patients received FLAG-Ida and 38 FLAGO-Ida; 92 were older than 60 years. The complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) rate was 51%, with 9% of induction deaths. Three covariates were associated with lower CR/CRi: high-risk cytogenetics and t(8;21) at diagnosis, no previous allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) and relapse-free interval <1 year. Allo-SCT was performed in second CR in 60 patients (23%). The median overall survival (OS) of the entire cohort was 0.7 years, with 22% OS at 5-years. Four independent variables were used to construct the score: cytogenetics, FLT3-internal tandem duplication, length of relapse-free interval and previous allo-SCT. Using this stratification system, three groups were defined: favourable (26% of patients), intermediate (29%) and poor-risk (45%), with an expected 5-year OS of 52%, 26% and 7%, respectively. The SALFLAGE score discriminated a subset of patients with an acceptable long-term outcome using FLAG-Ida/FLAGO-Ida regimen. The results of this retrospective analysis should be validated in independent external cohorts.","['Bergua, Juan M', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Martinez-Cuadron, David', 'Fernandez-Abellan, Pascual', 'Serrano, Josefina', 'Sayas, Maria J', 'Prieto-Fernandez, Julio', 'Garcia, Raimundo', 'Garcia-Huerta, Ana J', 'Barrios, Manuel', 'Benavente, Celina', 'Perez-Encinas, Manuel', 'Simiele, Adriana', 'Rodriguez-Macias, Gabriela', 'Herrera-Puente, Pilar', 'Rodriguez-Veiga, Rebeca', 'Martinez-Sanchez, Maria P', 'Amador-Barciela, Maria L', 'Riaza-Grau, Rosalia', 'Sanz, Miguel A']","['Bergua JM', 'Montesinos P', 'Martinez-Cuadron D', 'Fernandez-Abellan P', 'Serrano J', 'Sayas MJ', 'Prieto-Fernandez J', 'Garcia R', 'Garcia-Huerta AJ', 'Barrios M', 'Benavente C', 'Perez-Encinas M', 'Simiele A', 'Rodriguez-Macias G', 'Herrera-Puente P', 'Rodriguez-Veiga R', 'Martinez-Sanchez MP', 'Amador-Barciela ML', 'Riaza-Grau R', 'Sanz MA']","['Department of Haematology, Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara, Caceres, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, General Hospital Alicante, Alicante, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital Reina Sofia, Cordoba, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital Doctor Peset, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara, Caceres, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, General Hospital Castellon, Castellon, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Central Hospital of Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital Carlos Haya, Malaga, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Clinic Hospital, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Clinic Hospital, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital Povisa, Vigo, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital Montecelo, Pontevedra, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital Severo Ochoa, Leganes, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', 'Aminoglycosides/*administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Salvage Therapy/*methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/28 06:00,2017/06/07 06:00,['2016/04/28 06:00'],"['2015/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2016 Sep;174(5):700-10. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14107.

An increased incidence of cancer in SSc patients compared with the general population has been reported in several reports. Our aims in this study were to determine the most common malignancies and to investigate the possible risk factors for the development of malignancy in patients with SSc. Three hundred forty SSc patients from 13 centers were included to the study. Data of the patients were obtained by evaluating their medical records retrospectively. A total of 340 patients with SSc were evaluated. Twenty-five of the patients had 19 different types of malignancy. Bladder cancer was the most common type of cancer with four patients and was followed by breast cancer with three patients, and cervix cancer and ovarian cancer with two patients each. Other types of cancers such as squamous cell skin cancer, adenocancer with an unknown origin, multiple myeloma, chronic myeloid leukemia, papillary thyroid cancer, larynx cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, follicular type non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), endometrium cancer, colon cancer, uterus cancer, neuroendocrine tumor, glioblastoma multiforme, and soft tissue sarcoma were diagnosed in one patient each. The only cancer type that showed an association with cyclophosphamide dose was bladder carcinoma. Other malignancies did not show a correlation with age, sex, smoking, type and duration of the disease, autoantibodies, organ involvement, and dose and duration of cyclophosphamide therapy. Cancer may develop in any organ in patients with SSc. Continuous screening of the patients during a follow-up period is necessary for the early detection of the tumor development.","['Kasifoglu, T', 'Yasar Bilge, S', 'Yildiz, F', 'Ozen, G', 'Pehlivan, Y', 'Yilmaz, N', 'Tarhan, F', 'Yilmaz, S', 'Kucuk, A', 'Emmungil, H', 'Koca, S S', 'Cinar, M', 'Direskeneli, H', 'Erken, E', 'Can, G', 'Ozmen, M', 'Gonullu, E', 'Kisacik, B', 'Aksu, K', 'Karadag, O', 'Kasifoglu, N', 'Arslantas, D', 'Sahin, F', 'Keser, G', 'Yavuz, S', 'Birlik, M', 'Onat, A M']","['Kasifoglu T', 'Yasar Bilge S', 'Yildiz F', 'Ozen G', 'Pehlivan Y', 'Yilmaz N', 'Tarhan F', 'Yilmaz S', 'Kucuk A', 'Emmungil H', 'Koca SS', 'Cinar M', 'Direskeneli H', 'Erken E', 'Can G', 'Ozmen M', 'Gonullu E', 'Kisacik B', 'Aksu K', 'Karadag O', 'Kasifoglu N', 'Arslantas D', 'Sahin F', 'Keser G', 'Yavuz S', 'Birlik M', 'Onat AM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Eskisehir Osmangazi University School of Medicine, Sumer Mahallesi, Atali Sokak 4/2, 26400, Eskisehir, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Eskisehir Osmangazi University School of Medicine, Sumer Mahallesi, Atali Sokak 4/2, 26400, Eskisehir, Turkey. suleyasar@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Cukurova University School of Medicine, Adana, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Gaziantep University School of Medicine, Gaziantep, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Istanbul Bilim University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Izmir Katip Celebi University School of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Selcuk University Medical School of Medicine, Konya, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Necmettin Erbakan University School of Medicine, Konya, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Ege University School of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Firat University School of Medicine, Elazig, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Gulhane Military School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Cukurova University School of Medicine, Adana, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Izmir Katip Celebi University School of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Izmir Katip Celebi University School of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Eskisehir Osmangazi University School of Medicine, Sumer Mahallesi, Atali Sokak 4/2, 26400, Eskisehir, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Gaziantep University School of Medicine, Gaziantep, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Ege University School of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Microbiology, Eskisehir Osmangazi University School of Medicine, Eskisehir, Turkey.', 'Department of Public Health, Eskisehir Osmangazi University School of Medicine, Eskisehir, Turkey.', 'Department of Biostatistic, Eskisehir Osmangazi University School of Medicine, Eskisehir, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Ege University School of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Istanbul Bilim University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Dokuz Eylul University School of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Gaziantep University School of Medicine, Gaziantep, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Germany,Clin Rheumatol,Clinical rheumatology,8211469,IM,"['Adult', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*classification/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Scleroderma, Systemic/*complications/drug therapy', 'Turkey']",2016/04/28 06:00,2017/03/16 06:00,['2016/04/28 06:00'],"['2016/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Clin Rheumatol. 2016 Jun;35(6):1529-33. doi: 10.1007/s10067-016-3288-8.

Medicaid provides coverage for 45% of childhood cancer admissions. This study aimed to examine how well APR-DRGs reflect admission costs for childhood cancer chemotherapy to inform clinicians, hospitals, and policymakers in the wake of policy changes. METHODS: We identified 25,613 chemotherapy admissions in the 2009 Kids' Inpatient Database. To determine how well APR-DRGs explain costs, we applied a hierarchic linear regression model of hospital costs, allowing for a variety of patient, hospital, and geographic confounders. RESULTS: APR-DRGs proved to be the most important predictors of admission costs (P < .001), with costs increasing by DRG severity code. Diagnosis, age, and hospital characteristics also predicted costs above and beyond those explained by APR-DRGs. Compared with admissions for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, costs of admissions for patients with acute myelomonocytic leukemia were 82% higher; non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 20% higher; Hodgkin lymphoma, 25% lower; and CNS tumors, 27% lower. Admissions for children who were 10 years of age or older cost 26% to 35% more than admissions for infants. Admissions to children's hospitals cost 46% more than admissions to other hospital types. CONCLUSION: APR-DRGs developed for adults are applicable to childhood cancer chemotherapy but should be refined to account for cancer diagnosis and patient age. Possible policy and clinical management changes merit further study to address factors not captured by APR-DRGs.","['Russell, Heidi', 'Street, Andrew', 'Ho, Vivian']","['Russell H', 'Street A', 'Ho V']","['Baylor College of Medicine; Rice University, Houston, TX; and University of York, York, United Kingdom hvrussel@txch.org.', 'Baylor College of Medicine; Rice University, Houston, TX; and University of York, York, United Kingdom.', 'Baylor College of Medicine; Rice University, Houston, TX; and University of York, York, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Oncol Pract,Journal of oncology practice,101261852,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Diagnosis-Related Groups', 'Female', '*Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization/*economics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Medicaid', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*economics', 'United States']",2016/04/28 06:00,2017/10/04 06:00,['2016/04/28 06:00'],"['2016/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/04 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pract. 2016 May;12(5):e564-75. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2015.010330.

Although hypoxic (meaning insufficient supply of oxygen) and anoxic areas are present and of pathophysiologic importance (by hypoxia-induced pathways such as HiF1alpha) in solid tumors, this may not be true for (malignant) hematologic cells. Hematopoiesis occurs in the stem cell niche, which is characterized, among other things, by extremely low pO2. However, in contrast to solid tumors, in this context, the low pO2 is physiological and this feature, among others, is shared by the malignant stem cell niche harboring leukemia-initiating cells. Upon differentiation, hematopoietic cells are constantly exposed to changes in pO2 as they travel throughout the human body and encounter arterial and venous blood and migrate into oxygen-carrier-free tissue with low pO2. Hematologic malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) make little difference in this respect and, whereas low oxygen is the usual environment of AML cells, recent evidence suggests no role for real hypoxia. Although there is no evidence that AML pathophysiology is related to hypoxia, leukemic blasts still show several distinct biological features when exposed to reduced pO2: they down- or upregulate membrane receptors such as CXCR4 or FLT3, activate or inhibit intracellular signaling pathways such as PI3K, and specifically secrete cytokines (IL-8). In summary, reduced pO2 should not be mistaken for hypoxia (nor should it be so called), and it does not automatically induce hypoxia-response mechanisms; therefore, a strict distinction should be made between physiologically low pO2 (physoxia) and hypoxia.","['Rieger, Christina T', 'Fiegl, Michael']","['Rieger CT', 'Fiegl M']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, 81377 Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, 81377 Munich, Germany.

However, the success has been tainted by the iatrogenic cardiac toxicities. This is especially concerning in the younger population who are facing cardiac disease such as heart failure in their 30s and 40s as the consequence of the anthracycline's side effects (used for childhood leukemia and lymphoma). This resulted in the awareness of cardiotoxic effects of anticancer drugs and emergence of a new discipline: oncocardiology. Since then, numerous anticancer drugs have been correlated to cardiomyopathy. Additionally, other cardiovascular effects have been identified, which includes but is not limited to myocardial infarction, thrombosis, hypertension, arrhythmias, and pulmonary hypertension. In this review we examine some of the anticancer agents that mitigate cardiotoxicity and present current knowledge of molecular mechanism(s).

However, a comprehensive analysis of HBZ, including mRNA and protein expression, humoral immunoreactivity against HBZ, and HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL), in HTLV-1-infected individuals with different clinical status has not been reported previously. RESULTS: In this study, using novel monoclonal antibody-based in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay systems, we report the absolute quantification of HBZ protein and its plasma antibody in clinical samples from HTLV-1-infected individuals with different clinical status. The data were compared to both HBZ mRNA levels and PVL. The results showed that plasma anti-HBZ antibody was detectable only in 10.4 % (5/48) of asymptomatic carriers (ACs), 10.8 % (13/120) of HAM/TSP patients, and 16.7 % (7/42) of ATL patients. HBZ protein was detected in three out of five patients with acute ATL, but was not detected in patients with HAM/TSP (0/10) or ACs (0/4). Thus, an antibody response to HBZ was not associated with the PVL or the expression of HBZ (both at the mRNA and protein levels) or the clinical status of the infection. CONCLUSIONS: The present results emphasize the extremely low expression and immunogenicity of HBZ in natural HTLV-1 infection. However, there is a possibility that the low but distinct expression of HBZ protein in PBMCs is associated with the survival of HTLV-1-infected cells and the development of ATL.","['Shiohama, Yasuo', 'Naito, Tadasuke', 'Matsuzaki, Toshio', 'Tanaka, Reiko', 'Tomoyose, Takeaki', 'Takashima, Hiroshi', 'Fukushima, Takuya', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Saito, Mineki']","['Shiohama Y', 'Naito T', 'Matsuzaki T', 'Tanaka R', 'Tomoyose T', 'Takashima H', 'Fukushima T', 'Tanaka Y', 'Saito M']","['Department of Microbiology, Kawasaki Medical School, 577 Matsushima, Kurashiki, Okayama, 701-0192, Japan.', 'Division of Immunogenetics, Department of Immunobiology and Neuroscience, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Kawasaki Medical School, 577 Matsushima, Kurashiki, Okayama, 701-0192, Japan.', 'Department of Neurology and Geriatrics, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 8-35-1 Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima, 890-8520, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Nishihara, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology, Second Department of Internal Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Nishihara, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan.', 'Department of Neurology and Geriatrics, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 8-35-1 Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima, 890-8520, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Hematoimmnology, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Nishihara, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Nishihara, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Kawasaki Medical School, 577 Matsushima, Kurashiki, Okayama, 701-0192, Japan. mineki@med.kawasaki-m.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*blood', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology/*pathology/*virology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Plasma/*chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/blood', 'RNA, Viral/blood', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*blood', '*Viral Load']",2016/04/28 06:00,2016/10/13 06:00,['2016/04/28 06:00'],"['2016/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/13 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2016 Apr 27;13:29. doi: 10.1186/s12977-016-0263-z.,10.1186/s12977-016-0263-z [doi],20160427,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",PMC4847349,['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'ELISA', 'HBZ', 'HTLV-1', 'Monoclonal antibody']",,"['10.1186/s12977-016-0263-z [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-016-0263-z [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of them is frankincense. This traditional medicine of the East is believed to have anti-inflammatory, expectorant, antiseptic, and even anxiolytic and anti-neurotic effects. The present study aims to verify the reported therapeutic properties of Boswellia resin and describe its chemical composition based on available scientific studies. The main component of frankincense is oil (60%). It contains mono- (13%) and diterpenes (40%) as well as ethyl acetate (21.4%), octyl acetate (13.4%) and methylanisole (7.6%). The highest biological activity among terpenes is characteristic of 11-keto-ss-acetyl-beta-boswellic acid, acetyl-11-keto-ss-boswellic acid and acetyl-alpha-boswellic acid. Contemporary studies have shown that resin indeed has an analgesic, tranquilising and anti-bacterial effects. From the point of view of therapeutic properties, extracts from Boswellia serrata and Boswellia carterii are reported to be particularly useful. They reduce inflammatory conditions in the course of rheumatism by inhibiting leukocyte elastase and degrading glycosaminoglycans. Boswellia preparations inhibit 5-lipoxygenase and prevent the release of leukotrienes, thus having an anti-inflammatory effect in ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, bronchitis and sinusitis. Inhalation and consumption of Boswellia olibanum reduces the risk of asthma. In addition, boswellic acids have an antiproliferative effect on tumours. They inhibit proliferation of tumour cells of the leukaemia and glioblastoma subset. They have an anti-tumour effect since they inhibit topoisomerase I and II-alpha and stimulate programmed cell death (apoptosis).","['Al-Yasiry, Ali Ridha Mustafa', 'Kiczorowska, Bozena']","['Al-Yasiry AR', 'Kiczorowska B']","['Institute of Animal Nutrition and Bromatology, Faculty of Biology and Animal Breeding, University of Life Sciences, Lublin, Poland.', 'Institute of Animal Nutrition and Bromatology, Faculty of Biology and Animal Breeding, University of Life Sciences, Lublin, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Poland,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online),Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),101206517,IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Boswellia/*chemistry', 'Frankincense/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/pharmacology', 'Medicine, Ayurvedic', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/*analysis/pharmacology', 'Resins, Plant', 'Triterpenes/*chemistry/pharmacology']",2016/04/28 06:00,2016/06/18 06:00,['2016/04/28 06:00'],"['2016/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online). 2016 Jan 4;70:380-91. doi: 10.5604/17322693.1200553.,,20160104,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Resins, Plant)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '631-69-6 (boswellic acid)', 'R9XLF1R1WM (Frankincense)']",,,,,"['1200553 [pii]', '10.5604/17322693.1200553 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the rationale of our in vitro trials, we used low-dose decitabine and ATRA to treat 31 myeloid neoplasms deemed ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. The regimen consisted of decitabine at the dose of 15 mg/m(2) intravenously over 1 h daily for consecutive 5 days and ATRA at the dose of 20 mg/m(2) orally from day 1 to 28 except day 4 to 28 in the first cycle, and the regimen was repeated every 28 days. After 6 cycles, decitabine treatment was stopped, and ATRA treatment was continued for maintenance treatment. Treated with a median of 2 cycles (range 1-6), 7 patients (22.6 %) achieved complete remission (CR), 7 (22.6 %) marrow CR (mCR), and 4 (12.9 %) partial remission (PR). The overall remission (CR, mCR, and PR) rate was 58.1 %, and the best response (CR and mCR) rate was 45.2 %. The median overall survival (OS) was 11.0 months, the 1-year OS rate was 41.9 %, and the 2-year OS rate was 26.6 %. In univariate analyses, age, performance status, comorbidities, white blood cell counts and platelets at diagnosis, percentage of bone marrow blasts, karyotype, and treatment efficacy demonstrated no impacts on OS (P > 0.05, each). Main side effects were tolerable hematologic toxicities. In conclusion, low-dose decitabine plus ATRA is a promising treatment for patients with myeloid neoplasms judged ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.","['Wu, Wei', 'Lin, Yan', 'Xiang, Lili', 'Dong, Weimin', 'Hua, Xiaoying', 'Ling, Yun', 'Li, Haiqian', 'Yan, Feng', 'Xie, Xiaobao', 'Gu, Weiying']","['Wu W', 'Lin Y', 'Xiang L', 'Dong W', 'Hua X', 'Ling Y', 'Li H', 'Yan F', 'Xie X', 'Gu W']","[""Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China, 213003."", ""Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China, 213003."", ""Department of Hematology, Xuzhou Central Hospital, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China, 221009."", ""Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China, 213003."", ""Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China, 213003."", ""Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China, 213003."", ""Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China, 213003."", ""Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China, 213003."", ""Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China, 213003. czxxb1098@163.com."", ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Third Affiliated to Suzhou University, Changzhou, 213003, China. czxxb1098@163.com."", ""Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China, 213003. guweiying2001@163.com."", ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Third Affiliated to Suzhou University, Changzhou, 213003, China. guweiying2001@163.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Decitabine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage']",2016/04/27 06:00,2017/01/28 06:00,['2016/04/27 06:00'],"['2016/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2016 Jun;95(7):1051-7. doi: 10.1007/s00277-016-2681-3.

A fuller understanding of the biological features of CSCs is expected to lead to the development of new anticancer therapies capable of eradicating this life-threatening disease. Cancer stem cells are known to maintain a non-proliferative state and to enter the cell cycle only infrequently. Given that conventional anticancer therapies preferentially target dividing cells, CSCs are resistant to such treatments, with those remaining after elimination of bulk cancer cells potentially giving rise to disease relapse and metastasis as they re-enter the cell cycle after a period of latency. Targeting of the switch between quiescence and proliferation in CSCs is therefore a potential strategy for preventing the reinitiation of malignancy, underscoring the importance of elucidation of the mechanisms by which these cells are maintained in the quiescent state. The fundamental properties of CSCs are thought to be governed cooperatively by internal molecules and cues from the external microenvironment (stem cell niche). Several such intrinsic and extrinsic regulators are responsible for the control of cell cycle progression in CSCs. In this review, we address two opposite approaches to the therapeutic targeting of CSCs - wake-up and hibernation therapies - that either promote or prevent the entry of CSCs into the cell cycle, respectively, and we discuss the potential advantages and risks of each strategy.","['Takeishi, Shoichiro', 'Nakayama, Keiichi I']","['Takeishi S', 'Nakayama KI']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'F-Box Proteins/metabolism', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/*pathology', 'PPAR gamma/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism']",2016/04/27 06:00,2017/02/15 06:00,['2016/04/27 06:00'],"['2016/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/15 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2016 Jul;107(7):875-81. doi: 10.1111/cas.12958.

In contrast to the oncogenic role of miR-22 reported in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and breast cancer, here we show that miR-22 is an essential anti-tumour gatekeeper in de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) where it is significantly downregulated. Forced expression of miR-22 significantly suppresses leukaemic cell viability and growth in vitro, and substantially inhibits leukaemia development and maintenance in vivo. Mechanistically, miR-22 targets multiple oncogenes, including CRTC1, FLT3 and MYCBP, and thus represses the CREB and MYC pathways. The downregulation of miR-22 in AML is caused by TET1/GFI1/EZH2/SIN3A-mediated epigenetic repression and/or DNA copy-number loss. Furthermore, nanoparticles carrying miR-22 oligos significantly inhibit leukaemia progression in vivo. Together, our study uncovers a TET1/GFI1/EZH2/SIN3A/miR-22/CREB-MYC signalling circuit and thereby provides insights into epigenetic/genetic mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AML, and also highlights the clinical potential of miR-22-based AML therapy.","['Jiang, Xi', 'Hu, Chao', 'Arnovitz, Stephen', 'Bugno, Jason', 'Yu, Miao', 'Zuo, Zhixiang', 'Chen, Ping', 'Huang, Hao', 'Ulrich,

We aimed to quantify the excess risk of cancer-related deaths among Italian people with AIDS (PWA), as compared with people without AIDS (non-PWA). METHODS: A nationwide, population-based, retrospective cohort study was carried out among 5285 Italian PWA, aged 15-74 years, diagnosed between 2006 and 2011. Date of death and multiple-cause-of-death data were retrieved up to December 2011. Excess mortality, as compared with non-PWA, was estimated using sex- and age-standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Among 1229 deceased PWA, 10.3% reported non-ADCs in the death certificate, including lung (3.1%), and liver (1.4%), cancers. A 7.3-fold (95% CI: 6.1 to 8.7) excess mortality was observed for all non-ADCs combined. Statistically significant SMRs emerged for specific non-ADCs, ie, anus (5 deaths, SMR = 227.6, 95% CI: 73.9 to 531.0), Hodgkin lymphoma (12 deaths, SMR = 122.0, 95% CI: 63.0 to 213.0), unspecified uterus (4 deaths, SMR = 52.5, 95% CI: 14.3 to 134.5), liver (17 deaths, SMR = 13.2, 95% CI: 7.7 to 21.1), skin melanoma (4 deaths, SMR = 10.9, 95% CI: 3.0 to 27.8), lung (38 deaths, SMR = 8.0, 95% CI: 5.7 to 11.0), head and neck (9 deaths, SMR = 7.8, 95% CI: 3.6 to 14.9), leukemia (5 deaths, SMR = 7.6, 95% CI: 2.4 to 17.7), and colon-rectum (10 deaths, SMR = 5.4, 95% CI: 2.6 to 10.0). SMRs for non-ADCs were particularly elevated among PWA infected through injecting drug use. CONCLUSION: This population-based study documented extremely elevated risks of death for non-ADCs among PWA. These findings stress the need of preventive interventions for both virus-related and non-virus-related cancers among HIV-infected individuals.","['Zucchetto, Antonella', 'Virdone, Saverio', 'Taborelli, Martina', 'Grande, Enrico', 'Camoni, Laura', 'Pappagallo, Marilena', 'Regine, Vincenza', 'Grippo, Francesco', 'Polesel, Jerry', 'Dal Maso, Luigino', 'Suligoi, Barbara', 'Frova, Luisa', 'Serraino, Diego']","['Zucchetto A', 'Virdone S', 'Taborelli M', 'Grande E', 'Camoni L', 'Pappagallo M', 'Regine V', 'Grippo F', 'Polesel J', 'Dal Maso L', 'Suligoi B', 'Frova L', 'Serraino D']","['*Unit of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, CRO Aviano National Cancer Institute, Aviano, Italy; daggerServizio Sanita, Salute ed Assistenza, Istituto Nazionale di Statistica, Rome, Italy; and double daggerCentro Operativo AIDS, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999),100892005,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*complications', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/complications/*mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/27 06:00,2017/06/01 06:00,['2016/04/27 06:00'],"['2016/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2016 Oct 1;73(2):190-6. doi: 10.1097/QAI.0000000000001033.,10.1097/QAI.0000000000001033 [doi],,,,,,,['10.1097/QAI.0000000000001033 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis was delayed despite a suggestive radiological presentation of the patient's pulmonary lesion. The uncommon risk profile (T-lymphoblastic lymphoma, short neutropenic phases) wrongly led to a low level of suspicion. The diagnosis was also hampered by the lack of indirect markers for infections caused by Mucorales, the low sensitivity of both fungal culture and panfungal PCR, and the limited availability of species-specific PCR. A high level of suspicion of IFD is needed, and aggressive diagnostic procedures should be promptly initiated even in apparently low-risk patients with uncommon presentations. The extent of the analytical workup should be decided on a case-by-case base. Diagnostic tests such as the galactomannan and beta-D-glucan test and/or PCR on biological material followed by sequencing should be chosen according to their availability and after evaluation of their specificity and sensitivity. In high-risk patients, preemptive therapy with a broad-spectrum mould-active antifungal agent should be started before definitive diagnostic findings become available.","['Zimmerli, Stefan', 'Bialek, Ralf', 'Blau, Igor W', 'Christe, Andreas', 'Lass-Florl, Cornelia', 'Presterl, Elisabeth']","['Zimmerli S', 'Bialek R', 'Blau IW', 'Christe A', 'Lass-Florl C', 'Presterl E']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, 3010, Bern, Switzerland. stefan.zimmerli@insel.ch.', 'LADR GmbH MVZ Dr. Kramer and Kollegen, Lauenburger Strasse 67, 21502, Geesthacht, Germany.', 'Charite University Hospital, Benjamin Franklin Campus, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12200, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Diagnostic, Interventional and Pediatric Radiology, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, 3010, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hygiene and Medical Microbiology, Medical University, Schopfstr. 41, 6020, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, 1090, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Mycopathologia,Mycopathologia,7505689,IM,"['DNA, Fungal/analysis/chemistry/genetics', 'Diagnostic Tests, Routine/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucorales/*isolation & purification', 'Mucormycosis/*diagnosis/microbiology/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Proteoglycans', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'beta-Glucans/analysis']",2016/04/27 06:00,2017/04/04 06:00,['2016/04/27 06:00'],"['2015/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Mycopathologia. 2016 Aug;181(7-8):561-6. doi: 10.1007/s11046-016-0010-y.

This study presented the potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties of ethanol extract of P. fomentarius. The results showed that P. fomentarius extract inhibited the viability of murine leukemia L1210 cells in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 value of 69.35 mug/ml. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that the extract induced apoptosis in L1210 cells. Additionally, the decline of mitochondrial membrane potential was observed as well as the changes of caspase-3, caspase-9, Bcl-2, and Bax, suggesting that proapoptosis effect of the extract involved mitochondria-related pathway. Simultaneously, the P. fomentarius extract significantly enhanced the proliferation and activation of splenic lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner. This P. fomentarius extract has potential applications as a natural antitumor agent with immunomodulatory activity.","['Li, Yixiang', 'Zhou, Yuetao', 'Wang, Xiaobing', 'Wang, Pan', 'Xiao, Yaping', 'Cheng, Xiaoxia', 'Zhang, Yanhua', 'Liu, Yilin', 'Liu, Quanhong']","['Li Y', 'Zhou Y', 'Wang X', 'Wang P', 'Xiao Y', 'Cheng X', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu Y', 'Liu Q']","[""a Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Mushroom Resource and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University , Xi'an , China."", ""a Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Mushroom Resource and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University , Xi'an , China."", ""a Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Mushroom Resource and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University , Xi'an , China."", ""a Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Mushroom Resource and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University , Xi'an , China."", ""a Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Mushroom Resource and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University , Xi'an , China."", ""a Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Mushroom Resource and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University , Xi'an , China."", ""a Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Mushroom Resource and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University , Xi'an , China."", ""a Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Mushroom Resource and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University , Xi'an , China."", ""a Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Mushroom Resource and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University , Xi'an , China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Immunologic Factors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Polyporaceae/*chemistry', 'Spleen/cytology']",2016/04/27 06:00,2017/12/05 06:00,['2016/04/27 06:00'],"['2016/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2016 May-Jun;68(4):708-17. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2016.1158290.

METHODS: A total of 3512 five-year survivors treated before the age of 19 years in 10 French cancer centres between 1948 and 2000 were identified. Educational level, employment status and occupational class of survivors were assessed by a self-reported questionnaire. These outcome measures were compared with sex-age rates recorded in the French population, using indirect standardisation. Paternal occupational class was also considered to control for the role of survivors' socioeconomic background on their achievement. Multivariable analyses were conducted to explore clinical characteristics associated with the outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 2406 survivors responded to the questionnaire and survivors aged below 25 years were included in the current analysis. Compared with national statistics adjusted on age and sex, male survivors were more likely to be college graduates (39.2% vs 30.9% expected; P<0.001). This higher achievement was not observed either for leukaemia or central nervous system (CNS) tumour survivors. Health-related unemployment was higher for survivors of CNS tumour (28.1% vs 4.3%; P<0.001) but not for survivors of other diagnoses. Survivors of non-CNS childhood cancer had a similar or a higher occupational class than expected. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors treated for CNS tumour or leukaemia, especially when treatment included cranial irradiation, might need support throughout their lifespan.","['Dumas, Agnes', 'Berger, Claire', 'Auquier, Pascal', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Fresneau, Brice', 'Allodji, Rodrigue Setcheou', 'Haddy, Nadia', 'Rubino, Carole', 'Vassal, Gilles', 'Valteau-Couanet, Dominique', 'Thouvenin-Doulet, Sandrine', 'Casagranda, Leonie', 'Pacquement, Helene', 'El-Fayech, Chiraz', 'Oberlin, Odile', 'Guibout, Catherine', 'de Vathaire, Florent']","['Dumas A', 'Berger C', 'Auquier P', 'Michel G', 'Fresneau B', 'Allodji RS', 'Haddy N', 'Rubino C', 'Vassal G', 'Valteau-Couanet D', 'Thouvenin-Doulet S', 'Casagranda L', 'Pacquement H', 'El-Fayech C', 'Oberlin O', 'Guibout C', 'de Vathaire F']","['CESP (Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health) U1018, Inserm, 94807 Villejuif, France.', 'Social and Human Sciences Research Unit, Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology-Oncology, CHU Saint-Etienne, 42270 Saint-Priest-en-Jarez, France.', 'Rhone-Alpes Childhood Cancer Registry, 42000 Saint-Etienne, France.', 'Laboratory SNA-EPIS EA4607, Jean Monnet University), 42000 Saint-Etienne, France.', 'Quality of Life Research Unit (EA3279), APHM, Aix Marseille University, 13385 Marseille, France.', 'Quality of Life Research Unit (EA3279), APHM, Aix Marseille University, 13385 Marseille, France.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology-Oncology, La Timone, 13005 Marseille, France.', 'Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Oncology, Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France.', 'CESP (Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health) U1018, Inserm, 94807 Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Clinical Research, Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France.', 'Paris XI University.', 'CESP (Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health) U1018, Inserm, 94807 Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Clinical Research, Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France.', 'Paris XI University.', 'CESP (Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health) U1018, Inserm, 94807 Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Clinical Research, Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France.', 'Paris XI University.', 'Department of Clinical Research, Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Oncology, Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology-Oncology, CHU Saint-Etienne, 42270 Saint-Priest-en-Jarez, France.', 'Rhone-Alpes Childhood Cancer Registry, 42000 Saint-Etienne, France.', 'Laboratory SNA-EPIS EA4607, Jean Monnet University), 42000 Saint-Etienne, France.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, Institut Curie, 75005 Paris, France.', 'CESP (Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health) U1018, Inserm, 94807 Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Oncology, Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Oncology, Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France.', 'CESP (Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health) U1018, Inserm, 94807 Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Clinical Research, Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France.', 'Paris XI University.', 'CESP (Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health) U1018, Inserm, 94807 Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Clinical Research, Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France.', 'Paris XI University.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'France', 'Health Occupations/*trends', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors']",2016/04/27 06:00,2017/05/19 06:00,['2016/04/27 06:00'],"['2015/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/04 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2016 Apr 26;114(9):1060-8. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2016.62.,10.1038/bjc.2016.62 [doi],,,PMC4984908,,,,"['bjc201662 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2016.62 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our knowledge of how normal blood cells degenerate in response to leukemic cell infiltration has been quite limited. This review summarizes recent findings and discusses both extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms underlying the suppression of normal hematopoiesis in leukemia. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have shown that leukemic cells are able to remodel the bone marrow niche by secreting specific cytokines or dampening its hematopoietic-supporting functions. In turn, a suitable microenvironment for leukemic cell proliferation but not for normal hematopoietic cell growth is created. Intrinsically, the leukemic condition impairs the normalcy of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and alters their signaling networks; consequently, it exhausts hematopoietic progenitor cells and forces stem cells into a more quiescent state, which would allow a reversible suppression of hematopoietic regeneration. The deepened quiescence of hematopoietic stem cells in leukemic marrow was achieved in part via transcription factor Egr3. SUMMARY: These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying hematopoietic suppression in response to leukemic cell outgrowth and offer new strategies to further improve current therapies for leukemias, placing more emphasis on the augmentation of normal hematopoietic regeneration when targeting leukemic cells.","['Cheng, Hui', 'Cheng, Tao']","['Cheng H', 'Cheng T']","['aState Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital bCenter for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences cDepartment of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Cells/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', '*Cell Communication', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",2016/04/27 06:00,2017/10/20 06:00,['2016/04/27 06:00'],"['2016/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2016 Jul;23(4):304-10. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000253.,10.1097/MOH.0000000000000253 [doi],,['0 (Cytokines)'],,,,,['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000253 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Liver cancer occurrence in infancy, 1.5 for million children per year, falls far below the threshold of interest for dedicated drug development programs, and this disease is so rare that it is very difficult to gather enough children into a phase II clinical trial. Here, we present the establishment of an unprecedented preclinical platform of 24 pediatric liver cancer patient-derived xenografts (PLC-PDXs) from 20 hepatoblastomas (HBs), 1 transitional liver cell tumor (TCLT), 1 hepatocellular carcinoma, and 2 malignant rhabdoid tumors. Cytogenetic array and mutational analysis of the parental tumors and the corresponding PLC-PDXs show high conservation of the molecular features of the parental tumors. The histology of PLC-PDXs is strikingly similar to that observed in primary tumors and recapitulates the heterogeneity of recurrent disease observed in the clinic. Tumor growth in the mouse is strongly associated with elevated circulating alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), low rate of necrosis/fibrosis after treatment, and gain of chromosome 20, all indicators of resistance to chemotherapy and poor outcome. Accordingly, the ability of a tumor to generate PLC-PDX is predictive of poor prognosis. Exposure of PLC-PDXs to standards of care or therapeutic options already in use for other pediatric malignancies revealed unique response profiles in these models. Among these, the irinotecan/temozolomide combination induced strong tumor regression in the TCLT and in a model derived from an AFP-negative relapsing HB. CONCLUSION: These results provide evidence that PLC-PDX preclinical platform can strongly contribute to accelerate the identification and diversification of anticancer treatment for aggressive subtypes of pediatric liver cancer.

The purpose of this study is to find out the relation between VDR polymorphism and the response to vitamin D intake in pediatric ALL cases who receive corticosteroid therapy which predispose to osteoporosis. This study might shed the light on some genetic variants that are effect the response of individuals to vitamin D therapy. METHODS: Forty newly diagnosed pediatrics ALL cases were studied. Three SNPs at the 3'-end of the VDR gene (BsmI rs1544410, ApaI rs739837and TaqI rs731236) and two SNPs at the 5'-end (Cdx-2 rs11568820 and GATA rs4516035) were analyzed by Allelic discrimination assay. Of those twenty-six cases with initial BMD data available were further analyzed with regards to the effect of various VDR genotypes/haplotypes on BMD. RESULTS: The genotype frequencies at 3'-end of VDR gene were, TaqI TT 23%, Tt 54% and tt 23%, BsmI bb 19.2%, Bb 65.4% and BB 15.4% and ApaI AA 12%, Aa 27% and aa 61%. The frequencies at the 5'-end were Cdx-2 GG 34.5%, GA 54% and AA 11.5% and GATA AA 8%, AG 50% and GG 42%. Eight and four possible haplotypes were observed at the 3' and 5'-ends of the VDR gene respectively. The Tt genotype was significantly correlated with high BMD as compared to other TaqI genotypes (P = 0.0420). There was a trend towards higher BMD with the genotype Bb as compared to other BsmI genotypes. No statistical significance was found between the other VDR genotypes or haplotypes studied and BMD. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on VDR gene polymorphisms in Egyptian pediatric ALL patients. The Tt genotype was associated with increased BMD. Our study showed marked genetic heterogeneity in VDR gene in Egyptian pediatric ALL patients.","['Tantawy, Maha', 'Amer, Mahmoud', 'Raafat, Tarek', 'Hamdy, Nayera']","['Tantawy M', 'Amer M', 'Raafat T', 'Hamdy N']","['Children Cancer Hospital Egypt, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Faculty of Science, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Meta Gene,Meta gene,101627670,,,2016/04/27 06:00,2016/04/27 06:01,['2016/04/27 06:00'],"['2015/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/27 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,Meta Gene. 2016 Mar 30;9:42-6. doi: 10.1016/j.mgene.2016.03.008. eCollection 2016 Sep.,10.1016/j.mgene.2016.03.008 [doi],20160330,,PMC4833050,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Bone mineral density', 'Osteoporosis', 'Polymorphism', 'Vitamin D receptor']",,"['10.1016/j.mgene.2016.03.008 [doi]', 'S2214-5400(16)30008-1 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Andrographolide (Andro), the major active component from Andrographis paniculata, has been shown to possess antitumor activities in several types of cancer cells. However, whether Andro would inhibit T-ALL cell growth remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic effect of Andro on human T-ALL Jurkat cells and explored the mechanisms of cell death. Cell apoptosis was assayed by flow cytometry, and the signaling transduction for Andro was analyzed by Western blotting. The results indicated 10 mug/mL Andro could significantly induce Jurkat cells' apoptosis, depending on the inhibition of PI3K/AKT pathway. Moreover, Andro-induced apoptosis is enhanced by AKT-selective inhibitor LY294002. ERK- or JNK-selective inhibitors PD98059 and SP600125 had no effect on Andro-induced apoptosis. In addition, p38 inhibitor SB203580 could reverse Andro-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. We also found that the protein expression of p-p53 and p-p38 were increased after Andro treatments. The result of an in vivo study also demonstrated Andro's dose-dependent inhibition in subcutaneous Jurkat xenografts. In conclusion, our findings explained a novel mechanism of drug action by Andro in Jurkat cells and suggested that Andro might be developed into a new candidate therapy for T-ALL patients in the coming days.","['Yang, Tingfang', 'Yao, Shuluan', 'Zhang, Xianfeng', 'Guo, Yan']","['Yang T', 'Yao S', 'Zhang X', 'Guo Y']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Jining No 1 People's Hospital, Shandong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Respiratory Medicine, Jining Medical University Affiliated Hospital, Shandong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Psychiatry, Jining Psychiatric Hospital, Shandong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Respiratory Medicine, Jining Medical University Affiliated Hospital, Shandong Province, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Diterpenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2016/04/27 06:00,2016/12/31 06:00,['2016/04/27 06:00'],"['2016/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2016 Apr 11;10:1389-97. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S94983. eCollection 2016.,10.2147/DDDT.S94983 [doi],20160411,"['0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '410105JHGR (andrographolide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",PMC4833376,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT', 'Burkitt lymphoma', 'Jurkat cell', 'PI3K', 'andrographolide']",,"['10.2147/DDDT.S94983 [doi]', 'dddt-10-1389 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism is unknown, and genetic predisposition to asparaginase-induced pancreatitis has not been previously identified. METHODS: To determine clinical risk factors for asparaginase-induced pancreatitis, we studied a cohort of 5,185 children and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, including 117 (2.3%) who were diagnosed with at least one episode of acute pancreatitis during therapy. A genome-wide association study was performed in the cohort and in an independent case-control group of 213 patients to identify genetic risk factors. RESULTS: Risk factors associated with pancreatitis included genetically defined Native American ancestry (P < .001), older age (P < .001), and higher cumulative dose of asparaginase (P < .001). No common variants reached genome-wide significance in the genome-wide association study, but a rare nonsense variant rs199695765 in CPA2, encoding carboxypeptidase A2, was highly associated with pancreatitis (hazard ratio, 587; 95% CI, 66.8 to 5166; P = 9.0 x 10(-9)). A gene-level analysis showed an excess of additional CPA2 variants in patients who did versus those who did not develop pancreatitis (P = .001). Sixteen CPA2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were associated (P < .05) with pancreatitis, and 13 of 24 patients who carried at least one of these variants developed pancreatitis. Biologic functions that were overrepresented by common variants modestly associated with pancreatitis included purine metabolism and cytoskeleton regulation. CONCLUSION: Older age, higher exposure to asparaginase, and higher Native American ancestry were independent risk factors for pancreatitis in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Those who inherit a nonsense rare variant in the CPA2 gene had a markedly increased risk of asparaginase-induced pancreatitis.","['Liu, Chengcheng', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Pei, Deqing', 'Smith, Colton', 'Carroll, William L', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Bowman, W Paul', 'Larsen, Eric C', 'Maloney, Kelly W', 'Martin, Paul L', 'Mattano, Leonard A Jr', 'Winick, Naomi J', 'Mardis, Elaine R', 'Fulton, Robert S', 'Bhojwani, Deepa', 'Howard, Scott C', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Evans, William E', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Relling, Mary V']","['Liu C', 'Yang W', 'Devidas M', 'Cheng C', 'Pei D', 'Smith C', 'Carroll WL', 'Raetz EA', 'Bowman WP', 'Larsen EC', 'Maloney KW', 'Martin PL', 'Mattano LA Jr', 'Winick NJ', 'Mardis ER', 'Fulton RS', 'Bhojwani D', 'Howard SC', 'Jeha S', 'Pui CH', 'Hunger SP', 'Evans WE', 'Loh ML', 'Relling MV']","[""Chengcheng Liu, Wenjian Yang, Cheng Cheng, Deqing Pei, Colton Smith, Sima Jeha, Ching-Hon Pui, William E.

With conventional chemotherapy, patients typically die within 1 year. In all but one of the retrospective studies reported to date, bortezomib and lenalidomide seem to improve survival. We conducted a prospective phase II trial in patients with pPCL to assess the efficacy of an alternate regimen that combines standard chemotherapy, a proteasome inhibitor, and high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDM/ASCT) followed by either allogeneic transplantation or bortezomib/lenalidomide maintenance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients 70 years old and younger with newly diagnosed pPCL received four alternating cycles of bortezomib, dexamethasone plus doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide. Peripheral blood stem cells were collected from responding patients with < 1% of circulating plasma cells before HDM/ASCT. As consolidation, young patients received a reduced-intensity conditioning allograft, whereas the remaining patients underwent a second HDM/ASCT followed by 1 year of bortezomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Forty patients (median age, 57 years; range, 27 to 71 years) were enrolled. The median follow-up was 28.7 months. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the median PFS and overall survival were 15.1 (95% CI, 8.4; -) and 36.3 (95% CI, 25.6; -) months, respectively. The overall response rate to induction was 69%. One patient underwent a syngeneic allograft and 25 HDM/ASCT (16 of whom subsequently received a reduced-intensity conditioning allograft and seven a second ASCT followed by maintenance). CONCLUSION: In this prospective trial in patients with pPCL, we show that bortezomib, dexamethasone plus doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide induction followed by transplantation induces high response rates and appears to significantly improve PFS.","['Royer, Bruno', 'Minvielle, Stephane', 'Diouf, Momar', 'Roussel, Murielle', 'Karlin, Lionel', 'Hulin, Cyrille', 'Arnulf, Bertrand', 'Macro, Margaret', 'Cailleres, Sylvie', 'Brion, Annie', 'Brechignac, Sabine', 'Belhadj, Karim', 'Chretien, Marie Lorraine', 'Wetterwald, Marc', 'Chaleteix, Carine', 'Tiab, Mourad', 'Leleu, Xavier', 'Frenzel, Laurent', 'Garderet, Laurent', 'Choquet, Sylvain', 'Fuzibet, Jean Gabriel', 'Dauriac, Charles', 'Forneker, Luc-Matthieu', 'Benboubker, Lotfi', 'Facon, Thierry', 'Moreau, Philippe', 'Avet-Loiseau, Herve', 'Marolleau, Jean Pierre']","['Royer B', 'Minvielle S', 'Diouf M', 'Roussel M', 'Karlin L', 'Hulin C', 'Arnulf B', 'Macro M', 'Cailleres S', 'Brion A', 'Brechignac S', 'Belhadj K', 'Chretien ML', 'Wetterwald M', 'Chaleteix C', 'Tiab M', 'Leleu X', 'Frenzel L', 'Garderet L', 'Choquet S', 'Fuzibet JG', 'Dauriac C', 'Forneker LM', 'Benboubker L', 'Facon T', 'Moreau P', 'Avet-Loiseau H', 'Marolleau JP']","['Bruno Royer, Momar Diouf, and Jean Pierre Marolleau, University Hospital, Amiens;

Children's Oncology Group study AALL0232 tested two interventions to improve survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2004 and January 2011, AALL0232 enrolled 3,154 participants 1 to 30 years old with newly diagnosed high-risk B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia. By using a 2 x 2 factorial design, 2,914 participants were randomly assigned to receive dexamethasone (14 days) versus prednisone (28 days) during induction and high-dose methotrexate versus Capizzi escalating-dose methotrexate plus pegaspargase during interim maintenance 1. RESULTS: Planned interim monitoring showed the superiority of the high-dose methotrexate regimens, which exceeded the predefined boundary and led to cessation of enrollment in January 2011. At that time, participants randomly assigned to high-dose methotrexate during interim maintenance 1 versus those randomly assigned to Capizzi methotrexate had a 5-year event-free survival (EFS) of 82% versus 75.4% (P = .006). Mature final data showed 5-year EFS rates of 79.6% for high-dose methotrexate and 75.2% for Capizzi methotrexate (P = .008). High-dose methotrexate decreased both marrow and CNS recurrences. Patients 1 to 9 years old who received dexamethasone and high-dose methotrexate had a superior outcome compared with those who received the other three regimens (5-year EFS, 91.2% v 83.2%, 80.8%, and 82.1%; P = .015). Older participants derived no benefit from dexamethasone during induction and experienced excess rates of osteonecrosis. CONCLUSION: High-dose methotrexate is superior to Capizzi methotrexate for the treatment of high-risk B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with no increase in acute toxicity. Dexamethasone given during induction benefited younger children but provided no benefit and was associated with a higher risk of osteonecrosis among participants 10 years and older.","['Larsen, Eric C', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Chen, Si', 'Salzer, Wanda L', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Mattano, Leonard A Jr', 'Cole, Catherine', 'Eicher, Alisa', 'Haugan, Maureen', 'Sorenson, Mark', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Carroll, Andrew A', 'Gastier-Foster, Julie M', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Winick, Naomi J', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Carroll, William L']","['Larsen EC', 'Devidas M', 'Chen S', 'Salzer WL', 'Raetz EA', 'Loh ML', 'Mattano LA Jr', 'Cole C', 'Eicher A', 'Haugan M', 'Sorenson M', 'Heerema NA', 'Carroll AA', 'Gastier-Foster JM', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Wood BL', 'Willman CL', 'Winick NJ', 'Hunger SP', 'Carroll WL']","[""Eric C.

Dysregulated trafficking contributes to malignancy, whereas understanding the process can reveal unique therapeutic opportunities. Here, we focus on eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), a prooncogenic protein highly elevated in many cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Typically, eIF4E is localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it acts in export and translation of specific methyl 7-guanosine (m(7)G)-capped mRNAs, respectively. Nuclear accumulation of eIF4E in patients who have AML is correlated with increased eIF4E-dependent export of transcripts encoding oncoproteins. The subcellular localization of eIF4E closely correlates with patients' responses. During clinical responses to the m(7)G-cap competitor ribavirin, eIF4E is mainly cytoplasmic. At relapse, eIF4E reaccumulates in the nucleus, leading to elevated eIF4E-dependent mRNA export. We have identified importin 8 as a factor that directly imports eIF4E into the nucleus. We found that importin 8 is highly elevated in untreated patients with AML, leading to eIF4E nuclear accumulation. Importin 8 only imports cap-free eIF4E. Cap-dependent changes to the structure of eIF4E underpin this selectivity. Indeed, m(7)G cap analogs or ribavirin prevents nuclear entry of eIF4E, which mirrors the trafficking phenotypes observed in patients with AML. Our studies also suggest that nuclear entry is important for the prooncogenic activity of eIF4E, at least in this context. These findings position nuclear trafficking of eIF4E as a critical step in its regulation and position the importin 8-eIF4E complex as a novel therapeutic target.","['Volpon, Laurent', 'Culjkovic-Kraljacic, Biljana', 'Osborne, Michael J', 'Ramteke, Anup', 'Sun, Qingxiang', 'Niesman, Ashley', 'Chook, Yuh Min', 'Borden, Katherine L B']","['Volpon L', 'Culjkovic-Kraljacic B', 'Osborne MJ', 'Ramteke A', 'Sun Q', 'Niesman A', 'Chook YM', 'Borden KL']","['Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, H3T 1J4, Canada;', 'Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, H3T 1J4, Canada;', 'Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, H3T 1J4, Canada;', 'Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, H3T 1J4, Canada;', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, TX 75390-9041.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, TX 75390-9041.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, TX 75390-9041.', 'Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, H3T 1J4, Canada; katherine.borden@umontreal.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Guanosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Nucleocytoplasmic Transport Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta Karyopherins/*metabolism']",2016/04/27 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/04/27 06:00'],"['2016/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 May 10;113(19):5263-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1524291113.

This latter property is being pursued in clinics to treat leukemia with the hope that further breakthroughs in NK cell biology can extend treatments to other cancers. At issue is the ability to expand transferred NK cells and prolong their functionality within the context of a tumor. In terms of NK cell expansion and survival, we now report that Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) is a key transcription factor that underpins both of these events. Excision of Klf2 using gene-targeted mouse models promotes spontaneous proliferation of immature NK cells in peripheral tissues, a phenotype that is replicated under ex vivo conditions. Moreover, KLF2 imprints a homeostatic migration pattern on mature NK cells that allows these cells to access IL-15-rich microenvironments. KLF2 accomplishes this feat within the mature NK cell lineage via regulation of a subset of homing receptors that respond to homeostatic ligands while leaving constitutively expressed receptors that recognize inflammatory cytokines unperturbed. Under steady-state conditions, KLF2-deficient NK cells alter their expression of homeostatic homing receptors and subsequently undergo apoptosis due to IL-15 starvation. This novel mechanism has implications regarding NK cell contraction following the termination of immune responses including the possibility that retention of an IL-15 transpresenting support system is key to extending NK cell activity in a tumor environment.","['Rabacal, Whitney', 'Pabbisetty, Sudheer K', 'Hoek, Kristen L', 'Cendron, Delphine', 'Guo, Yin', 'Maseda, Damian', 'Sebzda, Eric']","['Rabacal W', 'Pabbisetty SK', 'Hoek KL', 'Cendron D', 'Guo Y', 'Maseda D', 'Sebzda E']","['Department of Pathology, Microbiology & Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232;', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology & Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232;', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology & Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232;', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology & Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232;', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology & Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232; Department of Anesthesiology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232.', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology & Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232;', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology & Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232; eric.sebzda@vanderbilt.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/*physiology', 'Cell Survival/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Homeostasis/physiology', 'Interleukin-15/*metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology/*physiology', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",2016/04/27 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/04/27 06:00'],"['2016/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 May 10;113(19):5370-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1521491113.

Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) is a rare subtype of AML. Deep sequencing has identified CBFA2T3/GLIS2 and NUP98/KDM5A as recurrent aberrations, occurring in similar frequencies as RBM15/MKL1 and KMT2A-rearrangements. We studied whether these cytogenetic aberrations can be used for risk group stratification. To assess frequencies and outcome parameters of recurrent cytogenetic aberrations in AMKL, samples and clinical data of patients treated by the Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica, Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Study Group, Children's Oncology Group, Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, and the Saint Louis Hopital were collected, enabling us to screen 153 newly diagnosed pediatric AMKL cases for the aforementioned aberrations and to study their clinical characteristics and outcome. CBFA2T3/GLIS2 was identified in 16% of the cases; RBM15/MKL1, in 12%; NUP98/KDM5A and KMT2A rearrangements, in 9% each; and monosomy 7, in 6%. These aberrations were mutually exclusive. RBM15/MKL1-rearranged patients were significantly younger. No significant differences in sex and white blood cell count were found. NUP98/KDM5A, CBFA2T3/GLIS2, KMT2A-rearranged lesions and monosomy 7 (NCK-7) independently predicted a poor outcome, compared with RBM15/MKL1-rearranged patients and those with AMKL not carrying these molecular lesions. NCK-7-patients (n = 61) showed a 4-year probability of overall survival of 35 +/- 6% vs 70 +/- 5% in the RBM15/MKL1-other groups (n = 92, P < .0001) and 4-year probability of event-free survival of 33 +/- 6% vs 62 +/- 5% (P = .0013), the 4-year cumulative incidence of relapse being 42 +/- 7% and 19 +/- 4% (P = .003), respectively.

These observations have led to the development of strategies to disrupt the association of TPO with its receptor as a means of targeting MF hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). In this report, we show that although both splenic and peripheral blood MF CD34(+) cells expressed lower levels of MPL than normal CD34(+) cells, TPO promoted the proliferation of MF CD34(+) cells and HPCs in a dose-dependent fashion. Furthermore, the treatment of MF but not normal CD34(+) cells with a synthesized MPL antagonist, LCP4, decreased the number of CD34(+)Lin(-) cells and all classes of assayable HPCs (colony-forming unit-megakaryocyte [CFU-MK], CFU-granulocyte/macrophage, burst-forming unit-erythroid/CFU-erythroid, and CFU-granulocyte/erythroid/macrophage/MK) irrespective of their mutational status. In addition, LCP4 treatment resulted in the depletion of the number of MF HPCs that were JAK2V617F(+) Moreover, the degree of human cell chimerism and the proportion of malignant donor cells were significantly reduced in immunodeficient mice transplanted with MF CD34(+) cell grafts treated with LCP4. These effects of LCP4 on MF HSCs/HPCs were associated with inhibition of JAK-STAT activity, leading to the induction of apoptosis.

This study aims to understand the variable activity of an rIT against ALL toward improving responses in clinical application. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We determined in vitro activity of rITs by WST-8 assays and the time needed to kill ALL cell lines and patient-derived ALL blasts by flow cytometry. The findings were translated into two systemic ALL xenograft models. Differences in time needed to kill KOPN-8 cells for distinct rITs were addressed biochemically. RESULTS: In vitro activity (IC50) of anti-CD22 rIT varied 210-fold from 0.02 to 4.6 ng/mL. Activity also varied greatly depending on the time ALL cells were exposed to immunotoxin from < 30 minutes to > 4 days. For KOPN-8, the difference in exposure time was related to intracellular rIT processing. We showed in newly developed ALL xenograft models, where immunotoxins have a short half-life, that the needed exposure time in vitro predicted the responses in vivo By replacing bolus dose with small doses at frequent intervals or with continuous infusion, responses were substantially improved. We confirmed exposure time variability on patient-derived ALL samples and showed a correlation between exposure time needed to reach maximal cytotoxicity in vitro and their clinical response. CONCLUSIONS: The exposure time needed for rITs targeting CD22 to kill ALL cells varies widely. Our results suggest that ALL patients would have a better response rate to anti-CD22 immunotoxins if treated by continuous infusion rather than by bolus injections. Clin Cancer Res; 22(19); 4913-22.

Previous reports have suggested that aberrant nuclear-cytoplasmic transport due to mutations or overexpression of nuclear pore complexes and nuclear transport receptors is closely linked to diseases. Nup214, a component of nuclear pore complexes, has been found as chimeric fusion proteins in leukemia. Among various Nup214 fusion proteins, SET-Nup214 and DEK-Nup214 have been shown to be engaged in tumorigenesis, but their oncogenic mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we examined the functions of the Nup214 fusion proteins by focusing on their effects on nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. We found that SET-Nup214 and DEK-Nup214 interact with exportin-1 (XPO1)/CRM1 and nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1)/TAP, which mediate leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES)-dependent protein export and mRNA export, respectively. SET-Nup214 and DEK-Nup214 decreased the XPO1-mediated nuclear export of NES proteins such as cyclin B and proteins involved in the NF-kappaB signaling pathway by tethering XPO1 onto nuclear dots where Nup214 fusion proteins are localized. We also demonstrated that SET-Nup214 and DEK-Nup214 expression inhibited NF-kappaB-mediated transcription by abnormal tethering of the complex containing p65 and its inhibitor, IkappaB, in the nucleus. These results suggest that SET-Nup214 and DEK-Nup214 perturb the regulation of gene expression through alteration of the nuclear-cytoplasmic transport system.","['Saito, Shoko', 'Cigdem, Sadik', 'Okuwaki, Mitsuru', 'Nagata, Kyosuke']","['Saito S', 'Cigdem S', 'Okuwaki M', 'Nagata K']","['Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan Department of Infection Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan ssaito@md.tsukuba.ac.jp.', 'Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan Department of Infection Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Nucleocytoplasmic Transport Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', '*Protein Transport', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2016/04/27 06:00,2017/05/17 06:00,['2016/04/27 06:00'],"['2016/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/17 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2016 Jun 15;36(13):1820-35. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00158-16.

To tackle this issue, we retrospectively studied 206 patients with MPN-related VTE (deep venous thrombosis of the legs and/or pulmonary embolism). After this index event, we recorded over 695 pt-years 45 recurrences, venous in 36 cases, with an incidence rate (IR) of 6.5 per 100 pt-years (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.9-8.6). One hundred fifty-five patients received VKA; the IR of recurrent thrombosis per 100 pt-years was 4.7 (95% CI: 2.8-7.3) on VKA and 8.9 (95% CI: 5.7-13.2) off VKA (P=0.03). In patients receiving VKA, the IR of recurrent thrombosis per 100 pt-years was 5.3 (95% CI: 3.2-8.4) among 108 patients on long-term VKA and 12.8 (95% CI: 7.3-20.7) after discontinuation among the 47 who ceased treatment (P=0.008), with a doubled risk of recurrence after stopping VKA (hazard ratio: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.19-5.30). The IR of major bleeding per 100 pt-years was 2.4 (95%: CI: 1.1-4.5) on VKA and 0.7 (95% CI: 0.08-2.5) off VKA (P=0.08). In conclusion, in MPN patients with VTE recurrent thrombosis is significantly reduced by VKA and caution should be adopted in discontinuation; however, the incidence of recurrence on treatment remains high, calling for clinical trials aimed to improve prophylaxis in this setting.","['De Stefano, V', 'Ruggeri, M', 'Cervantes, F', 'Alvarez-Larran, A', 'Iurlo, A', 'Randi, M L', 'Elli, E', 'Finazzi, M C', 'Finazzi, G', 'Zetterberg, E', 'Vianelli, N', 'Gaidano, G', 'Rossi, E', 'Betti, S', 'Nichele, I', 'Cattaneo, D', 'Palova, M', 'Ellis, M H', 'Cacciola, R', 'Tieghi, A', 'Hernandez-Boluda, J C', 'Pungolino, E', 'Specchia, G', 'Rapezzi, D', 'Forcina, A', 'Musolino, C', 'Carobbio, A', 'Griesshammer, M', ""Sant'Antonio, E"", 'Vannucchi, A M', 'Barbui, T']","['De Stefano V', 'Ruggeri M', 'Cervantes F', 'Alvarez-Larran A', 'Iurlo A', 'Randi ML', 'Elli E', 'Finazzi MC', 'Finazzi G', 'Zetterberg E', 'Vianelli N', 'Gaidano G', 'Rossi E', 'Betti S', 'Nichele I', 'Cattaneo D', 'Palova M', 'Ellis MH', 'Cacciola R', 'Tieghi A', 'Hernandez-Boluda JC', 'Pungolino E', 'Specchia G', 'Rapezzi D', 'Forcina A', 'Musolino C', 'Carobbio A', 'Griesshammer M', ""Sant'Antonio E"", 'Vannucchi AM', 'Barbui T']","['Institute of Hematology, Catholic University, Roma, Italy.', 'Ospedale San Bortolo, Vicenza, Italy.', 'Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Oncohematology Division, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milano, Italy."", 'A.O.

During nucleocytoplasmic transport of tumor suppressor proteins and cell cycle regulators during the processing of these proteins, aberrant cellular growth signaling and inactivation of apoptosis can occur, both critical to growth and development of tumors. Karyopherin-beta proteins bind to these cargo proteins and RanGTP for active transport across the nuclear membrane through the nuclear pore complex. Importins and exportins are overexpressed in multiple tumors including melanoma, pancreatic, breast, colon, gastric, prostate, esophageal, lung cancer, and lymphomas. Furthermore, some of the karyopherin-beta proteins such as exportin-1 have been implicated in drug resistance in cancer. Importin and exportin inhibitors are being considered as therapeutic targets against cancer and have shown preclinical anticancer activity. Moreover, synergistic activity has been observed with various chemotherapeutic and targeted agents. However, clinical development of the exportin-1 inhibitor leptomycin B was stopped due to adverse events, including vomiting, anorexia, and dehydration. Selinexor, a selective nuclear export inhibitor, is being tested in multiple clinical trials both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy. Selinexor has demonstrated clinical activity in multiple cancers, especially acute myelogenous leukemia and multiple myeloma. The roles of other importin and exportin inhibitors still need to be investigated clinically.

BACKGROUND: Management of chronic myeloid leukaemia has changed dramatically during the last decade. While medication adherence is crucial to clinical response, little is known about how to improve patients' adherence. DESIGN: Randomized multicentre intervention study. METHODS: The study was conducted between June 2012-August 2014. Eighty-six patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia who had been on tyrosine kinase inhibitor medication for at least six months from eight hospitals were randomized into intervention and control groups. Intervention combined nurse-conducted medication counselling, an information booklet, video and website and text message reminders. Patients were interviewed to assess medication adherence using Morisky's 8-Item Medication Adherence Scale at baseline and nine months. RESULTS: Medication adherence improved with the adherence aids used. At nine months, 51% of patients were highly adherent in the intervention group, compared with 21% in the control group. Adherence improved for a higher proportion of patients in the intervention group than the control group (49% vs. 18%). Morisky's score decreased in almost half of control group cases. Patients were most satisfied with face-to-face counselling (86%) and the information booklet (83%) and least satisfied with text messages (9%). CONCLUSION: Tailored patient education improved the medication adherence of patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia. Without this, adherence behaviour tended to decline. Personal communication with a nurse proved to be an essential part of adherence support and should not be ignored.","['Kekale, Meri', 'Soderlund, Tim', 'Koskenvesa, Perttu', 'Talvensaari, Kimmo', 'Airaksinen, Marja']","['Kekale M', 'Soderlund T', 'Koskenvesa P', 'Talvensaari K', 'Airaksinen M']","['Division of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapy, University of Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Helsinki University Central Hospital and University of Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Medicine, Helsinki University Central Hospital and University of Helsinki, Finland.', 'Medical Center Mehilainen, Nummela, Finland.', 'Division of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapy, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,J Adv Nurs,Journal of advanced nursing,7609811,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/therapeutic use', 'Internet', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Medication Adherence', 'Melphalan/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Education as Topic', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Reminder Systems', 'Text Messaging']",2016/04/27 06:00,2018/04/07 06:00,['2016/04/27 06:00'],"['2016/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,J Adv Nurs. 2016 Sep;72(9):2196-206. doi: 10.1111/jan.12978.

Bosutinib is an oral, once-daily SRC/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor with very potent inhibitory activity. Bosutinib is effective against all phases of intolerant or resistant Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML that do not harbor the T315I or V299LABL kinase domain mutations. Peak plasma concentrations of bosutinib occur at 4-6 h following oral administration, and dose-proportional increases in exposure are observed at doses ranging from 200 to 800 mg. Absorption of bosutinib increases with food. Bosutinib is distributed extensively into the tissues. It is highly plasma protein bound (94 %) and is primarily metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 3A4. Bosutinib is well tolerated overall and has a unique but manageable toxicity profile. This article provides a review of the available clinical pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and drug-drug interaction data on bosutinib in healthy subjects, patients with CML, and special populations.","['Abbas, Richat', 'Hsyu, Poe-Hirr']","['Abbas R', 'Hsyu PH']","['Pfizer Inc, 500 Arcola Road, Collegeville, PA, 19426, USA. richat.abbas-borhan@pfizer.com.', 'Pfizer Inc, San Diego, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Area Under Curve', 'Asians', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electrocardiography', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Liver Failure/metabolism', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Nitriles/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Renal Insufficiency/metabolism']",2016/04/27 06:00,2017/09/12 06:00,['2016/04/27 06:00'],"['2016/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 2016 Oct;55(10):1191-1204. doi: 10.1007/s40262-016-0391-6.,10.1007/s40262-016-0391-6 [doi],,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinolines)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 1.14.14.55 (CYP3A4 protein, human)']",,,,,"['10.1007/s40262-016-0391-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s40262-016-0391-6 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, targeting the CXCR4 receptor with small cyclic pentapeptide-based radiopharmaceuticals remains challenging because minor structural modifications within the ligand-linker-chelate structure often significantly affect the receptor affinity. Based on the excellent in vivo properties of CXCR4-directed pentapeptide [(68)Ga]pentixafor (cyclo(-D-Tyr-N-Me-D-Orn(AMB-DOTA)-L-Arg-L-2-Nal-Gly-)), this study aims to broaden the spectrum of applicable (radio)metal-labeled pentixafor analogs. METHODS: Cyclic pentapeptides, based on the pentixafor scaffold, were synthesized by a combined solid- and solution-phase peptide synthesis. The CXCR4 receptor affinities of the cold reference compounds were determined in competitive binding assays using CXCR4-expressing Jurkat T - cell leukemia cells and [(125)I]FC131 as the radioligand. RESULTS: Metalated pentixafor derivatives with cyclic and acyclic chelators were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis and evaluated in vitro. The resulting CXCR4 affinities (IC50) were highly dependent on the chelator and metal used. Two pentapeptides, Ga-NOTA and Bi-DOTA conjugates, offer an improved affinity compared to [(68)Ga]pentixafor. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the pentapeptide [(68)Ga]pentixafor, a broad range of metal-labeled analogs were investigated. The affinities of the new compounds were found to be strongly dependent on both the chelator and the metal used. Bi-labeled pentixafor showed high receptor affinity and seems to be a promising ligand for further preclinical evaluation and future alpha-emitter-based endoradiotherapy.","['Poschenrieder, Andreas', 'Schottelius, Margret', 'Schwaiger, Markus', 'Kessler, Horst', 'Wester, Hans-Jurgen']","['Poschenrieder A', 'Schottelius M', 'Schwaiger M', 'Kessler H', 'Wester HJ']","['Pharmaceutical Radiochemistry, Technical University Munich, Walther-Meissner-Str.3, 85748, Garching, Germany. a.poschenrieder@tum.de.', 'Pharmaceutical Radiochemistry, Technical University Munich, Walther-Meissner-Str.3, 85748, Garching, Germany.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Technical University Munich, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Ismaninger Strasse 22, 81675, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute for Advanced Study at the Department Chemie, Technical University Munich, Lichtenbergstr. 2a, 85748, Garching, Germany.', 'Pharmaceutical Radiochemistry, Technical University Munich, Walther-Meissner-Str.3, 85748, Garching, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,EJNMMI Res,EJNMMI research,101560946,,,2016/04/27 06:00,2016/04/27 06:01,['2016/04/27 06:00'],"['2016/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/27 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,EJNMMI Res. 2016 Dec;6(1):36. doi: 10.1186/s13550-016-0193-8.

The use of DAUN and DOX is hampered by the development of cardiotoxicity. Clinical evidence suggests that patients with leukemia and Down syndrome are at increased risk for anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity. Carbonyl reductases and aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) catalyze the reduction of DAUN and DOX into cardiotoxic C-13 alcohol metabolites. Anthracyclines also exert cardiotoxicity by triggering mitochondrial dysfunction. In recent studies, a collection of heart samples from donors with and without Down syndrome was used to investigate determinants for anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity including cardiac daunorubicin reductase activity (DA), carbonyl reductase/AKRs protein expression, mitochondrial DNA content (mtDNA), and AKR7A2 DNA methylation status. In this study, the available demographic, biochemical, genetic, and epigenetic data were integrated through classification and regression trees analysis with the aim of pinpointing the most relevant variables for the synthesis of cardiotoxic daunorubicinol (i.e., DA). Seventeen variables were considered as potential predictors. Leave-one-out-cross-validation was performed for model selection and to estimate the generalization error. The classification and regression trees analysis model and variable importance measures suggest that cardiac mtDNA content, mtDNA(4977) deletion frequency, and AKR7A2 protein content are the most important variables in determining DA.","['Hoefer, Carrie C', 'Blair, Rachael Hageman', 'Blanco, Javier G']","['Hoefer CC', 'Blair RH', 'Blanco JG']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, The State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York 14260.', 'Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health and Health Professions, The State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York 14260.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, The State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York 14260.

The purpose of this study was to describe the natural history, the haematological features and the genotype-phenotype correlations of this entity in order to, first, screen it better and earlier, before leukaemia occurrence and secondly to optimize appropriate monitoring and treatment, in particular when familial stem cell transplantation is considered. METHODS: We have investigated 41 carriers of RUNX1 alteration belonging to nine unrelated French families with FPD/AML and two syndromic patients, registered in the French network on rare platelet disorders from 2005 to 2015. RESULTS: Five missense, one non-sense, three frameshift mutations and two large deletions involving several genes including RUNX1 were evidenced. The history of familial leukaemia was suggestive of FPD/AML in seven pedigrees, whereas an autosomal dominant pattern of lifelong thrombocytopenia was the clinical presentation of two. Additional syndromic features characterized two large sporadic deletions. Bleeding tendency was mild and thrombocytopenia moderate (>50 x10(9)/L), with normal platelet volume. A functional platelet defect consistent with a delta-granule release defect was found in ten patients regardless of the type of RUNX1 alteration. The incidence of haematological malignancies was higher when the mutated RUNX1 allele was likely to cause a dominant negative effect (19/34) in comparison with loss of function alleles (3/9). A normal platelet count does not rule out the diagnosis of FPD/AML, since the platelet count was found normal for three mutated subjects, a feature that has a direct impact in the search for a related donor in case of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Platelet dysfunction suggestive of defective delta-granule release could be of values for the diagnosis of FPD/AML particularly when the clinical presentation is an autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia with normal platelet size in the absence of familial malignancies. The genotype-phenotype correlations might be helpful in genetic counselling and appropriate optimal therapeutic management.","['Latger-Cannard, Veronique', 'Philippe, Christophe', 'Bouquet,

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a rapidly evolving technique that offers potential cure for hematologic cancers, such as leukemia or lymphoma. HSCT may be autologous or allogenic. Successful HSCT depends critically on the abundance of engraftment-competent HSPCs, which are currently difficult to obtain in large numbers. Therefore, finding compounds that enhance either the number or the activity of HSPCs could improve prognosis for patients undergoing HSCT and is of great clinical interest. We developed a semiautomated screening method for whole zebrafish larvae using conventional liquid handling equipment and confocal microscopy. Applying this pipeline, we screened 550 compounds in triplicate for proliferation of HSPCs in vivo and identified several modulators of hematopoietic stem cell activity. One identified hit was valproic acid (VPA), which was further validated as a compound that expands and maintains the population of HSPCs isolated from human peripheral blood ex vivo. In summary, our in vivo zebrafish imaging screen identified several potential drug candidates with clinical relevance and could easily be further expanded to screen more compounds.","['Arulmozhivarman, Guruchandar', 'Stoter, Martin', 'Bickle, Marc', 'Krater, Martin', 'Wobus, Manja', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Stolzel, Friedrich', 'Brand, Michael', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Shayegi, Nona']","['Arulmozhivarman G', 'Stoter M', 'Bickle M', 'Krater M', 'Wobus M', 'Ehninger G', 'Stolzel F', 'Brand M', 'Bornhauser M', 'Shayegi N']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'HT-Technology Development Studio, Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany.', 'HT-Technology Development Studio, Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Center for Regenerative Therapies, Cluster of Excellence, Bioinnovation Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany nshayegi@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biomol Screen,Journal of biomolecular screening,9612112,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Lineage/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology/*therapy', 'Microscopy, Confocal/methods', 'Molecular Imaging/*methods', 'Valproic Acid/pharmacology', 'Zebrafish/genetics/growth & development']",2016/04/27 06:00,2018/01/27 06:00,['2016/04/27 06:00'],"['2016/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,J Biomol Screen. 2016 Oct;21(9):956-64. doi: 10.1177/1087057116644163.

We here explored CD30 as an alternative target, which is validated in lymphoma therapy and expressed by a broad variety of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. As a safty concern, however, CD30 is also expressed by lymphocytes and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) during activation. We revealed that HRS3scFv-derived CAR T cells are superior since they were not blocked by soluble CD30 and did not attack CD30(+) HSPCs while eliminating CD30(+) lymphoma cells. Consequently, normal hemato- and lymphopoiesis was not affected in the long-term in the humanized mouse; the number of blood B and T cells remained unchanged. We provide evidence that the CD30(+) HSPCs are protected against a CAR T-cell attack by substantially lower CD30 levels than lymphoma cells and higher levels of the granzyme B inactivating SP6/PI9 serine protease, which furthermore increased upon activation. Taken together, adoptive cell therapy with anti-CD30 CAR T cells displays a superior therapeutic index in the treatment of CD30(+) malignancies leaving healthy activated lymphocytes and HSPCs unaffected.","['Hombach, Andreas A', 'Gorgens, Andre', 'Chmielewski, Markus', 'Murke, Florian', 'Kimpel, Janine', 'Giebel, Bernd', 'Abken, Hinrich']","['Hombach AA', 'Gorgens A', 'Chmielewski M', 'Murke F', 'Kimpel J', 'Giebel B', 'Abken H']","['Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne, University of Cologne, and Department I for Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne, University of Cologne, and Department I for Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Division of Virology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne, University of Cologne, and Department I for Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,,,2016/04/27 06:00,2016/04/27 06:01,['2016/04/27 06:00'],"['2015/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/27 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2016 Aug;24(8):1423-34. doi: 10.1038/mt.2016.82.

However, it is heterogeneous whereby CLL patients with higher percentages of 13q- cells (13q-H) have a more aggressive clinical course and a distinct gene expression profile. The microRNA (miRNA) expression profile of CLL gives additional biological and prognostic information, but its expression in 13q- CLL has not been examined in detail. The miRNA expression of clonal B cell lymphocytes (CD19+ cells) of 38 CLL patients and normal B cells of six healthy donors was analyzed. CLL patients with higher percentages of 13q- cells (>/=80%) showed a different level of miRNA expression from patients with lower percentages (<80%). Interestingly, miR-143 was downregulated and miR-155 was overexpressed in 13q-H. This deregulation affected important validated target genes involved in apoptosis (BCL2, MDM2, TP53INP1) and proliferation (KRAS, PI3K-AKT signaling), that could lead to decreased apoptosis and increased proliferation in 13q-H patients. This study provides new evidence about the heterogeneity of the 13q deletion in CLL patients, showing that miRNA regulation could be involved in several significant pathways deregulated in CLL patients with a high number of losses in 13q.","['Hernandez-Sanchez, Maria', 'Rodriguez-Vicente, Ana E', 'Hernandez, Jose-Angel', 'Lumbreras, Eva', 'Sarasquete, Maria-Eugenia', 'Martin, Ana-Africa', 'Benito, Rocio', 'Vicente-Gutierrez, Carlos', 'Robledo, Cristina', 'Heras, Natalia de Las', 'Rodriguez, Juan-Nicolas', 'Alcoceba, Miguel', 'Coca, Alfonso Garcia de', 'Aguilar, Carlos', 'Gonzalez, Marcos', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus-Maria']","['Hernandez-Sanchez M', 'Rodriguez-Vicente AE', 'Hernandez JA', 'Lumbreras E', 'Sarasquete ME', 'Martin AA', 'Benito R', 'Vicente-Gutierrez C', 'Robledo C', 'Heras Nde L', 'Rodriguez JN', 'Alcoceba M', 'Coca AG', 'Aguilar C', 'Gonzalez M', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM']","['Hematology Department, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, IBSAL, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, IBSAL, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, IBSAL, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, IBSAL, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, IBSAL, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, IBSAL, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, IBSAL, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, IBSAL, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Virgen Blanca, Leon, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Juan Ramon Jimenez, Huelva, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, IBSAL, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Valladolid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Santa Barbara, Soria, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, IBSAL, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, IBSAL, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.

The wider acceptability of these new technologies in clinical practice will depend on its impact on survival and costs. Due to the small patient groups who have received it, these aspects have remained understudied. This non-randomized single-center study evaluated medical costs and survival for acute myeloid leukemia between 2005 and 2010 in 50 patients: patients treated with induction and consolidation chemotherapy (ICT) alone; patients treated with ICT plus allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), which is the current preferred post-remission therapy in patients with intermediate- and poor-risk AML with few co-morbidities, and patients treated with ICT plus immunotherapy using autologous dendritic cells (DC) engineered to express the Wilms' tumor protein (WT1). Total costs including post- consolidation costs on medical care at the hematology ward and outpatient clinic, pharmaceutical prescriptions, intensive care ward, laboratory tests and medical imaging were analyzed. Survival was markedly better in HCT and DC. HCT and DC were more costly than ICT. The median total costs for HCT and DC were similar.

In this study, we observed the correlation between variation in LNK gene and the clinical type of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). METHODS: A total of 285 MPN cases were recruited, including essential thrombocythemia (ET) 154 cases, polycythemia vera (PV) 76 cases, primary myelofibrosis (PMF) 19 cases, and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) 36 cases. Ninety-three healthy individuals were used as normal controls. V617F mutation in JAK2 was identified by allele-specific PCR method, RT-PCR was used for the detection of BCR/ABL1 fusion gene, and mutations and variations in coding exons and their flanking sequences of LNK gene were examined by PCR-sequencing. RESULTS: Missense mutations of A300V, V402M, and R415H in LNK were found in 8 patients including ET (4 cases, all combined with JAK2-V617F mutation), PV (2 cases, one combined with JAK2-V617F mutation), PMF (one case, combined with JAK2-V617F mutation) and CML (one case, combined with BCR/ABL1 fusion gene). The genotype and allele frequencies of the three SNPs (rs3184504, rs111340708 and rs78894077) in LNK were significantly different between MPN patients and controls. For rs3184504 (T/C, in exon2), the T allele (p.262W) and TT genotype were frequently seen in ET, PV and PMF (P<0.01), and C allele (p.262R) and CC genotype were frequently seen in CML (P<0.01). For rs78894077 (T/C, in exon1), the T allele (p.242S) was frequently found in ET (P<0.05). For rs111340708 (TGGGGx5/TGGGGx4, in intron 5), the TGGGG x4 allele was infrequently found in ET, PMF and CML(P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Mutations in LNK could be found in some of MPN patients in the presence or absence of JAK2-V617F mutation.

We established that high CAR-T cell doses and tumor burden increase the risks of severe cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. Moreover, we identified serum biomarkers that allow testing of early intervention strategies in patients at the highest risk of toxicity. Risk-stratified CAR-T cell dosing based on BM disease burden decreased toxicity. CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-CAR transgene product immune responses developed after CAR-T cell infusion in some patients, limited CAR-T cell persistence, and increased relapse risk. Addition of fludarabine to the lymphodepletion regimen improved CAR-T cell persistence and disease-free survival. CONCLUSION: Immunotherapy with a CAR-T cell product of defined composition enabled identification of factors that correlated with CAR-T cell expansion, persistence, and toxicity and facilitated design of lymphodepletion and CAR-T cell dosing strategies that mitigated toxicity and improved disease-free survival.

METHODS: Male participants in the Veterans Affairs RA registry were followed up from the time of enrollment until death or December 2013. Cytokines and chemokines were measured in banked serum obtained at the time of enrollment, using a bead-based multiplex assay, and a previously developed cytokine score was calculated. Vital status and cause of death were determined through the National Death Index. Associations of cytokines with cancer mortality were examined using multivariable competing-risks regression. RESULTS: Among 1,190 men with RA, 60 cancer deaths (30 of which were attributable to lung cancer) occurred over 5,307 patient-years of follow-up. The patients had a mean age of 64.5 years, had established disease (median duration 8.7 years), were seropositive for rheumatoid factor (81%) or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (77%), and frequently had a history of smoking (82% current or former). Seven of 17 analytes examined were individually associated with cancer mortality. The cytokine score was associated with overall cancer (subhazard ratio [SHR] 1.42, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.08-1.85) and lung cancer (SHR 1.86, 95% CI 1.57-2.19) mortality in multivariable analyses. Those in the highest quartile of cytokine scores had a >2-fold increased risk of overall cancer mortality (P = 0.039) and a 6-fold increased risk of lung cancer mortality (P = 0.028) relative to the lowest quartile. A synergistic interaction between current smoking and high cytokine score was observed. CONCLUSION: Serum cytokines and chemokines are associated with cancer and lung cancer mortality in men with RA, independent of multiple factors including age, smoking status, and prevalent cancer.","['England, Bryant R', 'Sokolove, Jeremy', 'Robinson, William H', 'Thiele, Geoffrey M', 'Ganti, Apar K', 'Sayles, Harlan', 'Michaud, Kaleb', 'Caplan, Liron', 'Davis, Lisa A', 'Cannon, Grant W', 'Sauer, Brian', 'Singh, Namrata', 'Blair Solow, E', 'Reimold, Andreas M', 'Kerr, Gail S', 'Schwab, Pascale', 'Baker, Josh F', 'Mikuls, Ted R']","['England BR', 'Sokolove J', 'Robinson WH', 'Thiele GM', 'Ganti AK', 'Sayles H', 'Michaud K', 'Caplan L', 'Davis LA', 'Cannon GW', 'Sauer B', 'Singh N', 'Blair Solow E', 'Reimold AM', 'Kerr GS', 'Schwab P', 'Baker JF', 'Mikuls TR']","['Veterans Affairs Nebraska-Western Iowa Health Care System and University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha.', 'VA Palo Alto Health Care System and Stanford University, Palo Alto, California.', 'VA Palo Alto Health Care System and Stanford University, Palo Alto, California.', 'Veterans Affairs Nebraska-Western Iowa Health Care System and University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha.', 'Veterans Affairs Nebraska-Western Iowa Health Care System and University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha.', 'Veterans Affairs Nebraska-Western Iowa Health Care System and University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha.', 'Veterans Affairs Nebraska-Western Iowa Health Care System and University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, and National Data Bank for Rheumatic Diseases, Wichita, Kansas.', 'Denver VA Medical Center and University of Colorado, Denver.', 'Denver VA Medical Center, University of Colorado, and Denver Health Medical Center, Denver, Colorado.', 'VA Salt Lake City Health Care System and University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City.', 'VA Salt Lake City Health Care System and University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City.', 'Iowa City VA Health Care System and University of Iowa, Iowa City.', 'Dallas VA Medical Center and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas.', 'Dallas VA Medical Center and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas.', 'Washington DC VA Medical Center and Georgetown-Howard Universities Center for Clinical and Translational Science, Washington, DC.', 'Portland VA Health Care System and Oregon Health and Sciences University, Portland.', 'Philadelphia VA Medical Center and University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.', 'Veterans Affairs Nebraska-Western Iowa Health Care System and University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha. tmikuls@unmc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Arthritis Rheumatol,"Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)",101623795,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/epidemiology/*immunology', 'Body Mass Index', 'C-Reactive Protein/immunology', 'Chemokines/immunology', 'Cytokines/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/mortality', 'Lung Neoplasms/immunology/mortality', 'Lymphoma/immunology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/mortality', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/immunology/mortality', 'Peptides, Cyclic/immunology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/immunology/mortality', '*Registries', 'Rheumatic Nodule/epidemiology/immunology', 'Rheumatoid Factor/immunology', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/epidemiology', 'Thinness/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs']",2016/04/26 06:00,2017/07/08 06:00,['2016/04/26 06:00'],"['2016/01/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/08 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Arthritis Rheumatol. 2016 Oct;68(10):2394-402. doi: 10.1002/art.39735.,10.1002/art.39735 [doi],,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (cyclic citrullinated peptide)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)', '9009-79-4 (Rheumatoid Factor)']",,,,,['10.1002/art.39735 [doi]'],,"['(c) 2016, American College of Rheumatology.']",['IK2 CX000955/CX/CSRD VA/United States'],,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5350-3934', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4947-2741']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the heterogeneous leukemic cells, a rare population referred as the leukemic stem cell (LSC), is thought to be responsible for relapses and drug resistance. Cardiac glycosides (CGs) have been used in treating heart failure despite its toxicity. Recently, increasing evidence has demonstrated its new usage as a potential anti-cancer drug. Ouabain, one of the CGs, specifically targeted CD34(+)CD38(-) leukemic stem-like cells, but not the more mature CD34(+)CD38(+) leukemic cells, making this type of compounds a potential treatment for leukemia. In search of other potential anti-leukemia CGs, we found that Peruvoside, a less studied CG, is more effective than Ouabain and Digitoxin at inducing cell death in primitive myeloid leukemia cells without obvious cytotoxicity on normal blood cells. Similar to Ouabain and Digitoxin, Peruvoside also caused cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M stage. It up-regulates CDKN1A expression and activated the cleavage of Caspase 3, 8 and PARP, resulting in apoptosis. Thus, Peruvoside showed potent anti-leukemia effect, which may serve as a new anti-leukemia agent in the future.","['Feng, Qian', 'Leong, Wa Seng', 'Liu, Liang', 'Chan, Wai-In']","['Feng Q', 'Leong WS', 'Liu L', 'Chan WI']","['State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, China. fengqianmoon@163.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, China. michael_jackydog@hotmail.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, China. lliu@must.edu.mo.', 'State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, China. pollychan8375@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cardenolides/*pharmacology', 'Cardiac Glycosides/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Digitoxin/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Ouabain/pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism']",2016/04/26 06:00,2017/01/04 06:00,['2016/04/26 06:00'],"['2016/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Molecules. 2016 Apr 22;21(4):534. doi: 10.3390/molecules21040534.,10.3390/molecules21040534 [doi] E534 [pii],20160422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cardenolides)', '0 (Cardiac Glycosides)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '5ACL011P69 (Ouabain)', 'CT36KGC6A6 (cannogenin thevetoside)', 'E90NZP2L9U (Digitoxin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",PMC6273398,['NOTNLM'],"['Peruvoside', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'cardiac glycoside']",,"['molecules21040534 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules21040534 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nuclear Factors Associated with double-stranded RNA (NFAR) proteins NF90/110 function in the lifecycles of several viruses and participate in host innate immunity against infection and oncogenesis. Using GST pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation assays we demonstrate specific novel interactions between HBZ/APH-2 and NF90/110 and characterised the protein domains involved. Moreover we show that NF90/110 significantly enhance Tax mediated LTR activation, an effect that was abolished by HBZ but enhanced by APH-2. Additionally we found that HBZ and APH-2 modulate the promoter activity of survivin and are capable of antagonising NF110-mediated survivin activation. Thus interactions between HTLV antisense proteins and the NFAR protein family have an overall positive impact on HTLV infection. Hence NFARs may represent potential therapeutic targets in HTLV infected cells.","['Murphy, Jane', 'Hall, William W', 'Ratner, Lee', 'Sheehy, Noreen']","['Murphy J', 'Hall WW', 'Ratner L', 'Sheehy N']","['Centre for Research in Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland.', 'Centre for Research in Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Molecular Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri, United States of America.', 'Centre for Research in Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*metabolism', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Extracellular Space/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HTLV-I Infections/genetics/*metabolism/*virology', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/physiology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Factor 90 Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA Interference', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Survivin', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Virus Replication']",2016/04/26 06:00,2017/05/05 06:00,['2016/04/26 06:00'],"['2016/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/05 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Virology. 2016 Jul;494:129-42. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2016.04.012.

While CLL is the most common type of leukemia in Western populations, the disease is rare in Africans. Hence, clinical and laboratory data and studies of CLL in Sub Saharan populations have been limited. The aims of this study were to analyze the characteristics of senegalese patients with CLL at the time of the diagnosis and to identify the correlation between clinical characteristics (Binet stage) with age, gender, laboratory parameters and chromosomal abnormalities. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the clinical and laboratory characteristics of CLL in Senegal. A total of 40 patients who had been diagnosed with CLL during the period from July 2011 to April 2015 in Senegal were evaluated. Cytology and immunophenotype were performed in all patients to confirm the diagnosis. The prognosis factors such as Binet staging, CD38 and cytogenetic abnormalities were studied. The statistical analysis was performed using STATA version 13 (Stata college station Texas). Each patient signed a free and informed consent form before participating in the study. RESULTS: The mean age was 61 years ranged from 48 to 85. There were 31 males and only 9 females (sex ratio M : F = 3,44). At diagnosic, 82.5 % of the patients were classified as having advanced Binet stages B or C. The prognosis marker CD38 was positive in 28 patients. Cytogenetic abnormalities studied by FISH were performed in 25 patients, among them, 68 % (17 cases) had at least one cytogenetic abnormality and 28 % had 2 simultaneous cytogenetic abnormalities. CONCLUSION: Africans may present with CLL at a younger age and our data suggest that CLL in Senegal may be more aggressive than in Western populations.","['Sall, Abibatou', 'Toure, Awa Oumar', 'Sall, Fatimata Bintou', 'Ndour, Moussa', 'Fall, Seynabou', 'Sene, Abdoulaye', 'Faye, Blaise Felix', 'Seck, Moussa', 'Gadji, Macoura', 'Dieye, Tandakha Ndiaye', 'Mathiot, Claire', 'Reynaud, Sophie', 'Diop, Saliou', 'Raphael, Martine']","['Sall A', 'Toure AO', 'Sall FB', 'Ndour M', 'Fall S', 'Sene A', 'Faye BF', 'Seck M', 'Gadji M', 'Dieye TN', 'Mathiot C', 'Reynaud S', 'Diop S', 'Raphael M']","['Hematology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Dakar, Senegal.', 'Hematology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Dakar, Senegal.', 'Hematology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Dakar, Senegal.', 'Hematology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Dakar, Senegal.', 'Hematology, Aristide Le Dantec Hospital, Dakar, Senegal.', 'Hematology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Dakar, Senegal.', 'Hematology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Dakar, Senegal.', 'Hematology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Dakar, Senegal.', 'Hematology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Dakar, Senegal.', 'Hematology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Dakar, Senegal.', 'Curie Institute, Paris, France.', 'Hematology, University Hospital, Nice, France.', 'Hematology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Dakar, Senegal.', 'University Paris XI, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Hematol,BMC hematology,101609487,,,2016/04/26 06:00,2016/04/26 06:01,['2016/04/26 06:00'],"['2015/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/26 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,BMC Hematol. 2016 Apr 23;16:10. doi: 10.1186/s12878-016-0051-y. eCollection 2016.,10.1186/s12878-016-0051-y [doi],20160423,,PMC4841974,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Clinic', 'Cytogenetic abnormalities', 'Cytology', 'Immunophenotype']",,"['10.1186/s12878-016-0051-y [doi]', '51 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet availability of matched family donor limits its use and although matched unrelated donor or mismatched umbilical cord blood (UCB) are viable options, they fail to meet the global need. Haploidentical family donor is almost universally available and is emerging as the alternate donor of choice in adult patients. However, the same is not true in the case of children. The studies of haploidentical HSCT in children are largely limited to T cell depleted grafts with not so encouraging results in advanced leukemia. At the same time, emerging data from UCBT are challenging the existing paradigm of less stringent HLA match requirements as perceived in the past. The use of posttransplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCY) has yielded encouraging results in adults, but data in children is sorely lacking. Our experience of using PTCY based haploidentical HSCT in children shows inadequacy of this approach in younger children compared to excellent outcome in older children. In this context, we discuss the current status of haploidentical HSCT in children with acute leukemia in a global perspective and dwell on its future prospects.","['Jaiswal, Sarita Rani', 'Chakrabarti, Suparno']","['Jaiswal SR', 'Chakrabarti S']","['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Dharamshila Hospital and Research Centre, Vasundhara Enclave, New Delhi 110096, India; Manashi Chakrabarti Foundation, Kolkata, India.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Dharamshila Hospital and Research Centre, Vasundhara Enclave, New Delhi 110096, India; Manashi Chakrabarti Foundation, Kolkata, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Adv Hematol,Advances in hematology,101504271,,,2016/04/26 06:00,2016/04/26 06:01,['2016/04/26 06:00'],"['2015/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/26 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Adv Hematol. 2016;2016:3467672. doi: 10.1155/2016/3467672.

In a previous study, we demonstrated that sodium selenite is 1 of the key factors that enhances the growth of ISCs in crypt culture medium. The goal of the present article was to investigate the effect of selenite on the proliferative and antioxidative activities of ISCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five-week old BALB/C mice were administered phosphate-buffered saline or sodium selenite (4 mg/kg/d) for 7 days before ISCs were harvested. The proliferative activity of ISC was indexed by the growth of crypt organoids. The messenger RNA expression levels of ISC markers were quantified by using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The activity of antioxidative enzymes was assayed for glutathione peroxidase (GPx), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and superoxide dismutase. RESULTS: Treatment with sodium selenite induced a 1.88-fold increase in the growth number of organoids from ISCs, with elevated expression of leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5, B lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region homolog-1, and Musashi-1, compared with the ISCs from control samples treated with phosphate-buffered saline. The antioxidative activity of GPx and TrxR was significantly enhanced in the selenite-treated groups (1.55- and 1.23-fold increases, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Selenite positively regulated the proliferation of ISCs and activated the expression of ISC markers. The elevated activity of GPx and TrxR induced by selenite should promote the antioxidative ability of ISCs and benefit the growth of organoids.","['Chen, Y', 'Tsai, Y-H', 'Tseng, S-H']","['Chen Y', 'Tsai YH', 'Tseng SH']","['Department of Surgery, Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, Pan-Chiao, New Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China; Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Yuan Ze University, Chung-Li, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China.', 'Department of Surgery, Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, Pan-Chiao, New Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China; Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Yuan Ze University, Chung-Li, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China.

Study after study has illustrated that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling cascade is involved in the MDR phenotype and is correlated with P-gp expression in many human malignancies. In the present study, osthole, an O-methylated coumarin, exhibited potent reversal capability of MDR in myelogenous leukemia K562/ADM cells. Simultaneously, the uptake and efflux of Rhodamine-123 (Rh-123) and the accumulation of doxorubicin assays combined with flow cytometric analysis suggested that osthole could increase intracellular drug accumulation. Furthermore, osthole decreased the expression of multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) at both the mRNA and protein levels. Further experiments elucidated that osthole could suppress P-gp expression by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway which might be the main mechanism accounting for the reversal potential of osthole in the MDR in K562/ADM cells. In conclusion, osthole combats MDR and could be a promising candidate for the development of novel MDR reversal modulators.","['Wang, Hong', 'Jia, Xiu-Hong', 'Chen, Jie-Ru', 'Wang, Jian-Yong', 'Li, You-Jie']","['Wang H', 'Jia XH', 'Chen JR', 'Wang JY', 'Li YJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Hospital of Binzhou Medical University, Binzhou, Shandong 256603, P.R.

However, the mechanisms underlying defective erythropoiesis in leukemia have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that insufficient erythropoiesis in an immunocompetent acute myeloid leukemia (AML) murine model was due to reduced proliferation of megakaryocyte erythroid progenitors and increased apoptosis of erythroblasts. Colony-forming cell assays indicated that the leukemic bone marrow (BM) plasma inhibited erythroid colony formation, whereas they had no inhibitory effect on other types of colonies. Cytokine array analysis demonstrated that the chemokine CCL3 was elevated in the plasma of AML mice and patients. CCL3 inhibited erythroid differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells, common myeloid progenitors and especially megakaryocytic-erythroid progenitors. Administration of the CCR1 antagonist partially recovered the yield of erythroid colonies in the presence of CCL3 or leukemic BM plasma. Mechanistically, we observed an increase of p38 phosphorylation and subsequent downregulation of GATA1 after CCL3 treatment. Furthermore, knockdown of CCL3 attenuated leukemic progression and alleviated anemia. Therefore, our results demonstrate that elevated CCL3 in the leukemic environment suppresses erythropoiesis via CCR1-p38 activation, suggesting a novel mechanism for the erythroid defects observed in leukemia.","['Wang, Y', 'Gao, A', 'Zhao, H', 'Lu, P', 'Cheng, H', 'Dong, F', 'Gong, Y', 'Ma, S', 'Zheng, Y', 'Zhang, H', 'Zhang, Y', 'Xu, J', 'Zhu, X', 'Yuan, W', 'Zhang, X', 'Hao, S', 'Cheng, T']","['Wang Y', 'Gao A', 'Zhao H', 'Lu P', 'Cheng H', 'Dong F', 'Gong Y', 'Ma S', 'Zheng Y', 'Zhang H', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu J', 'Zhu X', 'Yuan W', 'Zhang X', 'Hao S', 'Cheng T']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Medicine, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Blood Cell Therapy and Technology, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chemokine CCL3/blood/*pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Erythroblasts', '*Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*pathology', 'Megakaryocytes', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2016/04/26 06:00,2017/08/30 06:00,['2016/04/26 06:00'],"['2015/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/02 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Sep;30(9):1897-908. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.81.

Adherent ALL cells showed an increased accumulation in the S phase of the cell cycle and diminished apoptosis when compared with cells in the suspension fraction. Moreover, surface expression of adhesion molecules CD34, CDH2 and CD10 increased several fold. Approximately 20% of the ALL cells were in G0 phase of the cell cycle, suggesting that MSCs may support quiescent ALL cells. Cellular barcoding demonstrated long-term preservation of clonal abundance. Expansion of ALL cells for >3 months compromised neither feeder dependence nor cancer initiating ability as judged by their engraftment potential in immunocompromised mice. Finally, we demonstrate the suitability of this co-culture approach for the investigation of drug combinations with luciferase-expressing primograft ALL cells.

In addition to TP53, the clinical relevance of NOTCH1, SF3B1 and BIRC3 gene mutations has been recently emphasized. By analyzing a cohort of 778 unselected CLL patients, we assessed the clinical relevance of CD49d as an OS predictor in subgroups defined by mutation/deletion of the TP53, NOTCH1, SF3B1 and BIRC3 genes. In this context, CD49d emerged as an independent predictor of OS in multivariate Cox analysis (Hazard ratio =1.88, P<0.0001). Consistently, high CD49d expression identified CLL subsets with inferior OS in the context of each category of a previously reported hierarchical risk stratification model. Moreover, by evaluating the relative importance of biological prognosticators by random survival forests, CD49d was selected among the top-ranked OS predictor (variable importance =0.0410), along with IGHV mutational status and TP53 abnormalities. These results confirmed CD49d as an independent negative OS prognosticator in CLL also in comprehensive models comprising the novel recurrent mutations. In this context, TP53 disruption and NOTCH1 mutations retained prognostic relevance, in keeping with their roles in CLL cell immuno-chemoresistance.","['Dal Bo, M', 'Bulian, P', 'Bomben, R', 'Zucchetto, A', 'Rossi, F M', 'Pozzo, F', 'Tissino, E', 'Benedetti, D', 'Bittolo, T', 'Nanni, P', 'Cattarossi, I', 'Zaina, E', 'Chivilo, H', 'Degan, M', 'Zaja, F', 'Pozzato, G', 'Chiarenza, A', 'Di Raimondo, F', 'Del Principe, M I', 'Del Poeta, G', 'Rossi, D', 'Gaidano, G', 'Gattei, V']","['Dal Bo M', 'Bulian P', 'Bomben R', 'Zucchetto A', 'Rossi FM', 'Pozzo F', 'Tissino E', 'Benedetti D', 'Bittolo T', 'Nanni P', 'Cattarossi I', 'Zaina E', 'Chivilo H', 'Degan M', 'Zaja F', 'Pozzato G', 'Chiarenza A', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Del Principe MI', 'Del Poeta G', 'Rossi D', 'Gaidano G', 'Gattei V']","['Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.', ""Clinica Ematologica, Centro Trapianti e Terapie Cellulari 'Carlo Melzi' DISM, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria S.

In this study, we describe the development of the first cell-based secondary reference panel that is traceable to and faithfully replicates the WHO panel, with an additional MR(4.5) level. The secondary panel was calibrated to IS using digital PCR with ABL1, BCR and GUSB as reference genes and evaluated by 44 laboratories worldwide. Interestingly, we found that >40% of BCR-ABL1 assays showed signs of inadequate optimization such as poor linearity and suboptimal PCR efficiency. Nonetheless, when optimized sample inputs were used, >60% demonstrated satisfactory IS accuracy, precision and/or MR(4.5) sensitivity, and 58% obtained IS conversion factors from the secondary reference concordant with their current values.

METHOD AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed 80 subjects diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent chemotherapy with bolus high-dose mitoxantrone. Echocardiographic measurements were taken at baseline and at a median interval of 55 days after receiving mitoxantrone. Thirty-five (44%) of the patients developed clinically defined early cardiotoxicity, 29 (36%) of which developed heart failure. There was a significant decrease in the ejection fraction (EF) not only in the cardiotoxicity group (17.6 +/- 14.8%, P < 0.001) but also in the noncardiotoxicity group (5.3 +/- 8.4%, P < 0.001). Decrease in global longitudinal strain (GLS) (-3.7 +/- 4.5, P < 0.001 vs. -2.4 +/- 4.3, P = 0.01) and global circumferential strain (GCS) (-5.6 +/- 9, P = 0.003 vs. -5.3 +/- 8.7, P < 0.001) was significant in both the cardiotoxicity and noncardiotoxicity group, respectively. A multivariate model including baseline left ventricular end-systolic diameter, baseline pre-E/A ratio, and baseline pre-E/e' ratio was found to be the best-fitted model for prediction of mitoxantrone-induced early clinical cardiotoxicity. CONCLUSION: High-dose mitoxantrone therapy is associated with an excellent remission rate but with a significantly increased risk of clinical and subclinical early cardiotoxicity and heart failure. Mitoxantrone-induced systolic dysfunction is evident from reduction in EF, increase in Tei index, and significant reduction in GLS and GCS. Baseline impaired ventricular relaxation evident from higher E/e' ratio and lower E/A ratio independently predicts increased risk of mitoxantrone-induced early cardiotoxicity.","['Shaikh, Amir Y', 'Suryadevara, Sourabh', 'Tripathi, Abhishek', 'Ahmed, Mohamed', 'Kane, Jennifer L', 'Escobar, Jorge', 'Cerny, Jan', 'Nath, Rajneesh', 'McManus, David D', 'Shih, Jeffrey', 'McGuiness, Matthew E', 'Tighe, Dennis A', 'Meyer, Theo E', 'Ramanathan, Muthalagu', 'Aurigemma, Gerard P']","['Shaikh AY', 'Suryadevara S', 'Tripathi A', 'Ahmed M', 'Kane JL', 'Escobar J', 'Cerny J', 'Nath R', 'McManus DD', 'Shih J', 'McGuiness ME', 'Tighe DA', 'Meyer TE', 'Ramanathan M', 'Aurigemma GP']","['Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine, Providence Holy Cross Medical Center, Mission Hills, California.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Division of Cardiology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Division of Cardiology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Division of Cardiology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Division of Cardiology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Division of Cardiology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Division of Cardiology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Division of Cardiology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Division of Cardiology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Echocardiography,"Echocardiography (Mount Kisco, N.Y.)",8511187,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Causality', 'Comorbidity', 'Echocardiography/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Elasticity Imaging Techniques/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Heart Failure/diagnostic imaging/mortality', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Massachusetts/epidemiology', 'Mitoxantrone/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stroke Volume/drug effects', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/*diagnostic imaging/*mortality']",2016/04/26 06:00,2017/03/16 06:00,['2016/04/26 06:00'],"['2016/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Echocardiography. 2016 Aug;33(8):1166-77. doi: 10.1111/echo.13245.

METHODS: A total of 65 newly diagnosed ALL patients upto 18 y of age along with 30 age and sex matched controls were included in the study. Coagulation tests including Prothrombin Time (PT), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT), Fibrinogen (FBG) assay, D-dimer (D-DI) assay, Coagulation inhibitor levels and tests for fibrinolysis were performed. RESULTS: At baseline, APTT of the patients was significantly prolonged (p 0.033), but PT and fibrinogen were comparable in the two groups. Protein C (PC) and Protein S (PS) were both significantly reduced in the cases, while antithrombin was comparable to control values (p < 0.001, p < 0.001 & p = 0.828 respectively). Tissue plasminogen activator levels (tPA) were significantly lower in the cases (p < 0.001) but Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) values were comparable. D-DI levels were significantly high (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The onset of leukemia is associated with hemostatic derangement favouring hypercoagulability. The coagulopathy is due to thrombin activation (as evidenced by raised d-dimer). The decreased fibrinolysis (due to reduced tPA and raised PAI-1) and low levels of PC and PS contribute to the hypercoagulable state at the time of diagnosis.","['Sehgal, Shivali', 'Sharma, Sunita', 'Chandra, Jagdish', 'Nangia, Anita']","['Sehgal S', 'Sharma S', 'Chandra J', 'Nangia A']","[""Department of Pathology, Lady Hardinge Medical College and Associated Kalawati Saran Children's Hospital, New Delhi, 110001, India. shivalisehgal@gmail.com."", ""Department of Pathology, Lady Hardinge Medical College and Associated Kalawati Saran Children's Hospital, New Delhi, 110001, India."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Lady Hardinge Medical College and Associated Kalawati Saran Children's Hospital, New Delhi, 110001, India."", ""Department of Pathology, Lady Hardinge Medical College and Associated Kalawati Saran Children's Hospital, New Delhi, 110001, India.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Pediatr,Indian journal of pediatrics,0417442,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blood Coagulation', '*Blood Coagulation Tests', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis']",2016/04/26 06:00,2018/04/10 06:00,['2016/04/26 06:00'],"['2015/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/10 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Indian J Pediatr. 2016 Oct;83(10):1082-6. doi: 10.1007/s12098-016-2114-2.

The expansion and functional importance of MDSCs in patients with cancer and noncancer pathogenic conditions has been recognized. As a result, there has been growing interest in understanding their roles in acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) after allogenetic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). In order to evaluate possible effects of MDSCs on aGVHD development and clinical outcomes, this study systematically detected the dynamic changes of MDSCs accumulation in patients during the first 100 days after allo-HSCT, and investigated the levels of other cell types and relative cytokines during MDSCs accumulation. Results showed that accumulation of MDSCs in the graft and in peripheral blood when engraftment might contribute to patients' overall immune suppression and result in the successful control of severe aGVHD and long-term survival without influence on risk of recurrence after allo-HSCT. But MDSCs levels in the graft had more favorable predictive abilities. Furthermore, MDSCs proportion significantly increased in patients developing aGVHD after allo-HSCT. It might be caused by secondary inflammatory response, especially related to high concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-alpha. But this accumulation would not be able to counterbalance the aggravation of aGVHD and would not have influence on clinical outcomes and risk of relapse. Overall, MDSCs might be considered as potential new therapeutic option for aGVHD and achieve long-term immunological tolerance and survival.","['Yin, Jin', 'Wang, Chunyan', 'Huang, Min', 'Mao, Xia', 'Zhou, Jianfeng', 'Zhang, Yicheng']","['Yin J', 'Wang C', 'Huang M', 'Mao X', 'Zhou J', 'Zhang Y']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Count', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/prevention & control/therapy', 'HLA-DR Antigens/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*metabolism/mortality/therapy', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/26 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2016/04/26 06:00'],"['2015/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/27 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Cancer Med. 2016 Jul;5(7):1654-69. doi: 10.1002/cam4.688.

In order to understand the molecular basis for the rapid oncogenicity of Fu-J, an acutely transforming avian leukosis virus isolated from fibrosarcomas in crossbreed broilers infected with subgroup J avian leukosis virus (ALV-J) in China, complete genomic structure of Fu-J virus was determined by PCR amplification and compared with those of Fu-J1, Fu-J2, Fu-J3, Fu-J4, and Fu-J5 reported previously. The results showed that the genome of Fu-J was defective, with parts of gag gene replaced by the complete v-fps oncogene and encoded a 137 kDa Gag-fps fusion protein. Sequence analysis revealed that Fu-J and Fu-J1 to Fu-J5 were related quasi-species variants carrying different lengths of v-fps oncogenes generated from recombination between helper virus and c-fps gene. Comparison of virus carrying v-fps oncogene also gave us a glimpse of the molecular characterization and evolution process of the acutely transforming ALV.","['Wang, Yixin', 'Li, Jianliang', 'Li, Yang', 'Fang, Lichun', 'Sun, Xiaolong', 'Chang, Shuang', 'Zhao, Peng', 'Cui, Zhizhong']","['Wang Y', 'Li J', 'Li Y', 'Fang L', 'Sun X', 'Chang S', 'Zhao P', 'Cui Z']","[""College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Daizong Road No. 61, Tai'an, 271018, Shandong, China."", ""College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Daizong Road No. 61, Tai'an, 271018, Shandong, China."", ""College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Daizong Road No. 61, Tai'an, 271018, Shandong, China."", ""College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Daizong Road No. 61, Tai'an, 271018, Shandong, China."", ""College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Daizong Road No. 61, Tai'an, 271018, Shandong, China."", ""College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Daizong Road No. 61, Tai'an, 271018, Shandong, China."", ""College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Daizong Road No. 61, Tai'an, 271018, Shandong, China. zhaopeng@sdau.edu.cn."", ""College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Daizong Road No. 61, Tai'an, 271018, Shandong, China. zzcui@sdau.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Virus Genes,Virus genes,8803967,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics/isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens/virology', 'DNA, Viral', 'Fibrosarcoma/virology', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-onc/*genetics', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics', 'Genes, Viral', 'Helper Viruses/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogenic Viruses/*genetics', 'Poultry Diseases/*virology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Virus Replication']",2016/04/26 06:00,2017/04/14 06:00,['2016/04/26 06:00'],"['2015/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Virus Genes. 2016 Jun;52(3):365-71. doi: 10.1007/s11262-016-1301-6.

It was shown that p54nrb/NONO was closely related to the occurrence of erythroleukemia. Whether p54nrb/NONO plays a role in progress of human acute monocytic leukemia remains unknown. In the present study, we examined the effects of p54nrb/NONO silencing on the biological characteristics of human acute monocytic leukemia THP1 cells. The results showed that p54nrb was strongly expressed in THP1 cells, and knockdown of p54nrb slightly promoted proliferation and strongly inhibited motility and invasion of THP1 cells. Moreover, knockdown of p54nrb strongly decreased the release of TNF-alpha from THP1 cells by inhibiting certain process of TNF-alpha secretion, specially for the release of TNF-alpha induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Notably, the infection of negative control shRNA-containing lentiviruses promoted the migration and the release of TNF-alpha induced by LPS in THP1 cells. All the above results demonstrated that p54nrb slightly inhibited THP1 cell proliferation, but significantly promoted migration, invasion and release of TNF-alpha induced by LPS in THP1 cells. The present study indicates that p54nrb is a powerful molecule involved in the regulation of cell motility and promotes the migration and invasion of THP1 cells, and it is more likely to be involved in the release of inflammatory mediators and the motility of inflammatory cells.","['Zhang, Xiujuan', 'Wu, Changli', 'Xiong, Wei', 'Chen, Chunling', 'Li, Rong', 'Zhou, Guangji']","['Zhang X', 'Wu C', 'Xiong W', 'Chen C', 'Li R', 'Zhou G']","['Department of Physiology, Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang, Guangdong 524023, P.R.

The present study aimed to characterize the effects of BMI-1 on the proliferation and invasion of cancer cells, as well as the mechanism involved in the regulation of the growth of esophageal cancer ECA109 and TE13 cells. The expression levels of the BMI-1 gene and protein in esophageal cancer ECA109 and TE13 cells were determined by quantitative PCR and western blotting after transfection. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay was employed to detect the interaction of BMI-1 with r-H2AX and H2AK119ub. We used flow cytometry to analyze the cell cycle distribution and apoptosis of transfected cells after irradiation or not, and examined cellular growth and invasion in vitro by MTS and Transwell assays. The results revealed that shRNA targeting the BMI-1 gene and protein downregulated BMI-1 expression after transfection for 24 h. The proliferation and invasion of tumor cells in the BMI-1shRNA group were suppressed after RT. In addition, the interaction of BMI-1, H2AK119ub and r-H2AX was increased after exposure to IR, followed by an increased apoptosis rate and decreased percentage of cells arrested at the G2/M phase after irradiation and silencing of BMI-1 by shRNA. Knockdown of BMI-1 expression decreased the phosphorylation of H2AX, upregulated p16, and induced the radiosensitivity of esophageal cancer ECA109 and TE13 cells in vitro and significantly inhibited the growth and invasion of tumor cells. The mechanisms were found to be abrogation of cell cycle arrest at the G2/M stage and promotion of apoptosis.","['Yang, Xing-Xiao', 'Sang, Mei-Xiang', 'Zhu, Shu-Chai', 'Liu, Zhi-Kun', 'Ma, Ming']","['Yang XX', 'Sang MX', 'Zhu SC', 'Liu ZK', 'Ma M']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei 050011, P.R.

Although associated with treatment factors such as hospitalization and corticosteroids, sleep problems may also be influenced by modifiable environmental factors such as parenting behaviors. The purpose of this study was to examine sleep problems in children undergoing treatment for ALL compared to healthy children and whether parenting practices are associated with sleep difficulties. Parents of 73 children aged 2-6 years who were (1) in the maintenance phase of ALL treatment (ALL group, n = 43) or (2) had no major medical illness (healthy control group, n = 30) participated in the study. Parents completed questionnaires measuring their child's sleep behavior and their own parenting practices. Parents of children undergoing ALL treatment reported significantly more child sleep problems; 48% of children with ALL compared to 23% of healthy children had clinical levels of sleep disturbance. Parents of the ALL group also reported significantly more lax parenting practices and strategies associated with their child's sleep including co-sleeping, comforting activities, and offering food and drink in the bedroom. Results of multivariate regression analysis indicated that, after controlling for illness status, parent-child co-sleeping was significantly associated with child sleep difficulties. Strategies employed by parents during ALL treatment may be a potential modifiable intervention target that could result in improved child sleep behaviors.

Clustering of melanoma occurs in approximately 10 % of families, and an over-representation of additional cancers has been noticed in some 'melanoma' families. The degree to which other cancers aggregate in families affected by melanoma has not been well defined. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the risk of cancers other than melanoma in a cohort of 178 'intermediate risk' melanoma families, not selected for specific genetic mutations. Families designated as 'intermediate risk' had two first degree relatives (FDRs) affected by melanoma when ascertained between 1982 and 1990, and were followed up over a 33 year period to assess new occurrences of cancer. We included 414 melanoma cases and 529 FDRs, comprising 25,264 person years of observation. Standardised incidence ratios and their 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for all invasive cancers, comparing observed to expected cases of cancer based on age and sex specific incidence rates for the Queensland population. Statistically significant increases were found for bladder cancer in females (observed, 7; expected, 1.99; SIR, 3.52; 95 % CI 1.41-7.25), lymphoid leukaemia in females (observed, 6; expected, 1.75; SIR, 3.43; 95 % CI 1.26-7.46), and myeloma in female melanoma cases (observed, 4; expected, 0.82; SIR, 4.89; 95 % CI 1.33-12.52). Over-representation of bladder cancer, lymphoid leukaemia, and myeloma in females of the cohort may suggest sex-dependent co-modifiers, and it is possible that specific combinations of polymorphisms predispose to certain cancer types.","['Read, Jazlyn', 'Symmons, Judith', 'Palmer, Jane M', 'Montgomery, Grant W', 'Martin, Nicholas G', 'Hayward, Nicholas K']","['Read J', 'Symmons J', 'Palmer JM', 'Montgomery GW', 'Martin NG', 'Hayward NK']","['QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, PO Royal Brisbane Hospital, Herston, Brisbane, QLD, 4029, Australia. jazlyn.read@qimrberghofer.edu.au.', 'The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia. jazlyn.read@qimrberghofer.edu.au.', 'QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, PO Royal Brisbane Hospital, Herston, Brisbane, QLD, 4029, Australia.', 'QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, PO Royal Brisbane Hospital, Herston, Brisbane, QLD, 4029, Australia.', 'QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, PO Royal Brisbane Hospital, Herston, Brisbane, QLD, 4029, Australia.', 'QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, PO Royal Brisbane Hospital, Herston, Brisbane, QLD, 4029, Australia.', 'QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, PO Royal Brisbane Hospital, Herston, Brisbane, QLD, 4029, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Fam Cancer,Familial cancer,100898211,IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*epidemiology', 'Pedigree', 'Queensland/epidemiology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*epidemiology']",2016/04/25 06:00,2017/09/26 06:00,['2016/04/25 06:00'],"['2016/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Fam Cancer. 2016 Oct;15(4):651-63. doi: 10.1007/s10689-016-9907-3.,10.1007/s10689-016-9907-3 [doi],,"['Melanoma, Cutaneous Malignant']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bladder cancer', '*Familial cancer', '*Lymphoid leukaemia', '*Melanoma', '*Risk']",,"['10.1007/s10689-016-9907-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s10689-016-9907-3 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two of the most commonly prescribed corticosteroids in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), dexamethasone and prednisone, may impact sleep differently, but no research has compared these medications in children. The current study tested the hypothesis that dexamethasone and prednisone differentially affect sleep in children with ALL to understand how these medications contribute to health-related quality of life (HRQL). METHODS: Parents of 81 children 3-12 years old in maintenance therapy for ALL completed a baseline measure of child sleep (dexamethasone n = 55, prednisone n = 26), and 61 parents returned 28 days of child sleep diaries starting the first day of a 5-day steroid course (dexamethasone n = 43, prednisone n = 18). Parents also completed measures of HRQL and fatigue on the last day of steroids and the last day of the month. RESULTS: At baseline, parents reported more sleep disturbances in children taking dexamethasone than prednisone. Across the month, children taking dexamethasone experienced poorer sleep quality compared to children taking prednisone. During corticosteroid treatment, children taking dexamethasone also experienced more night awakenings than children taking prednisone. Sleep variables accounted for almost half of the variance in HRQL during time off steroids and also significantly contributed to fatigue during the corticosteroids course and time off corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep is an essential component of HRQL in children taking corticosteroids, and the impact on sleep is more pronounced in children taking dexamethasone compared to prednisone. Screening for sleep disturbances and offering brief interventions to manage steroid-related sleep disruptions may improve HRQL.","['Daniel, Lauren C', 'Li, Yimei', 'Kloss, Jacqueline D', 'Reilly, Anne F', 'Barakat, Lamia P']","['Daniel LC', 'Li Y', 'Kloss JD', 'Reilly AF', 'Barakat LP']","[""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 34th and Civic Center Blvd., CTRB 10-300, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA. daniell@email.chop.edu."", ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 34th and Civic Center Blvd., CTRB 10-300, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA."", 'Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Psychology, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 34th and Civic Center Blvd., CTRB 10-300, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA."", 'Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 34th and Civic Center Blvd., CTRB 10-300, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA."", 'Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/*therapeutic use', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prednisone/*therapeutic use', 'Quality of Life', 'Sleep/*drug effects', 'Sleep Wake Disorders/*etiology']",2016/04/25 06:00,2017/10/07 06:00,['2016/04/25 06:00'],"['2015/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/07 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2016 Sep;24(9):3897-906. doi: 10.1007/s00520-016-3234-y.

Due to the poor DNA binding observed, the nature of the diaromatic linker was explored by preparing the corresponding amide-linked bis-isouronium derivative and measuring its DNA affinity. Next, the inhibitory effects of the isouronium derivatives on cell viability were evaluated in two different cancer cell lines providing IC50 values in the range of 36.9-57.4 muM (HL-60, leukemia), and 17.3-33.9 muM (Kelly, neuroblastoma). These values are comparable to those previously found for the N-hydroxyguanidine series. Compounds with the -S- linker (3, 6, and 10) proved to be considerably active in the HL-60 cells and even more active in the Kelly cell line. No correlation was found between DNA minor groove binding and cell growth inhibition; hence, activity may depend on different modes of action. Further studies into the apoptotic potential of these compounds indicated that, besides inhibiting cell viability and proliferation, derivatives 9 and 10, are significant apoptosis-inducers in both cell lines. Results obtained with HL-60 cells suggest that G2/M arrest and subsequent apoptosis induced by compound 10 are associated with microtubular depolymerisation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of the caspase cascade. Moreover, the effects of compound 10 on cell viability and apoptosis in two non-cancereous cell lines (NIH3T3 and MCF-10A) indicate none or minimal toxicity.","['Kahvedzic-Seljubac, Amila', 'Nathwani, Seema-Maria', 'Zisterer, Daniela M', 'Rozas, Isabel']","['Kahvedzic-Seljubac A', 'Nathwani SM', 'Zisterer DM', 'Rozas I']","['School of Chemistry, Trinity Biomedical Science Institute, Trinity College Dublin, 152-160, Pearse St., Dublin 2, Ireland.', 'School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Science Institute, Trinity College Dublin, 152-160, Pearse St., Dublin 2, Ireland.', 'School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Science Institute, Trinity College Dublin, 152-160, Pearse St., Dublin 2, Ireland.', 'School of Chemistry, Trinity Biomedical Science Institute, Trinity College Dublin, 152-160, Pearse St., Dublin 2, Ireland.

Therefore, we aimed first to examine a direct effect of ZnPO4 (extracellular exposure) or Zn(2+) pyrithione (ZnPT) (intracellular exposure) application on the structure of the mitochondrion in ventricular cardiomyocytes by using histological investigations. The light microscopy data demonstrated that Zn(2+) exposure induced marked increases on cellular surface area, an indication of hypertrophy, in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, a whole-cell patch-clamp measurement of cell capacitance also supported the hypertrophy in the cells. We observed marked increases in mitochondrial matrix/cristae area and matrix volume together with increased lysosome numbers in ZnPO4- or ZnPT-incubated cells by using transmission electron microscopy, again in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, we observed notable clustering and vacuolated mitochondrion, markedly disrupted and damaged myofibrils, and electron-dense small granules in Zn(2+)-exposed cells together with some implications of fission-fusion defects in the mitochondria. Moreover, we observed marked depolarization in mitochondrial membrane potential during 1-muM ZnPT minute applications by using confocal microscopy. We also showed that 1-muM ZnPT incubation induced significant increases in the phosphorylation levels of GSK3beta (Ser21 and Ser9), Akt (Ser473), and NFkappaB (Ser276 and Thr254) together with increased expression levels in ER stress proteins such as GRP78 and calregulin. Furthermore, a new key player at ER-mitochondria sites, promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) level, was markedly increased in ZnPT-incubated cells. As a summary, our present data suggest that increased cytosolic free Zn(2+) can induce marked alterations in mitochondrion morphology as well as depolarization in mitochondrion membrane potential and changes in some cytosolic signaling proteins as well as a defect in ER-mitochondria cross talk.","['Billur, Deniz', 'Tuncay, Erkan', 'Okatan, Esma Nur', 'Olgar, Yusuf', 'Durak, Aysegul Toy', 'Degirmenci, Sinan', 'Can, Belgin', 'Turan, Belma']","['Billur D', 'Tuncay E', 'Okatan EN', 'Olgar Y', 'Durak AT', 'Degirmenci S', 'Can B', 'Turan B']","['Department of Histology-Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, Ankara University, 06100, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, Ankara University, 06100, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, Ankara University, 06100, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, Ankara University, 06100, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, Ankara University, 06100, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, Ankara University, 06100, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Histology-Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, Ankara University, 06100, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, Ankara University, 06100, Ankara, Turkey. belma.turan@medicine.ankara.edu.tr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biol Trace Elem Res,Biological trace element research,7911509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytosol/*metabolism', 'Heart Ventricles/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/physiology', 'Mitochondria, Heart/*metabolism', 'Muscle Proteins/metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Zinc/*metabolism']",2016/04/25 06:00,2017/01/20 06:00,['2016/04/25 06:00'],"['2016/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/20 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/25 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Trace Elem Res. 2016 Nov;174(1):177-188. doi: 10.1007/s12011-016-0704-5.

The FASP protocols in the label-free and SILAC (stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture) approaches were selected for producing the highest number of quantified proteins with reduced number of missed cleavages. The IMAC method was selected for producing the highest number of quantified phosphopeptides from SILAC-labelled peptides prepared with FASP. Using these selected workflows, we studied the effect of liquid nitrogen storage on the proteome and phosphoproteome of four AML patients. Our results showed that although there was not a major global proteome and phosphoproteome change when compared to their freshly processed counterparts, the freezing appeared to influence the abundance of mitochondrial proteins involved in the respiratory chain transport and affect the phosphorylation of apoptosis related proteins, cell surface interactors, ERK/MAPK targets and proteins involved in thrombin signalling. Our results encourage the assessment of current procedures of AML sample collection and preservation that could be used in future AML biomarker discovery studies. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Proteomic studies aiming to identify potential cancer biomarkers need to utilize the best sample preparation workflows on the samples of interest to achieve maximal proteome coverage. We have tested the most popular and recent proteomic and phosphoproteomic methods on cell lysates from patients with AML and systematically evaluated their performance. Our study shows the relevance of selecting the patient sample procedure giving the highest protein and PTM coverage. Moreover, we assessed how the proteome and phosphoproteome were affected by the conventional liquid nitrogen storage compared to cell lysis of fresh material, using the methods that worked best in our hands. For potential biomarkers that could be used for AML diagnostic and prognostic, it is of great importance to study the behaviour during sample conservation in order to avoid artefactual findings. Our results recommend caution in data interpretation when using different protocols of sample collection and conservation for proteomic and phosphosproteomic research.","['Aasebo, Elise', 'Mjaavatten, Olav', 'Vaudel, Marc', 'Farag, Yehia', 'Selheim, Frode', 'Berven, Frode', 'Bruserud, Oystein', 'Hernandez-Valladares, Maria']","['Aasebo E', 'Mjaavatten O', 'Vaudel M', 'Farag Y', 'Selheim F', 'Berven F', 'Bruserud O', 'Hernandez-Valladares M']","['Department of Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.

Errors in the multi-step commitment process result in excessive numbers of immature lymphocytes, causing malignant disease. Genes involved in the differentiation of lymphocytes are often associated with leukemia. One such gene, Zfp521, has been found to cause B-cell leukemia in mice when over-expressed. The role of Zfp521 in B-cell differentiation, and the mechanisms by which it leads to leukemic transformation, are unclear. In this study we report that Zfp521 knockdown causes apoptosis in a B-cell culture system and promotes down-regulation of genes acting at late stages of B-cell differentiation. We identify Pax5 and cyclin D1 as Zfp521 target genes, and suggest that excessive B-cell proliferation observed in mice with retroviral insertions near the Zfp521 gene is due to an up-regulation of cyclin D1 in B-cells. Overall, these results suggest links between dysregulated Zfp521 and B-cell survival.","['Al Dallal, Salma', 'Wolton, Kathryn', 'Hentges, Kathryn E']","['Al Dallal S', 'Wolton K', 'Hentges KE']","['Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, UK.', 'Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, UK.', 'Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, UK.

However, both have been related to some cardiovascular toxicity, being more frequent in patients with cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs). Nowadays, due to the lack of recommendations for CML patients, CVRF management is carried out heterogeneously. The aim of this work is to develop recommendations on the prevention and monitoring of cardiovascular events (CVD) in patients with CML treated with TKIs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Experts from the Spanish Group of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia together with experts in cardiovascular risk have elaborated, after a consensus meeting, recommendations for the prevention and follow-up of CVE in patients with CML treated with TKI. RESULTS: Recommendations regarding the necessary information to be collected on clinical history, treatment decisions, as well as treatment and monitoring of CVRFs are shown in this document. CONCLUSIONS: TKI treatment requires comprehensive patient management from a multidisciplinary approach, in which both the prevention and management of CVRFs are essential.","['Garcia-Gutierrez, Valentin', 'Jimenez-Velasco, Antonio', 'Gomez-Casares, M Teresa', 'Sanchez-Guijo, Fermin', 'Lopez-Sendon, Jose Luis', 'Steegmann Olmedillas, Juan Luis']","['Garcia-Gutierrez V', 'Jimenez-Velasco A', 'Gomez-Casares MT', 'Sanchez-Guijo F', 'Lopez-Sendon JL', 'Steegmann Olmedillas JL']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Espana.

Therefore, inhibition of glycolysis is a promising cancer treatment target. Recently, it has been recognized that to conduct thorough treatment of cancer, comprehensive understanding of cancer metabolism is essential, not only focusing on glycolysis. Here, we investigated the supporting mechanism of autophagy, which is a catabolic process that recycles intracellular components, for energy supply in the glycolysis-inhibited condition. Autophagy is thought to be highly activated in cancers and to promote their growth or progression by adapting to the harsh surrounding microenvironment. We found that cancer cells positively promoted autophagy to overcome the energy shortage from glycolysis by maintaining mitochondrial activity for ATP production essential for survival. Conclusively, autophagy plays a role in determining whether cancer cells live or die, and autophagic ability in cancer cells is a promising target for therapy.","['Kawaguchi, Moemi', 'Aoki, Shigeki', 'Hirao, Takuya', 'Morita, Michie', 'Ito, Kousei']","['Kawaguchi M', 'Aoki S', 'Hirao T', 'Morita M', 'Ito K']","['Laboratory of Biopharmaceutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Inohana 1-8-1, Chuo-ku, Chiba-shi, Chiba 260-8675, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Biopharmaceutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Inohana 1-8-1, Chuo-ku, Chiba-shi, Chiba 260-8675, Japan.

A total of 88 patients diagnosed with refractory anemia with excess blast (RAEB) treated with azacitidine (n=57) or decitabine (n=31) were evaluated. Comparisons between azacitidine and decitabine groups were performed in the whole cohort, and in a 1:1 propensity score-matched cohort in order to reduce the simple selection bias. Patients who received azacitidine or decitabine had comparable overall response rates in both the unmatched (49.1% vs. 64.5%, p=0.166) and the propensity-matched cohorts (52% vs. 68%, p=0.248). The cumulative incidence of AML transformation at one year was comparable between azacitidine and decitabine in the unmatched (24.0% vs. 31.3%, p=0.26) and in the propensity-matched cohorts (18.7% vs. 31.5%, p=0.11). There was no difference in terms of transfusion requirement, febrile neutropenia episodes or the need for antifungal use during the treatment cycles in the propensity-matched cohort. The median overall survival was 20.4 months for azacitidine and 16.8 months for decitabine (p=0.59). Finally, we found that at least a four-cycle treatment with any HMA was a favorable factor. In conclusion, both azacitidine and decitabine have similar efficacy and toxicity profiles in the treatment of MDS-RAEB.","['Salim, Ozan', 'Toptas, Tayfur', 'Avsar, Esin', 'Yucel, Orhan Kemal', 'Ozturk, Erman', 'Ferhanoglu, Burhan', 'Geduk, Ayfer', 'Mehtap, Ozgur', 'Tombak, Anil', 'Tiftik, Eyup Naci', 'Deveci, Burak', 'Kurtoglu, Erdal', 'Kara, Osman', 'Atagunduz, Isik Kaygusuz', 'Tuglular, Tulin Firatli', 'Undar, Levent']","['Salim O', 'Toptas T', 'Avsar E', 'Yucel OK', 'Ozturk E', 'Ferhanoglu B', 'Geduk A', 'Mehtap O', 'Tombak A', 'Tiftik EN', 'Deveci B', 'Kurtoglu E', 'Kara O', 'Atagunduz IK', 'Tuglular TF', 'Undar L']","['Akdeniz University, School of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Antalya, Turkey.

Using gene expression microarray analysis, we found that thousands of genes are repressed more than 2-fold in CLL compared to normal B cells; however therapeutic approaches to reverse this have been limited in CLL. Following treatment with the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG, a significant number of these repressed genes were significantly re-expressed. One of the genes significantly repressed in CLL and up-regulated by 17-DMAG was suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, (SOCS3). SOCS3 has been shown to be silenced in solid tumors as well as myeloid leukemia; however little is known about the regulation in CLL. We found that 17-DMAG induces expression of SOCS3 by via the activation of p38 signaling, and subsequently inhibits AKT and STAT3 phosphorylation resulting in downstream effects on cell migration and survival. We therefore suggest that SOCS3 is an important signaling protein in CLL, and Hsp90 inhibitors represent a novel approach to target transcriptional repression in B cell lymphoproliferative disorders which exhibit a substantial degree of gene repression.","['Chen, Timothy L', 'Gupta, Nikhil', 'Lehman, Amy', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Yu, Lianbo', 'Oakes, Christopher C', 'Claus, Rainer', 'Plass, Christoph', 'Maddocks, Kami J', 'Andritsos, Leslie', 'Jones, Jeffery A', 'Lucas, David M', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Byrd, John C', 'Hertlein, Erin']","['Chen TL', 'Gupta N', 'Lehman A', 'Ruppert AS', 'Yu L', 'Oakes CC', 'Claus R', 'Plass C', 'Maddocks KJ', 'Andritsos L', 'Jones JA', 'Lucas DM', 'Johnson AJ', 'Byrd JC', 'Hertlein E']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Medicinal Chemistry & Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Benzoquinones/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein/*genetics/metabolism']",2016/04/24 06:00,2017/12/12 06:00,['2016/04/24 06:00'],"['2015/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 May 10;7(19):28684-96. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.8760.,10.18632/oncotarget.8760 [doi],,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '001L2FE0M3 (17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin)']",PMC5053755,['NOTNLM'],"['Hsp90', 'SOCS3', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia']",['The authors have no conflicts to disclose related to this work.'],"['8760 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.8760 [doi]']",,,"['K12 CA133250/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, hematopoietic expression of Prdm14 at supraphysiological levels results in fully penetrant and rapid-onset T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) in the mouse. Here, we show that PRDM14-induced T-ALLs are driven by NOTCH1, a frequently mutated driver of human T-ALL. Notch1 is activated in this murine model via RAG-dependent promoter deletions and subsequent production of truncated, ligand-independent protein from downstream regions of the Notch1 locus. These T-ALLs also have focal changes in H3K4me3 deposition at the Notch1 locus and global increases in both H3K4me1 and H3K4me3. Using a PRDM14-FLAG mouse model, we show that PRDM14 binds within an intron of Notch1 prior to leukemia development. Our data support the idea that PRDM14 binding promotes a chromatin state that allows access of the RAG recombinase complex to cryptic RAG signal sequences embedded at the Notch1 locus. Indeed, breeding into a RAG recombination-deficient background abrogates T-ALL development and prevents Notch1 deletions, while allowing for transient hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-like pre-leukemia cell expansion.

At the same time, increasing numbers of patients are receiving reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) prior to hematopoietic stem cell infusion. In prior work using smaller patient numbers and limited data, RIC peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation was shown to be noninferior to RIC bone marrow (BM) transplantation for acute leukemia. A recent, large registry analysis from the Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation showed that peripheral blood grafts result in superior outcomes compared with BM after RIC regimens for acute leukemia. The T-cell-replete PBSC allografts are associated with significant graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) benefits that are important drivers of improved leukemia-free survival and overall survival. However, an increased risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) after peripheral blood grafts is concerning and long-term follow-up comparing peripheral versus BM grafts after RIC regimens is needed. Further assessment of the long-standing risks should be undertaken in an effort to better understand whether the risk of cGVHD among peripheral blood graft recipients translates into continued GVL effects and long-term remissions and cures or if it results in late morbidity and mortality.","['Byrne, Michael', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Byrne M', 'Savani BN', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']","['Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective single-center review of port removals was conducted between 2003 and 2012. Cases were identified through radiology reports. Clinical details (eg, demographics, disease, port dwell time, interventional techniques) were obtained through patient charts. Cases were classified as difficult removals if there was documented adherence to soft tissues or vein, or simple removals if no difficulty was recorded. Difficult removals were categorized and graded on increasing invasiveness of techniques required. Successful removal was defined as complete removal of the port catheter. Difficult removals were compared with simple removals for factors associated with difficult removal. Of all removals (N = 1,306), 58 were classified as difficult removals (4%). RESULTS: Using various techniques, 57 of 58 (98%) adherent port catheters were successfully removed. Factors identified with difficult removals included primary diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (78% vs 37%, P < .0001), age at insertion (3.7 y vs 5.4 y, P = .0019), and port dwell time (median 1,087 d vs 616 d, P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Difficulty removing port catheters in children is uncommon. Port catheters can usually be removed successfully using various IR techniques ranging in invasiveness. There is an association of difficult removal with early age at insertion, ALL diagnosis, and long port dwell time. Awareness of these factors may help physicians inform parents of potential difficulties and plan the removal procedure.","['Patel, Premal Amrishkumar', 'Parra, Dimitri A', 'Bath, Ramnik', 'Amaral, Joao G', 'Temple, Michael J', 'John, Philip R', 'Connolly, Bairbre L']","['Patel PA', 'Parra DA', 'Bath R', 'Amaral JG', 'Temple MJ', 'John PR', 'Connolly BL']","['Division of Image Guided Therapy, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1X8, Canada.', 'Division of Image Guided Therapy, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1X8, Canada.', 'Division of Image Guided Therapy, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1X8, Canada.', 'Division of Image Guided Therapy, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1X8, Canada.', 'Division of Image Guided Therapy, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1X8, Canada.', 'Division of Image Guided Therapy, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1X8, Canada.', 'Division of Image Guided Therapy, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1X8, Canada.

In this study, we targeted four candidate genes: JAK2 and RUNX1 genes assuring a prominent function in hematological process and CBL and NPM1 as proto-oncogenes. Their disruption was described in several sporadic hematological malignancies. The aim of this study is to determine whether JAK2, CBL, RUNX1, and NPM1 germline genes mutations are involved in familial hematological malignancies. Using direct sequencing, we analyzed JAK2 (exons 12 and 14); CBL (exons 7, 8 and 9); NPM1 (exon 12) and the entire RUNX1 in 88 independent families belonging to Tunisian and French populations. Twenty-one sporadic acute leukemias were included in this study. We reported a heterozygous intronic c.1641 + 6 T > C JAK2 variant (rs182123615) found in two independent familial cases diagnosed with gastric lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. The in silico analysis suggested a potential impact on splicing, but the functional splicing minigene reporter assay on rs182123615 variant showed no aberrant transcripts. In one sporadic acute myeloblastic leukemia, we reported an insertion 846 in. TGTT in exon 12 of NPM1 gene that may impact the normal reading frame. The rs182123615 JAK2 variant was described in several contexts including myeloproliferative neoplasms and congenital erythrocytosis and was supposed to be pathogenic. Through this current study, we established the assessment of pathogenicity of rs182123615 and we classified it rather as rare polymorphism.","['Hamadou, Walid S', 'Bourdon, Violaine', 'Gaildrat, Pascaline', 'Besbes, Sawsen', 'Fabre, Aurelie', 'Youssef, Yosra B', 'Regaieg, Haifa', 'Laatiri, Mohamed A', 'Eisinger, Francois', 'Mari, Veronique', 'Gesta, Paul', 'Dreyfus, Helene', 'Bonadona, Valerie', 'Dugast, Catherine', 'Zattara, Helene', 'Faivre, Laurence', 'Jemni, Saloua Yacoub', 'Noguchi, Testsuro', 'Khelif, Abderrahim', 'Sobol, Hagay', 'Soua, Zohra']","['Hamadou WS', 'Bourdon V', 'Gaildrat P', 'Besbes S', 'Fabre A', 'Youssef YB', 'Regaieg H', 'Laatiri MA', 'Eisinger F', 'Mari V', 'Gesta P', 'Dreyfus H', 'Bonadona V', 'Dugast C', 'Zattara H', 'Faivre L', 'Jemni SY', 'Noguchi T', 'Khelif A', 'Sobol H', 'Soua Z']","['UR ""Biologie moleculaire des leucemies et lymphomes"", Laboratoire de Biochimie, Faculte de Medecine de Sousse, Universite de Sousse, Avenue Mohamed Karoui, 4000, Sousse, Tunisia. walid_sabrimail@yahoo.fr.', ""Departement d'Oncologie Genetique, de Prevention et Depistage, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France."", ""Inserm U1079, Institut de Recherche et d'Innovation Biomedicale (IRIB), Universite de Rouen, Rouen, France."", 'UR ""Biologie moleculaire des leucemies et lymphomes"", Laboratoire de Biochimie, Faculte de Medecine de Sousse, Universite de Sousse, Avenue Mohamed Karoui, 4000, Sousse, Tunisia.', ""Departement d'Oncologie Genetique, de Prevention et Depistage, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France."", 'UR ""Biologie moleculaire des leucemies et lymphomes"", Laboratoire de Biochimie, Faculte de Medecine de Sousse, Universite de Sousse, Avenue Mohamed Karoui, 4000, Sousse, Tunisia.', ""Service d'Hematologie clinique, CHU Farhat Hached, Sousse, Tunisia."", 'UR ""Biologie moleculaire des leucemies et lymphomes"", Laboratoire de Biochimie, Faculte de Medecine de Sousse, Universite de Sousse, Avenue Mohamed Karoui, 4000, Sousse, Tunisia.', ""Service d'Hematologie clinique, CHU Farhat Hached, Sousse, Tunisia."", ""Service d'Hematologie clinique, CHU Fattouma Bourguiba, Monastir, Tunisia."", ""Departement d'Anticipation et de Suivi du Cancer, Centre de Lutte Contre le Cancer, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France."", ""Service d'Oncologie Genetique, Centre de Lutte Contre le Cancer, Centre Antoine Lacassagne, Nice, France."", ""Service d'Oncologie Genetique, Centre Hospitalier, Niort, France."", 'Institut Sainte Catherine, Avignon, France.', 'Unite de genetique Epidemiologique, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.', 'Centre Eugene Marquis, Rennes, France.', 'Departement de Genetique, Hopital de la Timone, Marseille, France.', ""Hopital d'Enfants, CHU de Dijon, Dijon, France."", 'Centre regional de transfusion sanguine, CHU F.

However, resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy in refractory acute myeloid leukemia is associated with short-time recurrence after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. To address this issue, we used three cell lines, HL60, HL60/ADR (adriamycin-resistant cells), and HL60/RX (a radiation-resistant cell line established from HL60 cells), as cellular models to investigate the mechanism of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway resulting in radioresistance, and the efficacy of LDE225 (an inhibitor of the Hh pathway) to enhance radiation sensitivity. Our results indicated that HL60/RX and HL60/ADR cells showed an increased in radioresistance and elevated activity of Hh pathway proteins compared with HL60 cells (P<0.001). In addition, LDE225 significantly reduced clonogenic survival with a sensitivity enhancement ratio (SER) of 1.283 for HL60/ADR and 1.245 for HL60/RX cells. The combination of LDE225 with irradiation significantly increased radiation-induced apoptosis and expression of gamma-H2AX and BAK compared with single-treatment groups in both HL60/RX and HL60/ADR cells (P<0.001). In vivo, the combination of LDE225 with irradiation exerted a significant antitumor effect compared with the control and single agents in HL60/RX- and HL60/ADR-xenografted mouse models (P<0.001). Furthermore, our data obtained from western blot and IHC analyses showed that the activation of pAKT and NF-kB was reduced by LDE225 treatment in both HL60/ADR and HL60/RX cells. This demonstrates that the Gli-1/PI3K/AKT/NF-kB pathway plays a key role in resistance to radiation, and that inhibition of the Hh pathway sensitizes cells to radiation by overcoming radioresistance.","['Li, Xiaodong', 'Chen, Fang', 'Zhu, Qiuhua', 'Ding, Bingjie', 'Zhong, Qingxiu', 'Huang, Kaikai', 'Jiang, Xuejie', 'Wang, Zhixiang', 'Yin, Changxin', 'Zhu, Yufeng', 'Li, Zhen', 'Meng, Fanyi']","['Li X', 'Chen F', 'Zhu Q', 'Ding B', 'Zhong Q', 'Huang K', 'Jiang X', 'Wang Z', 'Yin C', 'Zhu Y', 'Li Z', 'Meng F']","['Hematology Department, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, China.', 'Hematology Department, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, China.', 'Hematology Department, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, China.', 'Hematology Department, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, China.', 'Hematology Department, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, China.', 'Hematology Department, Kanghua Hospital, Dongguan 523080, Guangdong, China.', 'Hematology Department, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, China.', 'Hematology Department, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, China.', 'Hematology Department, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, China.', 'Hematology Department, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, China.', 'Hematology Department, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, China.', 'Hematology Department, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, China.', 'Hematology Department, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, China.', 'Hematology Department, Kanghua Hospital, Dongguan 523080, Guangdong, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*radiotherapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Signal Transduction', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'Zinc Finger Protein GLI1/*metabolism']",2016/04/23 06:00,2018/02/13 06:00,['2016/04/23 06:00'],"['2015/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/13 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 May 31;7(22):33004-15. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.8844.,10.18632/oncotarget.8844 [doi],,"['0 (GLI1 protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein GLI1)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",PMC5078070,['NOTNLM'],"['Gli-1/PI3K/AKT/NF-kB', 'LDE225', 'radioresistance', 'refractory AML']",['The authors declare no competing financial interests.'],"['8844 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.8844 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, investigators use genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to characterize G while relying on self-reported information to classify E. If E and GxE dominate disease risks, this imbalance obscures important causal factors. To estimate proportions of disease risk attributable to G (plus shared exposures), published data from Western European monozygotic (MZ) twins were used to estimate population attributable fractions (PAFs) for 28 chronic diseases. Genetic PAFs ranged from 3.4% for leukemia to 48.6% for asthma with a median value of 18.5%. Cancers had the lowest PAFs (median = 8.26%) while neurological (median = 26.1%) and lung (median = 33.6%) diseases had the highest PAFs. These PAFs were then linked with Western European mortality statistics to estimate deaths attributable to G for heart disease and nine cancer types. Of 1.53 million Western European deaths in 2000, 0.25 million (16.4%) could be attributed to genetics plus shared exposures. Given the modest influences of G-related factors on the risks of chronic diseases in MZ twins, the disparity in coverage of G and E in etiological research is problematic. To discover causes of disease, GWAS should be complemented with exposome-wide association studies (EWAS) that profile chemicals in biospecimens from incident disease cases and matched controls.","['Rappaport, Stephen M']",['Rappaport SM'],"['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Air Pollution, Indoor/adverse effects', 'Alcohol Drinking/adverse effects', 'Asthma/diagnosis/*etiology/genetics/mortality', 'Chronic Disease', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Gene-Environment Interaction', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Heart Diseases/diagnosis/*etiology/genetics/mortality', '*Heredity', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*etiology/genetics/mortality', 'Nervous System Diseases/diagnosis/*etiology/genetics/mortality', 'Smoking/adverse effects', 'Sodium, Dietary/adverse effects', 'Survival Analysis', 'Twins, Monozygotic/genetics']",2016/04/23 06:00,2017/03/25 06:00,['2016/04/23 06:00'],"['2016/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/25 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Apr 22;11(4):e0154387. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0154387. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0154387 [doi],20160422,"['0 (Sodium, Dietary)']",PMC4841510,,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0154387 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-08292 [pii]']",,,"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES005948/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Two trials were taken from 2,481 full-text articles. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) index. Quality assessment was performed with the Cochrane Collaboration's risk-of-bias tool. RESULTS: The analysis showed that high-dose daunorubicin induction therapy was associated with higher complete remission (CR) rate (n = 965; RR = 1.80; 95% CI = 1.36-2.38; p < 0.0001; I(2 )= 0%) and improved overall survival (n = 1040; HR = 0.74; 95% CI = 0.63-0.87; p = 0.0003; I(2 )= 0%) compared with standard-dose daunorubicin. However, there was no significant interaction between treatment efficacy and prognostic category based on cytogenetics (favourable, intermediate and unfavourable) (p = 0.44, I(2 )= 0%). CONCLUSION: High-dose daunorubicin therapy could increase CR rate and improve long-term outcome for young patients with de novo AML.

It is most effective during the M phase of the cell-cycle and tends to cause synchronization in malignant cells lines. In this study, we investigated whether timed, sequential treatment based on the cell-cycle characteristics could be exploited to enhance the cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel. We characterized the cell-cycle properties of a rapidly multiplying cell line (Sp2, mouse myeloma cells) by propidium-iodide DNA staining such as the lengths of various cell cycle phases and population duplication time. Based on this we designed a paclitaxel treatment protocol that comprised a primary and a secondary, timed treatment. We found that the first paclitaxel treatment synchronized the cells at the G2/M phase but releasing the block by stopping the treatment allowed a large number of cells to enter the next cell-cycle by a synchronized manner. The second treatment was most effective during the time when these cells approached the next G2/M phase and was least effective when it occurred after the peak time of this next G2/M phase. Moreover, we found that after mixing Sp2 cells with another, significantly slower multiplying cell type (Jurkat human T-cell leukemia) at an initial ratio of 1:1, the ratio of the two different cell types could be influenced by timed sequential paclitaxel treatment at will. Our results demonstrate that knowledge of the cell-cycle parameters of a specific malignant cell type could improve the effectivity of the chemotherapy. Implementing timed chemotherapeutic treatments could increase the cytotoxicity on the malignant cells but also decrease the side-effects since other, non-malignant cell types will have different cell-cycle characteristic and be out of synch during the treatment.","['Fisi, Viktoria', 'Katai, Emese', 'Bogner, Peter', 'Miseta, Attila', 'Nagy, Tamas']","['Fisi V', 'Katai E', 'Bogner P', 'Miseta A', 'Nagy T']","['a Department of Laboratory Medicine , University of Pecs , Pecs , Hungary.', 'a Department of Laboratory Medicine , University of Pecs , Pecs , Hungary.', 'b Department of Radiology , University of Pecs , Pecs , Hungary.', 'a Department of Laboratory Medicine , University of Pecs , Pecs , Hungary.', 'a Department of Laboratory Medicine , University of Pecs , Pecs , Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Paclitaxel/*administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",2016/04/23 06:00,2017/06/20 06:00,['2016/04/23 06:00'],"['2016/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/20 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2016 May 2;15(9):1227-33. doi: 10.1080/15384101.2016.1158361.

Considering the nature of MDS and the poor outcomes of SCT when performed after confirming the progression of MDS to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), allogeneic SCT should be performed with caution in patients with low-risk MDS. METHODS: To address low-risk MDS, the Korean AML/MDS working party group designed a survey for 34 MDS experts in Korea on therapeutic HMA and allogeneic SCT policies for low-risk MDS. The level of consensus was defined as the percentage of agreement among the experts. RESULTS: With regard to the optimal time for allogeneic SCT for HMA responders with MDS-RA, 76% experts agreed that allogeneic SCT should be performed when a patient has a low platelet count. With regard to the relapse pattern that was most commonly found during HMA treatment in responding patients with MDS-RA, 54% experts agreed that the most common pattern that indicated HMA failure was the gradual worsening of cytopenia. CONCLUSION: The optimal time to perform allogeneic SCT in RA patients who achieved hematologic complete remission during HMA treatment is when the platelet count decreases. However, these suggestions need to be evaluated in larger future studies.

In PCL, clonal plasma cells comprise >/=20% of the peripheral blood (PB) leukocytes and/or the absolute clonal PB plasma cell count is >/=2x10(9)/L. Primary PCL (PPCL) originates de novo, whereas, secondary PCL (SPCL) evolves from pre-existing multiple myeloma. METHODS: Clinicohematological features, immunophenotypic profile, and survival of PCL patients were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Between January 2007 and December 2014, ten PPCL and four SPCL patients were investigated (8 PPCLs and 3 SPCLs had complete clinical data). All were North Indians, sharing common geography and ethnicity. Our cohort showed less frequent renal failure, more frequent hepatomegaly, and non-secretory type disease. In contrast to western literature, flow cytometric immunophenotyping of our cohort revealed altered expression of CD138 (67%), CD56 (33%), and CD20 (0%). With novel therapeutic agents, these PPCL patients had a median overall survival of 15 months. CONCLUSION: We highlight that our PPCL patients from North India had distinct clinicohematological and immunophenotypic profiles. The significance of our findings must be tested in a larger patient cohort and must be supported by molecular and cytogenetic investigations to unmask possible significant effects on pathogenesis.","['Bommannan, Karthik', 'Sachdeva, Man Updesh Singh', 'Malhotra, Pankaj', 'Kumar, Narender', 'Sharma, Prashant', 'Naseem, Shano', 'Ahluwalia, Jasmina', 'Das, Reena', 'Varma, Neelam', 'Prakash, Gaurav', 'Khadwal, Alka', 'Srinivasan, Radhika', 'Varma, Subhash']","['Bommannan K', 'Sachdeva MU', 'Malhotra P', 'Kumar N', 'Sharma P', 'Naseem S', 'Ahluwalia J', 'Das R', 'Varma N', 'Prakash G', 'Khadwal A', 'Srinivasan R', 'Varma S']","['Department of Hematolog, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematolog, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematolog, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematolog, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematolog, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematolog, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematolog, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematolog, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Cytopathology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,2016/04/23 06:00,2016/04/23 06:01,['2016/04/23 06:00'],"['2015/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/28 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/23 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Blood Res. 2016 Mar;51(1):23-30. doi: 10.5045/br.2016.51.1.23.

Owing to its rarity, neither pathogenesis nor standard treatment is established for this orphan disease. Hence, we tried to treat a patient with MCL based on the exome and transcriptome sequencing results of the patient's own DNA and RNA. METHODS: First, tumor DNA and RNA were extracted from bone marrow at the time of diagnosis. Germline DNA was extracted from the patient's saliva 45 days after induction chemotherapy and used as a control. Then, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) using the DNA and whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS) using the RNA. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were called using MuTect and GATK. Samtools, FusionMap, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were utilized to analyze WTS results. RESULTS: WES and WTS results revealed mutation in KIT S476I. Fusion analysis was performed using WTS data, which suggested a possible RARalpha-B2M fusion. When RNA expression analysis was performed using WTS data, upregulation of PIK3/AKT pathway, downstream of KIT and mTOR, was observed. Based on our WES and WTS results, we first administered all-trans retinoic acid, then dasatinib, and finally, an mTOR inhibitor. CONCLUSION: We present a case of orphan disease where we used a targeted approach using WES and WTS data of the patient. Even though our treatment was not successful, use of our approach warrants further validation.","['Youk, Jeonghwan', 'Koh, Youngil', 'Kim, Ji-Won', 'Kim, Dae-Yoon', 'Park, Hyunkyung', 'Jung, Woo June', 'Ahn, Kwang-Sung', 'Yun, Hongseok', 'Park, Inho', 'Sun, Choong-Hyun', 'Lee, Seungmook', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo']","['Youk J', 'Koh Y', 'Kim JW', 'Kim DY', 'Park H', 'Jung WJ', 'Ahn KS', 'Yun H', 'Park I', 'Sun CH', 'Lee S', 'Yoon SS']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.; Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Bioinformatics Group, Platform Development Center, CSP R&D, Samsung SDS, Seoul, Korea.', 'Bioinformatics Group, Platform Development Center, CSP R&D, Samsung SDS, Seoul, Korea.', 'Bioinformatics Group, Platform Development Center, CSP R&D, Samsung SDS, Seoul, Korea.', 'Bioinformatics Group, Platform Development Center, CSP R&D, Samsung SDS, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.; Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.; Clinical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,2016/04/23 06:00,2016/04/23 06:01,['2016/04/23 06:00'],"['2016/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/23 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Blood Res. 2016 Mar;51(1):17-22. doi: 10.5045/br.2016.51.1.17.

Treatment of HL-60 cells with various concentration of DPEP resulted in a sequence of events characteristic of apoptosis, including loss of cell viability, morphological changes, and increased sub-G1 DNA content. We demonstrated that DPEP elevates reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in HL-60 cells, and that the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) could block DPEP-induced ROS generation and apoptosis. Western blot analysis revealed that DPEP inhibits Bcl-xL expression, leading to caspase-3 activation and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, thereby inducing apoptosis. However, NAC pre-treatment significantly inhibited the activation of caspase-3 and PARP cleavage and reduced Bcl-xL levels.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has been used in several clinical trials for the treatment of nonpromyelocytic AML with limited clinical activity observed. FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) used as monotherapy also achieve limited clinical responses and are thus far unable to affect cure rates in AML patients. We explored the efficacy of combining ATRA and FLT3 TKIs to eliminate FLT3/internal tandem duplication (ITD)(+) LSCs. Our studies reveal highly synergistic drug activity, preferentially inducing apoptosis in FLT3/ITD(+) cell lines and patient samples. Colony-forming unit assays further demonstrate decreased clonogenicity of FLT3/ITD(+) cells upon treatment with ATRA and TKI. Most importantly, the drug combination depletes FLT3/ITD(+) LSCs in a genetic mouse model of AML, and prolongs survival of leukemic mice. Furthermore, engraftment of primary FLT3/ITD(+) patient samples is reduced in mice following treatment with FLT3 TKI and ATRA in combination, with evidence of cellular differentiation occurring in vivo. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that the synergism of ATRA and FLT3 TKIs is at least in part due to the observation that FLT3 TKI treatment upregulates the antiapoptotic protein Bcl6, limiting the drug's apoptotic effect. However, cotreatment with ATRA reduces Bcl6 expression to baseline levels through suppression of interleukin-6 receptor signaling. These studies provide evidence of the potential of this drug combination to eliminate FLT3/ITD(+) LSCs and reduce the rate of relapse in AML patients with FLT3 mutations.","['Ma, Hayley S', 'Greenblatt, Sarah M', 'Shirley, Courtney M', 'Duffield, Amy S', 'Bruner, J Kyle', 'Li, Li', 'Nguyen, Bao', 'Jung, Eric', 'Aplan, Peter D', 'Ghiaur, Gabriel', 'Jones, Richard J', 'Small, Donald']","['Ma HS', 'Greenblatt SM', 'Shirley CM', 'Duffield AS', 'Bruner JK', 'Li L', 'Nguyen B', 'Jung E', 'Aplan PD', 'Ghiaur G', 'Jones RJ', 'Small D']","['Department of Oncology and.', 'Department of Oncology and.', 'Department of Oncology and.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD;', 'Department of Oncology and.', 'Department of Oncology and.', 'Department of Oncology and.', 'MD Program, Penn State Hershey College of Medicine, Hershey, PA;', 'Laboratory of Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; and.', 'Department of Oncology and.', 'Department of Oncology and.', 'Department of Oncology and Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Sorafenib', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism']",2016/04/23 06:00,2017/08/09 06:00,['2016/04/23 06:00'],"['2015/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/09 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jun 9;127(23):2867-78. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-05-646786.

Lentiviral short hairpin RNA knockdown of Bim and CRISPR knockdown of Mcl-1 were used to confirm their role in resistance to ABT-199. JC-1 assays and flow cytometry were used to determine drug-induced apoptosis. RESULTS: Immunoprecipitation of Bim from ABT-199-treated cell lines and a primary patient sample demonstrated decreased association with Bcl-2, but increased association with Mcl-1 without corresponding change in mitochondrial outer membrane potential. ABT-199 treatment resulted in increased levels of Mcl-1 protein, unchanged or decreased Mcl-1 transcript levels, and increased Mcl-1 protein half-life, suggesting that the association with Bim plays a role in stabilizing Mcl-1 protein. Combining conventional chemotherapeutic agent cytarabine or daunorubicin with ABT-199 resulted in increased DNA damage along with decreased Mcl-1 protein levels, compared with ABT-199 alone, and synergistic induction of cell death in both AML cell lines and primary patient samples obtained from AML patients at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that sequestration of Bim by Mcl-1 is a mechanism of intrinsic ABT-199 resistance and supports the clinical development of ABT-199 in combination with cytarabine or daunorubicin for the treatment of AML.

The pro-apoptotic activities are inhibited by overexpression of the dominant DeltaNp73 isoform. The aim of this study was to detect the expression of the TAp73 and DeltaNp73 isoforms in Egyptian patients with malignant lymphoid neoplasms. Their expression was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 30 B-NHL patients, 24 T-NHL patients, 16 ALL patients, 18 CLL patients, 22 patients with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, and 6 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: ALL and CLL patients expressed both isoforms at higher levels compared to lymphoma patients. Higher expression of TAp73 was found in both B-NHL and T-NHL (around 4-fold and 16-fold, respectively) in comparison to DeltaNp73 (2-fold and 14-fold, respectively). In CLL patients both isoforms showed higher expression levels in comparison to normal peripheral blood lymphocytes controls: nearly 27-fold for TAp73 and 233-fold for DeltaNp73. All ALL patients showed higher expression of both studied isoforms than controls (9-fold for TAp73 and 386-fold for DeltaNp73). The highest DeltaNp73 expression along with a higher DeltaNp73/TAp73 ratio (67-fold) was found in ALL patients compared with CLL patients (21-fold). CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of lymphoma patients lacked the expression of either or both isoforms, while all lymphoid leukemia patients expressed both isoforms. The expression pattern differences of p73 isoforms may reflect differences in the biology of these malignancies.","['Hamdy, Mona Salah Al-Din', 'El-Saadany, Zainab Ali', 'Makhlouf, Manal Mohamed', 'Salama, Asmaa Ibrahim', 'Ibrahim, Nihal Salah', 'Gad, Alaa Amr']","['Hamdy MSA', 'El-Saadany ZA', 'Makhlouf MM', 'Salama AI', 'Ibrahim NS', 'Gad AA']","['Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo - Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo - Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo - Egypt.', 'Department of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo - Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo - Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo - Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,IM,"['Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Protein Isoforms/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Protein p73/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2016/10/30 06:00,2017/06/22 06:00,['2016/04/23 06:00'],"['2016/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Tumori. 2017 May 12;103(3):268-271. doi: 10.5301/tj.5000506.

The T315I mutation mediates resistance to imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib and bosutinib, whereas sensitivity to ponatinib remains. Mutation detection by conventional Sanger sequencing requires 10%-20% expansion of the mutated subclone. We studied the T315I mutation development by ultra-deep sequencing on the 454 XL+ platform (Roche) in comparison to Sanger sequencing. By ultra-deep sequencing, mutations were detected at loads of 1%-2%. We selected 40 patients who had failed first-line to third-line treatment (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib) and had high loads of the T315I mutation detected by Sanger sequencing. We confirmed T315I mutations by ultra-deep sequencing and investigated the mutation dynamics by backtracking earlier samples. In 20 of 40 patients, we identified the T315I three months (median) before Sanger sequencing detection limits were reached. To exclude sporadic low percentage mutation development without subsequent mutation outgrowth, we selected 42 patients without resistance mutations detected by Sanger sequencing but loss of major molecular response. Here, no mutation was detected by ultradeep sequencing. Additional non-T315I resistance mutations were found in 20 of 40 patients. Only 15% had two mutations per cell; the other cases showed multiple independently mutated clones and the T315I clone demonstrated a rapid outgrowth. In conclusion, T315I mutations could be detected earlier by ultra-deep sequencing compared to Sanger sequencing in a selected group of cases. Earlier mutation detection by ultra-deep sequencing might allow treatment to be changed before clonal increase of cells with the T315I mutation.","['Baer, Constance', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Koch, Sarah', 'Nadarajah, Niroshan', 'Schindela, Sonja', 'Meggendorfer, Manja', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Baer C', 'Kern W', 'Koch S', 'Nadarajah N', 'Schindela S', 'Meggendorfer M', 'Haferlach C', 'Haferlach T']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Germany torsten.haferlach@mll.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Clonal Evolution/drug effects/genetics', '*Codon', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/23 06:00,2017/07/08 06:00,['2016/04/23 06:00'],"['2016/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/08 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2016 Jul;101(7):830-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.145888.

Here we examined the potential effect of LukS-PV in differentiation of human leukemia cells and the underlying mechanism. We found that LukS-PV could induce differentiation of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, including AML cell lines and primary AML blasts, as determined by morphological changes, phagocytosis assay and expression of CD14 and CD11b surface antigens. In addition, LukS-PV activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and significantly upregulated the phosphorylation of c-JUN and c-FOS transcriptional factors in the process of differentiation. Inhibiting ERK pathway activation with U0126 (a MEK1/2 inhibitor) markedly blocked LukS-PV-induced differentiation and decreased the phosphorylation of c-JUN and c-FOS. These findings demonstrate an essential role for the ERK pathway together with c-JUN and c-FOS in the differentiation activity of LukS-PV. Taken together, our data suggest that LukS-PV could be a potential candidate as a differentiation-inducing agent for the therapeutic treatment of AML.","['Dai, Chunyang', 'Zhang, Chengfang', 'Sun, Xiaoxi', 'Pan, Qing', 'Peng, Jing', 'Shen, Jilong', 'Ma, Xiaoling']","['Dai C', 'Zhang C', 'Sun X', 'Pan Q', 'Peng J', 'Shen J', 'Ma X']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Anhui Provincial Laboratories of Pathogen Biology and Zoonoses, Department of Microbiology and Parasitology, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.

BMI1 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in a retrospective patient cohort consisting of 144 stage II colon cancer patients. BMI1 expression at the invasive front of the primary tumors correlated with mismatch repair status of the tumors. Furthermore, BMI1 expression at the luminal surface correlated with T-stage, tumor location, and the histological subtypes of the tumors. In a univariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, no statistical significant association between risk of relapse and BMI1 protein expression at the invasive front (HR: 1.12; 95% CI 0.78-1.60; p = 0.53) or at the luminal surface of the tumor (HR: 1.06; 95% CI 0.75-1.48; p = 0.70) was found.

NKp44 has three splice variants corresponding to NKp44ITIM+ (NKp44-1) and NKp44ITIM- (NKp44-2, and NKp44-3) isoforms. RNAseq data of AML patients revealed similar survival of NKp46+NKp44+ and NKp46+NKp44- patients. However, if grouped according to the NKp44 splice variant profile, NKp44-1 expression was significantly associated with poor survival of AML patients. Moreover, activation of PBMC from healthy controls showed co-dominant expression of NKp44-1 and NKp44-3, while primary NK clones show more diverse NKp44 splice variant profiles. Cultured primary NK cells resulted in NKp44-1 dominance and impaired function associated with PCNA over-expression by target cells. This impaired functional phenotype could be rescued by blocking of NKp44 receptor. Human NK cell lines revealed co-dominant expression of NKp44-1 and NKp44-3 and showed a functional phenotype that was not inhibited by PCNA over-expression. Furthermore, transfection-based overexpression of NKp44-1, but not NKp44-2/NKp44-3, reversed the endogenous resistance of NK-92 cells to PCNA-mediated inhibition, and resulted in poor formation of stable lytic immune synapses. This research contributes to the understanding of AML prognosis by shedding new light on the functional implications of differential splicing of NKp44.","['Shemesh, Avishai', 'Brusilovsky, Michael', 'Hadad, Uzi', 'Teltsh, Omri', 'Edri, Avishay', 'Rubin, Eitan', 'Campbell, Kerry S', 'Rosental, Benyamin', 'Porgador, Angel']","['Shemesh A', 'Brusilovsky M', 'Hadad U', 'Teltsh O', 'Edri A', 'Rubin E', 'Campbell KS', 'Rosental B', 'Porgador A']","['The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.', 'National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.', 'The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.', 'The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.', 'The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.', 'The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.', 'The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.', 'Immune Cell Development and Function Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine and the Hopkins Marine Station, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.', 'National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/*mortality', 'Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Survival Rate']",2016/04/23 06:00,2018/02/13 06:00,['2016/04/23 06:00'],"['2016/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/13 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 May 31;7(22):32933-45. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.8782.,10.18632/oncotarget.8782 [doi],,"['0 (NCR2 protein, human)', '0 (Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 2)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)']",PMC5078064,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'NKp44', 'isoforms', 'natural killer cells', 'splice variants']",['The authors have declared that no conflict of interest exists.'],"['8782 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.8782 [doi]']",,,['P30 CA006927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore investigated dysfunctional clonal T cells in MM and demonstrated immunosenescence but not exhaustion as a predominant feature. T-cell clones were detected in 75% of MM patients and their prognostic significance was revalidated in a new post-immunomodulatory drug cohort. The cells exhibited a senescent secretory effector phenotype: KLRG-1+/CD57+/CD160+/CD28-. Normal-for-age telomere lengths indicate that senescence is telomere independent and potentially reversible. p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase, p16 and p21 signalling pathways known to induce senescence were not elevated. Telomerase activity was found to be elevated and this may explain how normal telomere lengths are maintained in senescent cells. T-cell receptor signalling checkpoints were normal but elevated SMAD levels associated with T-cell inactivation were detected and may provide a potential target for the reversal of clonal T-cell dysfunction in MM. Low programmed death 1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 expression detected on T-cell clones infers that these cells are not exhausted but suggests that there would be a suboptimal response to immune checkpoint blockade in MM.

In addition to imatinib, 3 newer generation TKIs (NG-TKIs) have been approved as first-line treatment of chronic phase (CP)-CML. These have been preferably used in patients with CP-CML with a high Sokal or Hasford risk score. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the outcomes with NG-TKIs as a category versus imatinib in patients with newly diagnosed CP-CML and to indirectly compare the efficacy of NG-TKIs among each other. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of the risk scores on the complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The eligible studies were limited to randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of first-line treatment using NG-TKIs versus imatinib in adult patients (aged >/= 18 years) with CP-CML. RESULTS: The differences in the CCyR, progression-free survival, and overall survival between the NG-TKIs and imatinib were not statistically significant. NG-TKI-treated patients showed a significantly greater likelihood of MMR (relative risk [RR], 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.91; P = .003) and lower likelihood of progression to an accelerated phase/blast crisis (RR, 0.37; 95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.67; P = .001) than did imatinib-treated patients. Nilotinib, dasatinib, and radotinib showed significantly greater CCyR rates compared with bosutinib and ponatinib. All risk groups showed statistically equivalent benefits from NG-TKIs for the CCyR and MMR. CONCLUSION: In first-line treatment, the NG-TKIs as a category showed greater effectiveness in MMR and prevention of accelerated phase/blast crisis progression. Risk stratification was not found to affect the RR of CCyR and MMR.","['Yun, Seongseok', 'Vincelette, Nicole D', 'Segar, Jennifer M', 'Dong, Yimin', 'Shen, Yang', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Abraham, Ivo']","['Yun S', 'Vincelette ND', 'Segar JM', 'Dong Y', 'Shen Y', 'Kim DW', 'Abraham I']","['Department of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ; Hematology and Oncology, H.

Both are selected via thymocyte-thymocyte interaction, and they contribute to the generation of activated/memory-like CD4 and CD8 T cells in the thymus via the production of IL-4. Here, we investigated whether PLZF(+) innate T cells also affect the development and function of Foxp3(+) regulatory CD4 T cells. Flow cytometry analysis of the thymus and spleen from both CIITA transgenic C57BL/6 and wild-type BALB/c mice, which have abundant PLZF(+) CD4 T cells and invariant natural killer T cells, respectively, revealed that Foxp3(+) T cells in these mice exhibited a CD103(+) activated/memory-like phenotype. The frequency of CD103(+) regulatory T cells was considerably decreased in PLZF(+) cell-deficient CIITA(Tg)Plzf(lu/lu) and BALB/c.CD1d(-/-) mice as well as in an IL-4-deficient background, such as in CIITA(Tg)IL-4(-/-) and BALB/c.lL-4(-/-) mice, indicating that the acquisition of an activated/memory-like phenotype was dependent on PLZF(+) innate T cells and IL-4. Using fetal thymic organ culture, we further demonstrated that IL-4 in concert with TGF-beta enhanced the acquisition of the activated/memory-like phenotype of regulatory T cells. In functional aspects, the activated/memory-like phenotype of Treg cells was directly related to their suppressive function; regulatory T cells of CIITA(Tg)PIV(-/-) mice more efficiently suppressed ovalbumin-induced allergic airway inflammation compared with their counterparts from wild-type mice. All of these findings suggest that PLZF(+) innate T cells also augmented the generation of activated/memory-like regulation via IL-4 production.","['Kang, Byung Hyun', 'Park, Hyo Jin', 'Park, Hi Jung', 'Lee, Jae-Ii', 'Park, Seong Hoe', 'Jung, Kyeong Cheon']","['Kang BH', 'Park HJ', 'Park HJ', 'Lee JI', 'Park SH', 'Jung KC']","['Postgraduate Course of Translational Medicine, Medical Research Center, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical Research Center, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Sungnam 13620, Korea.', 'Postgraduate Course of Translational Medicine, Medical Research Center, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Postgraduate Course of Translational Medicine, Medical Research Center, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Transplantation Research Institute, Medical Research Center, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Postgraduate Course of Translational Medicine, Medical Research Center, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Transplantation Research Institute, Medical Research Center, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Postgraduate Course of Translational Medicine, Medical Research Center, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical Research Center, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Transplantation Research Institute, Medical Research Center, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul 03080, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Interleukin-4/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/immunology', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Phenotype', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Spleen/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/embryology/*immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism']",2016/04/23 06:00,2017/03/11 06:00,['2016/04/23 06:00'],"['2016/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/11 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Mol Cells. 2016 Jun 30;39(6):468-76. doi: 10.14348/molcells.2016.0004.

The natural rotenoid deguelin has been shown to induce apoptosis in several cancer cells and cell lines, including primary human CLL cells, and to act as a chemopreventive agent in animal models of induced carcinogenesis. In this work, we show that deguelin induces apoptosis in vitro in primary human CLL cells and in CLL-like cells from the New Zealand Black (NZB) mouse strain. In both of them, deguelin dowregulates AKT, NFkappaB and several downstream antiapoptotic proteins (XIAP, cIAP, BCL2, BCL-XL and survivin), activating the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Moreover, deguelin inhibits stromal cell-mediated c-Myc upregulation and resistance to fludarabine, increasing fludarabine induced DNA damage. We further show that deguelin has activity in vivo against NZB CLL-like cells in an experimental model of CLL in young NZB mice transplanted with spleen cells from aged NZB mice with lymphoproliferation. Moreover, the combination of deguelin and fludarabine in this model prolonged the survival of transplanted mice at doses of both compounds that were ineffective when administered individually. These results suggest deguelin could have potential for the treatment of human CLL.","['Rebolleda, Nerea', 'Losada-Fernandez, Ignacio', 'Perez-Chacon, Gema', 'Castejon, Raquel', 'Rosado, Silvia', 'Morado, Marta', 'Vallejo-Cremades, Maria Teresa', 'Martinez, Andrea', 'Vargas-Nunez, Juan A', 'Perez-Aciego, Paloma']","['Rebolleda N', 'Losada-Fernandez I', 'Perez-Chacon G', 'Castejon R', 'Rosado S', 'Morado M', 'Vallejo-Cremades MT', 'Martinez A', 'Vargas-Nunez JA', 'Perez-Aciego P']","['Fundacion LAIR, Madrid, Spain.', 'Fundacion LAIR, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas ""Alberto Sols"", CSIC-UAM, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Medicina Interna, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda, IDIPHIM, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Medicina Interna, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda, IDIPHIM, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Laboratorio de Imagen, Plataforma Apoyo a la Investigacion, IdiPaz, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Fundacion LAIR, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Medicina Interna, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda, IDIPHIM, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.', 'Fundacion LAIR, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred NZB', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Rotenone/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2016/04/23 06:00,2017/04/06 06:00,['2016/04/22 06:00'],"['2015/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Apr 21;11(4):e0154159. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0154159. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0154159 [doi],20160421,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '03L9OT429T (Rotenone)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'K5Z93K66IE (deguelin)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",PMC4839760,,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0154159 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-43430 [pii]']",,,,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4819-5890'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, we showed that RAF-1 was activated and the blockade of RAF-1 activation attenuated MEK/ERK activation as well as ATRA-induced differentiation. ATRA-enhanced protein levels of C/EBPbeta, C/EBPepsilon and PU.1, which were required for differentiation in APL cells, were suppressed by the specific inhibitor of MEK. However, MEK inhibition had no effect on the degradation of PML-RARalpha fusion protein or the restoration of PML nuclear bodies by ATRA treatment.

Due to concerns regarding infection and bleeding risk as well as significant transfusion and supportive care requirements, patients have historically remained in the hospital until blood count recovery-a period of approximately 30 days. The rising cost of AML care has prompted physicians to reconsider this practice, and a number of small studies have suggested the safety and feasibility of providing outpatient supportive care to patients following intensive AML (re-) induction therapy. Potential benefits include a significant reduction of healthcare costs, improvement in quality of life, and decreased risk of hospital-acquired infections. In this article, we will review the currently available literature regarding this practice and discuss questions to be addressed in future studies.

In addition, relapsed ALL has a poor outcome with 5-year survival as low as 7 %. Hence, there is a need to develop effective therapies to treat relapsed disease and to combine these agents with chemotherapy to improve outcomes in newly diagnosed patients. ALL cells express several antigens amenable to target therapies including CD19, CD20, CD22, and CD52. Over the last decade, there has been a surge in the development of immune therapies which target these receptors and that have induced robust responses. In this manuscript, we review these novel immune agents in the treatment of B-ALL. As these new therapies mature, the challenge going forward will be to find safe and effective combinations of these agents with chemotherapy and to determine their place in the current treatment schema.","['Dias, Ajoy', 'Kenderian, Saad J', 'Westin, Gustavo F', 'Litzow, Mark R']","['Dias A', 'Kenderian SJ', 'Westin GF', 'Litzow MR']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.

Both compounds demonstrated selective unique multi-log differential patterns of activity, with GI50 values in the sub-micro molar range against cancer cells rather than normal cardiac cells. NSC757963 showed high selectivity towards the leukemia subpanel. Activities of both compounds strongly correlated to expression of NFKB1 and CSNK2B genes, implying that they may inhibit the NF-kappaB pathway. Immunocytochemical microscopy of OVCAR-3 cells showed clear cytosolic accumulation of the NF-kappaB p65 subunit following treatment. Western blotting showed dose dependent inhibition of the nuclear expression of the NF-kappaB p65 subunit with subsequent accumulation in the cytosol following treatment. Docking experiments showed binding of both compounds to the NF-kappaB activator IKKbeta subunit preventing its translocation to the nucleus. Collectively, these results confirm the ability of our compounds to inhibit the constitutively active NF-kappaB pathway of OVCAR-3 cells. Furthermore, COMPARE analysis indicated that the activity of NSC757963 is similar to the antituberculosis agent rifamycin SV, this was confirmed by testing the antimycobacterial activity of NSC757963 against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, results revealed potent activity suitable for use in clinical practice. Molecular properties and Lipinski's parameters predicted acceptable bioavailability properties with no indication of mutagenicity, tumorigenicity, irritability and reproductive effects. Oral absorption experiments using the human Caco-2 model showed high intestinal absorption of NSC745885 by passive transport mechanism with no intestinal efflux or active transport mechanisms. The unique molecular characterization as well as the illustrated anticancer spectra of activity and bioavailability properties warrant further development of our compounds and present a foundation brick in the pre-clinical investigations to implement such compounds in clinical practice.","['Ali, Ahmed Atef Ahmed', 'Lee, Yu-Ru', 'Chen, Tsung-Chih', 'Chen, Chun-Liang', 'Lee, Chia-Chung', 'Shiau, Chia-Yang', 'Chiang, Chiao-Hsi', 'Huang, Hsu-Shan']","['Ali AA', 'Lee YR', 'Chen TC', 'Chen CL', 'Lee CC', 'Shiau CY', 'Chiang CH', 'Huang HS']","['Molecular and Cell Biology, Taiwan International Graduate Program, Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute for Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute for Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute for Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute for Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Molecular and Cell Biology, Taiwan International Graduate Program, Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute for Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Antitubercular Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Biological Availability', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Intestinal Absorption/drug effects', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis/drug effects/growth & development', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thiadiazoles/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor RelA/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2016/04/23 06:00,2017/03/17 06:00,['2016/04/22 06:00'],"['2015/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/17 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Apr 21;11(4):e0154278. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0154278. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0154278 [doi],20160421,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antitubercular Agents)', '0 (RELA protein, human)', '0 (Thiadiazoles)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",PMC4839570,,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0154278 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-46617 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report the consequences of functional impairment of GABP in human hematopoietic and in leukemic stem/progenitor cells. Ectopic overexpression of a dominant-negative acting GABP mutant led to impaired myeloid differentiation of CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells obtained from healthy donors. Moreover, drastically reduced clonogenic capacity of leukemic stem/progenitor cells isolated from bone marrow aspirates of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients underlines the importance of GABP on stem/progenitor cell maintenance and confirms the relevance of GABP for human myelopoiesis in healthy and diseased states.","['Manukjan, Georgi', 'Ripperger, Tim', 'Venturini, Letizia', 'Stadler, Michael', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Schambach, Axel', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Steinemann, Doris']","['Manukjan G', 'Ripperger T', 'Venturini L', 'Stadler M', 'Gohring G', 'Schambach A', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Steinemann D']","['Institute of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.

Hyperfractionated radiation therapy (HFX) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was randomized against conventionally fractionated radiation therapy (CFX) in the DFCI 87-01/91-01 trials attempting to minimize these effects. When neurocognitive testing 8-year posttreatment demonstrated no difference, this strategy was abandoned. The objective of this study was to evaluate late social outcomes among patients who received HFX compared to CFX as part of the DFCI 87-01/91-01 trials. METHODS: This retrospective chart review examined all patients treated according to the DFCI 87-01/91-01 trials at the McMaster Children's Hospital in Hamilton, Canada. Patients <18 years at diagnosis and who have attended follow-up clinic since January 1, 2000 were included in this study. Social outcomes and IQ test results were examined for trends. Demographics and outcomes were presented with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: We identified 57 DFCI 87-01/91-01 trial participants: 14 received HFX, 29 received CFX, and 14 received no radiation. There were no demographic differences between the groups. HFX survivors were more likely to be living independently (64% vs. 28%, P = 0.02) and engaged in long-term relationships (57% vs. 25%, P = 0.04) than CFX. Nonsignificant trends suggested that HFX survivors may be more financially independent, employed full-time, had fewer educational difficulties in school, and higher scores on neuropsychological testing. Data trends, although not significant, persisted in logistic regression analysis when accounting for age.

27099895,,Publisher,,,,,,2016 Apr,,,"BACKGROUND: In the UK almost 7000 people are diagnosed with leukaemia each year, but despite continuing advances in diagnosis and treatment with new drugs, such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the majority of these patients will eventually die from their disease. Until quite recently, the only treatment to offer the possibility of long-term disease-free survival was allogeneic stem cell transplantation. However, this carries a substantial risk of mortality and is available to only a minority of patients. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that molecular and clinical responses, induced by T lymphocytes (T cells), can be predicted by increases in the number of CD8+ (cluster of differentiation 8-positive) T cells specific for the vaccine-encoded T-cell epitopes. This project also aimed to build on the established programme of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fusion-gene vaccination delivered by intramuscular injection, exploiting a unique experience with electroporation, to induce durable immune responses with the aim of controlling disease by precision attack of the tumour by CD8+ T cells. METHOD: A non-randomised, open-label, single-dose-level Phase II clinical trial in two patient groups [chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)] on stable doses of imatinib. Human leucocyte antigen A2-positive (HLA A2+) patients were vaccinated with two DNA vaccines: (1) p.DOM-WT1-37 (epitope sequence: VLDFAPPGA); and (2) p.DOM-WT1-126 (epitope sequence: RMFPNAPYL). The HLA A2-negative patients formed an unvaccinated control group. The sample size for the HLA A2+ group was originally determined following Simon's optimal Phase II trial design (Simon R. Optimal two-stage designs for phase II clinical trials. Control Clin Trials 1989;10:1-10). This was changed to A'Hern's single-stage design during the course of the trial (A'Hern RP. Sample size tables for single-stage phase II designs. Stat Med 2001;20:859-66), which was endorsed by the trial's independent oversight committees. RESULTS: The study included 12 patients with CML who were vaccinated and nine patients with CML who were unvaccinated as the control group. Both the vaccines and the electroporation were safe, with no new or unexpected toxicities. The evaluation adverse events of special interest (heart, bone marrow, renal) did not reveal safety concerns. Two BCR-ABL (breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukaemia viral oncogene homolog 1) responses were observed, both of which were defined as a major response, with one in each group. Two Wilms' tumour antigen 1 (WT1) molecular responses were observed in the vaccinated group and one was observed in the control group. At an immunological level, the vaccine performed as expected. CONCLUSIONS: The study met its primary decision-making target with one major molecular response in BCR-ABL transcript levels. Overall, the data showed, in this clinical setting, the immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine. LIMITATIONS: The study did not complete recruitment and there were multiple hurdles that contributed to this failure. This is disappointing given the robust induction immune responses against WT1 T-cell responses in 7 out of 10 evaluable patients. FUTURE WORK: Evaluation of the p.DOM-WT1 vaccines in AML remains attractive clinically, but it is unlikely to be feasible at this time. Combination of the DNA vaccine approach with strategies to expand T-cell responses with immunomodulatory antibodies is in development. FUNDING DETAILS: This project was funded by the Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation (EME) programme, a Medical Research Council (MRC) and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) partnership, and Bloodwise.","['Ottensmeier, Christian', 'Bowers, Megan', 'Hamid, Debbie', 'Maishman, Tom', 'Regan, Scott', 'Wood, Wendy', 'Cazaly, Angelica', 'Stanton, Louise']","['Ottensmeier C', 'Bowers M', 'Hamid D', 'Maishman T', 'Regan S', 'Wood W', 'Cazaly A', 'Stanton L']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book']",Southampton (UK),,,,,,2016/04/22 06:00,2016/04/22 06:00,,,,,10.3310/eme03030 [doi],,,,,,,"['NBK355745 [bookaccession]', '10.3310/eme03030 [doi]']",,"[""Copyright (c) Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

The results of MRD testing are used to reclassify these patients and guide changes in treatment according to their future risk of relapse. We conducted a systematic review of the economic literature, cost-effectiveness analysis, and budget-impact analysis to ascertain the cost-effectiveness and economic impact of MRD testing by flow cytometry for management of childhood precursor B-cell ALL in Ontario. METHODS: A systematic literature search (1998-2014) identified studies that examined the incremental cost-effectiveness of MRD testing by either flow cytometry or PCR. We developed a lifetime state-transition (Markov) microsimulation model to quantify the cost-effectiveness of MRD testing followed by risk-directed therapy to no MRD testing and to estimate its marginal effect on health outcomes and on costs. Model input parameters were based on the literature, expert opinion, and data from the Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario Networked Information System. Using predictions from our Markov model, we estimated the 1-year cost burden of MRD testing versus no testing and forecasted its economic impact over 3 and 5 years. RESULTS: In a base-case cost-effectiveness analysis, compared with no testing, MRD testing by flow cytometry at the end of induction and consolidation was associated with an increased discounted survival of 0.0958 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and increased discounted costs of $4,180, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $43,613/QALY gained. After accounting for parameter uncertainty, incremental cost-effectiveness of MRD testing was associated with an ICER of $50,249/QALY gained. In the budget-impact analysis, the 1-year cost expenditure for MRD testing by flow cytometry in newly diagnosed patients with precursor B-cell ALL was estimated at $340,760. We forecasted that the province would have to pay approximately $1.3 million over 3 years and $2.4 million over 5 years for MRD testing by flow cytometry in this population. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with no testing, MRD testing by flow cytometry in newly diagnosed patients with precursor B-cell ALL represents good value for money at commonly used willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY.",,,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",Canada,Ont Health Technol Assess Ser,Ontario health technology assessment series,101521610,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Flow Cytometry/*economics', 'Humans', '*Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/economics', 'Ontario', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*economics/pathology', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years']",2016/04/22 06:00,2017/01/06 06:00,['2016/04/22 06:00'],"['2016/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/06 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Ont Health Technol Assess Ser. 2016 Mar 8;16(8):1-83. eCollection 2016.,,20160308,,PMC4808717,,,,,,,,,,['Health Quality Ontario'],,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Gajic-Veljanoski O', 'Pham B', 'Pechlivanoglou P', 'Krahn M', 'Higgins C', 'Bielecki J']","['Gajic-Veljanoski, O', 'Pham, B', 'Pechlivanoglou, P', 'Krahn, M', 'Higgins, Caroline', 'Bielecki, Joanna']",

Identification of prognostic factors that allow risk stratification and tailored treatment have improved overall survival. However, nearly a quarter of patients considered standard risk on the basis of conventional prognostic factors still relapse, and relapse is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Relapse is thought to result from extremely low levels of leukemic cells left over once complete remission is reached, termed minimal residual disease (MRD). Poor event-free survival (EFS) as well as overall survival for those who are classified as MRD-positive have been substantiated in seminal studies demonstrating the prognostic value of MRD for EFS in the past few decades. This review sought to further elucidate the relationship between MRD and EFS by looking at relapse, the primary determinant of EFS and the biological mechanism through which MRD is thought to act. This evidence review aimed to ascertain whether MRD is an independent prognostic factor for relapse and to assess the effect of MRD-directed treatment on patient-important outcomes in childhood ALL. METHODS: Large prospective cohort studies with a priori multivariable analysis that includes potential confounders are required to draw confirmatory conclusions about the independence of a prognostic factor. Data on the prognostic value of MRD for relapse measured by molecular methods (polymerase chain reaction [PCR] of immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor rearrangements) or flow cytometry for leukemia-associated immunophenotypes or difference-from-normal approach were abstracted from included studies. Relevant data on relapse, EFS, and overall survival were abstracted from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of MRD-directed treatment. RESULTS: A total of 2,832 citations were reviewed, of which 12 studies were included in this review. All cohort studies evaluating MRD as a prognostic factor for relapse found significant independent value when added to various existing prognostic factors. Seven studies showed prognostic value of MRD measured at the end of induction therapy and two at the end of consolidation therapy in de novo ALL, one study in relapsed ALL after re-induction therapy, and three studies before hematopoietic stem cell transplant. One large RCT in standard-risk patients found no compromise to outcomes when reducing treatment in MRD-negative patients, and also showed a 45% reduction in relapse risk and nearly 40% benefit in EFS when escalating treatment in MRD-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Minimal residual disease is an independent prognostic factor for relapse in childhood ALL. Relapse is a key determinant of EFS and patients' quality of life.

METHODS: Two hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, HepG2 and SMMC-7721, were selected. ABT-737 and NCTD were allocated into groups to be used alone or in combination. HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells were cultured in vitro. Liver cancer cells in the logarithmic phase of growth were vaccinated and cultured to the cell wall stage; these cells were treated for 48 h with different concentrations of NCTD, or ABT-737, or NCTD combined with ABT-737. The cell proliferation inhibition rate was detected by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium. The expression of Mcl in HCC cells was detected by Western Blotting, and the cells in each group after treatment had apoptosis detected by flow cytometry. The proliferation inhibition rate, the expression of Mcl-1 in cells and the apoptosis inducing effect of treatment were observed in each group, and the effect of NCTD on ABT-737 in the treatment of HCC and its mechanism of action were analyzed. RESULTS: As the concentration of NCTD increased, the cell proliferation inhibition rate gradually decreased; and the treatment effect of ABT-737 1-3 mum combined with NCTD on cell proliferation inhibition was stronger than that of ABT-737 alone. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). In observing the expression of Mcl-1 in cells after the treatment of different concentrations of NCTD, this was partially inhibited after treatment with NCTD 15 mum, and the expression of Mcl-1 was almost undetectable after treatment with NCTD 30 mum and 60 mum. The effect on inducing apoptosis with the treatment of ABT-737 or NCTD alone for 48 h was lower than that of the control group. The difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05).

During herpesvirus infection, these antiviral proteins are independently recruited to nuclear domains that contain infecting viral genomes to cooperatively promote viral genome silencing. Central to the execution of this particular antiviral response is the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) signaling pathway. However, the participating SUMOylation enzymes are not fully characterized. We identify the SUMO ligase protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (PIAS1) as a constituent PML-NB protein. We show that PIAS1 localizes at PML-NBs in a SUMO interaction motif (SIM)-dependent manner that requires SUMOylated or SUMOylation-competent PML. Following infection with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), PIAS1 is recruited to nuclear sites associated with viral genome entry in a SIM-dependent manner, consistent with the SIM-dependent recruitment mechanisms of other well-characterized PML-NB proteins. In contrast to that of Daxx and Sp100, however, the recruitment of PIAS1 is enhanced by PML. PIAS1 promotes the stable accumulation of SUMO1 at nuclear sites associated with HSV-1 genome entry, whereas the accumulation of other evaluated PML-NB proteins occurs independently of PIAS1. We show that PIAS1 cooperatively contributes to HSV-1 restriction through mechanisms that are additive to those of PML and cooperative with those of PIAS4. The antiviral mechanisms of PIAS1 are counteracted by ICP0, the HSV-1 SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase, which disrupts the recruitment of PIAS1 to nuclear domains that contain infecting HSV-1 genomes through mechanisms that do not directly result in PIAS1 degradation. IMPORTANCE: Adaptive, innate, and intrinsic immunity cooperatively and efficiently restrict the propagation of viral pathogens. Intrinsic immunity mediated by constitutively expressed cellular proteins represents the first line of intracellular defense against infection. PML-NB constituent proteins mediate aspects of intrinsic immunity to restrict herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) as well as other viruses. These proteins repress viral replication through mechanisms that rely on SUMO signaling. However, the participating SUMOylation enzymes are not known. We identify the SUMO ligase PIAS1 as a constituent PML-NB antiviral protein. This finding distinguishes a SUMO ligase that may mediate signaling events important in PML-NB-mediated intrinsic immunity. Moreover, this research complements the recent identification of PIAS4 as an intrinsic antiviral factor, supporting a role for PIAS proteins as both positive and negative regulators of host immunity to virus infection.","['Brown, James R', 'Conn, Kristen L', 'Wasson, Peter', 'Charman, Matthew', 'Tong, Lily', 'Grant, Kyle', 'McFarlane, Steven', 'Boutell, Chris']","['Brown JR', 'Conn KL', 'Wasson P', 'Charman M', 'Tong L', 'Grant K', 'McFarlane S', 'Boutell C']","['MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom chris.boutell@glasgow.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Fibroblasts/virology', 'Foreskin', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genome, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*immunology', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Male', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT/genetics/*metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/chemistry/metabolism', 'SUMO-1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sumoylation', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Internalization', 'Virus Replication']",2016/04/22 06:00,2017/05/11 06:00,['2016/04/22 06:00'],"['2016/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,J Virol. 2016 Jun 10;90(13):5939-5952. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00426-16.

However, the function and mechanisms of individual miRs in regulating spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) homeostasis remain unclear. In the present study, we report for the first time that miR-224 is highly expressed in mouse SSCs. Functional assays using miRNA mimics and inhibitors reveal that miR-224 is essential for differentiation of SSCs. Mechanistically, miR-224 promotes differentiation of SSCs via targeting doublesex and Mab-3-related transcription factor 1 (DMRT1). Moreover, WNT/beta-catenin signalling pathway is involved in miR-224-mediated regulation of SSCs self-renewal. We further demonstrate that miR-224 overexpression increases the expression of GFRalpha1 and PLZF, accompanied by the down-regulation of DMRT1 in mouse testes. Our findings provide novel insights into molecular mechanisms regulating differentiation of SSCs and may have important implications for regulating male reproduction.","['Cui, Na', 'Hao, Guimin', 'Zhao, Zhiming', 'Wang, Feng', 'Cao, Jinfeng', 'Yang, Aimin']","['Cui N', 'Hao G', 'Zhao Z', 'Wang F', 'Cao J', 'Yang A']","['Department of Reproduction, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Department of Reproduction, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Department of Reproduction, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Department of Reproduction, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Department of Reproduction, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Self Renewal/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Spermatogonia/*cytology', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Testis/cytology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/genetics']",2016/04/22 06:00,2017/07/08 06:00,['2016/04/22 06:00'],"['2016/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/08 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2016 Aug;20(8):1503-12. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.12838.

We report a prospective randomized study, designed to compare single- vs double-UCB transplantation in children and young adults with acute leukemia in remission or myelodysplasia. Eligible patients had at least two 4-6 HLA-identical UCBs with >3 x 10(7) nucleated cells/kg for the first and >1.5 x 10(7) for the second. The primary end point was the 2-year cumulative incidence of transplantation strategy failure, a composite end point including transplant-related mortality (TRM), engraftment failure, and autologous recovery. Randomized patients who did not proceed to transplantation due to refractory disease were considered transplantation failures. A total of 151 patients were randomized and included in the intent-to-treat analysis; 137 were transplanted. Double-UCB transplantation did not decrease transplantation strategy failure (23.4% +/- 4.9% vs 14.9% +/- 4.2%). Two-year posttransplant survival, disease-free survival, and TRM were 68.8% +/- 6.0%, 67.6% +/- 6.0%, and 5.9% +/- 2.9% after single-unit transplantation compared with 74.8% +/- 5.5%, 68.1% +/- 6.0%, and 11.6% +/- 3.9% after double-unit transplantation. The final relapse risk did not significantly differ, but relapses were delayed after double-unit transplantation. Overall incidences of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were similar, but chronic GVHD was more frequently extensive after double-UCB transplantation (31.9% +/- 5.7% vs 14.7% +/- 4.3%, P = .02). In an exploratory subgroup analysis, we found a significantly lower relapse risk after double-unit transplantation in patients receiving total body irradiation without antithymocyte globulin (ATG), whereas the relapse risk was similar in the group treated with busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and ATG. Single-UCB transplantation with adequate cell dose remains the standard of care and leads to low TRM. Double-unit transplantation should be reserved for patients who lack such units.

Such mutations are associated with a poor prognosis and a high propensity to relapse after remission. FLT3 inhibitors are being developed as targeted therapy for FLT3-ITD(+) acute myeloid leukemia; however, their use is complicated by rapid development of resistance, which illustrates the need for additional therapeutic targets. We show that the US Food and Drug Administration-approved CDK4/6 kinase inhibitor palbociclib induces apoptosis of FLT3-ITD leukemic cells. The effect is specific for FLT3-mutant cells and is ascribed to the transcriptional activity of CDK6: CDK6 but not its functional homolog CDK4 is found at the promoters of the FLT3 and PIM1 genes, another important leukemogenic driver. There CDK6 regulates transcription in a kinase-dependent manner. Of potential clinical relevance, combined treatment with palbociclib and FLT3 inhibitors results in synergistic cytotoxicity. Simultaneously targeting two critical signaling nodes in leukemogenesis could represent a therapeutic breakthrough, leading to complete remission and overcoming resistance to FLT3 inhibitors.","['Uras, Iris Z', 'Walter, Gina J', 'Scheicher, Ruth', 'Bellutti, Florian', 'Prchal-Murphy, Michaela', 'Tigan, Anca S', 'Valent, Peter', 'Heidel, Florian H', 'Kubicek, Stefan', 'Scholl, Claudia', 'Frohling, Stefan', 'Sexl, Veronika']","['Uras IZ', 'Walter GJ', 'Scheicher R', 'Bellutti F', 'Prchal-Murphy M', 'Tigan AS', 'Valent P', 'Heidel FH', 'Kubicek S', 'Scholl C', 'Frohling S', 'Sexl V']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria;', 'Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases and German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany; German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany;', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria;', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria;', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria;', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria;', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, and Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria;', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Center for Internal Medicine II, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany;', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria; and.', 'Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases and German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany; German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany;', 'Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases and German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany; German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany; Section for Personalized Oncology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria;']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/metabolism/*physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism']",2016/04/22 06:00,2017/08/09 06:00,['2016/04/22 06:00'],"['2015/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/09 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jun 9;127(23):2890-902. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-11-683581.

As AML is lethal in dogs, we defined global DNA methylation content, and screened the C-terminal domain of DNMT3 family of genes for sequence variants in 39 canine acute myeloid leukaemia (cAML) cases. A heterogeneous pattern of DNA methylation was found among cAML samples, with subsets of cases being hypermethylated or hypomethylated compared with healthy controls; four recurrent single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were found in DNMT3L gene. Although SNVs were not directly correlated to whole genome DNA methylation levels, all hypomethylated cAML cases were homozygous for the deleterious mutation at p.Arg222Trp. This study contributes to understand genetic modifications of cAML, leading up to studies that will elucidate the role of methylome alterations in the pathogenesis of AML in dogs.","['Bronzini, I', 'Aresu, L', 'Paganin, M', 'Marchioretto, L', 'Comazzi, S', 'Cian, F', 'Riondato, F', 'Marconato, L', 'Martini, V', 'Te Kronnie, G']","['Bronzini I', 'Aresu L', 'Paganin M', 'Marchioretto L', 'Comazzi S', 'Cian F', 'Riondato F', 'Marconato L', 'Martini V', 'Te Kronnie G']","[""Oncohematology Laboratory, Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", 'Department of Comparative Biomedicine and Food Science, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', ""Oncohematology Laboratory, Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", 'Department of Cellular Biotechnology and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Veterinary Science and Public Health, University of Milan, Milano, Italy.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Veterinary Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Centro Oncologico Veterinario, Sasso Marconi, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Veterinary Science and Public Health, University of Milan, Milano, Italy.', ""Oncohematology Laboratory, Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Vet Comp Oncol,Veterinary and comparative oncology,101185242,IM,"['Animals', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dog Diseases/*genetics', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/veterinary', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*veterinary', 'Male']",2016/04/22 06:00,2018/01/18 06:00,['2016/04/22 06:00'],"['2015/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/11 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vet Comp Oncol. 2017 Sep;15(3):910-918. doi: 10.1111/vco.12231.

Over the past decade, scientific discovery has revealed dozens of prognostic gene mutations for AML while sequencing costs have plummeted. In this study, we compared the cost-effectiveness of multigene integrative analysis (genomic analysis) with the standard molecular testing currently used for diagnosis of intermediate-risk AML. We used a decision analytic model with data for costs and outcomes from British Columbia, Canada, to assess the long-term (10-year) economic impacts. Our results suggest that genomic analysis would result in a 26% increase in the use of first-remission allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The resulting treatment decisions and downstream effects would come at an additional cost of $12 556 [2013 Canadian dollars (CAD)] per person and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio would be $49 493 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Cost-effectiveness was dependent on quality of life during the long-term (5-10) years of survival, relapse rates following first-remission chemotherapy and the upfront cost of transplantation. Non-relapse mortality rates, short-term quality of life and the cost of genomic sequencing had only minor impacts. Further research on post-remission outcomes can lead to improvements in the cost-effectiveness of curative treatments for AML.","['Cressman, Sonya', 'Karsan, Aly', 'Hogge, Donna E', 'McPherson, Emily', 'Bolbocean, Corneliu', 'Regier, Dean A', 'Peacock, Stuart J']","['Cressman S', 'Karsan A', 'Hogge DE', 'McPherson E', 'Bolbocean C', 'Regier DA', 'Peacock SJ']","['Canadian Centre for Applied Research in Cancer Control (ARCC), Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Cancer Control, BC Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Centre for Clinical Genomics, Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Cancer Genetics Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratories, British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Leukemia Bone Marrow Transplant Program of BC, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Canadian Centre for Applied Research in Cancer Control (ARCC), Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Cancer Control, BC Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Canadian Centre for Applied Research in Cancer Control (ARCC), Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Cancer Control, BC Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'School of Population and Public Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Canadian Centre for Applied Research in Cancer Control (ARCC), Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Cancer Control, BC Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'School of Population and Public Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Canadian Centre for Applied Research in Cancer Control (ARCC), Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Cancer Control, BC Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Canada', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', '*Decision Support Techniques', 'Genomics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/economics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*economics', 'Middle Aged', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/22 06:00,2017/06/03 06:00,['2016/04/22 06:00'],"['2015/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2016 Aug;174(4):526-35. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14076.

CAR-modified T cells directed against CD19 have led the way, setting a high standard with remission rates as high as 90 % in clinical trials for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Yet, the first demonstration of efficacy was in another disease, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), in which CD19-targeted CAR T cells eradicated bulky, highly refractory disease. Despite early encouraging results, clinical trials in CLL have yielded lower response rates, revealing disease-specific differences in response in this form of immunotherapy. Ongoing research focused on identifying and overcoming these limitations, promises to improve response rates. Beyond the induction of remission, the transformative impact of engineered T cell therapy lies in its potential for long-term disease control. With longer follow-up and durable T cell persistence now reported, we are closer to answering the question of whether sustained remissions are possible with CAR T cell monotherapy. As might be expected with a highly effective therapy using a single mechanism of action, escape pathways have emerged. Combinatorial approaches are needed to anticipate and prevent this mode of relapse. Lastly, toxicity management is vital to ensure the safety of this exciting cancer immunotherapy.","['Singh, Nathan', 'Frey, Noelle V', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'Maude, Shannon L']","['Singh N', 'Frey NV', 'Grupp SA', 'Maude SL']","['Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, 3012 CTRB, 3501 Civic Center Blvd., Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA."", ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, 3012 CTRB, 3501 Civic Center Blvd., Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA. maude@email.chop.edu.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,IM,"['Antigens, CD19/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', '*Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy/methods', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/metabolism/*therapy', '*Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",2016/04/22 06:00,2017/08/08 06:00,['2016/04/22 06:00'],"['2016/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2016 Jun;17(6):28. doi: 10.1007/s11864-016-0406-4.,10.1007/s11864-016-0406-4 [doi],,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*CD19', '*Cellular immunotherapy', '*Chimeric antigen receptor', '*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*Cytokine release syndrome', '*Engineered T cells']",,"['10.1007/s11864-016-0406-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s11864-016-0406-4 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elimination of cells bearing activated oncogenes or stimulation of tumor suppressor mediators may provide a selection pressure to overcome resistance. KC-53 is a novel biyouyanagin analogue known to elicit strong anti-inflammatory and anti-viral activity. The current study was designed to evaluate the anticancer efficacy and molecular mechanisms of KC-53 against human cancer cells. METHODS: Using the MTT assay we examined initially how KC-53 affects the proliferation rates of thirteen representative human cancer cell lines in comparison to normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and immortalized cell lines. To decipher the key molecular events underlying its mode of action we selected the human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 and the acute lymphocytic leukemia CCRF/CEM cell lines that were found to be the most sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of KC-53. RESULTS: KC-53 promoted rapidly and irreversibly apoptosis in both leukemia cell lines at relatively low concentrations. Apoptosis was characterized by an increase in membrane-associated TNFR1, activation of Caspase-8 and proteolytic inactivation of the death domain kinase RIP1 indicating that KC-53 induced mainly the extrinsic/death receptor apoptotic pathway. Regardless, induction of the intrinsic/mitochondrial pathway was also achieved by Caspase-8 processing of Bid, activation of Caspase-9 and increased translocation of AIF to the nucleus. FADD protein knockdown restored HL-60 and CCRF/CEM cell viability and completely blocked KC-53-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, KC-53 administration dramatically inhibited TNFalpha-induced serine phosphorylation on TRAF2 and on IkappaBalpha hindering therefore p65/NF-kappaBeta translocation to nucleus. Reduced transcriptional expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-survival p65 target genes, confirmed that the agent functionally inhibited the transcriptional activity of p65. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, the selective anticancer properties of KC-53 towards leukemic cell lines and provide a detailed understanding of the molecular events underlying its dual anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic properties. These results provide new insights into the development of innovative and targeted therapies for the treatment of some forms of leukemia.","['Savva, Christiana G', 'Totokotsopoulos, Sotirios', 'Nicolaou, Kyriakos C', 'Neophytou, Christiana M', 'Constantinou, Andreas I']","['Savva CG', 'Totokotsopoulos S', 'Nicolaou KC', 'Neophytou CM', 'Constantinou AI']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Cyprus, Kallipoleos 75, Nicosia, 01678, Cyprus.', 'Department of Chemistry, BioScience Research Collaborative, Rice University, 6500 Main Street, Houston, TX, 77005, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, BioScience Research Collaborative, Rice University, 6500 Main Street, Houston, TX, 77005, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Cyprus, Kallipoleos 75, Nicosia, 01678, Cyprus.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Cyprus, Kallipoleos 75, Nicosia, 01678, Cyprus. andreasc@ucy.ac.cy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/genetics', 'NF-kappa B/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Sesquiterpenes/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Spiro Compounds/*administration & dosage/chemistry']",2016/04/22 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/04/22 06:00'],"['2015/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2016 Apr 20;16:279. doi: 10.1186/s12885-016-2310-5.,10.1186/s12885-016-2310-5 [doi],20160420,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Spiro Compounds)', '0 (biyouyanagin A)']",PMC4839067,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Biyouyanagin', 'Caspases', 'Death receptors', 'Leukemia', 'NF-kappaBeta', 'Nuclear factor kappaBeta', 'TNFR1', 'Tumor necrosis factor receptor 1']",,"['10.1186/s12885-016-2310-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-016-2310-5 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate that APL may emerge from a dynamical endogenous molecular-cellular network obtained from normal, non-cancerous molecular interactions such as signal transduction and translational regulation under physiological conditions. This unifying framework, which reproduces APL, normal progenitor, and differentiated granulocytic phenotypes as different robust states from the network dynamics, has the advantage to study transition between these states, i.e. critical drivers for leukemogenesis and targets for differentiation. The simulation results quantitatively reproduce microarray profiles of NB4 and HL60 cell lines in response to treatment and normal neutrophil differentiation, and lead to new findings such as biomarkers for APL and additional molecular targets for arsenic trioxide therapy. The modeling shows APL and normal states mutually suppress each other, both in ""wiring"" and in dynamical cooperation. Leukemogenesis and recovery under treatment may be a consequence of spontaneous or induced transitions between robust states, through ""passes"" or ""dragging"" by drug effects. Our approach rationalizes leukemic complexity and constructs a platform towards extending differentiation therapy by performing ""dry"" molecular biology experiments.","['Yuan, Ruoshi', 'Zhu, Xiaomei', 'Radich, Jerald P', 'Ao, Ping']","['Yuan R', 'Zhu X', 'Radich JP', 'Ao P']","['Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine, Ministry of Education, Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China.', 'School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China.', 'GeneMath, 5525 27th Ave. N.E., Seattle, WA 98105, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Avenue N., Seattle, WA 98109, USA.', 'Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine, Ministry of Education, Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Interaction Maps', '*Signal Transduction']",2016/04/22 06:00,2017/03/10 06:00,['2016/04/22 06:00'],"['2015/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Apr 21;6:24307. doi: 10.1038/srep24307.,10.1038/srep24307 [doi],20160421,,PMC4838884,,,,"['srep24307 [pii]', '10.1038/srep24307 [doi]']",,,['P01 CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibitors of mutant IDH1 and IDH2 may potentially be effective in the treatment of the IDH mutation driven tumors. Mutations in the succinate dehydrogenase, the other enzyme complex participating in the Krebs cycle and electron transfer of oxidative phosphorylation occur in the paragangliomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and occasionally in the pituitary adenomas. We aimed to determine whether the IDH1(R132H) mutation, the most frequent IDH mutation in human malignancies, occurs in pituitary adenomas. METHODS: We performed immunohistochemical analysis by using a monoclonal anti-IDH1(R132H) antibody on the tissue microarrays containing specimens from the pituitary adenomas of different hormonal types from 246 patients. In positive samples, the status of the IDH1 gene was further examined by molecular genetic analyses. RESULTS: In all but one patient, there was no expression of mutated IDH1(R132H) protein in the tumor cells by immunohistochemistry. Only one patient with a recurring clinically non-functioning gonadotroph adenoma demonstrated IDH1(R132H)-immunostaining in both the primary tumor and the recurrence. However, no mutation in the IDH1 gene was detected using different molecular genetic analyses. CONCLUSION: IDH1(R132H) mutation occurs only exceptionally in pituitary adenomas and does not play a role in their pathogenesis. Patients with pituitary adenomas do not seem to be candidates for treatment with the inhibitors of mutant IDH1.","['Casar-Borota, Olivera', 'Oystese, Kristin Astrid Berland', 'Sundstrom, Magnus', 'Melchior, Linea', 'Popovic, Vera']","['Casar-Borota O', 'Oystese KA', 'Sundstrom M', 'Melchior L', 'Popovic V']","['Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Rudbeck Laboratory, Dag Hammarskjolds vag 20, 751 85, Uppsala, Sweden. olivera.casar-borota@igp.uu.se.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology and Cytology, Uppsala University Hospital, Rudbeck Laboratory, Dag Hammarskjolds vag 20, 751 85, Uppsala, Sweden. olivera.casar-borota@igp.uu.se.', 'Department of Pathology, Oslo University Hospital, Sognsvannsveien 20, 0372, Oslo, Norway. olivera.casar-borota@igp.uu.se.', 'Department of Specialised Endocrinology, Oslo University Hospital, Sognsvannsveien 20, 0372, Oslo, Norway.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Klaus Torgardsvei 3, 0372, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Rudbeck Laboratory, Dag Hammarskjolds vag 20, 751 85, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology and Cytology, Uppsala University Hospital, Rudbeck Laboratory, Dag Hammarskjolds vag 20, 751 85, Uppsala, Sweden.', ""Department of Pathology, Rigshospitalet Copenhagen University Hospital, Frederik V's vei 11, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark."", 'Medical Faculty, University of Belgrade, Dr Subotica 8, 11 000, Belgrade, Serbia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pituitary,Pituitary,9814578,IM,"['ACTH-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma/metabolism', 'Adenoma/*metabolism', 'Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/*metabolism', 'Nelson Syndrome/metabolism', 'Pituitary ACTH Hypersecretion/metabolism', 'Pituitary Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Prolactinoma/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tissue Array Analysis']",2016/04/22 06:00,2017/03/23 06:00,['2016/04/22 06:00'],"['2016/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Pituitary. 2016 Aug;19(4):407-14. doi: 10.1007/s11102-016-0720-7.,10.1007/s11102-016-0720-7 [doi],,"['EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

Cytoskeletal proteins, including non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA (MYHIIA), vimentin (VIM) and cofilin-1 (CFL1), exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells have been identified as autoantigens that are recognized by the specific B-cell receptors of the CLL cells. In 212 CLL patients analysed with quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction we found CFL1 overexpression and low expression of MYH9 in comparison with healthy volunteers. We detected specific cytotoxic immune responses for peptides derived from MYHIIA in 66.7%, VIM in 87.5% and CFL1 in 62.5% CLL patients in an Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot assay. Low frequencies of autoreactive peptide-specific T cells were detected against MYHIIA, VIM and CFL1 in CLL patients ex vivo; most of the detected cells had an effector-memory phenotype. Our findings support the existence of cytotoxic immune responses against three autoantigens that have been identified as targets of CLL clonotypic B-cell receptors. The presence of autoreactive CD8(+) T cells against MYHIIA, VIM and CFL1 in CLL patients indicates the involvement of antigen-specific autoreactive T cells in the pathogenesis of CLL.","['Zaleska, Joanna', 'Skorka, Katarzyna', 'Zajac, Malgorzata', 'Karczmarczyk, Agnieszka', 'Karp, Marta', 'Tomczak, Waldemar', 'Hus, Marek', 'Wlasiuk, Paulina', 'Giannopoulos, Krzysztof']","['Zaleska J', 'Skorka K', 'Zajac M', 'Karczmarczyk A', 'Karp M', 'Tomczak W', 'Hus M', 'Wlasiuk P', 'Giannopoulos K']","['Department of Experimental Haemato-oncology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Haemato-oncology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Haemato-oncology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Haemato-oncology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Haemato-oncology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Postgraduate School of Molecular Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Haemato-oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Haemato-oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Haemato-oncology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Haemato-oncology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', ""Department of Haematology, St. John's Cancer Centre, Lublin, Poland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Autoantigens/*immunology', 'Cofilin 1/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myosin Heavy Chains/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Vimentin/immunology']",2016/04/22 06:00,2017/06/03 06:00,['2016/04/22 06:00'],"['2015/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2016 Aug;174(4):582-90. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14098.

Aged epidermal cells have a low ability to renew themselves and repair skin injury. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation, particularly UVB, can cause photo-aging of the skin by suppressing the viability of human epidermal cells. A chorion-derived stem cell conditioned medium (CDSC-CNM) is thought to have regenerative properties. This study aimed to determine the regenerative effects of CDSC-CNM on UVB-induced photo-aged epidermal cells. Epidermal cells were passaged four times and irradiated with quantitative UVB, and non-irradiated cells served as a control group. Cells were then treated with different concentrations of CDSC-CNM. Compared to the non-irradiated group, the proliferation rates and migration rates of UVB-induced photo-aged epidermal cells significantly decreased (p < 0.05) with increasing intracellular radical oxygen species (ROS) generation and DNA damage. After treatment with CDSC-CNM, photo-aged epidermal cells significantly improved their viability, and their ROS generation and DNA damage decreased. The secretory factors in CDSC-CNM, including epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8 and the related signaling pathway protein levels, increased compared to the control medium (CM). The potential regenerative and reparative effects of CDSC-CNM indicate that it may be a candidate material for the treatment of prematurely aged skin. The functions of the secretory factors and the mechanisms of CDSC-CNM therapy deserve further attention.","['Li, Qiankun', 'Chen, Yan', 'Ma, Kui', 'Zhao, Along', 'Zhang, Cuiping', 'Fu, Xiaobing']","['Li Q', 'Chen Y', 'Ma K', 'Zhao A', 'Zhang C', 'Fu X']","['a Wound Healing and Cell Biology Laboratory, Institute of Basic Medical Science, Chinese PLA General Hospital , Beijing , China.', 'b Key Laboratory of Wound Repair and Regeneration of PLA, the First Affiliated Hospital, General Hospital of PLA , Beijing , China.', 'c Department of Pharmacy , General Hospital of Beijing Military Region , DongCheng District, Beijing , China.', 'b Key Laboratory of Wound Repair and Regeneration of PLA, the First Affiliated Hospital, General Hospital of PLA , Beijing , China.', 'b Key Laboratory of Wound Repair and Regeneration of PLA, the First Affiliated Hospital, General Hospital of PLA , Beijing , China.', 'b Key Laboratory of Wound Repair and Regeneration of PLA, the First Affiliated Hospital, General Hospital of PLA , Beijing , China.', 'a Wound Healing and Cell Biology Laboratory, Institute of Basic Medical Science, Chinese PLA General Hospital , Beijing , China.', 'b Key Laboratory of Wound Repair and Regeneration of PLA, the First Affiliated Hospital, General Hospital of PLA , Beijing , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chorion/*cytology', 'Comet Assay', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/*pharmacology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/cytology/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Placenta/cytology', 'Pregnancy', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Regeneration/drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Skin Aging/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Stem Cells/*cytology', '*Ultraviolet Rays']",2016/04/21 06:00,2017/01/07 06:00,['2016/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/07 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2016;15(8):1144-55. doi: 10.1080/15384101.2016.1158376.,10.1080/15384101.2016.1158376 [doi],,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",PMC4889285,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage', 'ROS', 'cell cycle', 'epidermal cell', 'photo-aging']",,['10.1080/15384101.2016.1158376 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of NUP98 fusion oncoproteins has been shown to induce mitotic spindle defects and chromosome missegregation, which correlate with the capability of NUP98 fusions to cause mitotic checkpoint attenuation. We show that NUP98 oncoproteins physically interact with the APC/C(Cdc20) in the absence of the NUP98 partner protein RAE1, and prevent the binding of the mitotic checkpoint complex to the APC/C(Cdc20). NUP98 oncoproteins require the GLEBS-like domain present in their NUP98 moiety to bind the APC/C(Cdc20). We found that NUP98 wild-type is a substrate of APC/C(Cdc20) prior to mitotic entry, and that its binding to APC/C(Cdc20) is controlled via phosphorylation of a PEST sequence located within its C-terminal portion. We identify S606, within the PEST sequence, as a key target site, whose phosphorylation modulates the capability of NUP98 to interact with APC/C(Cdc20). We finally provide evidence for an involvement of the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase PIN1 in modulating the possible conformational changes within NUP98 that lead to its dissociation from the APC/C(Cdc20) during mitosis. Our results provide novel insight into the mechanisms underlying the aberrant capability of NUP98 oncoproteins to interact with APC/C(Cdc20) and to interfere with its function.","['Salsi, Valentina', 'Fantini, Sebastian', 'Zappavigna, Vincenzo']","['Salsi V', 'Fantini S', 'Zappavigna V']","['a Department of Life Sciences , University of Modena and Reggio Emilia , Modena , Italy.', 'a Department of Life Sciences , University of Modena and Reggio Emilia , Modena , Italy.', 'a Department of Life Sciences , University of Modena and Reggio Emilia , Modena , Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Cdc20 Proteins/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', '*M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Mad2 Proteins', 'Mitosis', 'NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase/metabolism', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Domains', 'Protein Stability', 'Substrate Specificity']",2016/04/21 06:00,2017/06/18 06:00,['2016/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2016 Sep;15(17):2275-87. doi: 10.1080/15384101.2016.1172156.

Because of a considerable degree of overlap with pseudolymphoma, the diagnosis is often challenging. Preliminary studies suggest that nuclear upregulation of calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) may play a role in lymphomagenesis. DESIGN: 137 cases (70 males and 67 female, mean age = 55) of various forms of cutaneous T-cell and B-cell infiltration were evaluated for NFATc1 expression. The study comprised 18 cases of PCSTCL, 45 cases of mycosis fungoides (MF), 5 cases of lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP), 5 cases of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL), 8 cases of other forms of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, 12 precursor lesions of MF (ie, cutaneous T-cell dyscrasias), 35 cases of pseudolymphomas, 8 primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma, and 1 chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The number of cells exhibiting a nuclear stain was counted per 10 high-power field and 2-tailed statistical analysis was used for comparison of nuclear NFATc1 expression between primary PCSTCL and all other groups. A P-value <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. RESULTS: All cases of PCSTCL showed nuclear staining for NFATc1 (mean = 296 +/- 236) with no cases in which an exclusive cytoplasmic stain was observed. The cells exhibiting this staining pattern were oftentimes larger manifesting other features of a follicular helper T-cell phenotype, such as variable positivity for PD1, ICOS, CXCL13, and BCL6. In comparison, an exclusively cytoplasmic stain was observed in 29 cases of MF; in few cases, rare nuclear staining cells were observed averaging less than 10 per high-power field (P = 0.0001). These positive staining cases were not only limited to tumor-stage MF but also encompassed patch- and plaque-stage lesions and follicular variants of MF. The same pattern was observed in cases of T-cell dyscrasia (mean = 3 +/- 3, P = 0.0001) and pseudolymphoma (mean = 2 +/- 3, P = 0.0001), both revealing a dominant cytoplasmic staining pattern. In pseudolymphomatous folliculitis, a greater extent of nuclear staining for NFATc1 was observed compared with other forms of pseudolymphoma. No significant difference was seen between MF and T-cell dyscrasia or pesudolymphomas excluding pseudolymphotous folliculitis. Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma cases showed an almost exclusive cytoplasmic staining pattern with rare nuclear staining (mean = 55 +/- 102, P = 0.0001); similar results were observed in LyP (mean = 17 +/- 15, P = 0.004). Cutaneous B-cell lymphomas showed a similar extent of staining as that noted for PCSTCL. The greatest extent of staining was observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A significant difference was noted between the extent of nuclear staining in PCSTCL and other forms of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, type unspecified (mean = 22 +/- 43, P = 0.0002), although not between PCSTCL and B-cell lymphoma. CONCLUSION: NFAT signaling plays a critical role in peripheral T-cell activation after T cell receptor engagement. When assessing T-cell-rich infiltrates where the differential diagnosis is largely between a PCSTCL and pseudolymphoma, a significant degree of nuclear staining of lymphocytes would be more in keeping with a diagnosis of PCSTCL. Upregulation of the NFAT pathway is not a feature of tumor progression in the setting of MF.","['Magro, Cynthia M', 'Momtahen, Shabnam']","['Magro CM', 'Momtahen S']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Dermatopathol,The American Journal of dermatopathology,7911005,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Pseudolymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis']",2016/04/21 06:00,2017/02/09 06:00,['2016/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Dermatopathol. 2017 Feb;39(2):95-103. doi: 10.1097/DAD.0000000000000597.,10.1097/DAD.0000000000000597 [doi],,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (NFATC1 protein, human)']",,,,,['10.1097/DAD.0000000000000597 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Integration of murine gamma-retroviruses into the host genome favours promoters and enhancers and entails interaction of viral integrase with host BET/bromodomain factors. We report that this integration pattern is conserved in feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), a gamma-retrovirus that infects many human cell types. Analysis of FeLV insertion sites in the MCF-7 mammary carcinoma cell line revealed strong bias towards active chromatin marks with no evidence of significant post-integration growth selection. The most prominent FeLV integration targets had little overlap with the most abundantly expressed transcripts, but were strongly enriched for annotated cancer genes. A meta-analysis based on several gamma-retrovirus integration profiling (GRIP) studies in human cells (CD34+, K562, HepG2) revealed a similar cancer gene bias but also remarkable cell-type specificity, with prominent exceptions including a universal integration hotspot at the long non-coding RNA MALAT1. Comparison of GRIP targets with databases of super-enhancers from the same cell lines showed that these have only limited overlap and that GRIP provides unique insights into the upstream drivers of cell growth. These observations elucidate the oncogenic potency of the gamma-retroviruses and support the wider application of GRIP to identify the genes and growth regulatory circuits that drive distinct cancer types.","['Gilroy, Kathryn L', 'Terry, Anne', 'Naseer, Asif', 'de Ridder, Jeroen', 'Allahyar, Amin', 'Wang, Weiwei', 'Carpenter, Eric', 'Mason, Andrew', 'Wong, Gane K-S', 'Cameron, Ewan R', 'Kilbey, Anna', 'Neil, James C']","['Gilroy KL', 'Terry A', 'Naseer A', 'de Ridder J', 'Allahyar A', 'Wang W', 'Carpenter E', 'Mason A', 'Wong GK', 'Cameron ER', 'Kilbey A', 'Neil JC']","['MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Delft Bioinformatics Lab, Faculty of EEMCS, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands.', 'Delft Bioinformatics Lab, Faculty of EEMCS, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Centre of Excellence for Gastrointestinal Inflammation and Immunity Research, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/genetics/virology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/*virology', 'Retroviridae Infections/complications/genetics/*virology', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Tumor Virus Infections/complications/genetics/*virology', '*Virus Integration']",2016/04/21 06:00,2016/09/10 06:00,['2016/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Apr 20;11(4):e0154070. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0154070. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0154070 [doi],20160420,['0 (Chromatin)'],PMC4838236,,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0154070 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-05838 [pii]']",,,"['11951/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', '13046/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'A11951/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'MOP 97798/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada']",,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2567-0273', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8311-1491']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The monoclonal CD20 antibodies rituximab and ofatumumab were found to trigger substantial release of ROS from monocytes. Antibody-exposed monocytes induced NK cell apoptosis and restricted NK cell-mediated ADCC against autologous CLL cells. The presence of inhibitors of ROS formation and scavengers of ROS preserved NK cell viability and restored NK cell-mediated ADCC against primary CLL cells.

The use of a pneumatic tube system (PTS) is associated with measurement errors and unnecessary transfusions. The aim of this study was to evaluate pre-analytical errors associated with transportation method (PTS versus hand-delivered) and to investigate whether there are unnecessary transfusion events in pancytopenia leukemia patients with very low hematological parameters. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 140 paired blood collections were performed for hemogram and biochemistry assays. Paired EDTA and serum gel blood samples were collected from 58 cases with acute leukemia on different days. For each pair, one sample was hand-delivered by a courier (Group 1) while the other sample was transported through a PTS (Group 2). RESULTS The hand-delivered method showed that some platelet transfusions were unnecessary for different thrombocyte cut-off values. Calculated unnecessary platelet (PLT) transfusion ratios when using PTS (PLT <30x10(3)/microL, 16.3%; PLT <25x10(3)/microL, 16.4%; PLT <20x10(3)/microL, 80.3%; PLT <15x10(3)/microL, 48.6%; and PLT <10x10(3)/microL, 150.0%) were found to be statistically significant (p=0.002, p=0.046, p<0.000, p=0.028, and p<0.000, respectively). In contrast, for RBC transfusion ratios, although the ratios were high in Group 2, we found no significant difference between the two groups; (HGB <8.0 g/dL, 23.3%; HGB <9.0 g/dL, 25.0%, HGB<10.0 g/dL, 19.3%) and (p=0.002, p=0.085, p<0.160, and p=0.235, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Although our results cannot be universally applied, physicians should be careful, skeptical, and suspicious of transfusion decisions in hematology clinics and consider potential analytical and pre-analytical errors in cases of severe cytopenia when using PTS.","['Koroglu, Mustafa', 'Erkurt, Mehmet Ali', 'Kuku, Irfan', 'Kaya, Emin', 'Berber, Ilhami', 'Nizam, Ilknur', 'Yagar, Yavuz', 'Kayis, Seyit Ali']","['Koroglu M', 'Erkurt MA', 'Kuku I', 'Kaya E', 'Berber I', 'Nizam I', 'Yagar Y', 'Kayis SA']","['Department of Hematology, Karabuk University, Faculty of Medicine, Karabuk, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Inonu University, Faculty of Medicine, Malatya, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Inonu University, Faculty of Medicine, Malatya, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Inonu University, Faculty of Medicine, Malatya, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Inonu University, Faculty of Medicine, Malatya, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Inonu University, Faculty of Medicine, Malatya, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Inonu University, Faculty of Medicine, Malatya, Turkey.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Karabuk University, Faculty of Medicine, Karabuk, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Female', 'Hematology/*instrumentation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Transfusion/*adverse effects/*instrumentation']",2016/04/21 06:00,2016/12/27 06:00,['2016/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/27 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2016 Apr 20;22:1329-33. doi: 10.12659/msm.898164.,,20160420,,PMC4841356,,,,"['898164 [pii]', '10.12659/msm.898164 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we verified the role of LIF by detecting gene expression in morula stage embryos through DNA microarray. Our results showed that LIF knockdown affected expression of 369 genes. After LIF supplementation, the epidermal growth factor (EGF) is most affected by LIF expression. To observe the correlation between LIF and EGF, the LIF knockdown embryos were supplemented with various growth factors, including LIF, EGF, GM-CSF, TGF, and IGF II. Only LIF and EGF caused the rate of blastocyst development to recover significantly from 52% of control to 83% and 93%, respectively. All of the variables, including the diameter of blastocysts, the number of blastomeres, and cells in ICM and TE, were almost restored. Moreover, EGF knockdown also impaired blastocyst development, which was reversed by LIF or EGF supplementation. The treatment with various signaling suppressors revealed that both EGF and LIF promoted embryonic development through the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. These data suggest that the EGF and LIF can be compensatory to each other during early embryonic development, and at least one of them is necessary for sustaining the normal development of pre-implantation embryos.","['Cheng, En-Hui', 'Liu, Jer-Yuh', 'Lee, Tsung-Hsein', 'Huang, Chun-Chia', 'Chen, Chung-I', 'Huang, Lii-Sheng', 'Lee, Maw-Sheng']","['Cheng EH', 'Liu JY', 'Lee TH', 'Huang CC', 'Chen CI', 'Huang LS', 'Lee MS']","[""Division of Infertility Clinic, Lee Women's Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan."", 'Graduate Institute of Cancer Biology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', ""Division of Infertility Clinic, Lee Women's Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan."", ""Division of Infertility Clinic, Lee Women's Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan."", ""Division of Infertility Clinic, Lee Women's Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan."", 'Department of Nursing, School of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', ""Division of Infertility Clinic, Lee Women's Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan."", 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Janus Kinases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice/*embryology', 'Morula/cytology/physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2016/04/21 06:00,2016/09/10 06:00,['2016/04/21 06:00'],"['2015/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Apr 20;11(4):e0153086. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0153086. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0153086 [doi],20160420,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",PMC4838257,,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0153086 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-37040 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of p-Pten in normal and abnormal hematopoiesis has not been studied. We found that Pten protein levels are comparable among long-term (LT) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), short-term (ST) HSCs, and multipotent progenitors (MPPs); however, the levels of p-Pten are elevated during the HSC-to-MPP transition. To study whether p-Pten is involved in regulating self-renewal and differentiation in HSCs, we compared the effects of overexpression of p-Pten and nonphosphorylated Pten (non-p-Pten) on the hematopoietic reconstitutive capacity (HRC) of HSCs. We found that overexpression of non-p-Pten enhances the LT-HRC of HSCs, whereas overexpression of p-Pten promotes myeloid differentiation and compromises the LT-HRC of HSCs. Such phosphorylation-regulated Pten functioning is mediated by repressing the cell:cell contact-induced activation of Fak/p38 signaling independent of Pten's lipid phosphatase activity because both p-Pten and non-p-Pten have comparable activity in repressing PI3K/Akt signaling. Our studies suggest that, in addition to repressing PI3K/Akt/mTor signaling, non-p-Pten maintains HSCs in bone marrow niches via a cell-contact inhibitory mechanism by inhibiting Fak/p38 signaling-mediated proliferation and differentiation. In contrast, p-Pten promotes the proliferation and differentiation of HSCs by enhancing the cell contact-dependent activation of Src/Fak/p38 signaling.

To determine the minimal requirements for ESCRT factors in MLV viral and viral-like particles (VLP) release, an siRNA knockdown screen of ESCRT(-associated) proteins was performed in MLV-producing human cells. We found that MLV VLPs and virions primarily engage the ESCRT-I factor Tsg101 and marginally the ESCRT-associated adaptors Nedd4-1 and Alix to enter the ESCRT pathway. Conversely, the inactivation of ESCRT-II had no impact on VLP and virion egress. By analyzing the effects of individual ESCRT-III knockdowns, VLP and virion release was profoundly inhibited in CHMP2A- and CHMP4B-knockdown cells. In contrast, neither the CHMP2B and CHMP4A isoforms nor CHMP3, CHMP5, and CHMP6 were found to be essential. In case of CHMP1, we unexpectedly observed that the CHMP1A isoform was specifically required for virus budding, but dispensable for VLP release.

Only a minority of HTLV-1 carriers develop neoplastic transformation to ATLL after a 40- to 60-year latency period. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 49-year-old Columbian male presented to the Emergency Department with abdominal pain, weight loss, generalized cutaneous papules and epistaxis. Extensive cytomorphological, histopathological, immunophenotypical, serological, and molecular (cyto)genetic analysis all contributed to reach the diagnosis of acute HTLV-1 associated ATLL. The patient was treated with multiagent cytotoxic chemotherapy, consisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP). CONCLUSION: Acute ATLL is a clinically aggressive disease and carries a poor prognosis. Treatment options include antiviral regimens, chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody-targeted therapy, and allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. The incidence of ATLL in non-endemic areas, such as the Netherlands, is increasing due to emigration of HTLV-1 carriers from endemic areas.","['Sandberg, Yorick', 'Langerak, Anton W', 'Lam, King H', 'Rijneveld, Anita W', 'van Lom, Kirsten']","['Sandberg Y', 'Langerak AW', 'Lam KH', 'Rijneveld AW', 'van Lom K']","['Erasmus Medisch Centrum, Rotterdam.']",['dut'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,0400770,IM,"['Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Leukocytosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Netherlands', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",2016/04/21 06:00,2017/05/30 06:00,['2016/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/30 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd. 2016;160:A9866.,,,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Leukocytose en huidafwijkingen: denk aan maligniteit; adulte T-celleukemie/-lymfoom.,,,,,,,,,

AIM AND METHODS: Antigen expression profiling of COR (RANK, PD-1), COL (RANK-L, PD-1L), and HLA-ABC-antigens on blasts from 90 AML-patients at first diagnosis was performed by flow cytometry (SFI-Level characterization) and findings were correlated with clinical parameters. RESULTS: RANK expression was higher in immature compared to mature FAB groups (P = 0.08). As a monocytic marker, we identified HLA-ABC (P = 0.07). Prognostic analysis revealed a higher probability of overall survival in cases with lower RANK-L expression (<1.6 and >/=1.6, 15.6 vs. 12.2 months, P = 0.008, hazard ratio 0.36, P = 0.008). No significant impact of PD-1/L expression for patients'(pts) survival was seen but a correlation of PD-1 with a secondary AML (P = 0.03). Prolonged disease-free survival however correlated with higher PD-1 expression (>/=1.1 vs. <1.1, 31.4 vs. 12.7 months; P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that RANK-L is a promising marker to forecast pts' prognosis in AML. Immune checkpoint receptor PD-1/L as well as RANK and HLA-ABC did not show an impact on pts' survival.","['Schmohl, Joerg Uwe', 'Nuebling, Tina', 'Wild, Julia', 'Kroell, Tanja', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Salih, Helmut Rainer', 'Schmetzer, Helga']","['Schmohl JU', 'Nuebling T', 'Wild J', 'Kroell T', 'Kanz L', 'Salih HR', 'Schmetzer H']","['Section of Molecular Cancer Therapeutics, Therapeutic Radiology-Radiation Oncology, University of Minnesota, Masonic Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department for Hematology and Oncology, Med Dept II, University Hospital of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department for Hematology and Oncology, Med Dept II, University Hospital of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium and German Cancer Research Center, Partner site Tuebingen, Department for Internal Medicine II, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department for Hematology and Oncology, Med Dept II, University Hospital of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium and German Cancer Research Center, Partner site Tuebingen, Department for Internal Medicine II, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department for Hematopoetic Cell Transplantation, Med.

This molecule also potently inhibited Pim kinase activity in KMS-12-BM, a multiple myeloma cell line with relatively high endogenous levels of Pim-1/2, both in vitro (pBAD IC50 = 25 nM) and in vivo (pBAD EC50 = 30 nM, unbound), and a 100 mg/kg daily dose was found to completely arrest the growth of KMS-12-BM xenografts in mice.","['Cee, Victor J', 'Chavez, Frank Jr', 'Herberich, Bradley', 'Lanman, Brian A', 'Pettus, Liping H', 'Reed, Anthony B', 'Wu, Bin', 'Wurz, Ryan P', 'Andrews, Kristin L', 'Chen, Jie', 'Hickman, Dean', 'Laszlo, Jimmy 3rd', 'Lee, Matthew R', 'Guerrero, Nadia', 'Mattson, Bethany K', 'Nguyen, Yen', 'Mohr, Christopher', 'Rex, Karen', 'Sastri, Christine E', 'Wang, Paul', 'Wu, Qiong', 'Wu, Tian', 'Xu, Yang', 'Zhou, Yihong', 'Winston, Jeffrey T', 'Lipford, J Russell', 'Tasker, Andrew S', 'Wang, Hui-Ling']","['Cee VJ', 'Chavez F Jr', 'Herberich B', 'Lanman BA', 'Pettus LH', 'Reed AB', 'Wu B', 'Wurz RP', 'Andrews KL', 'Chen J', 'Hickman D', 'Laszlo J 3rd', 'Lee MR', 'Guerrero N', 'Mattson BK', 'Nguyen Y', 'Mohr C', 'Rex K', 'Sastri CE', 'Wang P', 'Wu Q', 'Wu T', 'Xu Y', 'Zhou Y', 'Winston JT', 'Lipford JR', 'Tasker AS', 'Wang HL']","['Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.', 'Amgen Inc. , One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,ACS Med Chem Lett,ACS medicinal chemistry letters,101521073,,,2016/04/21 06:00,2016/04/21 06:01,['2016/04/21 06:00'],"['2015/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/21 06:01 [medline]']",epublish,ACS Med Chem Lett. 2016 Feb 12;7(4):408-12. doi: 10.1021/acsmedchemlett.5b00403. eCollection 2016 Apr 14.,10.1021/acsmedchemlett.5b00403 [doi],20160212,,PMC4834646,['NOTNLM'],"['KMS-12-BM', 'Pim kinase inhibitor', 'macrocycle', 'multiple myeloma']",,['10.1021/acsmedchemlett.5b00403 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further work up showed no systemic involvement but extensive thoracolumbar-sacral leptomeningeal disease. The patient was treated with several courses of intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy followed by craniospinal irradiation for consolidation. There was initial steady improvement in neurological symptoms and leptomeningeal disease, the latter being ascertained through radiological studies and cerebrospinal fluid examination.

ABT-199 is strongly cytotoxic against unstimulated peripheral blood CLL cells in vitro but is much less effective against CLL cells that have received survival signals from the microenvironment. In particular, stimulation of CLL cells with CD40L results in substantial resistance mediated by induction of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-xL and Bfl-1. In this study, we investigated whether resistance to ABT-199 can be conferred by B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation, which is another important survival signal from the leukemic microenvironment. We show that sustained BCR stimulation results in significant ABT-199 resistance, which correlates with induction of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 and less consistently with downregulation of proapoptotic Bmf, Hrk, and BimEL A major role for Mcl-1 in conferring ABT-199 resistance is additionally supported by knockdown and enforced expression experiments with primary CLL cells. We further show that SYK, BTK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase delta (PI3Kdelta) inhibitors significantly downregulate Mcl-1, but with different efficacy. Complete Mcl-1 downregulation was consistently achieved only with SYK inhibitors R406 and GS-9973 (entospletinib), whereas the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib and the PI3Kdelta inhibitor idelalisib in more than half of the cases had only a partial effect. The greater ability of SYK inhibitors to downregulate Mcl-1 correlated with their greater capacity to block BCR-mediated inactivation of GSK-3, a major negative regulator of Mcl-1. The finding that BCR signaling inhibitors differ in their ability to target Mcl-1 is relevant for the design of clinical trials combining these agents with ABT-199.","['Bojarczuk, Kamil', 'Sasi, Binu K', 'Gobessi, Stefania', 'Innocenti, Idanna', 'Pozzato, Gabriele', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Efremov, Dimitar G']","['Bojarczuk K', 'Sasi BK', 'Gobessi S', 'Innocenti I', 'Pozzato G', 'Laurenti L', 'Efremov DG']","['Molecular Hematology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy; Department of Immunology, Centre for Biostructure Research, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland;', 'Molecular Hematology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy;', 'Molecular Hematology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy;', 'Department of Hematology, Catholic University Hospital ""A.

Here we report that in MYC-, RAS-, and BCR-ABL-induced acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), apoptosis upon oncogene inactivation is mediated by the same pro-apoptotic protein, BIM. The induction of BIMin the MYC- and RAS-driven leukemia is mediated by the downregulation of miR-17-92. Overexpression of miR-17-92 blocked the induction of apoptosis upon oncogene inactivation in the MYC and RAS-driven but not in the BCR-ABL-driven ALL leukemia.

Its anti-tumor activity has been demonstrated in vitro models using extracts and isolated compounds. This study investigates the cytotoxic effects of stem bark extracts of D. brasiliensis as well as isolated compounds that may be responsible for the activitys and evaluates them in leukemia cells. The stem bark extract were subjected to column chromatography, and the structures of compounds were elucidated based on spectroscopic methods by using NMR and infrared spectroscopy and GC/MS. The cytotoxicity of the isolated compounds was evaluated in chronic myeloid (K562) and acute B lymphoblastic (Nalm6) leukemia cells using tetrazolium assay (MTT). Two new compounds were isolated 1beta-O-p-methoxy-E-cinnamoyl-5alpha-keto-11alpha-enol-albicanol (1a) and the isomer 1beta-O-p-methoxy-E-cinnamoyl-5alpha-keto-11beta-enol-albicanol (1b) and 1beta-O-p-methoxy-E-cinnamoyl-isodrimeninol (2). The known compounds polygonal acid (3a) and the isomer isopolygonal acid (3b), fuegin (4a) and the isomer epifuegin (4b), the mixture drimanial (5) and 1beta-O-(p-methoxy-E-cinnamoyl)-6alpha-hydroxypolygodial (6) were also isolated. The drimanes (1-4) and drimanial (5), 1beta-(p-coumaroyloxy)-polygodial (7), 1beta-(p-methoxycinnamoyl)-polygodial (8), and polygodial (9) isolated previously were assessed in tumor cells. The IC50 values were between 3.56 and 128.91 muM. 1-beta-(p-cumaroiloxi)-polygodial showed the best result with IC50 8.18 and 3.56 muM by K562 and Nalm6, respectively. The chloroform extract of the stem bark of D. brasiliensis is a great source of drimane sesquiterpenes. Our experimental data suggest that drimanes are responsible for cytotoxicity activity demonstrated by this species, especially those with the aldehyde group linked to carbons C-11 and C-12.","['Fratoni, Eduarda', 'Claudino, Vanessa Duarte', 'Yunes, Rosendo Augusto', 'Franchi, Gilberto C Jr', 'Nowill, Alexandre E', 'Filho, Valdir Cechinel', 'Monache, Franco Delle', 'Malheiros, Angela']","['Fratoni E', 'Claudino VD', 'Yunes RA', 'Franchi GC Jr', 'Nowill AE', 'Filho VC', 'Monache FD', 'Malheiros A']","['Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Ciencias Farmaceuticas e Nucleo de Investigacoes Quimico-Farmaceuticas, Universidade do Vale do Itajai - UNIVALI, Itajai, SC, CEP 88302-202, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Ciencias Farmaceuticas e Nucleo de Investigacoes Quimico-Farmaceuticas, Universidade do Vale do Itajai - UNIVALI, Itajai, SC, CEP 88302-202, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Quimica, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina - UFSC, Florianopolis, SC, CEP 88040-970, Brazil.', 'Centro Integrado de Pesquisas Oncohematologicas na Infancia (CIPOI), UNICAMP, Campinas, SP, CEP 13083-970, Brazil.', 'Centro Integrado de Pesquisas Oncohematologicas na Infancia (CIPOI), UNICAMP, Campinas, SP, CEP 13083-970, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Ciencias Farmaceuticas e Nucleo de Investigacoes Quimico-Farmaceuticas, Universidade do Vale do Itajai - UNIVALI, Itajai, SC, CEP 88302-202, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Ciencias Farmaceuticas e Nucleo de Investigacoes Quimico-Farmaceuticas, Universidade do Vale do Itajai - UNIVALI, Itajai, SC, CEP 88302-202, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Ciencias Farmaceuticas e Nucleo de Investigacoes Quimico-Farmaceuticas, Universidade do Vale do Itajai - UNIVALI, Itajai, SC, CEP 88302-202, Brazil. angela@univali.br.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,0326264,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drimys/*chemistry', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Bark/chemistry', 'Plant Stems/chemistry', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Polycyclic Sesquiterpenes', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Sesquiterpenes/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2016/04/21 06:00,2017/02/28 06:00,['2016/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/28 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol. 2016 Jul;389(7):791-7. doi: 10.1007/s00210-016-1241-7.

Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) give rise to the different blood cell types; however, the molecular basis of human hematopoietic lineage commitment is poorly characterized. Here, we define the transcriptional and epigenetic profile of human HSPC and early myeloid and erythroid progenitors by a combination of Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE), ChIP-seq and Moloney leukemia virus (MLV) integration site mapping. Most promoters and transcripts were shared by HSPC and committed progenitors, while enhancers and super-enhancers consistently changed upon differentiation, indicating that lineage commitment is essentially regulated by enhancer elements. A significant fraction of CAGE promoters differentially expressed upon commitment were novel, harbored a chromatin enhancer signature, and may identify promoters and transcribed enhancers driving cell commitment. MLV-targeted genomic regions co-mapped with cell-specific active enhancers and super-enhancers. Expression analyses, together with an enhancer functional assay, indicate that MLV integration can be used to identify bona fide developmentally regulated enhancers. Overall, this study provides an overview of transcriptional and epigenetic changes associated to HSPC lineage commitment, and a novel signature for regulatory elements involved in cell identity.","['Romano, Oriana', 'Peano, Clelia', 'Tagliazucchi, Guidantonio Malagoli', 'Petiti, Luca', 'Poletti, Valentina', 'Cocchiarella, Fabienne', 'Rizzi, Ermanno', 'Severgnini, Marco', 'Cavazza, Alessia', 'Rossi, Claudia', 'Pagliaro, Pasqualepaolo', 'Ambrosi, Alessandro', 'Ferrari, Giuliana', 'Bicciato, Silvio', 'De Bellis, Gianluca', 'Mavilio, Fulvio', 'Miccio, Annarita']","['Romano O', 'Peano C', 'Tagliazucchi GM', 'Petiti L', 'Poletti V', 'Cocchiarella F', 'Rizzi E', 'Severgnini M', 'Cavazza A', 'Rossi C', 'Pagliaro P', 'Ambrosi A', 'Ferrari G', 'Bicciato S', 'De Bellis G', 'Mavilio F', 'Miccio A']","['Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Center for Genomic Research, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'INSERM UMR 1163, Laboratory of chromatin and gene regulation during development, Paris, France.', 'Institute of Biomedical Technologies, CNR, Milan, Italy.', 'Center for Genomic Research, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Institute of Biomedical Technologies, CNR, Milan, Italy.', 'Genethon, Evry, France.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Institute of Biomedical Technologies, CNR, Milan, Italy.', 'Telethon Foundation, Milan, Italy.', 'Institute of Biomedical Technologies, CNR, Milan, Italy.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, US.', 'San Raffaele-Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (TIGET), San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Az.

Arctotherium angustidens became extinct during the Early Pleistocene, whereas Arctodus simus went extinct at the very end of the Pleistocene. The only living tremarctine is the spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), a largely herbivorous bear that is today only found in South America. The relationships among the spectacled bears (Tremarctos), South American short-faced bears (Arctotherium) and North American short-faced bears (Arctodus) remain uncertain. In this study, we sequenced a mitochondrial genome from an Arctotherium femur preserved in a Chilean cave. Our molecular phylogenetic analyses revealed that the South American short-faced bears were more closely related to the extant South American spectacled bear than to the North American short-faced bears. This result suggests striking convergent evolution of giant forms in the two groups of short-faced bears (Arctodus and Arctotherium), potentially as an adaptation to dominate competition for megafaunal carcasses.","['Mitchell, Kieren J', 'Bray, Sarah C', 'Bover, Pere', 'Soibelzon, Leopoldo', 'Schubert, Blaine W', 'Prevosti, Francisco', 'Prieto, Alfredo', 'Martin, Fabiana', 'Austin, Jeremy J', 'Cooper, Alan']","['Mitchell KJ', 'Bray SC', 'Bover P', 'Soibelzon L', 'Schubert BW', 'Prevosti F', 'Prieto A', 'Martin F', 'Austin JJ', 'Cooper A']","['Australian Centre for Ancient DNA, School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia 5005, Australia kieren.mitchell@adelaide.edu.au.', 'Australian Centre for Ancient DNA, School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia 5005, Australia Acute Leukaemia Laboratory, Centre for Cancer Biology, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia 5000, Australia.', ""Australian Centre for Ancient DNA, School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia 5005, Australia Department of Biodiversity and Conservation, Institut Mediterrani d'Estudis Avancats (IMEDEA, CSIC-UIB), Illes Balears, Spain."", 'Division Paleontologia de Vertebrados, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET), Museo de La Plata, Argentina.', 'Department of Geosciences and Don Sundquist Center of Excellence in Paleontology, East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, TN 37614, USA.', 'Centro Regional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Transferencia Tecnologica de Anillaco (CRILAR), CONICET, La Rioja, Argentina.', 'Centro de Estudios del Hombre Austral: Instituto de la Patagonia, Universidad de Magallanes, Punta Arenas, Chile.', 'Centro de Estudios del Hombre Austral: Instituto de la Patagonia, Universidad de Magallanes, Punta Arenas, Chile.', 'Australian Centre for Ancient DNA, School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia 5005, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Ancient DNA, School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia 5005, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biol Lett,Biology letters,101247722,IM,"['Animals', '*Biological Evolution', 'Chile', 'DNA, Ancient/*analysis', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/*genetics', 'Fossils', 'Genome, Mitochondrial', 'Phylogeny', 'Ursidae/classification/*genetics']",2016/04/21 06:00,2017/04/22 06:00,['2016/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/22 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Biol Lett. 2016 Apr;12(4). pii: rsbl.2016.0062. doi: 10.1098/rsbl.2016.0062.,10.1098/rsbl.2016.0062 [doi] 20160062 [pii],,"['0 (DNA, Ancient)', '0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)']",PMC4881349,['NOTNLM'],"['Ursidae', 'great American biotic interchange', 'molecular dating', 'palaeontology']",,"['rsbl.2016.0062 [pii]', '10.1098/rsbl.2016.0062 [doi]']",,['(c) 2016 The Author(s).'],,,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3921-0262', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7067-4551']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In developing countries, it is difficult to obtain some of the recent drugs for optimal therapy and mostly well-known drugs proven to be effective are used. We assessed the efficacy of the combination of fludarabine, high-dose cytarabine, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (FLAG regimen) with or without idarubicin (IDA) in children with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. METHODS: Between September 2007 and May 2015, 18 children with refractory/relapsed AL attending our center, treated with a FLAG regimen with or without IDA, were included. The primary end point was the remission status of the bone marrow sampled after the first/second course of chemotherapy. The second end point was the duration of survival after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 7 patients (38.8%) after the first cycle, and at the end of the second cycle the total number of patients in CR was 8 (42.1%). All patients in CR underwent HSCT. The CR rate in patients who had IDA in combination therapy was 28.6%, and it was 50% in patients treated without IDA (p=0.36). Mean survival duration in transplanted patients was 24.7+/-20.8 months (minimum-maximum: 2-70, median: 25 months), and it was 2.7+/-1.64 months (minimum-maximum: 0-5, median: 3 months) in nontransplanted patients. Five of them (27.7%) were still alive at the end of the study and in CR. The median time of follow-up for these patients was 33 months (minimum-maximum: 25-70 months). CONCLUSION: FLAG regimens with or without IDA produced a CR of >24 months in 27.7% of children with relapsed/refractory AL and can be recommended as therapeutic options prior to HSCT in developing countries.","['Yilmaz Bengoa, Sebnem', 'Ataseven, Eda', 'Kizmazoglu, Deniz', 'Demir Yenigurbuz, Fatma', 'Erdem, Melek', 'Oren, Hale']","['Yilmaz Bengoa S', 'Ataseven E', 'Kizmazoglu D', 'Demir Yenigurbuz F', 'Erdem M', 'Oren H']","['Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Izmir, Turkey Phone: +90 505 5252163 E-mail: sebnemyilmaz14@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,,,2016/04/21 06:00,2016/04/21 06:01,['2016/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/21 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2017 Mar 1;34(1):46-51. doi: 10.4274/Tjh.2015.0411.

RESULTS: The median age was 73 years and 61.5% of patients had >30% BM blasts. Patients received AZA for a median of four cycles (range: 1-21). Initial overall response [including complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete recovery/partial remission] was 36.2%. Hematologic improvement (HI) of any kind was documented in 37.7% of all patients. HI was also documented in 27.1% of patients who were unresponsive to treatment. Median overall survival (OS) was 18 months for responders and 12 months for nonresponders (p=0.005). In the unresponsive patient group, any HI improved OS compared to patients without any HI (median OS was 14 months versus 10 months, p=0.068). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of <2, increasing number of AZA cycles (>/=5 courses), and any HI predicted better OS. Age, AML type, and BM blast percentage had no impact. CONCLUSION: We conclude that AZA is effective and well tolerated in elderly comorbid AML patients, irrespective of BM blast count, and HI should be considered a sufficient response to continue treatment with AZA.","['Tombak, Anil', 'Ucar, Mehmet Ali', 'Akdeniz, Aydan', 'Tiftik, Eyup Naci', 'Goren Sahin, Deniz', 'Akay, Olga Meltem', 'Yildirim, Murat', 'Nevruz, Oral', 'Kis, Cem', 'Gurkan, Emel', 'Solmaz, Serife Medeni', 'Ozcan, Mehmet Ali', 'Yildirim, Rahsan', 'Berber, Ilhami', 'Erkurt, Mehmet Ali', 'Firatli Tuglular, Tulin', 'Tarkun, Pinar', 'Yavasoglu, Irfan', 'Dogu, Mehmet Hilmi', 'Sari, Ismail', 'Merter, Mustafa', 'Ozcan, Muhit', 'Yildizhan, Esra', 'Kaynar, Leylagul', 'Mehtap, Ozgur', 'Uysal, Ayse', 'Sahin, Fahri', 'Salim, Ozan', 'Sungur, Mehmet Ali']","['Tombak A', 'Ucar MA', 'Akdeniz A', 'Tiftik EN', 'Goren Sahin D', 'Akay OM', 'Yildirim M', 'Nevruz O', 'Kis C', 'Gurkan E', 'Solmaz SM', 'Ozcan MA', 'Yildirim R', 'Berber I', 'Erkurt MA', 'Firatli Tuglular T', 'Tarkun P', 'Yavasoglu I', 'Dogu MH', 'Sari I', 'Merter M', 'Ozcan M', 'Yildizhan E', 'Kaynar L', 'Mehtap O', 'Uysal A', 'Sahin F', 'Salim O', 'Sungur MA']","['Mersin University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Mersin, Turkey, Phone: +90 532 346 07 67, E-mail: aniltombak@mersin.edu.tr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Comorbidity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2016/04/21 06:00,2017/03/18 06:00,['2016/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2016 Dec 1;33(4):273-280. doi: 10.4274/tjh.2015.0203.

Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a small peptide hormone and has mitogenic and antiapoptotic effects, and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) has antiproliferative effects on cells. In this study, we investigated plasma levels of both IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 in patients with CLL compared with controls, and we compared these plasma levels according to prognostic factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed CLL who were being followed at the Haseki Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey, and volunteers were included in this study. Patients were stratified according to the Rai staging system. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 17.0 for Windows. RESULTS: Forty-three patients [16 women (37%) and 27 men (63%)] were enrolled in this study. Twenty-one volunteers (11 women, 10 men) were included in the control group. The median age of the patients was 65+/-9 years (range: 18-63 years), and subjects in the control group were 68+/-8 years old (range: 18-63 years). Even though the plasma levels of IGF-1 were higher and those of IGFBP-3 were lower and the ratio of IGF-I/IGFBP-3 was higher in comparison with the control group, these differences were not statistically significant (p>0.05). In the study group, IGF-1 levels appeared to be increased in parallel to more advanced Rai stages. There were no significant differences between the other groups (p=0.105). CONCLUSION: Plasma IGF-I levels were found higher in patients than in the control group and plasma IGFBP-3 levels were lower; however, neither result was statistically significant. Plasma IGF level increment was observed in concordance with Rai staging. These results prompted us to think that plasma IGF-1 levels in CLL patients are correlated with tumor burden and Rai staging and therefore could be a valuable prognostic factor. Further comprehensive studies are required to support our results.","['Ayer, Mesut', 'Sakin, Abdullah', 'Ay, Selim', 'Ayer, Aylin', 'Sazak, Elif Gokcen', 'Aktan, Melih']","['Ayer M', 'Sakin A', 'Ay S', 'Ayer A', 'Sazak EG', 'Aktan M']","['Haseki Training and Research Hospital, Clinic of Hematology, Istanbul, Turkey, Phone: +90 212 529 44 00/2048, E-mail: mesutayerdr@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/*blood/genetics', '*Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Burden', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/21 06:00,2017/03/18 06:00,['2016/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2016 Dec 1;33(4):335-338. doi: 10.4274/tjh.2016.0075.

We analyzed the clinical features of BKV-HC following Allo-SCT and reported the utility of leflunomide therapy for BKV-HC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2005 to June 2014, among the 69 patients underwent Allo-SCT in our institution, the patients who experienced BKV-HC were investigated retrospectively. RESULTS: Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) was observed in 30 patients (43.5%), and among them, 18 patients (26.1%) were identified as BKV-HC. The median age of the patients (12 males and 6 females) was 45 years (range, 13-63). Patients received Allo-SCT from acute myeloid leukemia (n=11), aplastic anemia (n=4), myelodysplastic syndrome (n=2), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n=1).The donor types were a HLA-matched sibling donor for 6 patients, HLA-matched unrelated donor for 9, and a haploidentical familial donor for 2. The median onset and duration of BKV-HC was on day 21 (range, 7-97) after transplantation and 22 days (range, 6-107). Eleven patients (62.1%) had grade I-II HC and seven patients (38.9%) had grade III-IV (high-grade) HC. Among the seven patients who had high-grade HC, one had complete response (CR), one partial response (PR), and five no response (NR). Among the five non-responders, one died of BKV-HC associated complications. The remaining four patients were treated with leflunomide, with achieving CR (n=2) and PR (n=2). The median duration from the start of leflunomide therapy to response was 13 days (range, 8-17 days). All patients tolerated the leflunomide treatment well, with three patients having mild gastrointestinal symptoms, including anorexia and abdominal bloating. CONCLUSION: BKV-HC was commonly observed in patients with HC following Allo-SCT. In high-grade BKV-HC patients who fail supportive care, leflunomide may be a feasible option without significant toxicity.","['Park, Young Hoon', 'Lim, Joo Han', 'Yi, Hyeon Gyu', 'Lee, Moon Hee', 'Kim, Chul Soo']","['Park YH', 'Lim JH', 'Yi HG', 'Lee MH', 'Kim CS']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,,,2016/04/21 06:00,2016/04/21 06:00,['2016/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [medline]']",aheadofprint,Turk J Haematol. 2016 Apr 18. doi: 10.4274/Tjh.2015.0131.,10.4274/Tjh.2015.0131 [doi],20160418,,PMC5111468,,,"['The authors of this paper have no conflicts of interest, including specific', 'financial interests, relationships, and/or affiliations relevant to the subject', 'matter or materials included.']",['10.4274/Tjh.2015.0131 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This disease has been previously described in patients that were immunocompromised due to a hematological malignancy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old man with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia was treated with imatinib. He was diagnosed with ascending colon cancer and underwent curative surgery. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he was healthy at 6 months after surgery, allowing for reinitiation of imatinib therapy. After the reinitiation of therapy, a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a mass shadow in the right iliopsoas muscle. This lesion was clinically diagnosed as recurrent colon cancer with an abscess, which was resected surgically. A pathological examination uncovered both edema and inflammation. Two months after the second surgery, imatinib therapy was reinitiated; however, he again developed painful swelling and erythema in his right thigh. A CT scan revealed a similar shadow as described previously. He was then diagnosed with pyomyositis; he underwent incisional drainage and was administered linezolid. Following the treatment for pyomyositis, there was no cancer recurrence or evidence of any recurrent pyomyositis. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this case suggest that both undergoing surgery and receiving imatinib therapy may modulate an individual's immune response, whereby the surgical site becomes more prone to infection and may predispose an individual to pyomyositis. The case report is followed by a discussion of the literature regarding this disease, including potential risk factors and the underlying pathogenesis.","['Takebayashi, Katsushi', 'Sonoda, Hiromichi', 'Shimizu, Tomoharu', 'Ohta, Hiroyuki', 'Minamiguchi, Hitoshi', 'Ishida, Mitsuaki', 'Mekata, Eiji', 'Endo, Yoshihiro', 'Tani, Tohru', 'Tani, Masaji']","['Takebayashi K', 'Sonoda H', 'Shimizu T', 'Ohta H', 'Minamiguchi H', 'Ishida M', 'Mekata E', 'Endo Y', 'Tani T', 'Tani M']","['Department of Surgery, Shiga University of Medical Science, Seta Tsukinowa-cho, Otsu, Shiga, 520-2192, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Shiga University of Medical Science, Seta Tsukinowa-cho, Otsu, Shiga, 520-2192, Japan. hirosono@belle.shiga-med.ac.jp.', 'Department of Surgery, Shiga University of Medical Science, Seta Tsukinowa-cho, Otsu, Shiga, 520-2192, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Shiga University of Medical Science, Seta Tsukinowa-cho, Otsu, Shiga, 520-2192, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Shiga University of Medical Science, Seta Tsukinowa-cho, Otsu, Shiga, 520-2192, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Shiga University of Medical Science, Seta Tsukinowa-cho, Otsu, Shiga, 520-2192, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Shiga University of Medical Science, Seta Tsukinowa-cho, Otsu, Shiga, 520-2192, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Nursing, Shiga University of Medical Science, Seta Tsukinowa-cho, Otsu, Shiga, 520-2192, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Shiga University of Medical Science, Seta Tsukinowa-cho, Otsu, Shiga, 520-2192, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Shiga University of Medical Science, Seta Tsukinowa-cho, Otsu, Shiga, 520-2192, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,World J Surg Oncol,World journal of surgical oncology,101170544,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/drug therapy/*surgery', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Pyomyositis/*etiology/pathology']",2016/04/21 06:00,2017/01/10 06:00,['2016/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/10 06:00 [medline]']",epublish,World J Surg Oncol. 2016 Apr 19;14:116. doi: 10.1186/s12957-016-0873-x.,10.1186/s12957-016-0873-x [doi],20160419,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",PMC4837566,['NOTNLM'],"['Imatinib', 'Pyomyositis', 'Surgical site']",,"['10.1186/s12957-016-0873-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12957-016-0873-x [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, prognosis of the advanced disease [i.e. Burkitt's cell leukemia (BCL)] has not been reported with current treatment modalities except for a few prospective trials. The aim of this study is to compare the prognoses of BCL patients with similarly treated and nontransplanted patients with other types of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and with ALL patients that underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in their first remissions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, BCL patients aged between 16 and 63 who were admitted between 2000 and 2014 to the hospitals of Hacettepe or Gazi University and were treated with intensive therapies aimed at cure were included. All ALL patients who were treated with a similar protocol not including transplantation during the same period (NT-ALL group) and all ALL patients who underwent ASCT in the first complete remission during the same period (T-ALL group) served as control groups. RESULTS: The central nervous system or extramedullary involvement rates, lactate dehydrogenase levels, and white blood cell counts at diagnosis were higher in the BCL group than the NT-ALL group and these differences were significant. BCL patients had disease-free survival (DFS) durations comparable with the T-ALL cohort but NT-ALL patients had significantly shorter DFS durations. Both cumulative relapse incidence and cumulative nonrelapse mortality were higher in NT-ALL patients compared to the T-ALL group and BCL patients. CONCLUSION: DFS in BCL patients treated with a widely accepted modern regimen, R-HyperCVAD, is comparable to results in other ALL patients receiving allogeneic transplantation. Our results are in agreement with a few prospective noncomparative studies suggesting no further need for stem cell transplantation in BCL.","['Malkan, Umit Yavuz', 'Gunes, Gursel', 'Goker, Hakan', 'Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim C', 'Acar, Kadir', 'Eliacik, Eylem', 'Etgul, Sezgin', 'Aslan, Tuncay', 'Balaban, Seda', 'Demiroglu, Haluk', 'Ozcebe, Osman I', 'Sayinalp, Nilgun', 'Aksu, Salih', 'Buyukasik, Yahya']","['Malkan UY', 'Gunes G', 'Goker H', 'Haznedaroglu IC', 'Acar K', 'Eliacik E', 'Etgul S', 'Aslan T', 'Balaban S', 'Demiroglu H', 'Ozcebe OI', 'Sayinalp N', 'Aksu S', 'Buyukasik Y']","['Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey, Phone: +90 532 778 00 87, E-mail : umitmalkan@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/diagnosis/*mortality/*therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/therapeutic use', 'Disease Management', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/21 06:00,2017/03/18 06:00,['2016/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2016 Dec 1;33(4):281-285. doi: 10.4274/tjh.2015.0088.

EM AML is diagnosed based on H&E stains with ancillary studies including flow cytometry and cytogenetics. Isolated EM AML is often misdiagnosed as large cell lymphoma or other lymphoproliferative disorder. The clinical presentation is often dictated by the mass effect and the location of the tumor. The optimal treatment remains unclear. High-dose chemotherapy, radiation, surgical resection, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation are all modalities that can be incorporated into the therapy of EM AML. Cytarabine-based remission induction regimens have been the most commonly used in the upfront setting. There are limited data about the optimal consolidation. Transplantation is ideally offered for high risk disease or in the relapsed setting. In this manuscript, we will review the recent literature about EM AML, focusing on therapy and proposing a treatment algorithm for managing this rare form of leukemia. Further studies addressing risk stratification, role of molecular and genetic aberrations, and optimal treatment strategies are warranted.","['Solh, Melhem', 'Solomon, Scott', 'Morris, Lawrence', 'Holland, Kent', 'Bashey, Asad']","['Solh M', 'Solomon S', 'Morris L', 'Holland K', 'Bashey A']","['The Blood and Marrow Transplant Program at Northside Hospital, Atlanta, GA, USA.

A key element of the initiation translation complex is eIF4E (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E). The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways play important roles in the regulation of eIF4E expression and downstream functional outcomes. Mitogen-activated protein kinase interacting protein kinases (Mnks) control translation by phosphorylation of eIF4E, whereas the mTOR kinase phosphorylates/de-activates the eIF4E inhibitor, 4E-BP1, to release translational repression. Both pathways are often abnormally activated in leukemia cells and promote cell survival events by controlling expression of oncogenic proteins. Targeting these pathways may provide approaches to avoid aberrant proliferation and neoplastic transformation.","['Kosciuczuk, Ewa M', 'Saleiro, Diana', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Kosciuczuk EM', 'Saleiro D', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effect of TKIs on allo-HSCT in CML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this quasi-experimental study, we compared patient, disease, and transplantation characteristics as well as allo-HSCT outcomes between the pre-TKI era (before 2002) and the post-TKI era (2002 and later) in patients with CML. A total of 193 allo-HSCTs were performed between 1989 and 2012. RESULTS: Patients in the post-TKI era had more advanced disease (>chronic phase 1) at the time of transplant and more frequently received reduced-intensity conditioning compared to patients in the pre-TKI era. Relapse/progression occurred more frequently in the year >/=2002 group than in the year <2002 group (48% vs. 32% at 5 years, p=0.01); however, overall survival (OS) was similar in these two groups (5-year survival was 50.8% vs. 59.5%, respectively; p=0.3). TKIs (with donor lymphocyte infusions or alone) for treatment of relapse after allo-HSCT were available in the post-TKI era and were associated with improved OS. While the rates of hematologic remission at 3 months after allo-HSCT were similar between TKI eras, patients having remission had better disease-free survival (DFS) [relative risk (RR): 0.15, confidence interval (CI) 95%: 0.09-0.24, p<0.001] and OS (RR: 0.14, CI 95%: 0.09-0.23, p<0.001). Male allo-HSCT recipients had worse DFS (RR: 1.7, CI 95%: 1.2-2.5, p=0.007) and OS (RR: 1.7, CI 95%: 1.1-2.6, p=0.02) than females. CONCLUSION: TKIs are an effective option for the treatment of relapse after allo-HSCT in CML. Hematologic remission after allo-HSCT is also an important factor for survival in CML patients.","['Ozen, Mehmet', 'Ustun, Celalettin', 'Ozturk, Bengi', 'Topcuoglu, Pervin', 'Arat, Mutlu', 'Gunduz, Mehmet', 'Atilla, Erden', 'Bolat, Gulsen', 'Arslan, Onder', 'Demirer, Taner', 'Akan, Hamdi', 'Ilhan, Osman', 'Beksac, Meral', 'Gurman, Gunhan', 'Ozcan, Muhit']","['Ozen M', 'Ustun C', 'Ozturk B', 'Topcuoglu P', 'Arat M', 'Gunduz M', 'Atilla E', 'Bolat G', 'Arslan O', 'Demirer T', 'Akan H', 'Ilhan O', 'Beksac M', 'Gurman G', 'Ozcan M']","['Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Ankara, Turkey Phone: +90-312-466 3550 E-mail: ozcan@hemoterapi.com, muhit.ozcan@medicine.ankara.edu.tr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Non-Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Sex Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/21 06:00,2017/04/11 06:00,['2016/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2017 Mar 1;34(1):16-26. doi: 10.4274/tjh.2015.0346.

This study aimed to retrospectively study the impact of eosinophilia on the outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation by taking into account the influence of corticosteroid therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 204 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from January 2001 to December 2010. RESULTS: The median age was 43 years (minimum-maximum: 17-65 years). Myeloablative conditioning was used in 153 patients and reduced intensity conditioning was employed in 51 patients. Donor cells were from bone marrow in 132 patients, peripheral blood in 34, and cord blood in 38. Eosinophilia was detected in 71 patients and there was no significant predictor of eosinophilia by multivariate analysis. There was no relationship between occurrence of eosinophilia and the incidence or grade of acute graft-versus-host disease when the patients were stratified according to corticosteroid treatment. Although eosinophilia was a prognostic factor for 5-year overall survival by univariate analysis, it was not a significant indicator by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the clinical significance of eosinophilia in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation should be assessed with consideration of systemic corticosteroid administration.","['Yamamoto, Wataru', 'Ogusa, Eriko', 'Matsumoto, Kenji', 'Maruta, Atsuo', 'Ishigatsubo, Yoshiaki', 'Kanamori, Heiwa']","['Yamamoto W', 'Ogusa E', 'Matsumoto K', 'Maruta A', 'Ishigatsubo Y', 'Kanamori H']","['Kanagawa Cancer Center, Department of Hematology, Yokohama, Japan, Phone: 81-45-391-5761, E-mail: watadesu@yahoo.co.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Eosinophilia/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2016/04/21 06:00,2017/07/04 06:00,['2016/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/04 06:00 [medline]']",ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2016 Sep 5;33(3):196-201. doi: 10.4274/tjh.2015.0047.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: FRG polymorphisms were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Survival status, MTX levels, and toxicity data were retrieved from 106 patients' charts. RESULTS: The allele frequencies for the FRG polymorphisms were as follows: TS 2R 41.0%, 3R 57.0%, and 4R 2.0%; MTRR 66A 42.4% and 66G 57.6%; MTHFR 677C 59.3% and 677T 40.7%; and MTHFR 1298A 58.1% and 1298C 41.9%. At the 48th hour of HD-MTX infusion, serum MTX was significantly higher in patients who had TS 2R/3R/4R variants as compared to those with wild-type TS (p<0.05). No significant differences were detected with respect to event-free survival or toxicity between wild-type and other FRG variants. CONCLUSION: The frequencies of FRG polymorphisms in Turkish children with ALL are similar to those reported in other Caucasian populations. This is the first published finding of the TS 3R/4R variant in the Turkish population. The results indicate that HD-MTX can be tolerated by leukemic children with some polymorphic variants of FRG; thus, it may prevent future risk of leukemic relapse.","['Yazicioglu, Burcu', 'Kaya, Zuhre', 'Guntekin Ergun, Sezen', 'Percin, Ferda', 'Kocak, Ulker', 'Yenicesu, Idil', 'Gursel, Turkiz']","['Yazicioglu B', 'Kaya Z', 'Guntekin Ergun S', 'Percin F', 'Kocak U', 'Yenicesu I', 'Gursel T']","['Gazi University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Ankara, Turkey E-mail: zuhrekaya@gazi.edu.tr.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Ferredoxin-NADP Reductase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/mortality', 'Survival Rate']",2016/04/21 06:00,2018/02/09 06:00,['2016/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2017 Jun 5;34(2):143-150. doi: 10.4274/tjh.2016.0007.

In the current study, we aimed to evaluate endocrine side effects of treatment in ALL survivors who were in remission for at least 2 years. METHODS: Sixty patients diagnosed with ALL, who were in remission for at least 2 years, were cross-sectionally evaluated for long-term endocrine complications. RESULTS: The median age of the patients at the time of diagnosis, at the time of chemotherapy completion, and at the time of the study was 5 years (minimum-maximum: 1.7-13), 8 years (minimum-maximum: 4.25-16), and 11.7 years (minimum-maximum: 7-22), respectively, and median follow-up time was 4 years (minimum-maximum: 2-10.1). At least one complication was observed in 81.6% of patients. Vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency (46.6%), overweight/obesity (33.3%), and dyslipidemia (23.3%) were the three most frequent endocrine complications. Other complications seen in our patients were hyperparathyroidism secondary to vitamin D deficiency (15%), insulin resistance (11.7%), hypertension (8.3%), short stature (6.7%), thyroid function abnormality (5%), precocious puberty (3.3%), and decreased bone mineral density (1.7%). There were no statistically significant correlations between endocrine complications and age, sex, and radiotherapy, except vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency, which was significantly more frequent in pubertal ALL survivors compared to prepubertal ALL survivors (57.5% and 25%, respectively, p=0.011). CONCLUSION: A high frequency of endocrine complications was observed in the current study. The high frequency of late effects necessitates long-term surveillance of this population to better understand the incidence of late-occurring events and the defining of high-risk features that can facilitate developing intervention strategies for early detection and prevention.","['Bayram, Cengiz', 'Yarali, Nese', 'Fettah, Ali', 'Demirel, Fatma', 'Tavil, Betul', 'Kara, Abdurrahman', 'Tunc, Bahattin']","['Bayram C', 'Yarali N', 'Fettah A', 'Demirel F', 'Tavil B', 'Kara A', 'Tunc B']","[""Ankara Children's Hematology and Oncology Hospital, Clinic of Pediatric Hematology, Ankara, Turkey Phone: +90 505 839 60 92 E-mail: cengizbayram2013@gmail.com""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,,,2016/04/21 06:00,2016/04/21 06:01,['2016/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/21 06:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2017 Mar 1;34(1):40-45. doi: 10.4274/tjh.2015.0332.
