RIA was performed by coupling rabbit anti-human IgG (AHIgG) to acrylamide beads to make immunobeads. The specificity and sensitivity of binding of human [125I]IgG to immunobeads permitted detection of as little as 10(-10) M unlabeled human IgG or aggregated human IgG (AHIgG) in competitive assay. The cells were incubated with an AHIgG concentration (3 x 10(-10) M) giving 25% inhibition in the RIA; unbound AHIgG concentration was then measured in the cell supernatants using RIA. Results show that Fc gamma receptors could be detected at 20 degrees C or at 37 degrees C (but not at 4 degrees C) on the four B cell lines tested. At whatever temperature of incubation, Fc gamma receptors were not detected on three T cell lines nor on two 'non T-non B' cell lines. This method allows screening of a large number of Fc gamma receptor positive cells. It is also useful for detecting Fc gamma receptors in membrane preparations or in detergent extracts of human B cell membranes.","['Barel, M', 'Frade, R']","['Barel M', 'Frade R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunoglobulin G', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', '*Radioimmunoassay', '*Receptors, Fc', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-1759(80)90197-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(80)90197-0 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1980;37(2):123-31. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(80)90197-0.,,,,,

Differences in mean Coulter volume among the lymphomas were due both to the intrinsic differences in mean G1 cell Coulter volume and to the presence of increased fractions of larger S and G2 cells, especially among the large B cell lymphomas. However, the relative contribution of large non-G1 cells to the overall population Coulter volume distribution was a relatively minor one; the presence of cells in S did not increase mean Coulter volume by more than 10%, even in samples with high S fractions. There was a good correlation between mean G1 cell Coulter volume and the log of the fraction of cells in S among the B cell lymphomas (r = 0.55). Evidence is presented that within individual samples, large cells proliferate more rapidly than small cells. This was seen in every case, both in the normal samples and in the lymphomas, and in the T cell lymphomas as well as in the B cell lymphomas. Aneuploidy was detected by flow cytometry in 11 cases; in 7 cases the aneuploid cell component could be analyzed separately from the diploid cell component on the basis of cell Coulter volume differences. The aneuploid components of diploid-aneuploid mixtures had higher S fractions than the diploid components in six of seven cases (0.16 +/- 0.04 [SE] vs. 0.08 +/- 0.02).

A radioimmunoassay, using anti-idiotypic antibody raised against the surface IgM of these cells, has been used to estimate levels of extracellular IgM produced both in vitro and in vivo. Analyses of the contributions to such IgM from the cell surface and from an export pathway have been made by examining the effect of prior removal of surface Fab mu by papain, and by following the fate of radio-iodinated surface IgM. Results suggest that the extracellular IgM arises predominantly from an export pathway, being exported in both pentameric and monomeric forms. Only a minute contribution, possibly in the form of vesicle-bound monomeric IgM, appears to derive from the cell surface. Radioimmunoassay was used to monitor the increasing levels of this leukaemic cell product during the course of the disease.

The enzyme is stable in frozen tissues for at least 1 week, in frozen homogenate for several months, or after overnight dialysis at 4 degrees C in 0.25 M sucrose. The adenosine deaminase of chronic myelogenous leukemic (CML) cells has a Km of 0.6 mM and a Vmax of 183 mumols x 10(-2)/g of cells/minute. All species have highest activities in spleen and intestine. Kidney activity is highest in rat and lowest in man. The human brain has higher activity than the mouse or rat brain, and activity is higher in mouse liver than in human or rat liver. Activity in lung tissues is moderate and similar in all three species. The mean activity in CML cells is 195 mumols x 10(-2)/g of cells/minute, and the activity is higher in patients with CML in blast cell crisis. Acute myelogenous and lymphocytic leukemia cells also have very high activities. Drug concentrations required for inhibiting 50% of CML enzyme activity are 10 nM or erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine (EHNA), 0.6 nM of coformycin, and 0.3 nM of 2'-deoxycoformycin. Preincubation of the enzyme with coformycin, but not with EHNA, enhances the inhibition. In view of the high adenosine deaminase activities in tissues and the enhancement of the therapeutic effect of ara-A by inhibitors in mouse tumor systems, clinical trials of these combinations are warranted. They may be particularly beneficial to patients with CML in blast cell crisis.","['Ho, D H', 'Pincus, C', 'Carter, C J', 'Benjamin, R S', 'Freireich, E J', 'Bodey, G P Sr']","['Ho DH', 'Pincus C', 'Carter CJ', 'Benjamin RS', 'Freireich EJ', 'Bodey GP Sr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,"['0 (Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors)', '11033-22-0 (Coformycin)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '59262-86-1 (9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Deaminase/*metabolism', 'Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'Brain/enzymology', 'Coformycin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intestines/enzymology', 'Kidney/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Lung/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/*metabolism', 'Pentostatin', 'Rats', 'Spleen/enzymology', 'Vidarabine/*pharmacology']",1980/04/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1980/04/01 00:00'],"['1980/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1980/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1980 Apr-May;64(4-5):629-33.,,"['CA-05831/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-14528/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-05511/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,

However, spleen T-cells from tumor-bearing (A/Sn X C57Bl/6)F1 mice were efficient killers against C57BL/6-derived RBL-5 cells. When tested for viral antigens by sera from mice with regressing atumors, YAC-1 and RBL-5 cells cross-reacted. The anti-RBL-5 effect of spleen cells from A/Sn X C57BL/6)F1 tumor bearers was blocked in cold target competition experiments by YAC-1 cells, which suggested the expression of a CTL target structure on YAC-1 cells. The activity against YAC-1 cells in spleen suspensions of both tumor-bearing and control (A/Sn X C57BL/6)F1 mice seemed to be an NK phenomenon entirely, because blocking occurred neither with RBL-5 cells nor with freshly prepared YAC lymphoma cells, both of which have low sensitivity to NK effects. Spleen cells from (A/Sn X C57BL/6)F1 regressors were stimulated to a secondary CTL response in vitro by YAC-1 and RBL-5 cells, which further indicated that YAC-1 cells express the M-MuSV-specific CTL target structure. These experiments also showed that YAC-1 cells could be lysed by CTL. YAC-1 cells did not induce a secondary response in A/Sn regressors, which indicated a lack of M-MuSV-induced CTL memory cells in this strain. The result was not due to a general unreactivity of A/Sn mice against YAC-1 cells, because spleen cells from YAC-1-immunized mice exhibited strong T-cell-mediated anti-YAC-1 activity after in vitro cultivation. Thus tumor regression seems to occur without the production of CTL in A/Sn mice.","['Becker, S', 'Klein, E']","['Becker S', 'Klein E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Cell Line', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Lymphoma/etiology/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/etiology/*immunology', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/etiology/*immunology']",1980/10/01 00:00,1980/10/01 00:01,['1980/10/01 00:00'],"['1980/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/65.4.811 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1980 Oct;65(4):811-6. doi: 10.1093/jnci/65.4.811.,,['N01-CB43921/CB/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,

However, sera absorbed with the T-cell line HSB remained cytotoxic for thymocytes, MOLT-4F, and most (6/9) T-cell cancers tested. The peripheral blood cell-absorbed sera precipitated a molecule with an apparent molecular weight of 48,000 from lactoperoxidase-labeled thymocytes but not from similarly labeled peripheral blood lymphocytes. The ability of the sera to precipitate this antigen was decreased by absorption with thymocytes, MOLT-4, or LBL cells but not by absorption with HSB, SB, or non-T, non-B ALL cells.

MLD of patients in clinical stages III and IV was significantly lower as compared with MLD of patients in stages 0, I, and II (P < 0.001). The actuarial curve of 57 patients showed a roughly estimated median survival probability of 43 months. This was of more than 54 months in patients with normal or increased MLD, but only of 22 months in those with a decreased MLD. The difference between these 2 survival curves was statistically significant (P < 0.01). A reduced peripheral blood lymphocyte size, as estimated in suspension by means of transmission electron microscopy, appears to have a bad prognostic significance.","['Rozman, C', 'Montserrat, E', 'Feliu, E', 'Woessner, S']","['Rozman C', 'Montserrat E', 'Feliu E', 'Woessner S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",1980/04/01 00:00,1980/04/01 00:01,['1980/04/01 00:00'],"['1980/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1980.tb01590.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1980 Apr;24(4):315-20. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1980.tb01590.x.,,,,,

The methylcellulose culture technique (Iscove et al 1974) was employed in the absence of an exogenous source of colony stimulating factor (CSF). During active disease, CFUc colony formation was absent from patients with ALL, but was present in 2 patients with LSA. 2 therapeutic regimens were employed. Colony formation from bone marrow CFUc was highly variable during remission maintained by either regimen, with no clear relation to clinical stage, number of monocytes or circulating neutrophils. Patients with LSA consistently had high numbers of bone marrow CFUc. CFUc were low or absent from the blood. In conclusion, CFUc are absent from the bone marrow in active ALL, but may be present in active LSA. For the purpose of monitoring children with ALL during therapy, determination of blood or bone marrow CFUc was not found in this study to be helpful.","['Prindull, G', 'van der Meulen, N', 'Jentsch, E', 'Prindull, B', 'Schroter, W']","['Prindull G', 'van der Meulen N', 'Jentsch E', 'Prindull B', 'Schroter W']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '9004-67-5 (Methylcellulose)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', '*Colony-Stimulating Factors', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*blood/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Methylcellulose']",1980/04/01 00:00,1980/04/01 00:01,['1980/04/01 00:00'],"['1980/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1980.tb01587.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1980 Apr;24(4):292-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1980.tb01587.x.,,,,,

The antibody bound has been quantitated by secondary binding of a radiolabelled anti-immunoglobulin. It was shown that the leukaemic cell lacks the peripheral thymus-derived lymphocyte antigens which the normal PVG peripheral T lymphocyte carries. In this respect, in its reduced distribution of the W3/13 antigen compared with T cells, as revealed by binding of the hybridoma monoclonal antibody W3/13, and in its abundance of Thy 1.1 antigen, the leukaemic cell resembles the immature thymocyte, rather than the mature T lymphocyte. This antigenic profile represents an illustration of de-differentiation of tumour cells at the molecular level. Two antigens shared by PVG leukaemic cells, normal PVG peripheral T cells and thymocytes were indicated by absorption studies with antisera against the leukaemic cell. In an immunotherapy model, treatment with AUG cells sensitized against the PVG leukaemia cell resulted in elimination of leukaemic cells from PVG rats. The peripheral T cell antigens clearly cannot be antigen(s) recognized by the AUG rat on the leukaemic cell, since the present studies indicate the absence of peripheral T cell antigens on this cell.","['Thompson, A R', 'Roser, B']","['Thompson AR', 'Roser B']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Rats', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1980/04/01 00:00,1980/04/01 00:01,['1980/04/01 00:00'],"['1980/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/00313028009060072 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathology. 1980 Apr;12(2):189-201. doi: 10.3109/00313028009060072.,,,,,

It has been observed recently in G6PD heterozygous patients with chronic phase CML that the non-E-rosetting lymphocytes were restricted to a single enzyme type, indicating that some lymphoid cells must also arise from the leukaemic clone. Surface or cytoplasmic immunoglobulin could be detected in up to 46% of the cells of these isolated non-T-lymphocyte populations, which suggested that cells from the CML clone were capable of differentiating into B lymphocytes. To investigate this further, we established Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from patients with CML and studied chromosomes and G6PD to determine whether progenitor B lymphocytes for any of the cell lines had originated from the CML clone. We report here direct evidence that immunoglobulin-synthesizing B lymphocytes can arise from the CML stem cell clone.","['Martin, P J', 'Najfeld, V', 'Hansen, J A', 'Penfold, G K', 'Jacobson, R J', 'Fialkow, P J']","['Martin PJ', 'Najfeld V', 'Hansen JA', 'Penfold GK', 'Jacobson RJ', 'Fialkow PJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*immunology/pathology']",1980/09/04 00:00,1980/09/04 00:01,['1980/09/04 00:00'],"['1980/09/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/04 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/287049a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1980 Sep 4;287(5777):49-50. doi: 10.1038/287049a0.,,"['CA 16448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 17265/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,

The addition of splenic macrophage-enriched preparations from either FBL-3-immune or normal mice suppressed the cytotoxic response of immune spleen cells treated with carbonyl iron and magnet. This suppressive effect of splenic macrophages presented a marked contrast with the enhancing effect of normal peritoneal macrophages on the same cell-mediated cytotoxic response, indicating regulation of the generation of killer T cells against a syngeneic tumor by functionally distinct macrophages. The suppressed cell-mediated cytotoxic response against FBL-3 cells by immune spleen cells was augmented by the addition of indomethacin to the culture medium, and this augmentation with indomethacin was greatly decreased by depletion of phagocytic cells from the immune spleen by treatment with carbonyl iron and magnet.

The evidence of serotonergic-endocrine interrelations with regard to adrenal, thyroid, gonadal and prolactin functions is fast accumulating. Our study extends the importance of those interrelations to some functions of the immune system. Multiple administration of 5-hydroxytryptamine(serotonin) or its precursor, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan(5-HTPH), produces marked depression of T cell dependent, humoral, hemolytic, primary immune response in mice. L-tryptophan, a more distant serotonin precursor, produces slight but significant depression of this immune response. Multiple treatment of mice infected with Friend Leukemia Virus (FLV) with serotonin or 5-HTPH alone or in combination with cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) results in significant delay of the clinical progression of the infection. L-tryptophan produces a modest but significant improvement. Administration of serotonin or 5-HTPH causes a marked reduction of the thymus weight. It is reasonable to postulate that the described effects result from the thymus involution which affects the T cell compartment of the immune system. This is the consequence of hormonal imbalance caused by the alteration of the serotonin biosynthetic pathway in the brain. The adrenal cortex is not implicated in the mediation of this effect. Since many clinically used drugs affect the serotonin metabolism, the clinical consequences of the resulting alteration of the immunological responsiveness should be considered.","['Bliznakov, E G']",['Bliznakov EG'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Med,Journal of medicine,7505566,"['333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'C1LJO185Q9 (5-Hydroxytryptophan)']",IM,"['5-Hydroxytryptophan/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibody Formation/drug effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Serotonin/*pharmacology', 'Tryptophan/pharmacology']",1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Med. 1980;11(2-3):81-105.,,,,,

The sera were raised in rabbits against human thymocytes (anti-HTY) and against T-cell cultured in the presence of conditioned medium derived from lymphocytes stimulated with PHA (anti-CTC). Both sera were absorbed to obtain a T-cell specific pattern of reaction and were further absorbed with normal peripheral blood lymphocytes or with each of the four T-HCL. The anti-HTY sera absorbed with CEM, 8402, and HSB-2 still reacted with MOLT-4. A similar pattern of reactivity was found only with the anti-CTC absorbed with 8402, whereas, after absorptions with the other cell lines, this antiserum was unreactive against MOLT-4. After absorption with normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, anti-HTY still reacted with thymocytes and MOLT-4 but was negative on CTC. In contrast, anti-CTC absorbed with peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) was negative on thymocytes and MOLT-4 but still reacted against CTC. Our data confirm the existence of a T-cell antigen (probably an early T-cell differentiation antigen) shared between thymus and MOLT-4. This antigen is not expressed on CTC, although these cells express an antigenic pattern more complex than PBL. Antisera to CTC represents a source of anti-T cell sera free of contamination with antibodies to early thymus-related antigens but containing other T-cell-related specificities.","['Pandolfi, F', 'Strong, D M', 'Bonnard, G D', 'Herberman, R B']","['Pandolfi F', 'Strong DM', 'Bonnard GD', 'Herberman RB']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,In Vitro,In vitro,0063733,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Antilymphocyte Serum', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1980/09/01 00:00,1980/09/01 00:01,['1980/09/01 00:00'],"['1980/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02619309 [doi]'],ppublish,In Vitro. 1980 Sep;16(9):754-60. doi: 10.1007/BF02619309.,,['Y01-CB-00319/CB/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,

It has been established by stepwise selective inhibition of Fc- and C3-receptors and surface immunoglobulins that human Fc- and C3-receptors do not take part in rosetting with mouse red blood cells, whilst surface immunoglobulins, particularly IgM or near-located structures, are implicated in the reaction of lymphocytes with mouse red blood cells. Multiple analysis of lymphocyte receptors has been performed in patients with different immunologic disorders. A significant decrease in the EM--RFC level was found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In patients with dys-and hypoimmunoglobulinemia, the content of EM--RFC varied depending on the severity of immunity B-system injury and correlated well with the cells bearing surface immunoglobulins.

The most common phenotype associates B-cell and monocytic properties: HC usually express monoclonal surface (and in certain cases cytoplasmic) immunoglobulins, receptors for IgM and IgG Fc, and mouse erythrocytes, and la-like antigens. Additionally, they are capable of phagocytosis, glass adherence, lysozyme and peroxidase synthesis. However, most of these features are not constant and cases have been reported in which HC fail to express one or more of these properties. In certain cases HC even display a T-cell phenotype, while, in others, features of both T and B cells are expressed. Moreover, in two recently studied patients, the phenotype of HC in the blood differed from that in the spleen (B + T in the blood and B in the spleen). These surprising discrepancies led us to hypothesize that HC from the same individual might be able to express different phenotypes following an appropriate stimulus. We therefore studied immunological parameters of HC stimulated by mitogens and the results indeed showed that after stimulation by phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) the cells switched from B to T or B + T phenotypes.","['Guglielmi, P', ""Preud'homme, J L"", 'Flandrin, G']","['Guglielmi P', ""Preud'homme JL"", 'Flandrin G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoplasm/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Phytohemagglutinins/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen/analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis', 'Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1980/07/10 00:00,1980/07/10 00:01,['1980/07/10 00:00'],"['1980/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1980/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/286166a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1980 Jul 10;286(5769):166-8. doi: 10.1038/286166a0.,,,,,

A child with T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), whose peripheral blood lymphoblasts manifested very low TTP catabolic capacity, was treated with 75 g dThd/m2/day by constant iv infusion for two courses of 5 and 8 days. The dThd caused an initial accumulation of peripheral blood blasts in S-phase at the expense of cells in G1, followed by a rapid reversal of this pattern consistent with a block in late G1 and/or early S. Concurrently, a prompt reduction of blasts was found in the peripheral blood. However, dThd treatment neither decreased the number of lymphoblasts in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) nor cleared the marrow. No major toxicity was observed, but the effect of dThd on normal marrow elements could not be evaluated in this patient. Blood concentrations of dThd were 1.4-3.0 mM, and concentrations of thymine were in the same range; beta half-life for dThd was 48 minutes. Steady-state CSF dThd was 9% of the simultaneous serum level. Clearance measurements demonstrated that catabolism of dThd was saturated and that renal clearance was a major determinant of total body clearance during high-dose dThd infusion. A good correlation was found between biochemical and cytokinetic parameters and response to dThd for the peripheral blood lymphoblasts. However, dThd did not produce a useful remission in this case of T-cell ALL.","['Howell, S B', 'Chu, B', 'Mendelsohn, J', 'Carson, D A', 'Kung, F H', 'Seegmiller, J E']","['Howell SB', 'Chu B', 'Mendelsohn J', 'Carson DA', 'Kung FH', 'Seegmiller JE']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Parenteral', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', '*T-Lymphocytes', 'Thymidine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",1980/08/01 00:00,1980/08/01 00:01,['1980/08/01 00:00'],"['1980/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1980 Aug;65(2):277-84.,,,,,

Normal mature T-cells have a receptor for sheep erythrocyte (E+) while mature B-cells bear membrane-bound immunoglobulin molecules (sIg+). These two findings can be used to divide acute lymphoblastic leukemia of childhood into three major groups; B-cell leukemia (sIg+ E-), which is rare (approximately 2 percent) and has the poorest prognosis, T-cell leukemia (sIg-, E+) which is more common (10 percent) but also has a poor prognosis and null cell leukemia (sIg-, E-) which is the most common (85 percent) and has the best prognosis. By the use of additional immunological methods, subgroups within T-cell leukemia and null cell leukemia have also been proposed. One of the most valuable of these additional methods is the detection of surface antigens. Three of the more commonly detected antigens currently being evaluated are (1) common leukemia antigen (cALL), (2) a normal B Lymphocyte antigen the Ia antigen (Ia) which is not generally expressed on most T lymphocytes and (3) a normal T lymphocyte antigen (T) not expressed on B lymphocytes. Within null cell leukemia, the most commonly identified and probably the largest subgroup if Ia+, cALL+, T-, E-, sIg-. In another but smaller subgroup within null cell leukemia, the lymphoblasts contain cytoplasmic immunoglobulin but do not express surface immunoglobulins or E receptors. This subgroup is designated pre B-cell leukemia. Subgroups with T-cell leukemia have also been suggested. These include T+ E-, T+ E+, in which the rosettes are thermolabile and T+ E+, in which the rosettes are thermostable. Whether or not there are any prognostic differences in these three subgroups remains to be determined.","['Humphrey, G B', 'Blackstock, R', 'Filler, J']","['Humphrey GB', 'Blackstock R', 'Filler J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, Surface/*classification', 'B-Lymphocytes/classification', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/classification', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*classification', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification']",1980/05/01 00:00,1980/05/01 00:01,['1980/05/01 00:00'],"['1980/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 1980 May-Jun;10(3):169-80.,,,,,

The optimal dose for induction, as measured by the increase of the number of cells containing sheep erythrocyte receptors (E-rosette assay), is between 8 and 16 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), although there were significant increases of E-rosette-positive (E(+)) cells at concentrations as low as 1.6 nM TPA. The induction was linear for 4 days, then it reached a plateau. This induction was independent of the cell densities of the cultures, and the viability of the E(+) cells remained high (95-100%) even after 10 days of culture in the presence of the tumor promoters. The E(+) cells, when measured with the more stable 2-aminoethylisothiouronium bromide E-rosette assay, indicated that virtually all (75-95%) of the MOLT-3 cells became E(+) by 4 days in culture. This induction by TPA was also accompanied by a dramatic drop in the plating efficiencies and a reduction in DNA synthesis. Examination of phorbol and other phrobol esters indicated that the ability to induce these cells correlated well with the tumor-promoting activities of these compounds, because only TPA and to a lesser extent phorbol 12,13,-dibenzoate induced E(+) cells, while phorbol and 4alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate had no effect. Studies of MOLT-3 cells depleted of E(+) cells indicated that the induction of E(+) cells cannot be explained solely on the basis of enrichment or stimulation of the background E(+) cells in MOLT-3 cultures. Finally, we have shown that TPA also affected another differentiation marker, the loss of the enzyme terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase. Terminal transferase activities and percentages of terminal-transferase-positive cells in these cultures were reduced to as low as 1/10th in 4 days in the presence of 16 nM TPA.","['Nagasawa, K', 'Mak, T W']","['Nagasawa K', 'Mak TW']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Phorbols)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/enzymology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1980/05/01 00:00,1980/05/01 00:01,['1980/05/01 00:00'],"['1980/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.77.5.2964 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1980 May;77(5):2964-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.77.5.2964.,PMC349527,,,,

In contrast to the leukemic AKR cells that express the T-cell surface component Thy-1.1, the potential leukemic cells among bone marrow cells of young AKR mice were shown to lack the expression of this antigen.

In the course of studies on humoral immunity to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells it was noticed that sera from normal subjects were cytotoxic in complement lysis and leucocyte dependent antibody (LDA) assays to blood leucocytes from patients with AML in remission. Investigation of these reactions in eleven patients with acute leukaemia in complete or partial remission revealed that reactivity occurred most frequently between sera from normal blood group O or B subjects and leucocytes from patients of blood group A (five patients). Leucocytes from blood group O patients were largely unreactive. Blood leucocytes from five of six patients in relapse did not react with normal sera. Subsequent studies revealed that the antigens were detected only on T lymphocytes. Reactivity could be removed by absorption on red cells of blood group A but not sheep or Ox red blood cells suggesting the antigens concerned were closely related to blood group A antigens. Some reactivity with antisera to the blood group H antigens was also evident in these studies. Gel filtration studies indicated that lymphocyte dependent antibody mediated cytotoxicity was mediated by IgG antibodies while complement dependent lysis was mainly mediated by IgM antibodies. The biological significance of these findings has yet to be determined but these results suggest that reactivity with blood group antigens needs to be considered in in vitro cytotoxicity studies involving leucocytes from leukaemia patients.,"['Pullen, S', 'Hersey, P']","['Pullen S', 'Hersey P']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Isoantibodies)']",IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/*immunology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Isoantibodies/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1980/02/01 00:00,1980/02/01 00:01,['1980/02/01 00:00'],"['1980/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1980 Feb;39(2):403-10.,PMC1538051,,,,

Eighteen of nineteen cases of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia expressed the mouse receptor, but only eight of fifteen cases of hairy-cell leukaemia showed significant mouse rosette formation by peripheral blood cells. A much higher percentage of splenic hairy cells, compared with peripheral blood cells, formed mouse rosettes, but receptor expression was found to be dependent on the surface immunoglobulin (SIg) phenotype. Cases forming mouse rosettes had multiple heavy chain isotypes including IgD on the surface, but the ontogenically more mature SIgG-only cells from other cases failed to form rosettes, whether from peripheral blood or spleen. Cultured hairy cells lost the ability to form mouse rosettes, and receptor expression by peripheral blood hairy cells fluctuated widely in the days following splenectomy. The results suggest that the mouse erythrocyte receptor is an early marker in B cell differentiation and that receptor expression by individual cells may depend on the age of the cell.","['Burns, G F', 'Cawley, J C']","['Burns GF', 'Cawley JC']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', '*Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', '*Rosette Formation']",1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1980 Jan;39(1):83-9.,PMC1537939,,,,

Total impact of illness (e.g., leukemia or colds) did not differ between ill and healthy respondents, and the nature of adolescent concerns were similar for both groups. Restriction of freedom was seen as the major disruption brought about by illness, with other areas of impact including relations with peers, siblings, and parents. Adolescents with cancer were most likely to view treatment as highly disruptive and, along with rheumatologic patients, expressed greatest disruption of body image secondary to disease and treatment. Perceived school disruption was most common in cardiac and oncologic patients, with the former also expressing a high degree of concern about sexuality. Females in all groups reported more impact of illness on physical appearance than did males; this difference was greatest in adolescents with cancer, rheumatologic diseases, and cystic fibrosis. The essentially healthy psychologic status of chronically ill adolescents is noted, as is the generally hopeful and positive quality of patient responses.","['Zeltzer, L', 'Kellerman, J', 'Ellenberg, L', 'Dash, J', 'Rigler, D']","['Zeltzer L', 'Kellerman J', 'Ellenberg L', 'Dash J', 'Rigler D']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Image', 'Cystic Fibrosis/psychology', 'Diabetes Mellitus/psychology', 'Disease/*psychology', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases/psychology', 'Humans', 'Kidney Diseases/psychology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/psychology', '*Perception', 'Rheumatic Diseases/psychology', 'Social Adjustment', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",1980/07/01 00:00,1980/07/01 00:01,['1980/07/01 00:00'],"['1980/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3476(80)80153-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3476(80)80153-3 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 1980 Jul;97(1):132-8. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3476(80)80153-3.,,,,,

The in vitro properties of this antiserum were identical to those of the anti-human B cell serum in the various assays: cytotoxicity, rosette inhibition and ultrastructural characterization. These results demonstrate that hairy cells of the studied patients express surface antigenic specificities of the B cell population, not shared by monocytes. Further absorption of the anti-hairy cell serum with CLL cells suggested that hairy cells express other characteristic antigens in addition to the B lymphocyte antigens.

The earliest stage was confined to <10% of thymocytes, which were.reactive with both OKT9 and OKT10. Subsequently, approximately 70% of human thymocytes acquired a thymocyte-restricted antigen, OKT6, lost OKT9 antigen, and expressed reactivity with OKT4 and OKT5. These last two monoclonal antibodies were previously shown to define inducer (helper) and cytotoxic/suppressor populations, respectively, in peripheral blood. The OKT4(+), OKT5(+), OKT6(+) ""common"" thymocyte population represents the majority of thymocytes and accounts for more than 70% of thymocytes. With further maturation, thymocytes lose OKT6 reactivity, segregate into OKT4(+) and OKT5(+) subsets, and acquire reactivity with OKT3 (and OKT1). This latter stage corresponds to the more functionally mature subset. The possible relationship of acute lymphoblastic leukemia of T-cell lineage to these proposed stages of intrathymic differentiation was determined. Analysis of 25 tumor populations showed that 21 could be related to one or another differentiative stage. The majority (15/21) were derived from an early thymocyte or prothymocyte subpopulation, 5/25 were derived from a common thymocyte subpopulation, and 1/25 was derived from a mature (OKT3(+)) subpopulation.

In the E+ group, the predominant features were sex (only men), the mediastinal localization, and the focal positivity of the acid phosphatase reaction. Cytotoxicity tests with rabbit antihuman T-lymphocyte anti-serum confirmed the results of the E rosette test in the 3 patients of the E+ group who were tested and were also positive in 2 patients from the E- group (1 of these 2 patients had the characteristics found in the E+ group and can thus be related to this group; the other patient had none of these characteristics).

In normal human blood, T-lymphocytes are marked by a distinct ""dot-like"" ANAE-reactivity which is somewhat less pronounced in the small (11%) subgroup of Fc-IgG-receptor positive T-lymphocytes; B-lymphocytes are negative or finely granular positive. Lymphoblastoid cell lines of B- and of T-type are ANAE- and APh-positive. In some lymphatic malignancies, a characteristic pattern of activity of APh or of ANAE may support the diagnosis.

Although no major differences could be detected among the antibody-defined serotypes of the various clones, the susceptibility of cells of individual HFL/b clones to attack by Friend virus-specific CTL varied widely, and those clones which produced large amounts of infectious virus provided the most sensitive target cells. It was also apparent that production of infectious Friend virus was inhibitory to CTL generation in syngeneic mixed leukocyte-tumor cell cultures.

A similar correlation between suspension morphology and inducibility of hemoglobin was found in hybrids between suspension Friend cells and an adherent lymphoma line.

Changes of thymidylate synthetase activity both in cell extracts and in the intact cells (in situ) were followed throughout the cell cycle. The enzyme activity assayed in situ, by measuring tritium released from [5-3H]deoxyuridine, changed markedly in relation to the DNA synthesis pattern, whereas that assayed in cell extracts remained unchanged. In the S phase of the cell cycle, activity of the enzyme was much higher as measured in situ than as measured in cell extracts. Hydroxyurea (1 mM) inhibited DNA synthesis in exponentially growing L1210 cells and was found to inhibit thymidylate synthetase activity in situ. However, the enzyme activity in cell extracts was not inhibited by the drug. In cells with DNA synthesis inhibited by hydroxyurea, the pattern of change of in situ activity with time suggested product inhibition. Results of isotope-dilution analysis of the release of tritium from [5-3H]deoxyuridine in the intact cells indicated that thymidine added to the medium caused strong inhibition of thymidylate synthetase, the most likely limiting step in this pathway. These data allow the suggestion that, during cell growth, thymidylate synthetase activity is regulated by thymine nucleotide(s), and is dependent on the rate of DNA synthesis as well as the availability of the salvage pathway substrate, thymidine.","['Rode, W', 'Scanlon, K J', 'Moroson, B A', 'Bertino, J R']","['Rode W', 'Scanlon KJ', 'Moroson BA', 'Bertino JR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leucovorin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*enzymology/physiopathology', 'Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*metabolism', 'Tritium']",1980/02/25 00:00,1980/02/25 00:01,['1980/02/25 00:00'],"['1980/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1980/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)86030-1 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1980 Feb 25;255(4):1305-11.,,,,,

Early splenectomy at different time intervals, ranging between 1 hr to 3 days after BCL1 inoculation, significantly delayed onset of the disease and prolonged survival, indicating that homing to the spleen occurred as early as 1 hr after inoculation.

T-cell markers included spontaneous sheep red blood cell rosette formation and a cytotoxic reaction to a specific T-cell antiserum. Seven patients with CLL and two with ALL had dual B and T markers. We propose that dual B- and T-cell markers are more common in CLL and ALL patients than previously reported.

None of these 248 patients contracted PCP. However, five cases of PCP did occur among ten additional high-risk patients who failed to receive this preparation for a variety of reasons. Complications of the continuous prophylaxis program included neutropenia, rash, and gastrointestinal complaints.

There was a poor correlation between the adherent cell numbers and the peripheral blood leukocyte counts, but an excellent correlation of the different adherent cell counts with each other. The number of adherent cells in the peripheral blood varied inversely with age in the cancer patients, but not in the normal subjects (r = 0.29, P less than 0.005). When patients under age 50 were compared to the controls, the deficiency of adherent cells was slightly more severe in patients with stage IV lung cancer than in those with stage III lung cancer.

Resistance to 1 microM dexamethasone was acquired spontaneously at a rate of 2.6 X 10(-5) per cell per generation as determined by fluctuation analysis. After mutagenesis with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), the phenotypic expression time for dexamethasone resistance was determined to be 3 days. Spontaneous acquisition of resistance to 0.1 mM 6-thioguanine appeared to occur at a much slower rate, 1.6 X 10(-6) per cell per generation. However, the expression time after MNNG mutagenesis for this resistant phenotype was greater than 11 days, suggesting that the different rates of acquisition for the two phenotypes measured by fluctuation analysis were the results of the disparate expression times. The mutagens ICR 191 and MNNG were effective in increasing the dexamethasone-resistant fraction of cells in mutagenized cultures; ICR 191 produced a 35.6-fold increase, and MNNG produced an 8.5-fold increase. All the spontaneous dexamethasone-resistant clones contained glucocorticoid receptors, usually less than half of the amount found in the parental clone. They are therefore strikingly different from dexamethasone-resistant clones derived from the mouse cell lines S49 and W7. Dexamethasone-resistant clones isolated after mutagenesis of CEM-C7 contained, on the average, lower concentrations of receptor than did those isolated spontaneously, and one clone contained no detectable receptor. These results are consistent with a mutational origin for dexamethasone resistance in these human cells at a haploid or functionally hemizygous locus. They also suggest that this is a useful system for mutation assay.","['Harmon, J M', 'Thompson, E B']","['Harmon JM', 'Thompson EB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutagens/pharmacology', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Steroid/drug effects']",1981/06/01 00:00,1981/06/01 00:01,['1981/06/01 00:00'],"['1981/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.1.6.512-521.1981 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1981 Jun;1(6):512-21. doi: 10.1128/mcb.1.6.512-521.1981.,PMC369694,,,"['Laboratory of Biochemistry, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20205.']",

These cells can be induced to differentiate to morphologically and functionally mature granulocytes by incubation with a wide variety of compounds, including butyrate and hypoxanthine and polar planar compounds such as dimethylsulfoxide and hexamethylene bisacetamide. However, these compounds are either nonphysiological or induce HL-60 at concentrations that are markedly greater than physiological. We have now found that retinoic acid is the most potent inducer of granulocytic differentiation of HL-60. This compound induces differentiation at concentrations 1/10(3) to 1/10(6) the concentration of other inducers and at concentrations that are physiological. These findings prompted an investigation of the sensitivity to retinoic acid of fresh human myelocytic leukemia cells in primary suspension culture. Of 21 leukemic specimens, only cells from the 2 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia differentiated in response to retinoic acid. Thus, as with HL-60, it appears that retinoic acid specifically induces granulocytic differentiation of leukemic promyelocytes and may have therapeutic utility in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. In addition, our results suggest that retinoic acid may also be involved in the differentiation of certain hematopoietic cells.","['Breitman, T R', 'Gallo, R C']","['Breitman TR', 'Gallo RC']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood Cells. 1981;7(1):79-89.,,,,,

The model postulates that determination of a pluripotent stem cell of a leukemic clone occurs abruptly with intermediate stem cell classes being rare. Transformations occurring in committed myelopoietic progenitors are not self-maintaining. Leukemic clones in AML originate by genetic transformation to a lineage independent of myelopoietic differentiation. The biological behavior of AML clones changes with time as a result, in the short term, of environmental changes, and in the long term, of genetic changes. Sensitivity of leukemic blast colonies to adriamycin and Ara-C, although variable from patient to patient, is relatively stable for one clone during a major portion of the course of the disease.","['McCulloch, E A', 'Till, J E']","['McCulloch EA', 'Till JE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Clone Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', '*Models, Biological']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood Cells. 1981;7(1):63-77.,,,,,

After this sequence, some leukemias can still be induced to revert with a high frequency from a malignant to a non-malignant phenotype. Results obtained from the analysis of regulation of growth and differentiation in normal and leukemic myeloid cells, restoration of the normal phenotype by induction of normal differentiation in myeloid leukemia, and the blocks in differentiation defective leukemic cell mutants have been used to propose a general model for the origin and evolution of leukemia. The model states that leukemia originates by changing specific pathways of gene expression required for growth from inducible to constitutive, in cells that can still be induced to differentiate normally by the physiological inducer of differentiation. The malignant, unlike the normal cells, then no longer require the physiological inducer for growth. This changes the requirements for growth and uncouples growth from differentiation. Constitutive expression of other specific pathways of gene expression can uncouple other controls, which then causes blocks in differentiation and the further evolution of leukemia. The existence of specific constitutive pathways of gene expression that uncouple controls in malignant cells, can also explain the origin and evolution of other types of malignancies.","['Sachs, L']",['Sachs L'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Phenotype']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood Cells. 1981;7(1):31-44.,,,,,

The different fractions were enriched with cells belonging to subsequent stages of the cell cycle. Cytokinetic evaluation of these cell fractions was performed by [3H]thymidine autoradiography, [3H]thymidine incorporation and DNA/RNA-flow cytometry. Phosphorylation of cytosine arabinoside (ara-C, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine) in the different fractions was measured by incubation of the cells for 30 min with 1.07 microM [3H]ara-C. Phosphorylation of ara-C in the whole bone marrow samples ranged from 5.9 to 33.2 pmol/10(6) cells. In the fractions containing only G1-phase cells, phosphorylation ranged from 1.2 to 19.5 pmol/10(6) cells. The phosphorylation seems to increase before DNA synthesis starts. Maximal activities were found in the fractions enriched with cells in late G1- or S-phase of the cell cycle. In these fractions the ara-C phosphorylating activity was 1.5-8 times higher compared to the fractions with the lowest activity. One may therefore assume that not only S-phase cells are killed by ara-C, but that G1-phase cells which can phosphorylate ara-C, may also be doomed when they enter S-phase, since the elimination of the intracellular cytosine arabinoside tri-phosphate (ara-CTP) is a relatively slow process. The fraction of G1-phase cells phosphorylating ara-C, may be an important determinant in the extent of the cell-killing effect of ara-C treatment in the different leukemias.","['Vierwinden, G', 'Drenthe-Schonk, A M', 'Plas, A M', 'Linssen, P C', 'Pennings, A H', 'Holdrinet, R S', 'van Egmond, J', 'Wessels, J M', 'Haanen, C A']","['Vierwinden G', 'Drenthe-Schonk AM', 'Plas AM', 'Linssen PC', 'Pennings AH', 'Holdrinet RS', 'van Egmond J', 'Wessels JM', 'Haanen CA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Separation', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism', 'DNA Replication', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(82)90031-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1982;6(2):251-9. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(82)90031-5.,,,,,

Cytofluorograms showed characteristic pattern in such hematopoietic malignancies as acute leukemias, chronic leukemias and malignant lymphomas, and turned out to be applicable to the diagnosis of these diseases. Especially in malignant lymphoma, cytofluorogram showed either normal or abnormal pattern. An abnormal cytofluorogram indicated poor prognosis, and an abnormal pattern of cytofluorogram became normalized after chemotherapy against lymphoma. Interestingly, those patients who showed in abnormal pattern relapsed in a short period, even when they were though diagnosed in remission. These data suggest that cytofluorograms are useful in diagnosing, predicting relapse and evaluating therapeutic effects for the treatment of malignant lymphoma. We hope that the analysis of cytofluorogram of peripheral leukocytes in lymphoma will provide a new benefit for further investigation of this disease.","['Kamimura, N', 'Fukuiya, Y', 'Komatsu, M', 'Itagaki, M']","['Kamimura N', 'Fukuiya Y', 'Komatsu M', 'Itagaki M']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

A 67-year-old male was admitted to our hospital in May 1981, with a few year history of cough, sputum and fatigue. He had already been diagnosed as having pulmonary emphysema and moderate anemia. On physical examination, except for pallor, no other findings were remarkable. The initial hematological examination showed hemoglobin, 9.6 g/dl, red cell count, 251 x 10(4)/microliters, platelet count, 7.3 x 10(4)/microliters, white cell count, 2600/microliters with neither myeloblasts nor erythroblasts. A sternal marrow aspiration revealed 21% myeloblasts and 40% erythroblasts including 7.5% megaloblastoids. Periodic Acid Schiff staining was strongly positive for a part of erythroblasts. A chest X-P finding was typical for pulmonary emphysema. Pulmonary function was moderately damaged. He was started on chemotherapy with AAAP (ACNU 50 mg/d i.v. drip over 4 hr x 4d, adriamycin 20 mg/d i.v. push x 4d, Methotrexate 20 mg i.v. push x 4d). The first course of AAAP brought him a complete remission with both disappearance of myeloblasts and erythroid precursors with megaloblastoid nuclei in the marrow and the normalization of white cell count and platelet count in the blood. He was discharged in September 1981 after completion of a consolidation chemotherapy with AAAP. Since then, he received two courses of AAAP as an intensification chemotherapy and has been in complete remission for more than 13 months. His pulmonary function has not been affected and no myocardial damage has been seen throughout AAAP therapy. Thus, AAAP therapy seems to be an excellent chemotherapy even for an aged patient with erythroleukemia.","['Takagi, S', 'Yoshikawa, H', 'Akao, Y', 'Hiraiwa, A', 'Sao, H', 'Yoshikawa, S']","['Takagi S', 'Yoshikawa H', 'Akao Y', 'Hiraiwa A', 'Sao H', 'Yoshikawa S']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

However, most of the complete remissions were of short duration. On the other hand, much progress has been made in the chemotherapy for blastic phase cases. Using a combination chemotherapy of vincristine and prednisolone, over one-third of the patients with CML in blastic crisis have achieved a complete remission.

Furthermore, L-asparaginase appeared to have a similar activity to the anthracyclines in combination with VP. Thus, VP plus one of these agents seemed to be a recommendable inductive chemotherapy against ALL. In CLL, remission rates obtained by the use of chlorambucil alone were ranged from 45 to 69%, while a 2-drug combination consisting of chlorambucil and prednisone obtained remission rates ranging 38 to 80%. Thus, the combination appeared to have superiority over chlorambucil alone.

FMF histogram analysis showed that homoharringtonine could strongly arrest cells in the G1 phase of the immediate cell cycle. This effect was more pronounced and persisted longer with G1 cells than with S or G2 cells. Hydroxycamptothecin mainly delayed the progression of S cells of the subsequent cell cycle (daughter cells). Lycobetaine caused a marked accumulation of G2 cells. These 3 compounds possess a relatively specific action on cell progression through the cell cycle. Homoharringtonine and hydroxycamptothecin can inhibit the cell proliferation of murine erythroleukemia cells (MELC) at low concentrations (ng/ml) whereas lycobetaine, cantharidin and oxalysine are less potent. Among them only hydroxycamptothecin had a weak activity to induce MELC differentiation. These results may provide some basic knowledge for designing new protocols of the combination treatment of neoplastic diseases.","['Xu, B']",['Xu B'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Singapore,Am J Chin Med,The American journal of Chinese medicine,7901431,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Amaryllidaceae Alkaloids)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Indolizines)', '2121-12-2 (ungeremine)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', '9Z01632KRV (10-hydroxycamptothecin)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/pharmacology', '*Amaryllidaceae Alkaloids', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Harringtonines/pharmacology', 'Homoharringtonine', '*Indolizines', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0192415X81000354 [pii]', '10.1142/s0192415x81000354 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Chin Med. 1981 Winter;9(4):268-76. doi: 10.1142/s0192415x81000354.,,,,,

By preincubation of leukemic cells with PHA-LCM in a liquid phase, leukemic cells were found to be more sensitive to forming colonies and clusters in agar medium. In addition, this PHA-two step assay could eliminate colony formation by T cell progenitors. The leukemic origin of the colonies was proven by electron-microscopic analysis, which demonstrated the presence of nuclear blebs and abnormal perinuclear fibril formation. Morphological studies also indicated myeloid differentiation of the cells in the leukemic colonies, although considerable variation was observed among patients. The wide range of linearity between the number of cells plated and the number of colonies grown permits quantitative assay of colony-forming leukemic cells (L-CFU). This assay should be valuable for studies of chemotherapy, growth regulation, and differentiation of L-CFU.","['Moriyama, Y', 'Koike, T', 'Takahashi, M', 'Sakurai, K', 'Fujiwara, M', 'Takai, K', 'Kishi, K', 'Sakai, C', 'Sanada, M', 'Shibata, A']","['Moriyama Y', 'Koike T', 'Takahashi M', 'Sakurai K', 'Fujiwara M', 'Takai K', 'Kishi K', 'Sakai C', 'Sanada M', 'Shibata A']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Stem Cells,Stem cells,8110002,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Culture Media', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Phytohemagglutinins/*pharmacology']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Stem Cells. 1982;2(4):189-202.,,,,,

During the different modes of motility (stationary without net translocation of the whole cell, and locomotion), the cells display a distinct configuration. This allows the interpretation of static images in terms usually reserved for the description of activities of living cells. The ability of cells to change shape is of special importance when they migrate in the body. Irrespective of nature and origin, these cells must continuously adapt their configuration to the structural elements which they encounter in their pathways. The existence of such an adaptability could be shown by time lapse films for leukemia cells and for cells of the V2 rabbit carcinoma moving in mesenteries of rat and rabbit, respectively.","['Haemmerli, G', 'Felix, H']","['Haemmerli G', 'Felix H']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Scan Electron Microsc,Scanning electron microscopy,0371617,,IM,"['Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/ultrastructure', 'Cell Movement', 'Epithelium/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Laryngeal Neoplasms/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Motion Pictures', 'Tongue Neoplasms/ultrastructure']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Scan Electron Microsc. 1982;(Pt 2):731-9.,,,,,

In a cohort of 68 females and 21 males, the cumulative incidence at 6 months of age was 88% in females and 48% in males, and at 12 months it was 100% in females and 94% in males. There were two types of leukemias with distinct in vivo homing behavior: the major type (72/86) proliferated in lymph nodes and the spleen, and the minor type (14/86) proliferated predominantly in the bone marrow cavity. In the minor type, paraplegia due to spinal compression by growing leukemia cells in vertebrae was a characteristic clinical manifestation and this was faithfully reproduced by intravenous injection of the leukemia cells from bone marrow. Both types of leukemias were histologically poorly differentiated lymphoblastic leukemias of null cell type, since none of 8 immunocytological and 4 cytochemical differentiation markers allowed either positive identification of their normal derivation or distinction between them. In contrast to AKR mice with a high incidence of thymic leukemias, spontaneous expression of xenotropic virus was observed not only in the thymus but also in the spleen and bone marrow. In addition to the high level of expression of eco- and xenotropic viruses, viruses with dual-tropic host range were isolated sporadically from preleukemic and leukemic lymphoid tissues.

These studies illustrate the substantial cytokinetic changes occur during therapy (e.g., a substantial increase in cell cycle traverse rate and almost complete recruitment) and show the importance of obtaining mid-treatment cytokinetic information about normal and malignant tissues.","['Gray, J W', 'Pallavicini, M G']","['Gray JW', 'Pallavicini MG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Jejunum/drug effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Models, Biological']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950100711 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1982;10 Suppl 1:93-108. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950100711.,,"['CA 14533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28752/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,

Using the single cell conjugate/dextran assay, we have quantitatively determined select requirements for the adhesion of monocytes to neoplastic target cells. Monocytes expressed a broad binding capacity to a wide spectrum of nonadherent tumor cell lines, while binding at minimal levels to nontumor target cells. Binding of monocytes to K562 tumor cells is an extremely rapid event, reaching saturation levels within 5 min after cosedimentation. The binding of monocytes to K562 targets was reduced by low temperatures and pretreatment with metabolic inhibitors. Pretreatment of monocytes with cytoskeletal-disruptive drugs significantly reduced binding. Monocytes were shown to exhibit a specific, Mg2+-dependent, Ca2+-independent mechanism in their binding to K562 cells. Subsequent to binding, Ca2+ was required for monocyte-mediated target cell lysis to proceed. The binding of tumor cells by monocytes was studied morphologically using transmission (TEM) and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) techniques. It was observed that binding was achieved initially through complex, surface membrane interdigitations from apposing effector--target cells and progressed to stable conjugates, which were characterized by contact regions consisting of large expanses of closely apposed surface membranes. The application of the single cell conjugate/dextran assay to assess monocyte-binding requirements and the morphological characterization of the monocyte--target cell conjugation process may help in clarifying the mechanisms of monocyte-mediated tumor cell lysis.","['Muse, K E', 'Koren, H S']","['Muse KE', 'Koren HS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Reticuloendothel Soc,Journal of the Reticuloendothelial Society,0206462,"['I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Binding Sites/drug effects', 'Calcium/pharmacology', '*Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cytoskeleton/drug effects', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/immunology/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors']",1982/11/01 00:00,1982/11/01 00:01,['1982/11/01 00:00'],"['1982/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Reticuloendothel Soc. 1982 Nov;32(5):323-37.,,"['CA 00581/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23354/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 29589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,

Antibodies 80H.5 and 81H.1 also inhibited CFU-GM growth stimulated by leukocyte feeder layers or placental conditioned media, but did not inhibit BFU-E and CFU-E. Antigens recognized by 80H.3, 80H.5, and 81H.1 were expressed both on a proportion of cells from HL.60, KG.1, ML.1, and K562 myeloid cell lines, and on a proportion of blast cells isolated from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. They were not found on lymphoid cell lines or lymphoid leukemia cells. These MCA recognize either late differentiation antigens expressed on mature neutrophils and monocytes (80H.1 and 80H.3) or early differentiation antigens (80H.5 and 81H.1) specific to the granulocytic lineage. They may be useful for a better definition of those antigens specific to hematopoietic stem cells and their relationship with normal or neoplastic hematopoiesis.","['Mannoni, P', 'Janowska-Wieczorek, A', 'Turner, A R', 'McGann, L', 'Turc, J M']","['Mannoni P', 'Janowska-Wieczorek A', 'Turner AR', 'McGann L', 'Turc JM']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Immunol,Human immunology,8010936,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Granulocytes/*immunology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Neutrophils/immunology']",1982/12/01 00:00,1982/12/01 00:01,['1982/12/01 00:00'],"['1982/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0198-8859(82)90022-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0198-8859(82)90022-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Immunol. 1982 Dec;5(4):309-23. doi: 10.1016/0198-8859(82)90022-2.,,,,,

Inactivation of the effector cells required greater than 4 h pretreatment with levamisole if NK activity was subsequently tested in the absence of the drug. Pretreatment with levamisole for up to 19 h had no effect on the lymphocyte proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA). NK activity of drug-inactivated effector cells recovered after further incubation in levamisole-free medium.

From these models, it was concluded that patients with leukemia may have an abnormal granulopoiesis, characterized by a high degree of inefficiency (premature cell death, skipping of divisions with undisturbed maturation). However, the underlying mechanisms may be quite different. While it cannot be excluded that in acute myelocytic leukemia there is a stem and/or progenitor cell pool that is highly ineffective but still capable of feeding some cells into the granulocytic pathway, it is nevertheless possible, as shown in plasma cell leukemia, that the ineffective granulopoiesis may be the result of direct or indirect interaction between the ""leukemic"" and the ""normal"" cell clone.","['Fliedner, T M', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Steinbach, K H']","['Fliedner TM', 'Hoelzer D', 'Steinbach KH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,,IM,"['Agranulocytosis/*etiology', 'Cell Division', 'Computers', 'Granulocytes/*physiology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*physiopathology', 'Models, Theoretical']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood Cells. 1982;8(3):535-48.,,,,,

This prompted us to design a study to determine the effect of hypertransfusion on the blood and marrow CFU-c of leukemic children during remission induction. Nineteen children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia have been randomized in pairs to normotransfused (Hb: 12-14 g/dl) and hypertransfused (Hb: 16-18 g/dl) groups. Anti-leukemic chemotherapy (vincristine and adriamycin weekly during 4 weeks and prednisone daily) was identical in all children. As expected, suppression of erythropoiesis was observed in the hypertransfused group. During the first three courses of chemotherapy, the number of marrow CFU-c remained very low in both groups. One week after the third course of chemotherapy the number of bone marrow CFU-c began to increase in both groups. One week after course four the CFU-c value was significantly larger in the hypertransfused group. We also observed that circulating CFU-c were almost absent before induction chemotherapy, whereas their number increased after course three and was higher in the hypertransfused group and remained higher after course four. These results show the kinetics of bone marrow recovery after chemotherapy and suggest that hypertransfusion increases the rate of recovery of granulopoiesis.","['de Montpellier, C', 'Cornu, G', 'Rodhain, J', 'Sokal, G', 'Symann, M']","['de Montpellier C', 'Cornu G', 'Rodhain J', 'Sokal G', 'Symann M']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*Erythrocyte Transfusion', 'Granulocytes/cytology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood/drug therapy/therapy']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood Cells. 1982;8(2):439-44.,,,,,

Platelet survival was significantly reduced in CGL. Platelet production was 5.8 x normal and the mgkc number and volume/microliter bone marrow were significantly increased as compared to controls. The increase in mgkc volume was not in proportion to that of number due to a significant decrease of mgkc size. Platelet production was strongly related to mgkc number/mm2 and to the mgkc volume/microliter bone marrow. The platelet production rate in relation to a unit of mgkc volume/microliter bone marrow was, however, greater in CGL than in controls, PV, PT and ITP.

We report here that, after the 25th transplant generation, leukemic guinea pigs began to develop a blast crisis similar to that seen in human CML. This feature of the disease is still present after 90 transplant generations. The transplantation conditions necessary to produce the leukemia (now referred to as GL-13-BC) with a predictable clinical and hematological course over a short interval are described. Thus, s.c. injection of 3.0 X 10(6) leukemic cells results in a slowly rising leukocyte count, due mainly to increasing numbers of myelocytes and mature granulocytes, at about 3 weeks after injection. At this early stage the spleen weights of the leukemic animals are about seven times greater than those of normal controls. Approximately 4-7 days later the leukocyte count rises sharply due to a blast crisis and the animals die shortly thereafter with a mean survival time of 30 (range 25-32) days. It is proposed that the GL-13-BC leukemia could serve as a useful model for investigating the problem of blast crisis associated with human CML.","['Evans, W H', 'Miller, D A']","['Evans WH', 'Miller DA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Leukemia, Experimental/blood/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Neoplasm Transplantation']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(82)90065-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1982;6(6):819-25. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(82)90065-0.,,['1-CO-75380/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,

The dual potentiality of these promyelocytes was demonstrated by the ability of isolated colonies to differentiate into granulocytes, following induction by dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) or express properties specific to macrophages following exposure to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The differentiation process involved an irreversible step which occurred 48 h after exposure to DMSO, and a few h after exposure to TPA. This implies that the presence of the inducer in the culture medium is no more required for completion of the differentiation programme. Removal of the inducer prior to this step resulted in reversal of all the inducer-mediated effects. During the period of non-commitment the specific pathway of maturation was still undetermined; cells in which differentiation was initiated by exposure to DMSO were able to develop into macrophages after substitution of DMSO by TPA. Moreover, pre-exposure to DMSO and other inducers of granulocyte differentiation resulted in higher sensitivity to TPA, as indicated by the cell response to low TPA concentrations and more rapid expression of macrophage specific properties. These results suggest that the early stages in HL-60 differentiation are probably common to the granulocyte and the macrophage pathways.","['Fibach, E', 'Peled, T', 'Treves, A', 'Kornberg, A', 'Rachmilewitz, E A']","['Fibach E', 'Peled T', 'Treves A', 'Kornberg A', 'Rachmilewitz EA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Monocytes/*pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(82)90060-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1982;6(6):781-90. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(82)90060-1.,,,,,

Twelve patients were phenotyped as non-T, non-B, five as T-like and seven as B-like leukemia/lymphoma. Eighty-eight tissue samples were assayed for cell surface markers at the time of relapse(s). Lymphoblasts from 18 children (75%) demonstrated no variation in membrane marker expression. Six patients (25%) showed alteration of antigen expression on lymphoblasts obtained during relapses. This was manifested by loss of Ia antigen in two patients, loss of E-rosetting in one patient and loss of sIgD in one patient. Lymphoblasts from two patients, initially non-reactive with the four membrane markers utilized, expressed Ia antigen on subsequent relapses. Despite these variations no patient was categorized differently (i.e. T-like becoming non-T, non-B). Simultaneous lymphoblast phenotype determination from multiple body sites in 13 children showed no variation in marker analysis. A lymphoblast's phenotype remains stable throughout repeated relapses and is not influenced by relapse site in most children with lymphoid neoplasias.

We have recently developed techniques enabling the long-term in vitro propagation of normal immature myeloid cells from fresh foetal cord blood and monocytes from normal adult peripheral blood, and have utilized these procedures to initiate cultures of fresh peripheral blood leukocytes from leukemic donors. In four of 26 leukemic samples tested, leukocyte replication beyond that obtained in control cultures was observed, and in one of these HL-92, derived from the peripheral blood of a patient with acute myelomonocytic leukemia, the culture has continued to replicate slowly for over 2 years under the special growth conditions. Morphological, cytochemical, immunological and functional studies show that the culture consists predominantly of immature myeloid cells (myeloblasts through to myelocytes) but also contains some mature neutrophils and monocytes. At least a portion of HL-92 cells express Fc and complement receptors, contain histacompatibility locus antigens, including HLA-DR, and release GM-CSA, low levels of PGE and lysozyme. HL-92 cells can be induced with DMSO or RA to differentiate into mature neutrophils (an increase from 20 to 70% of the cell population) as determined by morphology, by an increase in phagocytic cells, and superoxide anion production. Fresh leukocytes from the patient's bone marrow appeared to have a diploid karyotype. However a consistent chromosomal abnormality observed in HL-92 was a deletion in the long arm of chromosome 11 [del(11)(q23)]. This is consistent with recent observations in monocytic leukemia. Since the few other established human myeloid cell lines have various chromosomal abnormalities, and some respond to differentiation inducers, while others do not, there appears to be no detectable common chromosome change required either for in vitro growth of myeloid cells or their response to inducers of differentiation. These cell lines and the application of the techniques described here for the growth of myeloid cells from other leukemic or normal sources should be helpful in the study of normal and leukemic myeloid cell growth and differentiation.","['Salahuddin, S Z', 'Markham, P D', 'McCredie, K B', 'Kondo, K', 'Rowley, J D', 'Gallo, R C']","['Salahuddin SZ', 'Markham PD', 'McCredie KB', 'Kondo K', 'Rowley JD', 'Gallo RC']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Diploidy', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/*pathology']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(82)90054-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1982;6(6):729-41. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(82)90054-6.,,,,,

Analysis of 14 cases.",40-51,"Monosomy 7 is frequent in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and in preleukaemic dysmyelopoietic syndromes but often it is not the only chromosome anomaly associated with these conditions. We report 14 patients with ""pure"" monosomy 7 and their clinical and haematological data are analysed in order to clarify the possible implications of this chromosome anomaly. The following points are considered: 1) In spite of the apparent variability of clinical forms in which monosomy 7 is found, several characteristics are common to all monosomy 7 patients, i.e. the presence of a preleukaemic phase and blood and marrow features suggesting the early involvement in the disease of all marrow cell lines. The different diagnoses associated with monosomy 7 are correlated with different steps of a unique myeloproliferative disease whose typical course can be reconstructed. 2) Monosomy 7 has a negative prognostic value. When it is found in a preleukaemic disorder it indicates a high risk of progression to AML, while in AML it implies recurrent infections, poor response to therapy and short survival. 3) The significance of the lack of Colton blood group antigens in monosomy 7 patients is discussed, with particular regard to the fact that the patients in whom this lack was found are the only ones who had not received transfusions in the months before the tests were done. 4) The finding of defective neutrophil chemotaxis in monosomy 7 patients is confirmed and the clinical importance of this fact is emphasized. 5) The data on the 14 patients support the opinion that AML, in general, is heterogeneous in origin. It is postulated that monosomy 7 is a marker of a specific pathogenetic pathway of AML, which implies the beginning of the malignancy in a pluripotent stem cell.","['Pasquali, F', 'Bernasconi, P', 'Casalone, R', 'Fraccaro, M', 'Bernasconi, C', 'Lazzarino, M', 'Morra, E', 'Alessandrino, E P', 'Marchi, M A', 'Sanger, R']","['Pasquali F', 'Bernasconi P', 'Casalone R', 'Fraccaro M', 'Bernasconi C', 'Lazzarino M', 'Morra E', 'Alessandrino EP', 'Marchi MA', 'Sanger R']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Hum Genet,Human genetics,7613873,"['0 (Blood Group Antigens)', '0 (Genetic Markers)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Sideroblastic/genetics', '*Aneuploidy', 'Blood Group Antigens', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Neutrophils', 'Preleukemia/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Risk']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00295602 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Genet. 1982;62(1):40-51. doi: 10.1007/BF00295602.,,,,,

IgA levels were restored much more slowly. Most striking was the slow and incomplete return of serum IgM to normal levels. Even after a follow-up of 3 years the mean was still subnormal. This was not accompanied by clinical signs of disturbed immunity. Our study points out that in assessing the long-term immunosuppressive effects of anticancer therapy the follow-up period must be sufficiently long.","['de Vaan, G A', 'van Munster, P J', 'Bakkeren, J A']","['de Vaan GA', 'van Munster PJ', 'Bakkeren JA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,"['0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Male', 'Time Factors']",1982/10/01 00:00,1982/10/01 00:01,['1982/10/01 00:00'],"['1982/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00441492 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 1982 Oct;139(2):113-7. doi: 10.1007/BF00441492.,,,,,

When serum or albumin were present in the medium, uptake of fatty acid by cells as well as its further incorporation into phospholipids and neutral lipids were considerably reduced. Uptake and metabolic utilization of this fatty acid was reduced at low temperature, in the presence or absence of albumin in the incubation medium. In absence of albumin, addition of iodoacetate, sodium cyanide or sodium azide had but little effect on the total uptake of fatty acids while metabolic utilization was reduced. When albumin was present, these inhibitors reduced both total uptake and incorporation into lipids. The data suggest that incorporation of the fatty acid into the outer layer of the cell membrane is controlled by the concentration of free, uncomplexed molecules of fatty acid adjacent to the cell surface. In the absence of albumin this is a fast reaction which reaches nearly maximal uptake in three minutes. In the presence of albumin, this process is much slower and follows a nearly linear course between 3 and 60 minutes. Translocation into the inner layer of the membrane and subsequent utilization for metabolic processes is a much slower process, which seems to depend on the quantity of the fatty acid in the outer layer.","['Morand, O', 'Fibach, E', 'Gatt, S']","['Morand O', 'Fibach E', 'Gatt S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Azides)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Iodoacetates)', '0 (Palmitic Acids)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '2V16EO95H1 (Palmitic Acid)', '968JJ8C9DV (Sodium Azide)', 'O5DDB9Z95G (Sodium Cyanide)', 'WF5188V710 (Iodoacetic Acid)']",IM,"['Azides/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cold Temperature', 'Culture Media', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents/pharmacology', 'Iodoacetates/pharmacology', 'Iodoacetic Acid', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Palmitic Acid', 'Palmitic Acids/*metabolism', 'Serum Albumin/*physiology', 'Sodium Azide', 'Sodium Cyanide/pharmacology']",1982/12/08 00:00,1982/12/08 00:01,['1982/12/08 00:00'],"['1982/12/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/12/08 00:01 [medline]', '1982/12/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2736(82)90480-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(82)90480-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1982 Dec 8;693(1):143-50. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(82)90480-1.,,['NS-02967/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,

Need for new approaches to the treatment of patients in clinical remission, with special reference to acute myeloid leukaemia.",151-9,"A serious limitation of chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), Hodgkins disease and some classes of breast cancer is that, even when clinically evident disease responds well, the same chemotherapy when given during remission does not affect the rate of relapse after chemotherapeutic or surgical ablation of the primary disease. This cannot, in general, be caused by genetic adaptation of the residual cancer cells which renders them resistant to specific drugs, because after relapse further remissions can be obtained with the same drugs that were ineffective by chronic administration in prolonging remission. The resistance of the residual cells may arise from mechanisms such as inaccessibility for anatomical or other reasons, or because of a change in metabolic state which causes these cells temporarily to cease division, when they cannot be harmed by cycle-dependent drugs and repair damage sustained from cycle-independent drugs. Limited differentiation has been shown capable of reversal and this may be a mechanism which leads to quiescence and associated ""resistance"", particularly in the case of AML. Where such resistance occurs treatment during remission-or as an adjuvant to surgery and radiotherapy-may have to rely on mechanisms which are independent of cellular proliferation such as processes associated with graft-versus-host-disease or the induction of terminal differentiation. A model for studying the nature of resistance of residual cancer and for testing treatments that might be active against cancer cells in this state may be dormant metastases. The latter are malignant cells which appear to be in peaceful co-existence with their host and which in experimental systems have been induced to grow into lethal metastases by perturbation of the host by surgical trauma, by hormonal manipulation or by immunosuppression.","['Alexander, P']",['Alexander P'],['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology/surgery', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Drug Resistance', 'Hodgkin Disease/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors']",1982/08/01 00:00,1982/08/01 00:01,['1982/08/01 00:00'],"['1982/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1982.178 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1982 Aug;46(2):151-9. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1982.178.,PMC2011078,,,,

Thirty-one cases of lymphocytic leukemia (18 cases of acute lymphoblastic and 13 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia), 13 cases of acute nonlymphoblastic (myelo or myelomonoblastic) leukemia, and eight cases of blastic crisis of CGL (seven cases of predominantly myeloblastic crisis, and one case of lymphoblastic crisis) were studied. In all cases of lymphoid leukemia, cells formed clumps or aggregates after exposure to TPA, while in all cases of myeloid leukemia cells became adherent to the substrate. Seven of the eight cases of blastic crisis of CGL were predominantly myeloid in type and cells adhered to the substrate, while in a single case of lymphoid crisis in CGL cells formed clumps after TPA exposure. Functional, cytochemical, and ultrastructural studies showed altered cell differentiation and continuing in vitro maturation of leukemic cells after exposure to TPA. In the light of the above results, it is concluded that this simple test employing TPA exposure in vitro serves as a reliable means of distinguishing blasts from different origins in human leukemias.","['Polliack, A', 'Leizerowitz, R', 'Korkesh, A', 'Gurfel, D', 'Gamliel, H', 'Galili, U']","['Polliack A', 'Leizerowitz R', 'Korkesh A', 'Gurfel D', 'Gamliel H', 'Galili U']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Phorbols)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*classification/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*classification/pathology', 'Leukocytes/*classification/ultrastructure', '*Phorbols', '*Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate']",1982/11/01 00:00,1982/11/01 00:01,['1982/11/01 00:00'],"['1982/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830130303 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1982 Nov;13(3):199-211. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830130303.,,,,,

The human cellular homologue (c-abl) of the transforming sequence of Abelson murine leukaemia virus (A-MuL V) was recently shown to be located on chromosome 9. The long arm of this chromosome is involved in a specific translocation with chromosome 22, the Philadelphia translocation (Ph1), t(9; 22) (q34, q11), which occurs in patients with chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML)3-5. Here we investigate whether the c-abl gene is included in this translocation. Using c-abl and v-abl hybridization probes on blots of somatic cell hybrids, positive hybridization is found when the 22q- (the Philadelphia chromosome), and not the 9q+ derivative of the translocation, is present in the cell hybrids. From this we conclude that in CML, c-abl sequences are translocated from chromosome 9 to chromosome 22q-. This finding is a direct demonstration of a reciprocal exchange between the two chromosomes and suggests a role for the c-abl gene in the generation of CML.","['de Klein, A', 'van Kessel, A G', 'Grosveld, G', 'Bartram, C R', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'Bootsma, D', 'Spurr, N K', 'Heisterkamp, N', 'Groffen, J', 'Stephenson, J R']","['de Klein A', 'van Kessel AG', 'Grosveld G', 'Bartram CR', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Bootsma D', 'Spurr NK', 'Heisterkamp N', 'Groffen J', 'Stephenson JR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', '*Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1982/12/23 00:00,1982/12/23 00:01,['1982/12/23 00:00'],"['1982/12/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/12/23 00:01 [medline]', '1982/12/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/300765a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1982 Dec 23;300(5894):765-7. doi: 10.1038/300765a0.,,['N0I-CO-75380/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,

The stresses were acetlyphenylhydrazine-induced hemolysis, phlebotomy, or infection with Friend erythroleukemia virus. Recovery from anemia was associated with a transient increase in the synthesis of minor Hb similar to the reappearance of Hb F in man. Minor Hb synthesis also increased during the evolution of erythroleukemia induced by both the anemic and the polycythemic strains of virus.

Non-T ALL are DR+ but T (thymic) ALL are invariably DR-. In contrast to the latter, some leukaemias with mature T cell phenotypes are DR+. Leukaemias or lymphomas of B cells and B cell precursors (e.g. pre-BALL) are invariably DR+, whereas myeloma or plasma cell leukaemias are DR-. This pattern of selective expression appears to closely parallel that seen in normal haemopoietic differentiation. Biochemical features of HLA-DR structures on leukaemic cells have been compared with the known features of B cell derived DR molecules and in one case ALL compared with an autologous (EBV transformed) B cell line. Most leukemic cells showed the same general alpha and beta two chain structure. However, B cell line and most chronic leukaemias showed the presence of an extra band of molecular weight 30,000 daltons (p30) with an intermediate electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE between that of the alpha and beta DR chains. In acute leukaemias and leukaemic cell lines (i.e. immature cells) p30 was not seen unless short labelling times were used. Two dimensional NEPHGE/SDS-PAGE under appropriate labelling conditions showed that the pattern of spots obtained from an ALL line (Nalm-6) and its autologous EBV transformed partner (B85) were similar though not identical. Pulse chase labelling of Nalm-6 and B85 showed that the turnover rate of p30 relative to DR alpha and beta chains, differed in the two lines.","['Newman, R A', 'Greaves, M F']","['Newman RA', 'Greaves MF']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'HLA-DR Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoelectrophoresis', 'Immunoelectrophoresis, Two-Dimensional', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology']",1982/10/01 00:00,1982/10/01 00:01,['1982/10/01 00:00'],"['1982/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1982 Oct;50(1):41-50.,PMC1536866,,,,

Injections and continuous infusions (for up to three weeks) of virtually all classes of antineoplastic agents, antibiotics, blood components, and intravenous solutions were administered through the system. The system was filled with heparinized saline and not otherwise flushed between uses. The system has remained functional for periods exceeding 450 days (mean 235 days). There was no significant local irritation and no system became infected. None of 18 large-bore catheters (0.63 mm lumen) became occluded (seven to 300 days), whereas five of six small-bore catheters (0.38 mm lumen) became occluded (90 to 420 days).

Each transfusion was assessed by monitoring the patient for reactions and by estimating the recovery of PMN in the circulation at 1 hour and of PLT at 1 and 20 hours. Seventeen patients developed alloimmunization to PLT from at least one donor, defined as either a PLT recovery of less than 15 percent at 1 hour and/or less than 10 percent at 20 hours. In this group there was a progressive reduction in PMN and PLT recovery with increasing transfusion number, strongly suggesting alloimmunization to both cells. Thirty-four transfusions were accompanied by transfusion reactions, thirty-two of which occurred in ten patients who had PMN recoveries of less than 5 percent after at least one transfusion (median 2.5, range 1-6 transfusions per patient). Actuarial calculations predicted that 70 percent of patients would become alloimmunized to PLT from at least two individuals after receiving 11 transfusions.

The lambda max 207 nm of indirubin shifted toward longer wave length with decrease of absorbance after the incubation of indirubin with DNA. The escalation of Tm value of DNA induced by indirubin was about 2.4 degrees C and it was reproducible. The binding force between them was rather weak, as indirubin molecules were easily released during the precipitation with alcohol or the gel filtration. The binding was not affected by sodium chloride even at high concentration but greatly decreased (to 20-30% of the control) in the presence of 8 M urea. These results showed that the binding between indirubin and DNA might be of hydrogen bond rather than ionic. The amount of bound 3H-indirubin was directly proportional to the concentration of indirubin. However, it increased abruptly when the concentration of indirubin reached 1.5 x 10(-4) M. This suggested another binding force in the latter instance. By using spectrophotometric analysis and Scatchard plot it was found that calf thymus DNA bound 46 indirubin molecules/1000 nucleotides.

Thus, it has been possible to characterize each of these types more accurately than before regarding age- and sex-specific incidence rates, relative frequency, male/female ratio, and median age at diagnosis. Chronic lymphatic leukaemia constituted 38% and chronic myeloid leukaemia 15% of the cases. These figures are larger and smaller, respectively, than these previously reported. The median age of all cases combined was 67 years, and the median age in cases of acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia was 64 years with 59% of the latter patients more than 60 years of age. In childhood myeloid leukaemia, an early incidence peak, not previously described, was observed before the age of 2 years. Analysis of Danish leukaemia incidence rates from 1943 and onwards shows no increase over 3 decades in patients less than 75 years of age. Thus, the observed increase in incidence from 5866-9942/100 000 during the period studied is limited to the very oldest age groups and is probably due to improved diagnostic efforts.","['Brincker, H']",['Brincker H'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Denmark', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/classification/*epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Population', 'Registries', 'Sex Factors']",1982/09/01 00:00,1982/09/01 00:01,['1982/09/01 00:00'],"['1982/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1982.tb00589.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1982 Sep;29(3):241-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1982.tb00589.x.,,,,,

Pt-modified DNA was electrostatically complexed to methylated bovine serum albumin and injected into rabbits. Early bleedings of the derived antiserum were used to establish a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which demonstrated specificity for the Pt-modified DNA but not for DNA or the Pt drug alone. In the ELISA, 50% inhibition occurred at a concentration of 0.5 nM Pt (on DNA) as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. This value corresponds to a lower limit of detectability of one adduct in 10(7) nucleotides, with 50 micrograms of sample DNA added per microtiter well. DNA isolated from cultured mouse L1210 cells exposed to increasing doses of the Pt drug was found by ELISA to contain from 0.2 to 10.0 fmol of Pt adduct per microgram of DNA. These levels remained stable for up to 4 hr after a 1-hr drug treatment, during which time DNA interstrand crosslinks developed. Thus, the antiserum appears not to be specific for DNA interstrand crosslinks. DNAs from L1210 cells exposed to trans-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) and L-phenylalanine mustard were not recognized in the ELISA. DNA prepared from the ascites cells of mice bearing the L1210 tumor 5 hr after injection of cis-DDP was found to contain about 2 fmol of Pt per microgram of DNA. This work establishes that cis-DDP-DNA adducts prepared in vitro are relevant to the in vivo binding of the Pt drug to its biological target, DNA, and opens new avenues for studying the mechanism of action of the Pt anticancer drugs.","['Poirier, M C', 'Lippard, S J', 'Zwelling, L A', 'Ushay, H M', 'Kerrigan, D', 'Thill, C C', 'Santella, R M', 'Grunberger, D', 'Yuspa, S H']","['Poirier MC', 'Lippard SJ', 'Zwelling LA', 'Ushay HM', 'Kerrigan D', 'Thill CC', 'Santella RM', 'Grunberger D', 'Yuspa SH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Cisplatin/*immunology', 'DNA/*immunology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Leukemia L1210/immunology', 'Mice']",1982/11/01 00:00,1982/11/01 00:01,['1982/11/01 00:00'],"['1982/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.79.21.6443 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1982 Nov;79(21):6443-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.79.21.6443.,PMC347142,['CA-15826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,

We have studied polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) functions in 18 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia in remission treated either with chemotherapy (CT; n = 7) or the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy (CT + IT; n = 11); in addition comparisons were made with healthy controls. PMN migration under agarose stimulated by a bacterial factor from Escherichia coli was significantly lower in both patient groups compared with healthy controls. When migration was stimulated with serum, it was low only in the CT + IT group. The capacity of PMNs to kill Staphylococcus aureus was reduced in the CT + IT group but normal in the CT group. The adherence to nylon fibers was higher in the CT + IT group compared to the controls and the CT group. There was no difference in chemiluminescence during phagocytosis between the two groups. Thus, there was no indication that monthly maintenance CT essentially impaired the PMN functions investigated. However, IT was associated with impairments of migratory and bactericidal functions and enhanced adherence of neutrophils. The mechanisms and clinical significance of this remain nuclear.","['Uden, A M', 'Palmblad, J', 'Venizelos, N']","['Uden AM', 'Palmblad J', 'Venizelos N']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,7909092,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Bactericidal Activity', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy/therapy', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/*physiology', 'Phagocytosis']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1982;24(4):231-5.,,,,,

Each child had been treated intensively with steroids, vincristine, daunorubicin and L-asparaginase. In fact, all patients had failed to respond to previous reinduction therapy with prednisone-vincristine or had relapsed while receiving vincristine. Our intent in this study was to test whether or not addition of VM-26 to prednisone-vincristine would overcome clinical resistance to these established agents. Complete remissions were induced in 17 patients (0.30) over 4 to 6 weeks. Five of these children, all clinically unresponsive to prednisone-vincristine alone, had complete remissions that lasted longer than 1 year; two remain in remission for 2 1/2 years and both are now off therapy. Myelosuppression, the most serious treatment complication, was documented in 20 of 26 evaluable patients. The median time to recovery of normal marrow function was 15 days. These results demonstrate further the potential of VM-26 in combined-drug treatment of refractory ALL. Whether the effectiveness of this combination represents potentiation of prednisone and vincristine activity by VM-26 or some other, as yet unidentified interaction, remains to be determined.","['Rivera, G', 'Bowman, W P', 'Murphy, S B', 'Dahl, G V', 'Aur, R J', 'Kalwinsky, D K', 'Wood, A', 'Stagner, S', 'Avery, T L']","['Rivera G', 'Bowman WP', 'Murphy SB', 'Dahl GV', 'Aur RJ', 'Kalwinsky DK', 'Wood A', 'Stagner S', 'Avery TL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Podophyllotoxin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Prednisone/*administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Teniposide/*administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950100503 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1982;10(5):439-46. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950100503.,,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,

Furthermore, the induction of immunologic memory in serum-protected mice is demonstrated by their long-term resistance to rechallenge with FLV of FLV-infected leukemic spleen cells, although cells of an established transplantable syngeneic FLV-erythroleukemia (FLC-745) are not rejected. In the course of these studies, a serum prophylaxis effect was defined in DBA/2 mice treated with the chimpanzee anti-FLV serum before, rather than after FLV infection. The prophylaxis effect is highly dependent on the time period between the last serum inoculation and virus challenge. The results indicate that the long-term resistance of therapeutically protected mice to subsequent virus or leukemic cell challenge is not due to the short-term prophylactic effect of serum treatment alone.","['Genovesi, E V', 'Livnat, D', 'Collins, J J']","['Genovesi EV', 'Livnat D', 'Collins JJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', '*Immunization, Passive', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/prevention & control/therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Spleen/immunology']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(82)90014-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1982;6(4):577-93. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(82)90014-5.,,['5T32 CA 09111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,

In both cases, the induced HL60 cells lose their proliferative ability. The availability of this inducible cell line has led to an increasing number of studies aimed at dissecting the process of myeloid differentiation. However, the correct interpretation of such studies may only be reached through the use of appropriate cellular controls; specifically, variant HL60 cell lines which do not differentiate in response to the inducing agents. Here we report the isolation and characterization of two variant cell lines of HL60 which do not differentiate in the presence of 1.25% dimethylsulphoxide but still respond to TPA.

The DU-ALL-1 antigen had an apparent mol. wt of 24,000 and did not bind to lectins or label with [3H]glucosamine.

By comparison with biopsies from children under investigation for suspected malabsorption crypt mitosis was significantly reduced and showed a negative correlation with the dose of methotrexate given prior to biopsy. The three major cell types were studied under light and transmission electron microscopy. Gut endocrine cells were unaffected by therapy and immature crypt enterocytes showed only patchy degenerative abnormalities. By contrast a number of Paneth cells showed striking structural alterations with vacuolar dilatation of the cytoplasm.

The maximum recovery from the cell nuclei occurred 5 min after injection of the steroid. At this time, ten times more radioactivity was recovered from the liver cell nuclei of male animals compared to females. The recovered radioactivity in the cell nuclei was identified as mainly unmetabolised corticosterone and 5 alpha-dihydrocorticosterone. The radioactivity bound to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor protein also appeared to consist of unmetabolised corticosterone and 5 alpha-dihydrocorticosterone. However, 5 alpha-dihydrocorticosterone was found to have very little biological activity. The glucocorticoid receptor was found to exist in two forms with Stokes radii of 6.1 and 3.6 nm, respectively, following in vivo labelling with [3H] dexamethasone. The 6.1 nm form could be converted into the 3.6 nm form by incubation with trypsin, papain, alpha-chymotrypsin or an extract of purified rat liver lysosomes. Further incubation resulted in an even smaller form with a Stokes radius of 1.9 nm. With the help of biospecific adsorption chromatography based on the differential affinity of the activated and nonactivated complexes for DNA, the 6.1 nm form of the glucocorticoid-receptor complex was purified to near homogeneity by a rapid and simple technique. An immunoglobulin fraction from serum of a rabbit immunized with a highly purified preparation of glucocorticoid receptor contained specific antibodies to the receptor. The antibodies cross-reacted with the glucocorticoid receptor from human normal lymphocytes, chronic lymphatic leukemia cells and human hippocampus. Activated glucocorticoid receptor protein binds selectively in vitro to a cloned fragment of murine mammary tumor virus DNA. In contrast, the receptor fails to bind selectively to DNA restriction fragments from E coli plasmids pBR 322 and RSF 2124 or from bacteriophages alpha and T4.","['Gustafsson, J A', 'Carlstedt-Duke, J', 'Okret, S', 'Wrange, O']","['Gustafsson JA', 'Carlstedt-Duke J', 'Okret S', 'Wrange O']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Eur J Respir Dis Suppl,European journal of respiratory diseases.

There were one complete and four partial remissions in these patients, all of whom had received at least 500 mg AMSA/m2. Thirteen children with solid tumours were treated. They received single doses of 120 mg/m2 initially, increasing to 100 mg/m2 for 5 days. No complete or partial responses occurred, but some antitumour activity was noted in neuroblastoma and retinoblastoma. Dose-related severe bone marrow toxicity occurred, but gastrointestinal and other toxicity was mild. An additional patient with T cell lymphoma, who received AMSA prior to a successful autologous bone marrow transplant, is described. AMSA is an active drug in childhood leukaemia. Further studies at the maximum tolerated dose are needed to assess enough patients with any single solid tumour type. In particular, the response of neuroblastoma warrants further study. Investigation of the use of AMSA either prior to bone marrow transplantation in leukaemia or in association with autologous marrow transplant in neuroblastoma and other solid tumours may be of value.","['Goldman, A', 'Malpas, J S']","['Goldman A', 'Malpas JS']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Aminoacridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aminoacridines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Amsacrine', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00296763 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1982;9(1):53-6. doi: 10.1007/BF00296763.,,,,,

At Ara-C concentrations above 10 microM there was no longer a linear relationship of phosphorylation to Ara-C concentration. Ara-U production was measured by sampling the incubation medium. This method showed greater Ara-U production than previous methods sampling the cell pellet alone. However, Ara-CTP/Ara-U ratios from intact myeloblasts were much higher than those recorded in studies using lysed myeloblasts. Using 1 microM Ara-C, a concentration representative of in vivo concentrations, deamination and phosphorylation were related to therapeutic response to Ara-C-containing drug regimens. There was no significant correlation of these variables with response, although 5/16 non-responders had low Ara-C phosphorylation (less than 1.5 pmol/10(6) cells/45 min/l pm Ara-C) compared with 0/9 responders. Measuring deaminase activity did not help in selecting non-responders.

At low MTX concentrations (less than 6 X 10(-8) M), purines reduced MTX toxicity and at higher concentrations they potentiated MTX toxicity. The reduction of low-concentration MTX cytotoxicity by purines was associated with the reversal of MTX-induced changes in deoxyribonucleotide pools.

The magnitude of increase in deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate levels tended to correlate with the degree of potentiation which varied between 5-fold and 200-fold, depending on cell type and the exogenous purine.","['Taylor, I W', 'Slowiaczek, P', 'Francis, P R', 'Tattersall, M H']","['Taylor IW', 'Slowiaczek P', 'Francis PR', 'Tattersall MH']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Hypoxanthines)', '0 (Purines)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine', 'Hypoxanthines/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/physiopathology', 'Melanoma/physiopathology', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Purines/*pharmacology']",1982/12/01 00:00,1982/12/01 00:01,['1982/12/01 00:00'],"['1982/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Dec;42(12):5159-64.,,,,,

On lung biopsy, pathologic changes were characterized by diffuse alveolar damage with degenerating blast cells in the interstitium and in organizing alveolar exudates. No potential pathogenic organisms were seen on light or electron microscopy of the biopsy samples. In each case the pulmonary infiltrate resolved without specific therapy. We postulate that lysis of leukemic cells, with subsequent release of their enzyme contents, led to the diffuse alveolar damage observed pathologically.

It was measured repeatedly during remission to assess whether it could predict relapse. Ninety-seven percent of the children achieved a complete remission of their disease, and 40% relapsed during the study. The level of TdT activity in blasts at diagnosis varied 1000-fold from patient to patient. There was no statistically significant relationship between TdT activity in cells at diagnosis and the achievement of complete remission, the duration of remission, or length of survival. TdT activity was significantly increased in the bone marrow of 65% of patients at the time of marrow morphological relapse, but was rarely increased in marrow from patients with isolated testicular or central nervous system relapse. Wide fluctuations in TdT activity were characteristically seen in mononuclear cells from the marrow and peripheral blood of patients with ALL at all stages of their disease. An isolated high value of TdT activity in the bone marrow or peripheral blood cannot be taken as evidence of impending relapse.

However, a platelet deficiency cannot be the entire explanation, since most patients with thrombocytopenia never experience this complication. To better define the reason for intra-alveolar bleeding, we studied the clinical and pathologic findings in three patients with leukemia who died of massive pulmonary hemorrhage. Although the major finding at autopsy in all three cases were widespread intra=-alveolar hemorrhage, evidence of diffuse alveolar damage was also found. In one patient, a lung biopsy specimen (obtained five days before death) showed extensive intra-alveolar hemorrhage by light microscopy, while severe destruction of alveolar walls was detected by electron microscopy. The findings suggest that diffuse alveolar damage plus thrombocytopenia are necessary for massive pulmonary hemorrhage to occur in leukemia.","['Smith, L J', 'Katzenstein, A L']","['Smith LJ', 'Katzenstein AL']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Intern Med,Archives of internal medicine,0372440,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Basement Membrane/pathology', 'Capillaries/pathology', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/*etiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*complications', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Lung Diseases/*etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Pulmonary Alveoli/pathology', 'Thrombocytopenia/complications']",1982/11/01 00:00,1982/11/01 00:01,['1982/11/01 00:00'],"['1982/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Intern Med. 1982 Nov;142(12):2149-52.,,,,,

Chemotherapy does not seem to affect the development of junctions that were studied in sections and freeze fracture. Two age groups were considered (I, 5 to 8 years; II, 9 to 12 years). In age group I, oval Sertoli cells were connected by occasionally focal points of fusion, which in replicas appeared as scattered, interrupted ridges on the P face and grooves on the corresponding E face. In age group II Sertoli cells presented cytoplasmic extensions and interdigitations. Tight junctions appeared close to one another in conventional sections. Freeze fracture evidenced extensive although isolated areas formed by intervining strands. Lanthanum penetrated freely the intercellular spaces and gap junctions were observed in both age groups. The results suggest that tight junctions formation is initiated long before puberty; a progression in the complexity of the strand organization is present as the tubules mature; the strands reorganize in parallel and continuous rows only at puberty.","['Camatini, M', 'Franchi, E', 'de Curtis, I', 'Anelli, G', 'Masera, G']","['Camatini M', 'Franchi E', 'de Curtis I', 'Anelli G', 'Masera G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anat Rec,The Anatomical record,0370540,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biopsy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Junctions/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/pharmacology', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Prednisone/*pharmacology', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Sertoli Cells/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Testis/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",1982/07/01 00:00,1982/07/01 00:01,['1982/07/01 00:00'],"['1982/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ar.1092030306 [doi]'],ppublish,Anat Rec. 1982 Jul;203(3):353-63. doi: 10.1002/ar.1092030306.,,,,,

Factors predisposing to abnormalities.,257-62,"Twenty-three children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) were examined by computed tomography (CT) of the head on two occasions more than 11 months apart. The first CT was performed at the time of diagnosis in 11 children, who were re-examined while still in their first complete remission. They had received prophylactic central nervous system (CNS) treatment consisting of intrathecal methotrexate supplemented by irradiation in 7 cases and intermediate dose methotrexate in 4 cases. Twelve children were receiving treatment for CNS relapse. This included therapeutic irradiation and intrathecal methotrexate. Abnormal CT developed in 7 children. Three CT scans demonstrated areas of decreased attenuation coefficient, one with intracerebral calcifications. In 5 patients, dilatation of the ventricles and cortical sulci had developed. All CT abnormalities occurred in children in remission after CNS relapse. These results indicate that prophylactic treatment including cranial irradiation with 24 Gy and low cumulative doses of methotrexate is a safe procedure. Patients with CNS leukemia are at risk of developing CNS abnormalities, when they receive treatment with cranial irradiation and methotrexate. The risk is not correlated with age or sex of the child, the duration of the disease, the dose of irradiation or the cumulative dose of methotrexate.","['Clausen, N', 'Pedersen, H']","['Clausen N', 'Pedersen H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Sweden,Acta Paediatr Scand,Acta paediatrica Scandinavica,0000211,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain/*diagnostic imaging', 'Brain Diseases/chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Brain Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnostic imaging/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Spinal Cord Neoplasms/prevention & control', '*Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",1982/03/01 00:00,1982/03/01 00:01,['1982/03/01 00:00'],"['1982/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1651-2227.1982.tb09411.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Paediatr Scand. 1982 Mar;71(2):257-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1651-2227.1982.tb09411.x.,,,,,

Maintenance therapy was stopped after about 22 months. The life table-analysis after 30 months showed a 75.5% disease free survival for the total group of patients. Compared with a control group of 228 patients treated between 1974 and 1980 in 9 different clinics in Austria according to 3 consecutive national treatment regimens (modifications of Memphis protocol VII and VIII), therapeutic results were markedly improved. After a follow-up of 36 to 90 months the overall oumulative remission rate was 37.7%. The results could be improved especially in the group of high risk patients for replase by 35% in contrast to the historical studies. A prognostic difference between low- and high risk-patients was not seen in the BFM study (84.3% vs. 69.9%). Without doubt, the marked improvement of prognosis is due to the intensification of therapy.","['Gadner, H', 'Krepler, P', 'Kundi, M', 'Mutz, I', 'Pichler, E', 'Schmidmeier, W', 'Tulzer, W', 'Urban, C']","['Gadner H', 'Krepler P', 'Kundi M', 'Mutz I', 'Pichler E', 'Schmidmeier W', 'Tulzer W', 'Urban C']",['ger'],['Journal Article'],Austria,Wien Med Wochenschr,Wiener medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),8708475,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Risk', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1982/07/31 00:00,1982/07/31 00:01,['1982/07/31 00:00'],"['1982/07/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/31 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/31 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Wien Med Wochenschr. 1982 Jul 31;132(13-14):313-8.,,,Fortschritte in der Behandlung von Leukamien im Kindesalter.,,

The former approach chiefly considers the primary biological injuries at the cellular level, and the relationship between the dependent variable characteristic of the effect and the dose--an independent variable--has an explanatory meaning. The parameters associated to the independent variable have a biophysical signification and fit into a model of the action of ionizing radiations. In the latter approach, the relationship is pragmatic and the previous parameters are just the result of a curve-fitting procedure realized on experimental or human data. The biophysical models have led to a general formulation associating a linear term to a quadratic term both of them weighted by an exponential term describing cellular killing at the highest doses. To a certain extent the curves obtained for leukemias, bronchopulmonary and breast cancers prove the validity of the pragmatic model.","['Beau, P G', 'Nenot, J C']","['Beau PG', 'Nenot JC']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique,Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,7608039,,IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/etiology', '*Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced', 'Lung Neoplasms/etiology', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced', 'Osteosarcoma/etiology', '*Radiation Injuries', 'Radiation, Ionizing']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique. 1982;30(2):151-68.,,,Relations entre les doses de rayonnements et leurs effets.,,

Such cytogenetic sub groups are associated with differing prognoses. In acute lymphocytic leukemia, even the ploidy of the leukemic cells appears important in predicting prognosis. Identification of the Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome has diagnostic significance in chronic granulocytic leukemia. This makes possible the classification of patients into Ph1 + and Ph1 - varieties which have different responses to therapy. Similar variations are found between the 2 groups of patients who do or do not develop additional abnormalities with blastic transformation. The implication of these findings in both acute and chronic leukemia may influence choice of therapy in the future.","['Garson, O M']",['Garson OM'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y/ultrastructure', 'Cytogenetics', '*Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Ploidies']",1982/07/01 00:00,1982/07/01 00:01,['1982/07/01 00:00'],"['1982/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/00313028209061379 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathology. 1982 Jul;14(3):291-4. doi: 10.3109/00313028209061379.,,,,,

The results of these studies showed that the epimerization of the carbomethoxy-group at position 10 of the Class II anthracycline aglycone resulted in a 3-fold to 20-fold decrease in DNA-binding ability. The reduced DNA binding ability of these compounds is correlated with a 2-fold to 17-fold decrease in whole cellular nucleic acid synthesis inhibitory potency, a 2-fold to 4-fold decrease in vitro antitumor potency, and a 4-fold to 32-fold reduction in in vivo antitumor potency. These results further support the concept that a major portion of the antitumor activity of Class II anthracyclines is related to their avidity for DNA interactions and resultant disruption of normal template function. Previous studies from this laboratory have demonstrated that the 10-carbomethoxy group is essential for nucleolar RNA synthesis inhibition and Class II anthracycline antitumor activity. The current study further demonstrates that the stereochemical orientation of the carbomethoxy group at position 10 of the aglycone is also important in conferring Class II anthracycline antitumor activity.","['DuVernay, V H', 'Eubanks, D', 'Perales, R', 'Prestayko, A W', 'Crooke, S T']","['DuVernay VH', 'Eubanks D', 'Perales R', 'Prestayko AW', 'Crooke ST']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Naphthacenes/pharmacology', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1982 Jan;21(1):196-203.,,['CA-10893-P12/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,

Among 5,997 women treated with radiation, 449 developed second primary cancers compared with 313 expected (relative risk = 1.4) on the basis of rates from the Connecticut Tumor Registry. Excess incidence was noticeable 15 years or more after radiotherapy and attributed mostly to cancers of sites in or near the radiation field, especially the bladder, kidneys, rectum, corpus uteri, and ovaries. No excess was found for these sites among the 1,130 nonirradiated women. The ratio of observed to expected cancers for these sites did not vary appreciably by age at irradiation. The data suggested that high-dose pelvic irradiation was associated with increase in cancers of the bladder, kidneys, rectum, ovaries, corpus uteri, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma but, apparently, not leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, breast cancer, or colon cancer.","['Kleinerman, R A', 'Curtis, R E', 'Boice, J D Jr', 'Flannery, J T', 'Fraumeni, J F Jr']","['Kleinerman RA', 'Curtis RE', 'Boice JD Jr', 'Flannery JT', 'Fraumeni JF Jr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Risk', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*radiotherapy']",1982/11/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1982/11/01 00:00'],"['1982/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1982/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1982 Nov;69(5):1027-33.,,,,,

While imidazole does inhibit heme, globin mRNA, and hemoglobin accumulation in DMSO-induced MEL cells, it does not affect the commitment of MEL cells to the specific limitation of proliferative capacity associated with the in vitro differentiation program. Furthermore, imidazole treatment does not affect DMSO-induced changes in cell volume, in the relative proportion of nuclear protein IP25, and in the specific activity of the enzyme cytidine deaminase. A clonal analysis in the presence of imidazole indicated that the drug prevents heme accumulation even in MEL cells already committed to terminal differentiation. These observations suggest that imidazole effectively dissociates two aspects of the erythroid differentiation program of MEL cells: globin gene expression and commitment to loss of proliferative capacity.","['Gusella, J F', 'Tsiftsoglou, A S', 'Volloch, V', 'Weil, S C', 'Neumann, J', 'Housman, D E']","['Gusella JF', 'Tsiftsoglou AS', 'Volloch V', 'Weil SC', 'Neumann J', 'Housman DE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/metabolism', 'Cytidine Deaminase/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/genetics', 'Heme/metabolism', 'Hemoglobins/*biosynthesis', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology']",1982/10/01 00:00,1982/10/01 00:01,['1982/10/01 00:00'],"['1982/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041130127 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1982 Oct;113(1):179-85. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041130127.,,"['CA 14051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17575/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,

Colony development is independent of the normal regulator--the myeloid colony stimulating factor. The observed autostimulation suggests the production of specific growth promoters by the cells. Differentiation either to mature granulocytes or macrophages, induced by various agents, was associated with reduced cloning potential. Nevertheless, colonies containing differentiated cells could be developed either by cloning cells in the presence of suboptimal concentrations of inducer or by adding inducers over colonies developed in its absence. Upon differentiation, there was a morphological change from compact to diffused colony morphology due to cell mobility in the semisolid medium. Even at suboptimal concentrations of inducer more than 95% of the colonies became diffused, indicating clonal homogeneity of the population with respect to differentiation capacity. The loss of self-renewal was found to be one of the early properties which changed following the initiation of differentiation. The loss preceded not only the overt expression of maturation-specific functions but also cellular commitment to terminal differentiation; shorter contact with the inducer was required to cause loss of self-renewal than to induce an irreversible transition to differentiation. This resulted in cells that lost their self-renewal potential without being able to complete their program of differentiation.","['Fibach, E', 'Peled, T', 'Rachmilewitz, E A']","['Fibach E', 'Peled T', 'Rachmilewitz EA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,['YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)'],IM,"['*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/cytology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology']",1982/10/01 00:00,1982/10/01 00:01,['1982/10/01 00:00'],"['1982/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041130124 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1982 Oct;113(1):152-8. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041130124.,,,,,

In normal control subjects (n=21), values of FPA by the radioimmunoassay were 0.5 +/- 1.4 ng/ml (mean +/- SD). In animal models, using Lyoplastin (tissue thromboplastin, n=5) or Ancrod (n=5) to piglets, plasma FPA levels elevated rapidly as a reflection of fibrin formation, and these changes of FPA were found to be most rapid and sensitive among the indicators for coagulation and fibrinolysis. In patients with thrombosis (n=32), elevated FPA levels (14.7 +/- 13.8 ng/ml) and beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG)(86.1 +/- 65.6 ng/ml) were found. FPA levels in these patients positively correlated to beta-TG (r=0.5539, P less than 0.05) and inversely to fibrinogen (fbg) (r= -0.3622, P less than 0.05). In patients with acute myelocytic leukemia (AML, n=112), acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL, n=18) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL, n=15), mean FPA levels in patients with active signs and symptoms were significantly higher (AML: 13.5 ng/ml, APL: 20.8 ng/ml, ALL: 12.4 ng/ml) than those examined during remission states (AML: 7.7 ng/ml, P less than 0.02, APL: 3.9 ng/ml, P less than 0.01, ALL: 2.7 ng/ml, P less than 0.01). FPA levels in patients with APL inversely correlated to fbg (r= -0.6399, P less than 0.01). In patients with lung cancer (n=75), mean FPA level in advanced stage (17.7 ng/ml, n=67) were significantly higher than those examined in early stage 6.5 ng/ml, n=8, P less than 0.001). In patients with acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (n=12), prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, severely reduced fbg and platelets, and remarkably elevated fibrin degradation product were found. Elevated FPA and beta-TG levels were also found (FPA: 23.5 +/- 15.0 ng/ml, beta-TG: 100.0 +/- 63.0 ng/ml). In five patients with thrombotic diseases who were treated successfully with 12500 IU of heparin per 12 hours (subcutaneous injection), plasma FPA levels were reduced to near normal levels quicker than changes of other indicators.

The binding of [3H]PDBu to intact cells was maximal within only 15 min of incubation at 37 degrees C, after which there was a gradual decrease; binding at 4 degrees C however, was a slow process, requiring greater than 180 min for maximal binding. A Scatchard analysis showed that the dissociation constant for binding of [3H]PDBu is 8.3 nM; at saturation, approximately 1.75 x 10(5) molecules of [3H]PDBu are bound per cell. The binding of [3H]PDBu is blocked by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate, phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, mezerein, 4-O-methyl-12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate and resiniferatoxin, but not by phorbol or 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate. There was, in general, a good correlation between the potency of these agents in inhibiting [3H]PDBu binding and their activity in promoting tumors on mouse skin. Inducers of differentiation, such as hexamethylene bisacetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and butyric acid, as well as inhibitors of cell differentiation, dexamethasone and local anesthetics, did not significantly block the binding of [3H]PDBu to intact FELC. When FELC were induced to differentiate with 4 mM hexamethylene bisacetamide (approximately 80% of cells were benzidine-positive), a slight decrease (10-20%) in the number of binding sites at saturation was seen, but the dissociation constant was not changed. When the cells were precultured with non-radioactive phorbol esters, a significant decrease in [3H]PDBu binding was observed, suggesting a homologous down regulation of phorbol ester receptors. Scatchard analysis indicated that the decrease in [3H]PDBu binding was due to a decrease in the number of binding sites and not to a change in affinity. Such specific phorbol ester binding sites might mediate a number of biochemical and biological effects of phorbol esters on FELC.","['Yamasaki, H', 'Drevon, C', 'Martel, N']","['Yamasaki H', 'Drevon C', 'Martel N']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Phorbols)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', 'A5O6P1UL4I (resiniferatoxin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Diterpenes/toxicity', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate', 'Phorbol Esters/*metabolism', 'Phorbols/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/toxicity', 'Tritium']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/3.8.905 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1982;3(8):905-10. doi: 10.1093/carcin/3.8.905.,,,,,

However, when excessive amounts of nonradioactive vindesine were added, the 3H-vindesine was displaced. Binding of 3H-vindesine was only inhibited by vinblastine, vincristine and vindesine. These results suggest that K562 cells have receptors for vindesine and that these receptors are common to vinca alkaloids. Scatchard analysis showed that the number of vindesine receptors differed according to the kind of cells tested. K562 and a T-cell leukaemia-derived cell line, MOLT-4, had more receptors than an acute promyelocytic leukaemia-derived cell line, HL-60, and normal blood lymphocytes.

This age-associated, changing pattern of in vivo proliferation of K-562 cells derived from a single aliquot was consistently repeated throughout sequential passages. The only variable in this experimental system was the age of the recipient mice. Not only did the mice have an identical genetic background, but also the transplanted K-562 cells were derived from a single culture passage. As shown by cytological and histological examinations, the characteristic morphology and percentage composition of the subpopulations of the K-562 cell line were preserved in successive in vitro and in vivo passages. The K-562 cells had no prevailing phenotypic traits which could be associated with the growth either in the s.c. tissue or in the viscera. Furthermore, the cells maintained the human karyotype, including their typical chromosomal abnormalities and antigenic determinants, as demonstrated by the binding of a specific antibody, throughout all passages. Our results demonstrate that heterotransplanted K-562 cells may change their behaviour in vivo without undergoing modifications associated with different types of growth. These findings would indicate that the ability of neoplastic cells to proliferate in various environments (metastases) is not the consequence of predetermined cellular characteristics but is functionally conditioned.","['Machado, E A', 'Mitchell, J R', 'Lozzio, B B', 'Lozzio, C B', 'Gerard, D A']","['Machado EA', 'Mitchell JR', 'Lozzio BB', 'Lozzio CB', 'Gerard DA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude']",1982/09/01 00:00,1982/09/01 00:01,['1982/09/01 00:00'],"['1982/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1982.214 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1982 Sep;46(3):383-91. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1982.214.,PMC2011137,"['CA 18185-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'FR-5541/PHS HHS/United States']",,,

A significantly wider variation of unscheduled DNA synthesis was found in leukaemic as compared to normal blast cell populations. There was also a wider variation within individual leukaemic blast cell samples compared to normal samples. A correlation was found between unscheduled DNA synthesis induced by nitrogen mustard and by UV-irradiation in the leukaemic blast cell populations. The UV-induced unscheduled DNA synthesis in some of the leukaemic blast cell populations continued to increase at doses of UV-irradiation at which normal myeloblasts had reached their maximum level of unscheduled DNA synthesis.

Although no facilitation of one virus by the other was detected, persistently infected cultures were established. Electron microscopic examination revealed the presence of vaccinia and leukemia viruses in the same cell. The permanent lines of cells persistently infected with vaccinia were designated FLvac. Their morphology, growth rate, cloning efficiency, and ability to respond to the induction of erythrodifferentiation by treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide were not appreciably altered as compared to the parental FL cells. However, the persistently infected cells showed a marked decrease in tumorigenicity when assayed in DBA/2 mice. The infectious virus produced by FLvac cells and by L2 cells were indistinguishable as judged by restriction endonuclease patterns of virion DNA, structural proteins, and the activities of two virion-associated DNases. The yield of infectious vaccinia virus from FLvac cells generally declined after about 60 serial passages. Although some cell lines no longer yield infectious virus, they are resistant to challenge with vaccinia at concentrations that are cytolytic for L2 cells. The mechanism responsible for the establishment of the persistent infection remains unclear because defective particles, interferon production, and temperature-sensitive mutants have not been detected.","['Pogo, B G', 'Friend, C']","['Pogo BG', 'Friend C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/growth & development', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*microbiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/microbiology', 'Transfection', 'Vaccinia virus/genetics/*growth & development', 'Virus Replication']",1982/08/01 00:00,1982/08/01 00:01,['1982/08/01 00:00'],"['1982/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.79.15.4805 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1982 Aug;79(15):4805-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.79.15.4805.,PMC346767,"['CA 10,000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13,047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 29, 262/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,

Over 80% of the removal of O6MeGua was accomplished by the transfer of the methyl group to cysteine moieties of acceptor proteins in a stoichiometric reaction.

(i) NL-22, NL-1: NL-22 antibody reacted with leukemia cells from 12 to 16 cases of null cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (null-ALL) but not with any other type of leukemia tested or with lymphoid cells of various origins. Among cultured cell lines tested, one (NALM-6) of three null-ALL cell lines was positive, the others were negative. Absorption analysis confirmed the restriction of NL-22 antigen to null-ALL. NL-1 antibody was reactive with leukemia cells from 10 to 16 cases of null-ALL and 3 of 6 cases of chronic myelocytic leukemia in blastic crisis (CML-BC). The antigen was present also on a minor population of normal lymphoid cells. The distribution and molecular weight (100,000; glycoprotein) of the NL-1 antigen resembled that of the previously described common ALL antigen (cALL). (ii) NL-30, NL-4: Both antibodies exhibited almost identical patterns of reactivities against cultured cell lines tested. They reacted with leukemia cells from some cases of null-ALL, adult T-cell leukemia, and CML-BC, although they showed discordance in their reactivities against a panel of leukemia cells, (iii) NL-9, NL-8, NL-25: These three antibodies detect serologically distinguishable determinants on a broad range of leukemias and normal lymphoid and hematopoietic cell types. The antibodies analyzed in this study provide evidence for the heterogeneity of null-ALL by demonstrating a variety of antigen phenotypes on leukemia cells. One of the antigens (NL-22) appears to be restricted to null-ALL.","['Ueda, R', 'Tanimoto, M', 'Takahashi, T', 'Ogata, S', 'Nishida, K', 'Namikawa, R', 'Nishizuka, Y', 'Ota, K']","['Ueda R', 'Tanimoto M', 'Takahashi T', 'Ogata S', 'Nishida K', 'Namikawa R', 'Nishizuka Y', 'Ota K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes, Null/*immunology', 'Mice']",1982/07/01 00:00,1982/07/01 00:01,['1982/07/01 00:00'],"['1982/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.79.14.4386 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1982 Jul;79(14):4386-90. doi: 10.1073/pnas.79.14.4386.,PMC346676,,,,

Two specific translocations have been detected only in ANLL arrested in a particular stage in myeloid maturation, i.e., t(8;21) associated with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) with maturation (M2) and t(15;17) associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3). Patients with these translocations are substantially younger then patients with the same type of leukemia who have either a normal karyotype or other chromosome abnormalities. Patients who have ANLL secondary to treatment for a prior malignant disease tend to have AML (M1 or M2) and an abnormal karyotype with losses of chromosome #5 and/or #7. A similar high incidence of AML and aneuploidy affecting particularly #5, 7, 8, and 21 was seen in patients with ANLL who were exposed to chemicals and pesticides. Complete unselected data are available for 239 patients with ANLL; 128 of these were classified as having AML (M1 or M2). Within the AML group, 65% of the patients were chromosomally abnormal. Except for 16 patients with a t(8;21), the percentage of those with an abnormal karyotype increased with age, particularly above the age of 50 years. In regard to abnormalities other than t(8;21), 29 patients had loss of part of all of #5 and/or #7, 11 had +8, and 27 had other abnormalities.

All patients with immune complexes during the first two months of remission remained in remission for less than six months, whereas only 11 per cent of patients without complexes within this period had such early relapse. Of 23 patients who relapsed after long remissions, 18 (78 per cent) had immune complexes that preceded hematologic evidence of relapse by three weeks to six months (median, 3.7 months).

In primary virus-induced leukemias, no chromosome abnormalities were found. However, in tumors derived from transplanted leukemia tissue and in cell lines obtained from these tumors, euploidy and mostly aneuploidy were observed that varied according to the type of tumor cells and the number of passages. Eleven erythroleukemia cell lines showed aneuploidy from the first in vivo transplant stage on. Nonrandom abnormalities were found: trisomy 15 in 9 of 11 lines, followed by trisomy 3 in 8 of 11 lines and monosomy 6 in 5 of 11 lines. Subsequent evolution of the karyotypes was frequent (10 of 11 lines) and rapid. In vivo cell lines established from these tumors showed many structural rearrangements. Three myeloid lines revealed a stable karyotype with no or only minor changes: trisomy 15 in 1 line and normal diploid in 2 lines. One lymphatic leukemia cell line established in vitro presented with a very stable karyotype: trisomies 14 and 15. Another in vivo transplantable line showed trisomies 11, 9, and 17.

An extensive side-by-side serologic comparison of BA-3 with the anti-common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) monoclonal antibody J-5 was undertaken. Cells examined included established leukemic cell lines, malignant cells from patients with newly diagnosed leukemia/lymphoma, and normal hematopoietic tissues. In all experiments the cellular distribution of the antigens recognized by BA-3 and J-5 were identical when analyzed by immunofluorescent microscopy and the FACS. Iodination of NALM-6 cells, followed by radioimmunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE, indicated that BA-3 (like J-5) precipitated a glycoprotein of approximately 100,000 daltons. Competitive binding studies using 125I-labeled BA-3 indicated that BA-3 and J-5 were binding to closely associated (if not identical) epitopes on CALLA. Calculation of the equilibrium constant (K value) for BA-3 and J-5, and the approximate number of CALLA molecules per cell, was graphically determined using Scatchard plots. BA-3 and J-5 were shown to have K values of approximately 2.7 x 10(7) M-1 and 7.2 x 10(7) M-1, respectively, with NALM-6 cells expressing 1 x 10(5) to 2 x 10(5) CALLA molecules per cell. Additional studies with BA-3 failed to demonstrate significant antigenic modulation of CALLA in vitro using fresh leukemic cells and leukemic cell lines.

NAP activity was studied in bone marrow from patients with normal peripheral blood NAP scores (20-100) and compared with those with high NAP scores. Results indicate that NAP activity is confined to segmented neutrophils (SN) in marrow and peripheral blood except when peripheral NAP activity is abnormally high. There is a normal increase of approximately 60% in mean NAP scores of peripheral blood compared to marrow SN. Granulocyte Fc-IgG receptor activity, known to increase with maturation, was studied in relation to NAP activity. A combined assay using a rosetting technique with ox-erythrocyte (oxE) antibody-IgG and subsequent NAP cytochemistry was used. Receptor expression was found to be virtually complete in normal granulocytic maturation before the appearance of detectable NAP activity. This was supported by findings in chronic myeloid leukaemia where no cases of low Fc receptor activity were found despite NAP scores of less than 5.

During this process, physicochemical, and functional changes were detected simultaneously. After exposure to DMSO for more than 1 day, the cell volume decreased and the tendency for hydrophobic interaction increased. Using a hydrophobic two-phase system in counter current distribution fashion, it was then possible to separate more mature metamyelocytes and segmented granulocytes from immature myeloblasts and promyelocytes. Increased functional maturity was reflected by increased chemiluminescence (CL) response and phagocytic activity. Using yeast particles opsonized with IgG as stimulating agent, the CL response increased already after 1 day in DMSO, in parallel with increased phagocytosis of these particles. In contrast, C3b-opsonized yeast and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) did not enhance the CL response conspicuosly until days 3-4. These data suggest that Fc receptor function linked to phagocytosis and the activation of oxidative metabolism develop earlier than that of C3b and PMA.

Prostaglandin F2 alpha inhibited the inductions by dexamethasone of phagocytic and lysozyme activities in M1 cells. Prostaglandin F2 alpha stimulated the production of differentiation-inhibiting activity (I-activity) in M1 cells. I-activity production by prostaglandin F2 alpha was decreased by simultaneous treatment with actinomycin D (5 ng/ml) but not with 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (10 ng/ml). The I-activity was inactivated by heating (70 degrees, 20 min) or by treatment with trypsin but not with mixed glycosidases or ribonuclease, suggesting that I-activity was due to a proteinous substance(s). B-Type prostaglandins also stimulated I-activity production, whereas A-, E- and D-type ones did not. Induction of prostaglandin E2. Retinoic acid stimulated the synthesis and release of prostaglandin F2 alpha and production of I-activity in M1 cells. Indomethacin completely inhibited induction of I-activity by retinoic acid.

HL-60 cells grew in the absence of serum in synthetic medium supplemented with insulin, transferrin, and several trace elements, and could be maintained for more than 6 months in this medium. Induction of differentiation by TPA was observed with cells grown in serum-free medium. Human myeloid leukemia cells (K562-4) cultured in medium with serum could not be induced to differentiate even in the presence of TPA, but their differentiation into macrophages in the presence of TPA, arginase or actinomycin D was observed after they had been grown in serum-free medium for 4 months. Addition of serum inhibited the induction of differentiation of HL-60 and K562-4 cells that had been grown in serum-free medium. Calf serum was more inhibitory than fetal calf serum on TPA-induced differentiation, but there was no significant difference in the effects of the two sera on induction by actinomycin D or arginase. These results suggest that the different responses in media with different sera may be specific to TPA. Induction of adhesiveness of K562-4 cells by TPA required some unknown serum factor(s), although addition of serum inhibited the inductions of morphological and functional differentiation.

Studies reported elsewhere have shown that Sr2+, an alkaline earth ion known to degranulate granulocytes, inhibits NK cell function.

The recovery of natural killer function seen following in vitro culture of SR2+-treated effector cells was accompanied by the reappearance of typical intracytoplasmic granules. These data strongly suggest that the granules of LGL are required for and, perhaps, involved in natural killer-mediated cytolysis.","['Neighbour, P A', 'Huberman, H S', 'Kress, Y']","['Neighbour PA', 'Huberman HS', 'Kress Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,['YZS2RPE8LE (Strontium)'],IM,"['Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/classification/drug effects/*ultrastructure', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Monocytes/ultrastructure', 'Strontium/*pharmacology']",1982/07/01 00:00,1982/07/01 00:01,['1982/07/01 00:00'],"['1982/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830120711 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1982 Jul;12(7):588-95. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830120711.,,"['AI 09807/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 11920/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 15541/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that DMSO induction switched on cell alteration of the proerythroblast-like cells, possessing microvilli projections on cell membrane with some ruffles, to an advanced stage with a blebby surface. This was followed by the formation of a pear-like polarized cell separated into two zones by a narrow cytoplasmic bridge at the equatorial plane. The polarized cells showed a smooth surface and tended to disconnect into two unequal cells. The villous leukemic erythroblast has negatively charged sialic acid residues on the glycocalyx, available for latex hydrazide probe binding, while the blebby and polarized cells lack it. Tocopherol added to culture medium of DMSO-induced erythroleukemic cells prevented the formation of blebs and the polarization phenomena, without affecting hemoglobin synthesis. The tocopherol-treated cells contain available negative charges for latex hydrazide binding similar to uninduced Friend cells.

This corresponded to changes made in our cytogenetic techniques suggesting that the finding of the t(15;17) may be a function of technique, rather than a real difference in disease entities, and all patients with APL may have the t(15;17) when appropriately studied.","['Hurd, D D', 'Vukelich, M', 'Arthur, D C', 'Lindquist, L L', 'McKenna, R W', 'Peterson, B A', 'Bloomfield, C D']","['Hurd DD', 'Vukelich M', 'Arthur DC', 'Lindquist LL', 'McKenna RW', 'Peterson BA', 'Bloomfield CD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/physiopathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, 13-15', '*Chromosomes, Human, 16-18', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitosis', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1982/08/01 00:00,1982/08/01 00:01,['1982/08/01 00:00'],"['1982/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(82)90089-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(82)90089-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1982 Aug;6(4):331-7. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(82)90089-9.,,['CA-19527/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,

Consolidation for arm 1 employed cyclophosphamide and L-asparaginase followed by biweekly 5-day courses of parenteral MTX.

Survival and the incidence of extramedullary relapse were similar for the treatments employing either i.t. chemoprophylaxis or radiotherapy plus i.t. MTX upon achievement of remission. Among poor prognosis patients, the duration of complete remission was significantly better with the regimen using i.t. chemoprophylaxis as a component of consolidation therapy than with the regimen employing i.t. chemoprophylaxis early in induction or with the treatment using radiotherapy plus i.t.

In poor prognosis patients, the initiation of i.t. chemoprophylaxis during consolidation was also associated with hematologic remissions that were significantly better than those achieved with the treatment employing early CNS chemoprophylaxis or with the regimen using radiotherapy plus i.t.

Hematologic remissions of good prognosis patients who received treatment with the regimen employing i.t. chemoprophylaxis during consolidation were statistically superior when compared to the regimen employing CNS radiotherapy plus i.t.

Ninety patients (67%) had abnormal karyotypes. Five chromosome categories were designated, based on the distribution of modal numbers: hyperdiploid greater than 50 (n = 41), hyperdiploid 47-50 (n = 18), pseudodiploid (n = 28), normal (n = 46), and hypodiploid (n = 3). Treatment response was assessed for the categories in terms of time to failure (induction failure, first relapse, or death). Children in the hyperdiploid greater than 50 category had the best responses to treatment, with only 2 failures, and those in the pseudodiploid category had the poorest (p less than 0.001). The remaining 3 chromosome categories had intermediate responses and formed a third prognostic group. This same influence of chromosome number on time to failure was evident within the 2 clinical prognostic groups: high risk, signified by a leukocyte count greater than 100 X 10(9)/liter, meningeal leukemia, mediastinal mass, or the presence of blasts that formed rosettes with sheep erythrocytes at 37 degrees C, and standard risk, indicated by the absence of these features. The influence of chromosome number on time to failure was also the same within the historically favorable prognostic group that had common ALL. Results of a multivariate analysis indicated that chromosome number was the strongest single predictor of outcome (p less than 0.001) and was the only variable that added significant prognostic information to leukocyte count (p less than 0.001). The combination of chromosome number and leukocyte count should more clearly distinguish patients with ALL at low or high risk of relapse.","['Williams, D L', 'Tsiatis, A', 'Brodeur, G M', 'Look, A T', 'Melvin, S L', 'Bowman, W P', 'Kalwinsky, D K', 'Rivera, G', 'Dahl, G V']","['Williams DL', 'Tsiatis A', 'Brodeur GM', 'Look AT', 'Melvin SL', 'Bowman WP', 'Kalwinsky DK', 'Rivera G', 'Dahl GV']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9000-55-9 (Podophyllin)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Asparaginase/therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/prevention & control/secondary', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Ploidies', 'Podophyllin/administration & dosage', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1982/10/01 00:00,1982/10/01 00:01,['1982/10/01 00:00'],"['1982/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75942-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1982 Oct;60(4):864-71.,,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,

This induced complete remission in 42% of non-lymphoblastic, and in 58% of lymphoblastic plus undifferentiated leukaemias. Some induction failures who had non-lymphoblastic leukaemia were treated with cytosine arabinoside plus 6-thioguanine, which induced remissions in 46%. Advanced age was the factor most strongly associated with failure either to achieve or to sustain complete remission. Thrombocytopenia, promyelocytic leukaemia, high percentage of marrow blasts, and absence of metaphases in marrow cytogenetic preparations were also associated with poor survival.

Similar glucocorticoid receptors can be detected in lymphoid cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

Furthermore, in our hands, glucocorticoid receptor levels correlate with the duration of complete remission in ALL (though not in other forms of leukemia).

At the onset of the blast crisis, 90% of the blast cells were acid phosphatase-positive (focal pattern), Ph1-positive, lymphoid cells. The TdT activity amounted to 29 units/10(8) mononuclear cells in the peripheral blood and to 57 units/10(8) mononuclear cells in the bone marrow. Therapy with vincristine and prednisone caused the elimination of the TdT-positive cell population. 4 months later, there was an increase in TdT-negative, myeloid blasts which was brought under control with busulfan. Cytogenetic analysis of the myeloid blasts still revealed Ph1 positivity in 100% of the metaphases examined and the lack of additional chromosomal abnormalities. A second relapse was again dominated by TdT-containing cells with the 46,XX,Ph1 karyotype. This time, the patient failed to achieve remission with vincristine and prednisone. Even though the TdT activity was markedly decreased, the lymphoid blast count remained elevated and the cells showed resistance to further therapy. This failure of morphology, cytochemistry as well as cytogenetics to distinguish between the individual phenotypes emerging during the course of blast crisis of CML characterized the TdT as a cell marker of important diagnostic and therapeutically prognostic value.","['Paietta, E', 'Schwarzmeier, J D']","['Paietta E', 'Schwarzmeier JD']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*blood', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",1981/10/01 00:00,1981/10/01 00:01,['1981/10/01 00:00'],"['1981/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1981.tb00479.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1981 Oct;27(4):241-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1981.tb00479.x.,,,,,

Five new cases are presented including the first described following treatment for immune thrombocytopaenia. A review of the literature has revealed 226 case reports of treatment-linked AML with sufficient detail to permit further study. Of the total of 231 patients, 76 (33 per cent) followed Hodgkin's disease, 59 (25.5 per cent) multiple myeloma, 22 (9.5 per cent) non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 32 (14 per cent) other solid tumours and 42 (18 per cent) non-malignant diseases. The time interval from the start of chemotherapy to the diagnosis of AML was similar in all disease groups whether the patients had received radiotherapy or not. Differences emerged when the duration of exposure to chemotherapy was analysed in the individual disease groups; exposure was shorter in those patients treated for Hodgkin's disease and solid tumours than with the others suggesting that the pattern of administration of chemotherapy may be important. The effects of radiotherapy in addition to chemotherapy could not be defined precisely, but the study highlights the particular risk that appears to arise from alkylating agents, and the need to define optimal methods of administration of chemotherapy with minimal risk of inducing leukaemia.","['Smith, A G', 'Prentice, A G', 'Lucie, N P', 'Browning, J D', 'Dagg, J H', 'Rowan, R M']","['Smith AG', 'Prentice AG', 'Lucie NP', 'Browning JD', 'Dagg JH', 'Rowan RM']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Q J Med,The Quarterly journal of medicine,0401027,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic/drug therapy']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Q J Med. 1982 Spring;51(202):227-40.,,,,,

Infected EC cells were found to contain up to 100 integrated proviral genomes. However, expression of virus as measured by XC plaque and virus-specific RNA synthesis did not occur at significant levels, in contrast to productively infected differentiated cells. Analysis of the DNA in the infected EC cells revealed that the proviral genomes were highly methylated, as shown by their resistance to cleavage by Sma I. Integrated proviral genomes in infected differentiated cells were readily cut by Sma I and thus were not methylated at these sites. Transfection of DNA from infected EC cells to cells permissive for virus expression failed to induce virus expression. The proviral genomes, however, were potentially infectious because they induced XC plaques when the recipient cells for transfection were treated with 5-azacytidine. This drug is believed to interfere with DNA methylation. We conclude that expression of proviral genomes introduced into EC cells is suppressed and that this inactivation can be correlated with the de novo methylation of the viral DNA. De novo methylation activity thus may be a characteristic of early embryonic cells.","['Stewart, C L', 'Stuhlmann, H', 'Jahner, D', 'Jaenisch, R']","['Stewart CL', 'Stuhlmann H', 'Jahner D', 'Jaenisch R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Replication', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Virus Replication']",1982/07/01 00:00,1982/07/01 00:01,['1982/07/01 00:00'],"['1982/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.79.13.4098 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1982 Jul;79(13):4098-102. doi: 10.1073/pnas.79.13.4098.,PMC346584,,,,

One of 22 ANLL children had an abnormal IVP: only one kidney was involved with the unique mechanism of intraparenchimal hemorrhage and hydronephrosis due to the filling of renal pelvis and ureter by multiple coarse cloths.

However, during differentiation, no changes in the major cell surface proteins were detected using lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination, and no change in the synthesis of spectrin, the major cytoskeletal protein of the mature erythrocyte, was detected by specific immune precipitation. Despite this absence of major changes in cell surface proteins, profound changes take place in the organization of the cell membranes. A process similar but not identical to the enucleation observed in erythroid differentiation in vivo occurs in which a smooth-surfaced cell, about 10 micrometers in diameter, is divided from the nucleus-containing part of the cell.

There is a large body of virus-negative tumors, however, which are lowly antigenic and thus refractory to such approaches. Therefore, an investigation was done for determination of whether such tumors could be rendered susceptible to passive serum therapy by introduction of MuLV antigens onto the tumor cell surface. For this purpose a 3-methylcholanthrene-induced fibro-sarcoma from inbred C57BL/6J mice was chosen. Following infection of the tumor in vitro with Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV), the tumor was found to be susceptible to treatment with a high-titered heterologous anti-F-MuLV gp71 antiserum. The specificity of the treatment was determined by conduction of the therapy on the uninfected parental tumor, in which case there was no effect. In addition, therapy could be initiated at time points when demonstrable tumors were present and successfully treated animals were resistant to rechallenge with the infected tumor.

Age-adjusted mortality has increased more than fivefold during this 30-year period. Contrary to the impression obtained from clinical series, a slightly greater increase in age-adjusted mortality has occurred in males. Examination of age- and sex-specific mortality trends showed that the greatest apparent increase in myeloma mortality occurred in individuals over 70 years of age. The data are consistent with either a cohort effect, indicating a true increase in mortality, or an age-dependent diagnostic effect in which a greater percentage of deaths among the elderly are now being certified as myeloma. Analyses of mortality data by social class and region point toward improved case ascertainment being responsible for at least part of the apparent increase in reported mortality. The increase in reported mortality in the younger age groups may reflect a true increase in the incidence of this disease. This increase, however, would account for only a proportion of the total increase, even when extrapolated to the older age groups.","['Velez, R', 'Beral, V', 'Cuzick, J']","['Velez R', 'Beral V', 'Cuzick J']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'England', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*mortality', 'Sex Factors', 'Social Class', 'Texas', 'Time Factors', 'Wales']",1982/08/01 00:00,1982/08/01 00:01,['1982/08/01 00:00'],"['1982/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1982 Aug;69(2):387-92.,,,,,

The mutants were produced by inserting a synthetic oligonucleotide linker containing the recognition sequence of SalI endonuclease into several different locations of the SFFV DNA. Three classes of mutants were isolated: insertion-deletion mutants in the 5' half of the SFFV genome, in the long terminal repeat of the SFFV genome, and in the env gene of the SFFV genome. The env gene mutant has a deletion of sequences shared in common between the env gene of SFFV and the env genes of mink cell focus-inducing murine leukemia viruses. From analyses of the biological activity of the various mutants and a biologically active subgenomic SFFV DNA fragment described herein, we can deduce that the coding sequence encompassing the env gene of SFFV is required for the biological activity.

Upon exposure to increased salt concentration, most of the p10 but very little of the p15 proteins were released. The S. aureus-binding proteins from ts110 Mo-MuSV and MuSV-349 revealed similar binding and elution patterns of p10 and p15 molecules.

Since the cells in older specimens were less active in division, a prolonged culture time was used. The different times for the cells from older specimens to re-enter active proliferation in culture conditions appeared to have some cytobiological significance.

Analyses were performed by high performance liquid chromatography combined with enzymatic hydrolysis of glycosphingolipids using glycosidases (Escherichia freundii endo-beta-galactosidase, jack bean beta-galactosidase, and beef kidney beta-hexosaminidase). We found that acute leukemia cells contain very little or none of the more complex neutral glycosphingolipids that are found in normal leukocytes or chronic leukemia cells. Lymphoblasts, in particular, are rich in neutral glycosphingolipids with only 1 or 2 carbohydrate units. The most significant finding of our study was that, in contrast to normal leukocytes and chronic leukemia cells which have a single predominant tetraosylceramide species, acute leukemia cells (9 out of 10 patients analyzed) were found to have significant amounts of both globo (GalNAc beta 1 leads to 3Gal alpha 1 leads to 4Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc beta 1 leads to 1ceramide) and neolactotetraosylceramide (Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc beta 1 leads to 1ceramide). These results indicate that the composition of neutral glycosphingolipids in acute leukemia cells differs significantly from that found in normal or chronic leukemia cells.","['Lee, W M', 'Westrick, M A', 'Macher, B A']","['Lee WM', 'Westrick MA', 'Macher BA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,['0 (Glycosphingolipids)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Glycosphingolipids/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood', 'Leukocytes/analysis', 'Lymphocytes/analysis']",1982/09/10 00:00,1982/09/10 00:01,['1982/09/10 00:00'],"['1982/09/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/09/10 00:01 [medline]', '1982/09/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)33988-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1982 Sep 10;257(17):10090-5.,,['CA 29662-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,

The alpha- was separated from the beta-chain by chromatography with hydroxylapatite in Na-dodecyl sulfate. Here we describe the amino acid sequence of the alpha-chain up to Position 179. The molecule is divided into two domains which do not appear homologous to each other but show a significant homology to the beta-chain (21.2%). The similarity is larger in the second (27%) than in the first (15.5%) domain, indicating a different evolutionary relationship for both parts. In contrast to the beta-chain both domains contain an N-glycosidically linked carbohydrate. The methionines are positioned only in the N-terminal, the cysteines exclusively in the C-terminal domain. Only the latter can therefore be stabilized by a disulfide bridge. As with the beta-chain the regions around the cysteines show a remarkable similarity with the constant C-terminal domains of k-, lambda-, alpha-, gamma-, sigma-, epsilon- and mu-chains of immunoglobulins. Although to a considerably lesser extent, the alpha-chain preparation also shows a heterogeneity at the protein level. Since the employed cell-line is homozygous with regard to HLA-D/DR, our results indicate that at least two alpha-chain genes exist in the HLA-D/DR-region. Together with the already published sequence of the beta-chain, the extracellular part of an histocompatibility antigen of the HLA-D type is now known.","['Yang, C', 'Kratzin, H', 'Gotz, H', 'Thinnes, F P', 'Kruse, T', 'Egert, G', 'Pauly, E', 'Kolbel, S', 'Wernet, P', 'Hilschmann, N']","['Yang C', 'Kratzin H', 'Gotz H', 'Thinnes FP', 'Kruse T', 'Egert G', 'Pauly E', 'Kolbel S', 'Wernet P', 'Hilschmann N']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Hoppe Seylers Z Physiol Chem,Hoppe-Seyler's Zeitschrift fur physiologische Chemie,2985060R,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Humans', '*Isoantigens', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Lymphocytes', 'Macromolecular Substances']",1982/06/01 00:00,1982/06/01 00:01,['1982/06/01 00:00'],"['1982/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hoppe Seylers Z Physiol Chem. 1982 Jun;363(6):671-6.,,,Primarstruktur menschlicher Histokompatibilitatsantigene der Klasse II. 2.

To define the effective dose for the treatment of patients with leukemia, we treated 43 patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using ACM administered at three dose levels. All patients had previously received extensive treatment with other chemotherapy; their median cumulative dose of prior anthracycline was 340 mg/m2. An ACM dose of 100 mg/m2/day given for 2 days (total dose, 200 mg/m2) failed to produce significant bone marrow hypocellularity or remission in two patients. Total ACM doses of 300--360 mg/m2 (100 or 120 mg/m2/day x 3 days) produced marrow hypoplasia in 16 to 23 evaluable patients with ANLL. Overall, four of 32 patients with ANLL who received 300--360 mg/m2 of ACM achieved complete remission for duration of 1, 5+, 6 and 15+ months. Two of nine patients with ALL achieved partial remission. Toxic effects of this therapy included severe leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, nausea, mucositis, and diarrhea. ECG abnormalities were noted in 43% of patients who were carefully monitored; however, only one patient developed a significant decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by radionuclide cardiography. ACM produced only minimal alopecia and did not cause tissue necrosis following inadvertent subcutaneous infiltration. We conclude that 300--360 mg/m2 of ACM is an effective dose for the treatment of patients with ANLL and that further evaluation of this compound is indicated in patients who have received minimal prior therapy.","['Warrell, R P Jr', 'Arlin, Z A', 'Kempin, S J', 'Young, C W']","['Warrell RP Jr', 'Arlin ZA', 'Kempin SJ', 'Young CW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Naphthacenes/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced']",1982/08/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1982/08/01 00:00'],"['1982/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1982/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1982 Aug;66(8):1619-23.,,"['CA-05826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-57043/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,

This compound was selected from among related pyridopyrimidines and other lipid-soluble diaminoheterocyclic compounds as having the most favorable combination of properties as a potent inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase with minimal effects on histamine metabolism. In contrast to methotrexate, entry of BW 301U into cells is rapid and is not temperature dependent, indicating passage across cell membranes by diffusion. There is no competition between BW 301U and leucovorin (folinic acid) for uptake into Sarcoma 180 cells in culture. When BW 301U is added to culture medium, deoxyuridine incorporation ceases within the first few min, and this inhibition persists when cells are transferred to drug-free medium. Both leucovorin and thymidine are required to protect cells in culture from the cytotoxicity of BW 301U. The effect on thymidine biosynthesis appears to be indirect since BW 301U is inactive as an inhibitor of thymidylate synthetase. Hypoxanthine and thymidine restore growth by only 50% in cultures containing BW 301U, and complete restoration of growth requires the further addition of adenosine and either uridine or cytidine to the medium.

The rates of uptake of these derivatives and their incorporation into cellular lipids wer compared with that of radioactively labelled palmitic acid. Three groups of fluorescent derivatives were observed: A, those transported into the cells and subsequently incorporated into neutral lipids and phospholipids, B, fatty acids which were taken up by the cells but not utilized metabolically, and C, fatty acids which were not transported across the cell membrane. Fatty acids of the latter group, except the hydrophobic probe, also contained functional groups such as hydroxy, acetylamino or sulfonylamino. When observed in fluorescence microscopy, cells incubated with group A fatty acids contained intracellular fluorescent granules, whereas those incubated with group B fatty acids showed diffuse fluorescence.

The incidence of ALL the AML in Ibadan children was the same, estimated as 0.8 X 10(-5). Thus childhood ALL was about one-third as common in Ibadan as in most developed Caucasian countries. ALL and AML occurred most frequently in the age groups 10-14 and 5-9 years respectively. Six cases of AML were associated with chloromas. Only 2 of the ALL patients survived more than one year after standard chemotherapy. The poor result appeared to be attributable to frequent occurrence among the ALL patients of adverse prognostic factors such as hyperleucocytosis, age less than 2 or greater than 7 years, L2 morphology and low PAS reactivity of the lymphoblasts.

These results, together with our previous observation that ceramide composition of mouse lymphoma and myelocytic leukemia MI cells affects their antigenicity, suggest that ceramide structure may define the organization of glycosyltransferase for synthesis of the carbohydrate determinants and may affect the organization and orientation of the carbohydrate chain in membranes, eliciting or suppressing the reactivity to its ligand. Because these glycolipids with Lex and NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6Gal structures are developmentally regulated and are highly expressed in certain tumors, ceramide composition may affect development, differentiation, and oncogenesis.","['Kannagi, R', 'Nudelman, E', 'Hakomori, S']","['Kannagi R', 'Nudelman E', 'Hakomori S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Glycolipids)']",IM,"['Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Ceramides/*physiology', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/*metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Glycolipids/*blood', 'Humans', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1982/06/01 00:00,1982/06/01 00:01,['1982/06/01 00:00'],"['1982/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.79.11.3470 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1982 Jun;79(11):3470-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.79.11.3470.,PMC346442,"['CA-19224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-20026/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,

We have found that treatment with ethanolamine, followed by dehydration with ethanol yielded poly(A) sepharose which was stable for many months and possessed a low degree of nonspecific binding. Chromatography on poly(A) sepharose permitted the specific isolation of that fraction of Friend erythroleukemic cell heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) which contained oligo(U) sequences. Approximately 10% of the hnRNA which contained a poly(A) sequence [poly(A+)] also contained an oligo(U) sequence. Interestingly, prior HCHO denaturation of the hnRNA enhanced binding of the poly(A+) oligo(U+) hnRNA to poly(A) sepharose by tenfold. This suggested that the oligo(U) sequence may be in a region with secondary structure, possibly an intramolecular duplex with the 3' poly(A). Friend cell oligo(U) sequences ranged from 20 to 50 nucleotides in length and, thus, were similar to the oligo(U) sequences which heretofore had only been shown to be present in HeLa cell hnRNA. These results established that rodent cell hnRNA contain oligo(U) sequences and demonstrate, for the first time, that hnRNA containing both a poly(A) and an oligo(U) sequence can be separated from other classes of hnRNA. In addition, conditions are presented for the removal of HCHO from nucleic acid.","['Molloy, G R', 'Johnson, S']","['Molloy GR', 'Johnson S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Prep Biochem,Preparative biochemistry,1276634,"['0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oligoribonucleotides)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Heterogeneous Nuclear)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Uracil Nucleotides)', '0 (oligo(U))', '0 (poly A-agarose)', '9012-36-6 (Sepharose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromatography, Agarose', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*analysis', 'Oligonucleotides/*isolation & purification', 'Oligoribonucleotides/*isolation & purification', '*Polysaccharides', 'RNA, Heterogeneous Nuclear/*isolation & purification', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*isolation & purification', '*Sepharose/analogs & derivatives', 'Uracil Nucleotides/*isolation & purification']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/00327488208065551 [doi]'],ppublish,Prep Biochem. 1982;12(1):77-102. doi: 10.1080/00327488208065551.,,['CA 19535/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,

We show here that a major reason for the failure to observe end-stage cells in vitro is that such cells are physically unstable under the standard culture conditions used for MEL cell differentiation. Modification of these culture conditions by the addition of either bovine serum albumin or Ficoll leads to physical stabilization of end-stage cells. Under such culture conditions, uniform cultures of terminally differentiated MEL cells with morphological characteristics similar to those of normal mouse orthochromatophilic erythroblasts and reticulocytes are observed. Examination of physical and biochemical parameters of these cell populations give values which are similar to values characteristic of mouse reticulocytes. A physically stabilized MEL cell shows a narrow cell volume distribution with an average value of approximately 100 mum(3), similar to the cell volume distribution observed for mouse reticulocytes, while a typical MEL cell culture treated with DMSO but without a stabilizing agent exhibits a broader, more heterogeneous cell volume distribution with an average value of approximately 500 mum(3). Globin mRNA levels and levels of globin synthesis reach values almost equal to those in mouse reticulocytes in cultures of physically stabilized MEL cells while differentiating cultures not treated with a stabilizing agent reach substantially lower values for these parameters. We suggest that the ability to produce populations of MEL cells which undergo complete terminal erythroid differentiation in vitro will allow the analysis of the molecular mechanisms which control the terminal stages of the erythroid differentiation process.","['Volloch, V', 'Housman, D']","['Volloch V', 'Housman D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '25702-74-3 (Ficoll)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Ficoll/pharmacology', 'Globins/biosynthesis', '*Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reticulocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/pharmacology']",1982/05/01 00:00,1982/05/01 00:01,['1982/05/01 00:00'],"['1982/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.93.2.390 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1982 May;93(2):390-4. doi: 10.1083/jcb.93.2.390.,PMC2112864,"['CA 14051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17575/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,

The potential usefulness of this enzyme in predicting the onset of relapse before any morphological indications has been demonstrated in chronic myelogenous leukemia patients in blast phase of the disease. In order to be able to detect low levels of TdT activity, especially during remission phase, we have used the technique of free flow electrophoresis to enrich cell populations containing TdT. With this technique we have achieved up to 20-fold enrichment of TdT-positive cell populations from normal human bone marrow, cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast phase of the disease. TdT positive cells were not detected in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and B cell lines. This technique should prove to be useful in early detection of relapse in patients in remission and for enrichment of cell populations containing other biochemical markers.","['Sarin, P S', 'Virmani, M', 'Gallo, R C']","['Sarin PS', 'Virmani M', 'Gallo RC']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*analysis', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*analysis', 'Electrophoresis/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology']",1982/05/15 00:00,1982/05/15 00:01,['1982/05/15 00:00'],"['1982/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1982/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910290503 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1982 May 15;29(5):501-6. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910290503.,,,,,

Four different groups of severely granulocytopenic patients were studied. All 77 patients received amphotericin B orally as a suspension or as tablets. Four amphotericin B lozenges were also administered daily for topical antimycotic decontamination of the oropharynx. This was done in the presence of colonization-resistance decreasing factors such as a nasogastric tube (Group I, 19 patients) or mucosal damage (Group III, 25 patients) and in patients with four or more consecutive throat swab cultures with yeasts (Group IV, 11 patients). The 22 patients in Group II did not receive lozenges. The addition of lozenges resulted in a decrease in the mean ""growth density"" of Candida cells in the oropharynx. This reduction was significant in Group III (p less than 0.01) and Group IV (p less than 0.02) and became evident during the first week of treatment. In patients with a nasogastric tube, however, 51.8% of the throat swab cultures revealed yeasts. Increasing the dose of the lozenges might improve the results in these patients.

The karyotype of the ALL cells of our case was similar to those of published near-haploid ALL cases, possibly indicative of a common pathway of cytogenetic evolution.","['Sandberg, A A', 'Wake, N', 'Kohno, S']","['Sandberg AA', 'Wake N', 'Kohno S']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Ploidies']",1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(82)90095-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(82)90095-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1982 Apr;5(4):293-307. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(82)90095-4.,,['CA-14555/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,

The distribution of histologic subtypes and the stage at diagnosis were similar to that of all patients with Hodgkin's disease. Seventy-five percent of the 216 patients in whom acute myeloid leukemia developed had received both radiotherapy and chemotherapy, 15% chemotherapy only, and 10% radiotherapy only. Of those receiving radiotherapy, 66% were given multiple courses or total nodal irradiation. Of the patients receiving chemotherapy, 77% had received more than eight months of single or combination drug therapy; only 4% had not been exposed to alkylating agents. When acute leukemia developed, 78% of the patients showed no clinical or pathologic evidence of residual Hodgkin's disease. A period of pancytopenia preceded the onset of overt leukemia in at least one-third of the patients. Complete or partial remission of the acute leukemia was achieved in 25% of the patients treated with antileukemic chemotherapy. On the basis of these findings, it is deemed advisable to reexamine the intensity of treatment presently being administered to achieve cure of Hodgkin's disease. Unnecessary or unproved programs of combined radiation therapy and chemotherapy should be avoided. An optimal balance between the risks and benefits of treatment needs to be applied.","['Grunwald, H W', 'Rosner, F']","['Grunwald HW', 'Rosner F']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*complications/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Pancytopenia/etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Risk']",1982/08/15 00:00,1982/08/15 00:01,['1982/08/15 00:00'],"['1982/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1982/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19820815)50:4<676::aid-cncr2820500410>3.0.co;2-b [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1982 Aug 15;50(4):676-83. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19820815)50:4<676::aid-cncr2820500410>3.0.co;2-b.,,,,,

Of the 102 evaluable patients, 82 had AML, 17 ALL, and 3 CML in blastic phase. A number of different dose schedules of AMSA were explored, and we conclude that the optimum dose of AMSA for remission induction in acute leukemia is 120 mg/sq m/day for 5 days. Complete remissions were observed in 23 (28%) patients with AML and in 1 patient with ALL. Patients who achieved complete remission were maintained on AMSA using a dose of 30-40 mg/sq m/day for 5 days repeated at 4-wk intervals. The median duration of complete remission was 12 wk (3-59 wk), and the responders survived significantly longer than the failures (27 wk versus 8 wk, p = 0.002). The side effects associated with AMSA therapy included mild nausea and vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhea, phlebitis, alopecia, and myelosuppression-related infections. Our results indicate that AMSA is a useful new antileukemic agent for the treatment of relapsed acute leukemia and appears to have activity comparable to that of the currently available drugs, such as cytarabine and the anthracycline antibiotics.","['Legha, S S', 'Keating, M J', 'McCredie, K B', 'Bodey, G P', 'Freireich, E J']","['Legha SS', 'Keating MJ', 'McCredie KB', 'Bodey GP', 'Freireich EJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Aminoacridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aminoacridines/*therapeutic use', 'Amsacrine', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",1982/08/01 00:00,1982/08/01 00:01,['1982/08/01 00:00'],"['1982/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76624-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1982 Aug;60(2):484-90.,,['N01-CM-57042/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,

Clonal chromosome abnormalities were found in 21 of 26 patients. Four patients, including 3 with Down's syndrome, had AML(M1). Nine patients, including 3 with t(8;21), had AML(M2). All 3 patients with APL(M3) had t(15;17). Four patients had AMMOL(M4); 3 of these had a normal karyotype. Six patients had AMOL(M5); 5 and 11q rearrangements, and 3 of these had a break in 11q23. Only one patient had EL(M6), and he had a normal karyotype. One patient with t(11;19), classified as AML(M2) on Wright-Giemsa-stained cells, had a strong alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase reaction, indicating that the leukemic cells had a cytochemical feature characteristic of monocytes. Whereas t(8;21) and t(15;17) are uniquely associated with AML(M2) and APL(M3), respectively, the 11q rearrangements are also seen in AML(M1/M2), although they are more common in AMOL(M5) and AMMOL(M4). The case with t(11;19) suggests that cells with 11q rearrangements and with AML(M1/M2) may have both monocytic and granulocytic features. When we used our data and previous reports on 243 aneuploid patients (169 adults and 74 children) to correlate the chromosome abnormalities with patient age, we found differences in the chromosome pattern seen among various age groups. This suggests that different etiologic factors as well as changes in host susceptibility may influence the development of and the karyotypic pattern in the various types of leukemia. Moreover, the frequency of various chromosome abnormalities in childhood ANLL can provide a baseline for comparison of the frequency of the same abnormality in adults. The karyotypic analysis of childhood ANLL is important not only because of the information that can be obtained about childhood ANLL, but also because the data can provide substantial insight into the etiology of ANLL in adults.","['Kaneko, Y', 'Rowley, J D', 'Maurer, H S', 'Variakojis, D', 'Moohr, J W']","['Kaneko Y', 'Rowley JD', 'Maurer HS', 'Variakojis D', 'Moohr JW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Naphthols)', '830-81-9 (alpha-naphthyl acetate)', '9UZL9U0CIK (alpha-naphthyl butyrate)', 'EC 3.1.- (Esterases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Esterases/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Monocytes/enzymology', 'Naphthols/metabolism']",1982/08/01 00:00,1982/08/01 00:01,['1982/08/01 00:00'],"['1982/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76612-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1982 Aug;60(2):389-99.,,['CA-19266/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,

Band 3 was the major lysosomal acid phosphatase of all nonprostatic tissues. Bands 2 and 4 were antigenically identical to each other, and were observed in unusually high amounts in the prostate. The different electrophoretic mobility between bands 2 and 4 was due to their carbohydrate content. Band 5 was a characteristic enzyme of the osteoclast.

Band 2 was absorbed into the blood circulation in some prostatic cancer patients. A small amount of bands 2 and 4 was observed in nonprostatic tissues.

The sequence of events by which they bring about this transition is poorly understood. However, it is known that phorbol esters bind to the surface membrane of HL-60 cells and to various other cells as well. Our studies were directed toward determining the biologic importance of this membrane association. [3H]Phorbol dibutyrate (PBu2) was specifically bound by HL-60 cells with a Kd of 23 nM and with 1.9 X 10(5) binding sites for [3H]PBu2 per cell. There was no internalization of bound [3H]PBu2. Specific binding was fully reversible upon washing in fresh medium, and [3H]PBu2 added thereafter bound normally to its receptor. Within 10 min of binding, PBu2 stimulated [14C]choline incorporation into phosphatidylcholine, with a rapid return to normal upon removal of the PBu2. Membrane-bound PBu2 progressively inhibited DNA synthesis, with 70% inhibition by 8 hr. This process was interrupted if the PBu2 was removed, and little recovery of DNA synthesis occurred in previously inhibited cells. Between 8 and 16 hr, PBu2 induced adherence of cells to plastic, but only in those cells in which phosphatidylcholine synthesis was stimulated, and this process was also interrupted if PBu2 was removed prior to 16 hr. Similarly, nonspecific esterase, which develops after 72 hr of incubation, was induced in cells exposed to PBu2 for the initial 16 hr but not in cells exposed for 5 hr. These studies demonstrate that phorbol esters exert their effects while retained at the cell surface. Inhibition of cell growth and the acquisition of surface and enzymatic properties that characterize macrophages are separable events, each of which proceeds through a receptor-mediated, transmembrane process. The stimulation of phosphatidylcholine synthesis appears to be a part of that process.","['Cooper, R A', 'Braunwald, A D', 'Kuo, A L']","['Cooper RA', 'Braunwald AD', 'Kuo AL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Naphthols)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '830-81-9 (alpha-naphthyl acetate)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.1 (Carboxylesterase)']",IM,"['Carboxylesterase', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Naphthols/metabolism', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylcholines/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Drug/drug effects']",1982/05/01 00:00,1982/05/01 00:01,['1982/05/01 00:00'],"['1982/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.79.9.2865 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1982 May;79(9):2865-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.79.9.2865.,PMC346307,['AM-15441/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,

We investigated possible correlations between white blood cell (WBC) count, organomegaly and mediastinal enlargement at diagnosis, as well as age and sex, with the length of first remission and survival. Children presenting with a combination of all of the following four risk factors--WBC count greater than or equal to 50,000/mm3, enlarged mediastinum, spleen and liver greater than or equal to 3 cm below the costal margin--comprised a poor-prognosis group, in which boys predominated. Age in this small group of patients had no correlation with prognosis. On the other hand, no specific risk factor was predictive for survival in the 48 children who had less than four of the risk factors. In this better-prognosis group, children less than 2 yr and greater than 10 yr had a higher relapse rate than those of intermediate ages, and girls had a significantly better prognosis than boys. These results indicate that age and sex are intercorrelated with the above risk factors, so that analysis of the effect of a single risk factor or even a combination of two factors can be misleading. In the light of these findings, an interpretation of the discrepancies in the literature is suggested. Of interest, too, is the poor prognosis and the high frequency of T-cell leukemia among Arab children. Finally, we stress the importance of day-care facilities that enable shorter hospitalization periods and improve the quality of life.","['Ramot, B', 'Modan, M', 'Meerowitz, Y', 'Potashnick, D', 'Kende, G', 'Berkowicz, M']","['Ramot B', 'Modan M', 'Meerowitz Y', 'Potashnick D', 'Kende G', 'Berkowicz M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Israel,Isr J Med Sci,Israel journal of medical sciences,0013105,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/mortality/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Sex Factors', 'Time Factors']",1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Isr J Med Sci. 1982 Apr;18(4):447-55.,,,,,

Clonal chromosome abnormalities were found in 39 of the 50 patients (78%) at diagnosis. Eleven patients had diploidy (N patients). Among the 39 aneuploid patients, 17 had pseudodiploidy (A1 patients), eight had hyperdiploidy with 47 to 49 chromosomes (A2 patients), nine had hyperdiploidy with 50 to 59 chromosomes (A3 patients), and five had other chromosome abnormalities. Of 14 patients whose chromosomes were also studied at relapse, eight had karyotypic progression, five had abnormalities identical or similar to those observed at diagnosis, and one had a change of karyotype from diploidy to aneuploidy. The median age and the median WBC of A1 patients were higher than those of any other group of patients, although one-third of the patients had WBC below 20 x 10(3)/microliters, and they often had leukemic cells of T-cell or B-cell lineage. The A2 patients were relatively old and tended to have higher WBC. The N patients were relatively young and tended to have low WBC, although these tendencies were not as marked as those in A3 patients. The A3 patients had longer survival times than the A1 (p = 0.003) or A2 (p = 0.002) patients. Also, N patients had longer survival times than A1 (p = 0.03) or A2 (p = 0.05) patients.

Accordingly, we determined the sister chromatid exchanges frequency in 26 blood specimens from 24 acute leukemia long-term survivors (patients) and 14 blood specimens from 13 control subjects (controls). The patients consisted of 23 children with acute lymphocytic and one child with acute myelocytic leukemia. The median length of chemotherapy was 5 years. Eighteen of the 24 patients also received prophylactic fractional central nervous system irradiation for the first 3 years of treatment, and one patient received therapeutic irradiation to the central nervous system. The median off-therapy period at the time of study was 2.5 years with a range of 0 to 7.5 years. The controls consisted of the parents of the patients and laboratory personnel. A mean exchange score per cell was established for each specimen (25 to 30 cells/specimen were scored), and it ranged from 3.0 to 9.7 in the patients and from 3.0 to 11.5 in the controls.

The percentage of cells reducing nitro blue tetrazolium, an indication of a stimulus-induced respiratory burst typical of mature phagocytes, was used as a functional measure of the extent of differentiation. Marcellomycin was a potent inducer of maturation, with 95% of the cells expressing a terminally differentiated state after 10 days of exposure to a concentration of 40 nM anthracycline. Cells exposed to marcellomycin exhibited a 35-fold increase in their total superoxide anion-generating capacity, an 80% increase in acid phosphatase activity, and a loss of myeloperoxidase and chloroacetate esterase activities. In addition, marcellomycin-treated cells stained negatively for alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase. These findings provided evidence for the granulocytic nature of the mature cells. In contrast, marcellomycin was not an effective inducer of differentiation of Friend murine erythroleukemia cells. Studies on the relationship between structure and the ability to induce differentiation of HL-60 leukemia cells demonstrated that removal from the marcellomycin molecule of the terminal 2-deoxyfucose (musettamycin) or its substitution by cinerulose (aclacinomycin A) did not alter differentiation-inducing capacity. However, removal of the carbomethoxy group from the C-10 position of marcellomycin substantially reduced its potency as an initiator of maturation, and removal of the two terminal 2-deoxyfucose moieties (pyrromycin) decreased both potency and the maximal percentage of differentiated cells produced in the population. The monosaccharide anthracyclines Adriamycin and carminomycin were completely inactive as inducers of HL-60 leukemia cell maturation. The results suggest that certain anthracyclines would be reasonable candidate drugs to use in a clinical trial aimed at reducing the leukemic stem cell burden through maturation rather than through cytodestruction.","['Schwartz, E L', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Schwartz EL', 'Sartorelli AC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '3296X8L13E (marcellomycin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['*Anthracyclines', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Naphthacenes/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1982/07/01 00:00,1982/07/01 00:01,['1982/07/01 00:00'],"['1982/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Jul;42(7):2651-5.,,['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,

Patients dying from another disease were excluded from this study. Frequency of cells with CAA was measured and appeared strongly higher after blastic transformation than during myelocytic state; probability to be a blastic transformation is closely correlated with this frequency. On the other hand, actuarial curve of survivorship is very well represented by an exponential curve. This suggests a constant rate of death during disease evolution, for these patients without intercurrent disease. As a mean survivance after blastic transformation is very shorter than myelocytic duration, a constant rate of blastic transformation could be advanced: it explains possible occurrence of transformation as soon as preclinic state of a chronic myelogenous leukemia. Even if CAA frequency increases after blastic transformation, CAA can occur a long time before it and do not explain it: submicroscopic origin should be searched for the constant rate of blastic transformation would express the risk of a genic transformation at a constant rate during myelocytic state.","['Coutris, G']",['Coutris G'],['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Biomedicine,Biomedicine / [publiee pour l'A.A.I.C.I.G.],0361342,,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations/*complications', 'Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*genetics/mortality', 'Probability']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biomedicine. 1981 Dec;34(4):198-202.,,,Anomalies chromosomiques surajoutees au Phi et courbe actuarielle de survie dans la leucemie myeloide chronique.

Five MDS are described: (1) refractory anaemia (RA), (2) RA with ring sideroblasts, (3) RA with excess of blasts (RAEB), (4) chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), and (5) RAEB 'in transformation'. One of the main distinguishing features of these conditions is the proportion of blast cells in the peripheral blood (PB) and/or bone marrow (BM). The morphological features of the blast cells that are of diagnostic importance have been redefined. In RA, with or without ringed sideroblasts, there are fewer than 1% of blasts in the PB and fewer than 5% in the BM; RAEB is defined as having between 5% and 20% of blasts in the BM and fewer than 5% in the PB; RAEB in transformation (a newly defined category) will be considered when any of the following features is present: (i) more than 5% of blasts in the PB, (ii) 20-30% in the BM, and (iii) the presence of Auer rods in granulocyte precursors in BM or PB. In accordance with these newly defined criteria, it is now proposed that over 30% of bone marrow blasts will suffice for the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in any of its forms (M1-M6). The proposed descriptions of the MDS should facilitate the interpretation of data emerging from cytogenetic and bone marrow culture studies and the search for features of possible prognostic significance.

Eight months into remission 50% of her marrow cells comprised an abnormal clone, which was monosomic for the number 7 chromosome but had both copies of number 8; in addition a variable number of unique marker chromosomes were present in clonal as well as nonclonal cells. This same marrow sample, upon culture, showed an abnormal growth pattern of CFU-GM, absence of detectable CFU-GEMM and BFUe, non-responsiveness of CFU-GM to inhibition by acidic isoferritins, increased bone marrow acidic isoferritin inhibitory activity, and absence of detectable bone marrow cell-derived GM-CSF.

Induction also results in the cells acquiring sensitivity to the inhibitor from uninduced FL cells. A reduction in total protein synthesis is observed when uninduced and induced FL cell lysates are mixed. Inhibition does not result from competition by an excess of uninduced FL cell mRNA species for the translational machinery because uninduced FL cell lysates retain their inhibitory activity after treatment with micrococcal nuclease. Rabbit globin mRNA recovered from rabbit reticulocyte lysates that have been incubated with lysates of uninduced FL cells can still be translated effectively, indicating that inhibition does not result from modification of other species of mRNA by uninduced FL cell lysates. A switch to hemin-dependent translational control does not follow induction of differentiation. The rate of amino acid incorporation in induced FL cell lysates--like that in uninduced FL cell lysates--is unaffected by omission of exogenous hemin from the system. Its presence is not required to prevent activation of heme-regulated inhibitor.

Two types of erythroblast populations can be isolated from bursts of infected cells by manipulation of the culture conditions. One type of erythroblast, which is obtained when erythropoietin (EP) is added to the culture, has proliferated and undergoes differentiation to become an erythrocyte. The second type of erythroblast, which is obtained when no EP is added to the culture, is the product of extensive proliferation, but it fails to undergo the terminal stages of erythroblast differentiation. Comparisons of these two types of erythroblasts demonstrate that specific EP effects include changes in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and membrane of the treated cells. Those events of erythroid differentiation shown to be directed by EP were extrusion of the nucleus from the erythroblast, induction of uroporphyrinogen I synthetase activity, increased iron incorporation into protoporphyrin, synthesis of alpha- and beta-globin polypeptides due largely to increased mRNA production, and synthesis and incorporation of spectrin into the cell membrane. In this system, EP promotes these effects without observable stimulation of progenitor proliferation in addition to that caused by the virus alone. Thus, the role of EP in terminal erythrocyte differentiation is not simply that of an erythroid-specific mitogen.","['Koury, M J', 'Bondurant, M C', 'Duncan, D T', 'Krantz, S B', 'Hankins, W D']","['Koury MJ', 'Bondurant MC', 'Duncan DT', 'Krantz SB', 'Hankins WD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '12634-43-4 (Spectrin)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Erythroblasts/cytology/drug effects', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Globins/biosynthesis', 'Heme/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Spectrin/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.79.2.635 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1982 Jan;79(2):635-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.79.2.635.,PMC345801,"['AM15555/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26306/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32AM07186/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,

During in vitro incubation with lysosomal hydrolases, intact DNR could be released extensively only from conjugates prepared with a tri- or tetrapeptide spacer arm. These latter conjugates remained very stable in the presence of serum. When tested in vivo against the intraperitoneal form of L1210 leukemia, the conjugates in which DNR was linked to serum albumin directly or via one amino acid were completely inactive but the conjugate with a dipeptide spacer arm was not more active than free DNR. In parallel with the in vitro studies, the best therapeutic results were obtained with the conjugates formed with tri- and tetrapeptidic spacer arms; they were much more active than DNR, inducing a high percentage of long-term survivors. Thus, use of a tri- or tetrapeptide spacer arm is essential to obtain DNR-protein conjugates that remain stable in serum and from which DNR can be released through the action of lysosomal hydrolases. The in vivo results suggest, moreover, that these conjugates are endocytosed by L1210 cells and that DNR is released intracellularly after digestion by lysosomal enzymes. This conjugation method can be applied to other drugs possessing a free amino group and to various potential carriers, such as antibodies, polypeptide hormones, and glycoproteins, that have amino or carboxyl side chains.","['Trouet, A', 'Masquelier, M', 'Baurain, R', 'Deprez-De Campeneere, D']","['Trouet A', 'Masquelier M', 'Baurain R', 'Deprez-De Campeneere D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Albumins)', '0 (Pharmaceutical Vehicles)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Albumins', 'Animals', 'Daunorubicin/*administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Pharmaceutical Vehicles', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.79.2.626 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1982 Jan;79(2):626-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.79.2.626.,PMC345799,,,,

Some characteristics of inducer-mediated commitment of MELC to terminal erythroid differentiation were examined by determining the effects of dexamethasone (an inhibitor of inducer-mediated MELC differentiation) and of hemin (an inducer of globin mRNA accumulation). Previously, it was shown that exposure of MELC to hexamethylene-bisacetamide (HMBA) leads to commitment, detectable within 12 hr. MELC cultured with both HMBA and dexamethasone do not express commitment. MELC transferred from culture with HMBA and dexamethasone to cloning medium without these agents express commitment to terminal erythroid differentiation, indicating that MELC retain a ""memory"" for some early HMBA-mediated changes leading to commitment which occur even in the presence of the inhibitory steroid. The kinetics of commitment in experiments in which exposure to HMBA is interrupted, or dexamethasone is added to the culture in HMBA, suggest that there is a rate-limiting step early in the commitment process. The memory for this step persists for more than one cell cycle. Addition of hemin to cultures with HMBA and dexamethasone initiated accumulation of globin mRNA but does not reverse the steroid-mediated inhibition of terminal cell division (that is, the cells retain their proliferative capacity). Inducer-mediated MELC commitment is associated with accumulation of the chromatin protein IP25; dexamethasone does not inhibit this accumulation. Accumulation of IP25 may be inducer-related, but it is not sufficient to cause expression of terminal erythroid differentiation.","['Chen, Z', 'Banks, J', 'Rifkind, R A', 'Marks, P A']","['Chen Z', 'Banks J', 'Rifkind RA', 'Marks PA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Diamines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Diamines/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Globins/genetics', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.79.2.471 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1982 Jan;79(2):471-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.79.2.471.,PMC345765,"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-13696/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-18314/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,

Several immunostimulants from microorganisms were tested for ability to induce differentiation of Ml cells and to stimulate production of D-factor by spleen cells. Mycobacterium bovis BCG (500 micrograms/ml) and the cell wall skeleton of Nocardia rubra (50 micrograms/ml) induced differentiation of Ml cells; but Corynebacterium parvum CN6134 and the cell wall skeleton of Propionibacterium acnes C7 had no effect on Ml cells.

Synthetic derivatives of N-acetylmuramyl dipeptide(MDP), the minimal adjuvant-active subunit of the bacterial cell wall, had no direct effect on the differentiation of Ml cells and only slightly stimulated the production of D-factor by spleen cells.

The cellular uptake of these two drugs was temperature dependent and was not hindered by sodium azide treatment; incorporation into isolated nuclei was not temperature dependent, nor hindered by sodium azide. Friend leukemia cell variants resistant to adriamycin (ADM-RFLC) and to daunorubicin (DNR-RFLC) were developed. The rate of uptake of ADM and DNR across the plasma membrane of these two cell variants was lower than in sensitive cells. Although these cells were crossresistant to both ADM and DNR, the drug-induced fluorescence intensity was distributed differently in the corresponding resistant cell variants.

When incubated with glucocorticoid-resistant mutants derived from the glucocorticoid-sensitive human leukemic cell line CEM-C7, DAC caused significant growth inhibition. However, this effect required 1 microM DAC, a concentration 50 times higher than that necessary for glucocorticoid receptor saturation. Cytotoxicity was observed in both mutants containing high-affinity glucocorticoid receptors defective in nuclear translocation and a mutant completely devoid of receptors. Further, in dexamethasone-resistant clones, DAC elicited only marginal increases in the activity of the glucocorticoid-inducible enzyme glutamine synthetase. Clones resistant to high concentrations of DAC could not be directly isolated from CEM-C7. However, stable DAC-resistant clones could be isolated from dexamethasone-resistant subclones of CEM-C7 with a frequency of 1 to 8 x 10(-4). These data are consistent with resistance to DAC being acquired in a two-step process. Our results suggest that the cytotoxicity of DAC at concentrations higher than necessary for glucocorticoid receptor saturation is not mediated by glucocorticoid receptors. Thus, DAC may be a bifunctional compound having both steroid receptor-mediated and receptor-independent cytotoxicity.","['Harmon, J M', 'Schmidt, T J', 'Thompson, E B']","['Harmon JM', 'Schmidt TJ', 'Thompson EB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Pregnatrienes)', '3JO09QT49F (deacylcortivazol)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*physiopathology', 'Mutation', 'Pregnatrienes/*pharmacology']",1982/06/01 00:00,1982/06/01 00:01,['1982/06/01 00:00'],"['1982/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Jun;42(6):2110-4.,,['1F32 CA05447-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,

Hemin stimulates their synthesis of embryonic and fetal hemoglobins. We have found that their globin synthetic pattern depends on the concentration of added hemin. Clone RA6 was cultured with 0--100 microM hemin and the globin synthetic pattern determined by 3H-leucine incorporation and analysis of 3H-globins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in Triton X acid urea followed by fluorography and densitometry. The higher the hemin concentration, the greater the synthetic rate of each type of globin. However, the relative increase was greatest for alpha-globin. We propose that the differential dependence of alpha synthesis on added hemin is a reflection of translational inefficiency of alpha messenger RNA and that this property is exposed when the translational capacity of the cell is limited by hemin deficiency. We suggest that the differential dependence of alpha-chain synthesis on added hemin in clone RA6 is evidence of an intrinsic deficiency in heme synthesis.","['Rowley, P T', 'Ohlsson-Wilhelm, B M', 'Rudolph, N S', 'Farley, B A', 'Kosciolek, B', 'LaBella, S']","['Rowley PT', 'Ohlsson-Wilhelm BM', 'Rudolph NS', 'Farley BA', 'Kosciolek B', 'LaBella S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/*biosynthesis', 'Heme/*analogs & derivatives', 'Hemin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*blood']",1982/05/01 00:00,1982/05/01 00:01,['1982/05/01 00:00'],"['1982/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74371-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1982 May;59(5):1098-102.,,['5 RO1 AM-16847/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,
