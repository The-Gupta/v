In a previous study of different kinds of severe granulocytopenia, the AP positivity of circulating neutrophils appeared to indicate a kinetic parameter. Early release of mature, non-stored bone marrow granulocytes apparently furnished more AP+ neutrophils, whereas release of stored cells furnished more AP- cells. If we consider enzyme activity to indicate a kinetic parameter, its differential diagnostic usefulness would be less than generally supposed. One hundred and forty eight determinations in 74 CGL patients showed that low AP values are valid for CGL statistically, especially between the 2nd to 5th years of clinical disease, but normal or higher counts of circulating AP+ fraction of mature neutrophils could be found in one fourth of advanced cases (blastic metamorphosis excluded), and even more (17/37) in the earliest period of the CGL process.

The frequency of leukemic cell infiltration in the testis or ovary itself showed no significant increase in recent years, although median survival time became longer by a more aggressive combination chemotherapy. These findings show that the testis and ovary are essentially a preferred site of leukemic cell infiltration.

When the host was capable of a significant immune response against the malignant cells during progressive tumor growth (e.g., C3H vs. 6C3HED), protective immunization against a larger challenge tumor dose was achieved after fewer vaccinations. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhanced host response to iodoacetamide (IAd) modified P1798 and L1210 so as to confer resistance after fewer immunizations with these weakly antigenic tumors. Similarities among the three systems were also seen. Modified cells may be stored at 4 degrees C several weeks and are effective when 107-108 are given i.p.; resistance appears maximal about one week after vaccination. In immunotherapy trials, C3H mice implanted with 5 x 104 6C3HED cells and treated at least four times with IAd-6C3HED demonstrated a 25% cure rate. A model was presented for evaluating parameters of response to immunotherapy in conjunction with chemotherapy. Cell-mediated immunity in resistant mice was demonstrated by inhibition of DNA synthesis in cultures of lymphoma cells and sensitized peritoneal cells (PEC) compared to that with nonimmune PEC. This assay system may also provide an opportunity for examining the hypothesis of immunostimulation of tumor growth in vitro. Humoral response to modified cells was established by membrane immunofluorescence. Although anti-6C3HED and anti-L1210 appear specific, anti-P1798 antiserum reacts with BALB/c thymocytes and murine fetal antigen.",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1976.tb41636.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

Spleen cells from these mice in culture show a similar deficit in the response to stimulation with sheep red cells and inhibit the reactivity of normal splenocytes. In an attempt to reverse this immunosuppression, near normal responses were obtained in vitro from infected splenocytes by increasing antigen dose, by adding E. coli lipopolysaccharide, or, more effectively, by cocultivating with small numbers of unfractionated or T cell-depleted peritoneal exudate cells (PC), whereas other manipulations proved ineffective. PC did not prevent the inhibition of normal splenocytes by infected spleen cells, but exhibited substantial restorative activity in vivo. In similar experiments, the immunosuppression exerted by the entire Friend complex could be reversed by PC in vitro but not in vivo. These results indicate that a functional deficit of macrophages may be partially responsible for the immunological impairment induced by leukemia viruses and suggest rational approaches to evaluate the relevance of this impairment to oncogenesis.",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1976.tb41668.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

Neither human nor mouse globin mRNA sequences could be detected by a sensitive molecular hybridization assay which utilized globin complementary D N A. However, td n a from one of the cell lines was shown to contain both the mouse and humand globin genes. Thus, loss of the genes by chromosomal segregation did not account for their failure to be expressed. Cocultivation of the mouse erythroleukemia cells with excess human fibroblasts did not prevent erythroid differentiation of the erythroleukemia cells in the presence of dimethylsulfoxide. Similarly globin gene expression was preserved in tetraploid cells generated by fusion of two erythroleukemia lines. Thus, extinction of globin geneated by fusion of two erythroleukemia lines.

No significant differences were detectable on the polypeptide patterns from CML platelets in respect to the normal 20-25 protein constituents. Using a radio-isotopic method it has been measured as an elevated catalytic transfer of the galactosyl and N-acetylgalactosaminyl residues from nucleotide 14C sugar derivatives onto the endogenous acceptors of platelets from CML. The results obtained suggested that CML platelets with recognized abnormal functions, have modifications at the level of the macromolecular surface glycoprotein constituents and/or changes of the glycoconjugates reactive structures involved in the devopment of the periodic acid-Schiff reaction as also in the transfer reaction of the sugar residues.",,,,,,,,,,

Two years later when overt acute myelogenous leukemia had developed the study was repeated. The kinetics of proliferation were investigated by a new method which allows evaluation of the rate and time of DNA synthesis in individual morphologically defined cells. Erythropoiesis was found ineffective to the same degree in both stages of disease. The rate of erythroid cell proliferation, however, was reduced in overt leukemia only. The myeloid system showed a grossly reduced production rate of myeloblasts in preleukemia whilst the same parameter was strongly increased in leukemia. This high production rate of myeloblasts in overt leukemia was interpreted as indication of a far-reaching self-maintenance of the myeloblast pool in this stage of disease. The proliferative activity of the individual myeloblasts was reduced already in preleukemia, and even more so in leukemia. In order to explain the amplification of the myeloblast pool with the onset of overt leukemia a change in the mode of myeloblast divisions is assumed. For this a transition from steady state to some degree of exponential growth gives the most plausible explanation.",['10.1007/978-3-642-87524-3_9 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

During the course of many leukemias there is the synthesis of red cells containing fetal hemoglobin. In most cases this phenomenon is limited to a small population or clone of red cells and probably represents a nonspecific response of the bone marrow to a hematologic stress. However, in juvenile chronic myeloid leukemia and, in rare cases of erythroleukemia, there is a major reversion to fetal erythropoiesis, with progressive increase in fetal hemoglobin levels and synthesis of red cells which contain not only fetal hemoglobin but have a true fetal pattern of protein synthesis affecting proteins other than Hb F, namely Hb A2, carbonic anhydrase and the membrane antigens i and I. In this case, the fetal erythropoiesis may be a more specific manifestation of the leukemic process and may be related to the phenomenon of fetal protein synthesis (alpha-fetoprotein of carcinoembryonic antigen) observed in other types of neoplasia. Further information on the etiology and pathogenesis of abnormal cell proliferation and differentiation in the leukemias can be obtained by the study of experimental systems permitting the investigation of the regulation of gene expression in differentiating mammalian cells. Maturing erythroid cells provide a promising system for such investigations for many reasons: differentiating erythroid cells can be obtained relatively free of other cell types; a large amount of a well characterized product, hemoglobin, is synthesized; techniques are now available that permit isolation of erythroid precursors at different stages of differentiation (5-8); and finally, highly sensitive methods of measuring globin mRNA levels by DNA-RNA hybridization are currently available (13, 26, 27). We have used such techniques to measure levels of globin mRNA in separated populations of murine erythroid cells at different stages of maturation. These studies demonstrated a correlation between globin mRNA content and degree of morphological maturation. In the least well differentiated cells, however, there appeared to be a disproportionate amount of mRNA for the level of hemoglobin synthesis in these cells. These results suggest the presence of some translational control of globin mRNA in the early stages of erythroid development, although the major control of globin gene expression in this system seems to be at the transcriptional level...",['10.1007/978-3-642-87524-3_12 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

They reveived two courses of cyclic intensive chemotherapy with seven drugs (methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, cyclophosphamide, prednisone, vincristine, intrathecal methotrexate and hydrocortine, daunomycin and citosine-arabinoside) at high doses and thereafter, cyclic MTX 6MP and CP and periodic VCR and Pred. Median duration of complete remission was 28 months and 40% of the patients had initial relapse in central nervous system (median time of presentation of CNS relapse was 25 months). On Feb., 1976, 56% of the children are alive but 24% of them have had at least one relapse and now, are again in remission. Eight cases (32%) have never relapsed, from 42 to 58 months after remission was obtained (median of 46 months) and they are now off any antileukemic therapy for 11 to 22 months (median of 16 months). These long-term results are compared with those obtained with a previously reported protocol (HIM-TMI). No significant progresses were seen in the Protocol HIM-TSM, but both studies showed very good results for this country. More intensive systemic chemotherapy and CNS prophylaxis are needed. This has been taken into account in a more recent study (Protocol HIM-06) and the preliminary results are encouraging.

Erythropoietin acts selectively on proerythroblasts to stimulate first housekeeping RNA species (rRNA, tRNA), then cell proliferation and differentiation. In erythro-leukemia cells expression of the erythroid program is induced by a variety of polar compounds. DNA synthesis appears requisite to this transition to haemoglobin formation, The molecular site of action of inducing compounds is not established but it is suggested that one critical effect is on the structure of chromatin which occurs during DNA replication and results in the transcription of the erythropoietic gene program.",,,,,,,,,,

These PAS variant reactions generally do not indicate the presence of non-glycogen PAS-positive substances, known to be prevalent in various hematopoietic cells, possibly due to masking of reactive groups. The specificity of the reaction in blood cells was ascertained by alpha-amylase digestion, which removed more than 95% of the PAS-positive material. Calibration of the PAS reaction was undertaken with a microdroplet model of pure leukocyte glycogen. The glycogen amounts in the droplets were determined by microinterferometry, the droplets were stained with a variant PAS reaction, and the total extinction of the reaction product in the stained droplets was determined by microspectrophotometry. The extinction coefficient (k) was obtained from the equation k equals Etot divided by M where (Etot) is the total extinction as determined by microspectrophotometry and (M) the dry glycogen amount as determined by microinterferometry. The microinterferometric dry mass determinations were calibrated by X-ray absorption in order to obtain the absolute amounts of glycogen. For practical purposes a reference system was made of normal neutrophil leukocytes. The glycogen content in the reference neutrophils was first determined with the micromodel. These neutrophils, now with a known glycogen amount, were stained with the PAS reagents and measured microspectrophotometrically in parallel with cells containing an unknown glycogen amount. Alternatively, the staining was made with a fluorescent PAS reaction, and the glycogen content determined by microfluorometry. Both methods appeared suitable for determining the glycogen content of blood cells from patients with various diseases, though the microfluorometric method was preferable for measurements of small amounts of inhomogeneously distributed glycogen. The mean glycogen content of normal neutrophil leukocytes was found to be 13.6 times 10(-12) g. The content was increased in infectious diseases such as pneumonia and tonisillitis, as well as in polycythemia vera and myelofibrosis, while low amounts were found in untreated chronic myelocytic leukemia. In chronic myelocytic leukemia in remission, the glycogen content of mature neutrophils had completely normalized. Erythroblasts normally do not contain detectable amounts of glycogen. However, in certain diseases such as beta-thalassemia and Di Guglielomo's syndrome, appreciable amounts of glycogen accumulate in the erythropoietic precursor cells. In beta-thalassemia this was associated with an arrest in the proliferation of early polychromatic erythroblasts, which accumulate glycogen in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In all these diseases quantitative glycogen determinations in the blood cells have diagnostic importance.",['10.1016/s0079-6336(76)80013-7 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have investigated the role of nucleus-membrane interaction in the capping of membrane components. Mouse L cells and leukemia EL4 cells were enucleated with the aid of cytochalasin B, yielding cytoplasts and karyoplasts. Capping of surface receptors was induced by allo- and hetero-immune sera followed by fluorescein-conjugated antiglobulin serum, or by the plant lectin concanavalin A. Capping could easily be induced in intact cells, but virtually no capping was detected in the nucleus-free cytoplasts. Interestingly, karyoplasts, which posses cell-membrane components but very little cytoplasm, could be easily induced to cap their surface antigens. Hence, cap formation of membrane components seems not to be an autonomous membrane process. The data suggest that interaction of surface membranes and inner cell components associated with the nucleus is involved in the movement of surface membrane receptors.",['10.1073/pnas.73.12.4580 [doi]'],PMC431551,,,,,,,,

The detection of a spectrum of qualitative defects in the proliferation, differentiation and biophysical characteristics of leukemic colony forming cells (CFU-c) has permitted a detailed analysis of the relapse-remission status based on transition from qualitatively abnormal cell growth in vitro to a normal pattern of proliferation and differentiation. Changes in vitro generally preceded clinical or morphological evidence of the onset of relapse or remission and serve as a valuable additional parameter in monitoring clinical status. Marked cyclic changes in CFU-c incidence appeared to characterize the remission phase of AML and were frequently associated with fluctuations in marrow blast cell count which can lead to mis-diagnosis of incipient relapse. Detection of qualitative defect in marrow culture serves to distinguish patients with preleukemic disorders at high risk of termination in acute myeloid leukemia from patients with clinically similar disease who have not undergone further progression over a 2-4 year period of observation.",['10.1007/978-3-642-66312-3_7 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

Transient abnormalities were noted in liver function tests in 4 of 13 patients who received greater than 6.0 mg/kg. Other laboratory changes were confined to an increase in the absolute granulocyte count that paralleled fever development and abnormalities in coagulation parameters of 1 patient. In vitro lymphocyte DNA synthesis in response to mitogens was transiently impaired at times corresponding to serum IF appearance. These studies have established dose levels of poly I-poly C that can be safely administered to man with minimal toxicity and result in IF induction.",['10.1093/jnci/57.6.1211 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

Friend SFFV titers of 10(4) spleen focus-forming units/ml of culture medium were maintained for more than 200 cell generations. The virus from IS cells induced the splenomegaly and high hematocrit typical of Friend virus-induced erythroid disease in SIM mice. Cells of the IS line were adherent and phagocytic and had a low saturation density. They produced no tumors after being injected sc into normal syngeneic hosts and no spleen colonies after being injected iv into supralethally irradiated hosts. IS cells did not have the character of erythroid cells: They did not contain detectable heme as measured by benzidine-peroxide reagent, did not contain globin mRNA in detectable amounts, and did not produce erythroid colonies in plasma culture in the absence or presence of erythropoietin. According to these criteria, growth in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide did not stimulate erythroid differentiation of IS cells. We concluded that Friend SFFV can infect nonerythroid spleen cells but that replication of the virus was not obligatorily coupled to expression of genes associated with the erythroid phenotype.",['10.1093/jnci/57.4.853 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

Concentration- and time-dependent decrements to plateau levels of granulocytic colony-forming capacity occurred. The sequence of drug administration was important and synergistic cytotoxicity was noted when certain schedules of ara-C and 6-thioguanine combinations were used. Endotoxin-stimulated colony-forming cells had increased sensitivity to the in vitro ara-C exposure. High or intermittent doses of ara-C demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity when short exposure times (1 to 8 hr) were utilized, whereas low doses were markedly cytotoxic with prolonged exposure (10 days). Normal and leukemic human colony-forming cells had similar susceptibility to the cytotoxic effects of ara-C.

The complete remission rate was 76% in the 21 patients with no leukemic growth in vitro (Group 1), 75% in 36 patients with leukemic cell growth but aggregates of 20 cells or less (Group 2), and only 21% in the 15 patients with aggregates of greater than 20 (Group 3).

Adoptive immunity was also achieved by transferring splenocytes from actively immunized donor animals intravenously into syngeneic recipient animals challenged with the virus. Furthermore, RNA-rich extracts derived from spleens of actively immunized donor animals were capable of transferring immunity to FLV leukemia when injected into recipient animals challenged with the virus. The ""immune RNA,"" when incubated with normal splenocytes in vitro, followed by washing, resulted in a cell population that also induced adoptive immunity after transfer to normal animals challenged with virus either before, simultaneously with, or after injection of the treated splenocytes. RNase, but not DNase or other enzymes, inactivated the biologie activity of the protective RNA from immune donors. In addition, isogeneic mouse serum that contained neutralizing antibody to FLV also inhibited the protective effect of the specific RNA; sera from control mice immunized with unrelated antigens failed to neutralize the specific RNA. These results indicate that an RNA extract that contains a virus-associated or -induced antigen is formed in the spleens of actively immunized animals and possesses the ability to either directly induce protective immunity in recipient animals challenged with virus or, indirectly, to convert normal splenocytes in vitro to adoptively confer immunity to similar recipients.

The lymphoblastoid cell lines used for vaccination were established from blood of patients with advanced myeloid leukemia and were reactive with ""specific"" primate antisera against myeloid leukemic cells. Both sensitization to target cell antigens and substantial general increases in delayed hypersensitivity responses were recorded among immunized patients. Major immunologic complications (hypersensitivity and ""autoimmune"" phenomena) were observed in 10 patients. These complications were attributable to the BCG content of vaccines, and their incidence correlated with intensity of immunologic stimulation. Data from cases in which intermittent busulfan therapy was used provided suggestive evidence that immunotherapy (either with BCG-cell mixtures or with BCG alone) prolonged unmaintained remissions in one-third of the patients. Among 48 ""good-risk"" patients, there was an inverse correlation between intensity of immunologic stimulation and survival. The survival of 18 patients who received the most intensive vaccination schedule was identical to that of controls. Survival of the other 30 patients was significantly better (p = 0.03), with an increase of 2 years in median survival. Survival of 30 poor-risk patients (24, most intensive vaccination schedule) was identical to that of controls. We conclude that immunologic stimulation may produce worthwhile prolongation of life in CML but that overly aggressive schedules of immunotherapy abrogate this effect. Our experience raises the question whether results in other clinical trials of immunotherapy may have been adversely affected by excessive frequency or dosage of immunologic stimulants.",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1976.tb41715.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

DBA/2 Ha and C3H/f mice repeatedly immunized with neuraminidase-treated tumor cells rejected subsequent challenge of 10(7) or 10(6) untreated tumor cells, respectively. Based on the 51Cr microcytotoxicity assay, both strains of mice showed strong complement-dependent antibody titers and cell-mediated immunity. Sera and splenic lymphocytes from immunized C3H/f mice neutralized the tumorigenicity of 6C3HED lymphosarcoma and protected the recipient C3H/f mice against the disease. Immune lymphocytes pretreated with anti-theta sera lost their ability to neutralize the tumorigenicity of lymphosarcoma, and they failed to be stimulated by T-cell mitogens. We studied the effectiveness of chemoimmunotherapy in DBA/2 Ha mice with leukemia L1210. A single near optimal dose of BCNU 2 days after implantation of 10(6) tumor cells increased the survival time. A single immunization with 2 X 10(7) neuraminidase-treated L1210 tumor cells 4 days after cytoreductive therapy increased survival and resulted in cures for 50% of animals. Immunization of mice with neuraminidase-treated tumor cells and MER produced indefinite survival in a larger percentage of mice than did either treatment alone. AKR mice with spontaneous leukemia treated with combination chemotherapy sustained an 180% increase in life-span. Combination chemotherapy plus immunization with neuraminidase-treated syngeneic or allogeneic (Gross virus-induced) E2G leukemia cells were highly effective in prolonging the life-span of the immunized leukemic AKR mice. The experimental data led to clinical trials in acute myelocytic leukemia with neuraminidase-treated a-logeneic myeloblasts. Patients with acute myelocytic leukemia were randomized into two groups after remission induction. The median remission duration of patients on sustaining chemotherapy alone was 19 weeks (8 patients), whereas six of nine patients who received neuraminidase-treated allogeneic myeloblasts remain in remission 79-132 weeks.

In this study, four cohorts of active and retired workers, at four major rubber-tire plants, were identified historically and followed for the ten-year period from 1964 to 1973. The cancer mortality of these four population was compared, separately and combined, with that of the general community. For all cancers combined, there was a slight excess above the expected number of deaths, whereas for some specific cancers (stomach, colon, prostate, and neoplasms of the lymphatic and hematopoietic system) there was a marked excess of deaths. Proportional mortality analysis at other small plants revealed similar excesses for these cancers, and some excess for lung, bladder, and CNS cancers. Analysis of detailed individual work histories reveals an association of certain cancers with specific job exposures; in particular, lymphatic leukemia and solvent exposure, and lung cancer and curing-room exposure. For both bladder cancer and stomach cancer, preliminary analyses indicate an association with groups of jobs in adjacent production stages (handling and mixing raw ingredients, and processing the ""green"" precured rubber, respectively).

The low dosage of radiation was chosen because it is well tolerated and has been found temporaily effective in overt CNS relapse. The two series of patients were comparable as to various parameters. Results after three years of observation were comparable to those obtained by other with a single initial course of high-dose radiation, with an expected 50% uninterrupted complete 5-year remission.

In a small minority an independent origin of the relapse clone could not be excluded on cytogenetic grounds but was considered unlikely, since mechanisms capable of accounting for the changes observed in these patients could be demonstrated in other cases. The persistence of diploid leukemic cells in the presence of an aneuploid subclone was demonstrated in the relapse bone marrow and/or spinal fluid in all active phases of the disease. On this basis the conversion from an aneuploid to a predominantly or exclusively diploid karyotype could be visualized, and a new model of clonal evolution, involving repetitive formation of abnormal karyotypes from a surviving diploid clone could be suggested.",['10.1002/ajh.2830010202 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

Antibodydependent, complement-mediated cytotoxicity was demonstrated by the trypan blue test and Cr release assay for cultured ML cells, whereas no cytotoxicity was demonstrated for cells from B (SB) and T (MOLT 4) lymphoblastoid cell lines. The antisera showed no cross-reactivity for normal human peripheral leukocytes or purified granulocytes. A low level (less than 8%) of cytotoxicity was directed against cell membrane associated fetal bovine serum proteins. Absorption of the immune serum with normal human bone marrow cells of first trimester human whole embryo cells reduced the cytotoxic titer to a similar extent; this suggested the possibility of crossreactivity between ML cells and fetal antigen(s). However, the ML antigen(s) was unrelated to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), since absorption with CEA had no effect on the serum cytotoxic titer. The anti-ML sera were cytotoxic for cells taken from 10 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and from 3 with acute myelogenous leukemia. In contrast, the leukocytes of 1 of 4 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia, and 3 of 7 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia shared similar antigenic determinants as demonstrated by cytotoxicity tests. The significance of the cross-reactivity of some lymphatic and ML cells may be the result of the use of rabbit sera that did not distinguish antigens common to both granulocytic and lymphocytic cells, or it may reflect an ""immature"" or ""blastic"" antigen present on many leukemia cells.",['10.1093/jnci/56.5.903 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

Because normal human lymphocytes are not able to recognize immunologically, in vitro, lymphocytes from MHC identical siblings, the present studies have examined the in vitro proliferative and cytotoxic responses of normal lymphocytes to MHC identical AML and ALL blasts. In those cases where acute leukemic cells were unable to induce a proliferative response by MHC identical lymphocytes, the generation of effective anti-leukemic cytotoxicity required the addition of unrelated stimulating cells to the sensitization culture. In contrast, leukemic blasts that induced a proliferative response by MHC identical lymphocytes were also able to stimulate anti-leukemic cytotoxicity. This could be augmented by the addition of unrelated stimulating cells to the sensitization culture. The specificity of anti-leukemic cell cytotoxicity was demonstrated in all instances by simultaneous testing of putative killer cells on 51Cr leukemic blasts as well as 51Cr-labeled MHC identical phytohemagglutinin blasts or normal lymphocytes. Simultaneous sensitization to MHC identical leukemic blasts and unrelated stimulating lymphocytes did not invariably generate anti-leukemic cytotoxicity even when allogeneic cytotoxicity was observed; the absence of demonstrable suppressor activity in these nonreactive combinations suggested that some individuals may be specifically immunoincompetent, and thereby unable to generate effective anti-leukemic CML.",,,,,,,,,,

This release of binder was inhibited by culturing the cells at 4 degrees C and by the addition of N-ethylmaleimide, but not by actinomycin D, puromycin, or cycloheximide. When the pre- and post-culture cell lysates were saturated with tritiated folic acid ([3H]PteGlu) and subjected to chromatography on DEAE-agrarose, approximately half of the bound folate eluted with 0.001 M phosphate buffer at pH 6.0 and the other half eluted with 0.2 M buffer at pH 7.2.

In most patients the diagnosis is obvious as very immature cells are found to be the predominant cell in blood and marrow. However, in some, the onset is fairly subtle and the diagnosis of the syndrome will be dependent upon ancillary clinical and laboratory clues supplementing morphologic appearance of the blood and bone marrow. The same spectrum of morphological cell types is observed in blast crisis as is observed in acute myeloid leukemia. The predominant cells usually are myeloblasts and promyelocytes but may be immature monocytes, myelomonocytes, proerythroblasts, or immature megakaryocytes. These and other findings imply that the defect resides in the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell. It is possible, but by no means proven, that lymphoblastic conversion also may occur.

Chromosome analysis may be helpful in characterizing patients with preleukemia and DiGuglielmo's syndrome, and aneuploidy may correlate with shortened survival in these conditions.

Cell size and nucleolar size and prominence are the two criteria, detectable on Romanowsky-stained bone marrow spreads, which permit such prediction. In a series of 93 children with ALL, 48 ""poor risk"" patients were detected. More than 1% of the bone marrow blast cells of these patients exceeded in diameter twice the diameter of nearby red blood cells, and, on average, more than one nucleolus was visible in every two leukemic cells. The survival of these 48 patients (estimated median 18 mo) was significantly worse (p = 0.0036) than that of the other 45 patients (estimated median over 5 yr). Analysis of the series with respect to other risk factors (age, leukocytosis at diagnosis) revealed the cytomorphological risk to be independent of the other two. Comparison of this method with others which have been used suggests that the proposed method may be more reproducible (capable of being learned) than others because it relies on specific characteristics rather than on total recognition of a ""cell type,"" and that it may select a higher proportion of ""poor risk"" patients than other methods.

Four patients had constitutionally abnormal genotypes, three had Down's syndrome, and one had a D/G translocation. Aneuploidy was observed in the pretreatment bone marrow in 49/115 (42.6%) of this series exhibited several general characteristics: aneuploid cells usually coexist with normal stem cells, hyperdiploidy is predominant and wide ranging aneuploidy clusters around a major cell line. The most common chromosomal group involved in aneuploidy is the G group (p=0.001) and the next most common is the B group (p=0.01). Aneuploidy disappeared after successful achievement of remission, and new clones developed in 12 patients during relapse. Two of the four patients originally thought to have a Ph1 chromosome, on trypsin Giemsa handing were proved to have a 21q- chromosome. A higher incidence of aneuploidy was noted in patients under one year or more than 20 years of age and was also higher in patients with low or elevated WBCs at diagnosis. The appearance of aneuploid cells in the bone marrow at the onset or later in the disease is of no prognostic significance but persistence of these lines and the development of total aneuploidy signals a poor prognosis. Eradication of aneuploid cells is therefore essential for the achievement of a long remission and progress to a permanent cure.",['10.1002/mpo.2950020315 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

Thus, the sera of 17/18 patients fail to completely consume C3 to C9 when incubated with zymosan or cobra venom factor (CoF). This underutilization is due to a specific inhibitor of C3 activation which has been partially isolated. By remission, the inhibotor disappears and the CoF and zymosan assays return to normal. In addition, serum levels of C3 and factor B are elevated at the time of diagnosis or relapse but fall to below 3 S.D. from the mean in nearly 60 per cent of the cases during induction therapy. Similarly, serum C4 levels which are normal at diagnosis fall to less that 3 S.D. from the mean in 7/12 cases during treatment. Low C3 levels correlate well with factor B values, suggesting that if C3 to C9 are utilized after the inhibitor has been eliminated, such utilization occurs primarily through the alternative pathway. Presumably, as illustrated by the low C4 levels, this activity is mediated by the ampliciation loop of the alternative pathway involving classical pathway generation of C3b.",['0022-2143(76)90309-7 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,

In one set of experiments to assess RES function, isolated spleens of nonleukemic rats were perfused with blood from rats in progressively advanced stages of the leukemia. In a reciprocal set of experiments, isolated spleens of rats in comparable stages of the leukemia were perfused with blood from nonleukemic rats. The clearance of 99mTc-sulfur colloid from the blood perfusate was used as a test of RES function. In the first set, clearance was depressed in nonleukemic spleens perfused with blood collected from rats 1 hr after they had been inoculated with tumor cells, and it was more markedly depressed in a late stage of the leukemia 6 days later. Perfusion of nonleukemic spleens with blood from rats in intermediate stages of the leukemia did not depress clearance. In the reciprocal study, clearance was depressed in spleens of rats that were inoculated with tumor cells 1 hr before perfusion with nonleukemic blood. Clearance values were at the control level in spleens of rats in all other stages of the leukemia when calculated on the basis of total spleen weight. When calculated on a unit weight basis, clearance values were lower in the enlarged spleens of rats in advanced stages of the leukemia. The results indicate that impairment of RES clearance of 99mTc-sulfur colloid is associated with alternations in the humoral content of the blood of this leukemic rat. There is indirect evidence to suggest that in the terminal stage of the leukemia an impairment of splenic RES cells to clear 99mTc-sulfur colloid may develop secondarily.",,,,,,,,,,

It is composed of immature lymphoid cells that are indistinguishable from the cells of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Although these neoplasms usually have been classified as malignant lymphoma, lymphoblastic type, they contain, in addition to lymphoblasts, prolymphocytes in varying proportions. On the basis of the nuclear morphology, malignant lymphoma of the lymphoblastic type, (MLLB) can be further divided into those with and those without convoluted nuclei. In our series both groups had the following clinical features in common: 1) frequent occurrence in children and adolescents; 2) clinical presentation with mediastinal masses in 50% of cases; 3) a high incidence of bone marrow and perpheral blood involvement during the course of the disease; and 4) rapid progression of the disease with a median survival of 8 months. Our observations indicate that nuclear convolutions are helpful but not essential for the recognition of a clinicopathologic entity which is histologically and cytologically characterized by 1) the immaturity of the lymphoid cells indistinguishable from the lymphoblasts and prolymphocytes of ALL and 2) a high mitotic index. Because of the frequency with which MLLB progresses into ALL, systemic therapy may be indicated even before this progression is hematologically evident. This indicates the need for morphologic recognition of this malignant lymphoma regardless of the presence of nuclear convolution, age of the patient, and site of presentation.",['10.1002/1097-0142(197608)38:2<964::aid-cncr2820380248>3.0.co;2-v [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

The cells of these 38 patients (16 with abnormal karyotypes and 22 with normal karyotypes) were re-examined with Q- and G-banding techniques. Twenty-two patients with conventionally stained normal karyotypes did not show any abnormalities, even with banding techniques. Three cases had a common translocation between the long arm of No. 8 and No. 21, i.e., [t(8;21)(q22;q22)], the so-called prototypic karyotype. Two cases had a 45, XX,-21 karyotype; and three cases had trisomy of the long arm of chromosome No. 1. The banding patterns revealed that in two of the three latter cases, the presence of the trisomy of the long arm of No. 1 apparently occurred late in the disease. Therefore, it is possible that the trisomy of the long arm of No. 1 might bear a relationship to selective growth advantage of the leukemic cells in some cases with AML. The presence of extra No. 8 and No. 9 chromosomes and deletion of the long arm of No. 7, frequently reported in several leukemic disorders, were also found in the present cases, but with other chromosomal abnormalities. Chromosomes No. 6,No. 15,No. 19,No. 20, and X were not involved in any structural and/or numerical changes.

In 4 cases, the number was nearly or exactly tetraploid and in 1 patient a prevalent octaploid line was seen. Structurally abnormal marker chromosomes were seen in 8 of the patients. A total of 31 bone marrow chromosome counts were performed on a young woman with acute myelomonocytic leukaemia who had had several drug-induced remissions during the 3 1/2 years of disease. The results were related to the clinical findings. On several occasions a clear-cut correlation was noted between high proportions (nearly 100%) of polyploid cells and relapse on the one hand and low proportions (as low as 0%) of polyploids and remission on the other. Of the 11 patients, 2 had chronic myeloid leukaemia, 3 acute myelomonocytic leukaemia, 3 acute myeloid leukaemia and a further 3 some other malignant haematological disorders.

This case raises several points for discussion. Toxoplasmosis is a frequent complication of malignant hematological disease, it is often severe with neurological complications in more than half the patients affected. It is often difficult to diagnose. The parasite is arduous to isolate and serology is problematic to interpretate without reference to previous samples. This suggests it would be wise to measure the titre of anti-toxoplasma antibodies as part of the initial investigations of every malignant hemopathy and to repeat the measurements during the evolution of the disease. Any patient showing a high serological titre, even though it is stable and without IgM should be given systematically a specific treatment for toxoplasmosis, for as in the patient presented in this paper, such a serological picture is compatible with an increasing infection. The frequence of high serological titres seems to be greater among patients suffering from chronic myeloid leukemia than among another people. Then, transfusion of leucocytes of such patients may be the source of parasite transmission; this paper relates one case of post-transfusional toxoplasmosis.",,,,,,,,,,

Kinetic analysis of the ingestion rate showed CGL granulocytes to have the same capacity to bind the particles as normal granulocytes. Both specific and primary granule protein deficiencies were shown for CGL granulocytes, and these deficiencies were more pronounced at or near blast cell transformation. Analysis of all different granulocyte function parameters showed an inverse correlation to white blood cell counts (p less than 0.01) and to the percentage of immature granulocytes in peripheral blood (p less than 0.001). The leukocytosis doubling time was progressively shortened during the chronic course of the disease. A correlation was found between granulocyte function parameters and leukocytosis doubling time (p less than 0.001), indicating that granulocyte function was progressively deteriorating during chronic phase CGL, and may be an expression of increasing disturbance of the differentiation process.",['S0006-4971(20)73376-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,

Organs from noninoculated healthy C3H(f) mice crossreacted poorly in the system, virus generally being detectable only in the thymus and spleen and at low concentration. In some of the inoculated C3H(f) leukemic mice the viral content of as little as 0.5 mul of plasma is measurable. That this assay is for intact virus and not for soluble antigens of the viral envelope was proven by the observation that the immunoreactive material of plasma and extracts from thymus and liver of leukemic mice has a buoyant denisty in sucrose of 1.17-1.18 g/ml, corresponding to that of intact virus grown in tissue culture. With this sensitivity it may now be possible to quantitate viral concentrations in tissue and body fluids from the time of inoculation through the development of obvious pathology.",['10.1073/pnas.73.8.2847 [doi]'],PMC430772,,,,,,,,

In freeze-thawing experiments, 39 pg of parathyroid hormone was released form 1 x 108 of the patient's myeloblasts; no hormone was released from the normocalcemia cells.

Human granulocytes had a stronger inhinitory capacity than mouse granulocytes. The inhibition appeared to be tissue-specific and caused by a diffusible factor. A time study showed that the added granulocytes had no observable effect on the growth of proliferative granulocytes and CFU-C during the first days of culture. A rapid decrease of proliferative granulocytes after day 5 was preceded by a similar reduction of CFU-C 1 day earlier. The effect of CFU-S was more variable. In one strain of mice, there was a consistent increase in the granulocyte co-culture group, whereas in another strain a significant increase was observed only on day 2. Hislotologic examination showed that mature granulocytes changed the colony distribution, so that a significant relative decrease of granuloid colonies occurred. The nature of this delayed suppression of granulopoiesis is not evident from these data. A possible explanation is that factors released by mature granulocytes prevent recruitment of CFU-C and granulocyte precursors from the CFU-S compartment by blocking the granulopoietic pathway.

During later stages, serial studies revealed that sudden increments of CFC S-phase coincided with rapidly growing leukocytosis, which was consistent with leukemic cell populations escaping growth control. H-thymidine labeling indices for differentiated precursor cells showed slight variations not coinciding with variations of the CFC S-phase fraction. Cyclic oscillations of the white cell count were observed in one case. The white cell count and the fraction of CFC in S-phase displayed a direct relationship, indicating that the occurence of cycles was not likely to be due to a negative feedback mechanism elaborated by mature granulocytes.

These enzymes require divalent cations for their activity. The data suggest that the major role of idvalent cations is to chelate with ATP; the complex thus formed serves as the phosphate donor for the reaction. The activity of various triphosphate nucleosides as a phosphate donor for cytoplasmic deoxythymidine kinase is as follows: ATP = dATP greater than ara-ATP greater than GTP greater than CTP greater than dGTP = dCTP greater than dUTP, whereas for mitochondrial deoxythymidine kinase, the order of activity is ATP greater than CTP greater than UTP = dATP greater than ara-ATP greater than dGTP = dCTP greater than dUTP. Neither IdUTP nor dTTP could serve as a phosphate donor in the reaction catalyzed by either isozyme. From the many pyrimidine analogues tested for their binding affinity to each of these isozymes, I-dUrd and Br-dUrd had high good affinity which was equivalent to that of deoxythymidine. 5-Allyl-dUrd, 5-ethyl-dUrd, and 5-propyl-dUrd were only weakly bound to each isozyme. 5-I-dCyd, 5-Br-dCyd, dCyd, and 5-vinyl-dUrd were tightly bound to mitochondrial deoxythymidine kinase but not to the cytoplasmic isozyme. dTTP and I-dUTP are potent inhibitors of the reaction catalyzed by both isozymes. In contrast, dCTP and ara-CTP are potent inhibitors only of the mitochondrial isozyme, but not of the cytoplasmic isozyme. ATP-MG2+ acts as a sigmoidal substrate of the cytoplasmic isozyme with a""Km"" of 0.22 mM, and as a regular substrate of the mitochondrial isozyme with a Km of 0.1 mM. Deoxythymidine acts as a regular substrate for both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial isozyme with a Km of 2.6 and 5.2 muM, respectively. Initial velocity as well as product inhibition studies suggest that the cytoplasmic isozyme catalyzes the reaction via a ""sequential"" mechanism. In contrast, mitochondrial deoxythymidine kinase catalyzes the reaction via a ""ping-pong"" mechanism.",['10.1021/bi00662a007 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

During the last five years, 27 patients with different types of acute leukemia were treated. The type of acute leukemia was determined using cytological criteria of Levy and Lortholary and cytochemical criteria as described by Hayhoe. One thrid of the patients died during the first days of hospitalisation, before any effect of cytostatic treatment could be evaluated. The cause of death in those patients was septic shock, intracranial haemorrhage or cardiovascular colapsus; initial signs of those complications of acute leukemia were allready present before diagnosis. Those data point to the fact that diagnosis of acute leukemia is often made too late, when irreversible ocmplications of the disease are allready established. Patients over sixty, often ""fragile"" to aggresive cytostatic therapy, may enter complete and relatively long lasting remission with induction therapy cosisting of 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate only. Allthough the number of cases was rather limited, the authors had rather disappointing results with the 06-LA-66 protocole in adult lymphoblastic leukemia. The first with COAP treatment protocole seem encouraging. Adequate cytostatic therapy was in several cases impossible, duo to the lack of adequate substitution therapy; such inadequate cytostatic therapy resulted in partial remissions with a rather poor quality survival. A beeter cooperation is needed between hospital centers and institutions which provide matherial for the substitution theapy.",,,,,,,,,,

Seven additional cases are reported herein. The incidence of neonatal leukemia has been of one in 50,000. Its incidence among the group of neonates requiring hospitalization has been of 0.075%. The seven neonates with leukemia consist of five males and two females. Two of them had an associated Down's syndrome. Abdominal distension, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, cutaneous manifestations and purpura were the most frequent clinical findings in our patients. Severe anemia was present in only three patients. Thrombocytopenia was recognized in six of them. A high white blood cell count was present in five patients. The number of blast cells in their peripheral blood smear ranged between 16 and 100%. A remarkable myeloid dominance was observed. One patient died two hours after birth and his diagnosis was made at autopsy. Three patients were diagnosed before the age of three weeks. The three patients with myeloid leukemia were treated with DNR and Ara-C. A complete hematological remission was achieved in two of them. One patient died of a Pn. carinii pneumonia one month after the remission was induced. The remainder patient of this group had a Down's syndrome and the leukemia had been confirmed by hepatic biopsy. After two years of maintenance with Ara-C and Thioguanine he is alive and both, peripheral blood and bone marrow, remains normal. A lymphocitic leukemia was seen in only two patients. One was treated with prednisolone and VCR, and the other with prednisolone, VR and L-Asp. In both cases a good response to the chemotherapy was observed. Autopsy was performed in all patients who died but one. The pathological findings are analyzed. The low survival among patients with neonatal leukemia may be influenced by the toxic side effects of the used chemotherapy. All aspects of the medical treatment including drugs of choice and the usefullness of isolation devices are further discussed.",,,,,,,,,,

This was done by determining separately the relative compartment size, the mitotic index (IM), and the in vitro 3H-TdR labelling index (IL) of marrow and blood myeloblasts (MB) and promyelocytes plus myelocytes (PMC + MC), before and at intervals after the drug. After a single dose of ARA-C, the IL of marrow MB declines rapidly, and recovers thereafter, often with an overshoot at 15 h. After 2 to 4 doses of ARA-C, the IL of marrow and blood MB rises by a factor of 2 to 3, and is maintained at a plateau during further treatment. The behaviour of the IL of blood MB is not always the same as that of marrow MB. The IM of marrow MB does not rise proportionally to the IL, and sometimes is even found to be decreased. It is suggested that these kinetic perturbations reflect an accumulation of MB in S-phase where many but not all of them are trapped and sooner or later die off. With a few exceptions, ARA-C induces only milder kinetic perturbations in marrow and blood PMC+MC. The overall results of this study are in agreement with the generally accepted mechanism of action of ARA-C (S-phase specific effector agent), and with studies that indicate that the effect of ARA-C depends on the growth pattern and on the degree of maturation of the target cells. It is suggested that a proper evaluation of ARA-C on a cell population should take into account the existence of different cell pools, provided with different proliferative activity and potential, and with variable degrees of maturation.",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1976.tb00326.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of this host restriction was investigated by comparing the early events in the replication of N-tropic versus B-tropic Friend leukemia virus in NIH 3T3 cells. These cells, which are Fv-1nn in type, are permissive for the N-tropic strain, but nonpermissive for the B-tropic strain, which replicates permissively in Balb/c cells. We have studied the synthesis, intracellular location, and molecular form of virus-specific DNA early in replication by means of molecular hybridization with a virus-specific DNA probe. Our results suggest that in the permissive infection viral DNA rapidly becomes integrated with cellular DNA.

This precursor could be labeled with radioactive glucosamine and methionine but not with fucose; whereas gp69/71 could be detected by labeling with radioactive glucosamine, fucose, or a mixture of amino acids but seemed to be deficient in methionine relative to Pr2a+b. Pr2a+b and gp69/71, were specifically precipitated by an antiserum prepared against phosphocellulose purified Rauscher gp69/71. Other virus-specific precursors, in addition to Pr2a+b, could be precipitated by antiserum prepared against detergent disrupted virus. Neither Pr2a+b nor gp69/71 was precipitated from cell extracts by antisera to Rauscher p30. Tryptic maps of Pr2a+b and gp69/71 showed that these glycoproteins share many tryptic peptides. Pulse-chase experiments with 14C-labeled amino acids indicated that gp69/71 was not radio-labeled during the pulse-labeling period but slowly appeared during the chase incubations. Pr2a+b, however, was rapidly labeled and tended to disappear during long chases. Furthermore, two nonglycosylated viral proteins, termed p15E and p12E, are structurally related to Pr2a+b. Viral p15E and p12E contained the same methionine-containing tryptic peptide fraction as Pr2a+b as determined by ion-exchange chromatography. These results provide evidence that Pr2a+b is a precursor to gp69/71 and establish a structural and possible precursor-product relationship between Pr2a+b, p15E, and p12E.",['10.1073/pnas.73.7.2326 [doi]'],PMC430550,,,,,,,,

Suspension cultures of Ostertag FSD-1 cell line were found to enter a G or resting state at the end of their proliferative phase and to simultaneously cease producing helper and dependent components of Friend virus. Whereas the decline in virus production is at least 100-fold, rates of cellular RNA and protein synthesis are only slightly lower in resting than in growing cells. Both resting and growing cells contain similarly large concentrations of the viral proteins P(30) and P(12). Dimethyl sulfoxide induces hemoglobin synthesis in growing cells, but its effects on virus production appear to be indirect results of its action to inhibit cell growth and thus to delay entry of cells into the G resting state. Furthermore, variant cell lines were obtained with differing abilities to synthesize virus or hemoglobin. Some lines no longer produce infectious virus, although they all harbor murine leukemia virus genes which are expressed to varying extents. The major internal protein of these oncornaviruses, P(30), is synthesized in large amounts by all of the cell lines. These results suggest that Friend virus production is not coinduced with erythroid differentiation, as had been proposed, but rather is controlled by a cellular growth cycle.",['10.1128/JVI.19.1.118-125.1976 [doi]'],PMC354838,,,,,,,,

In a highly condensed metaphase chromosome, only a rare free fiber end is seen, suggesting that a single chromatin fiber folds into a chromatid. The presence of interchromosomal fibers suggests that the DNA molecule (i.e., the chromatin fiber) might be folded into more than one chromosome. The specificity of the 9q+/22q-Ph1) translocation in chronic myelogenous leukemia and the evidence for nonrandom translocation abnormalities in adult acute leukemia suggest that either the linear integrity of the chromatin fiber comprising several chromosomes is real or that the nuclear membrane attachment site of individual chromosomes results in specific, adjacent chromosomes which are available for induction of nonrandom translocations.",,,,,,,,,,

Thus, in the case of cancer of the stomach or bladder, for example, the karyotypic aberrations can only be found in the cancerous cells, whereas the surrounding normal cells or those within the tumor (such as the leukocytes) have a normal chromosomal constitution. In the case of leukemia the chromosomal changes are best observed in the cells of the marrow, though if sufficient leukemic cells are circulating in the blood, the karyotypic changes can sometimes by established on such cells. In any case, in order to ascertain a reliable karyotypic picture in human cancer or leukemia the malignant cells must be examined and the chromosome constitution ascertained either by a direct technique not involving culture conditions or after short-term culture. Long-term culture of leukemic or cancerous cells generally leads to changes in the chromosomal picture either towards diploidy or towards aberrations resulting from in vitro conditions and, in either case, is not representative of the karyotypic picture in the original malignant cells. Since some tumors have a rather low mitotic index (and this applies occasionally to marrows of leukemia), either a repeat examination has to be undertaken or one has to resort to short-term culture.",,,,,,,,,,

In the absence of somatic cell selection the tissues of an X-linked heterozygote should all be mosaic and should have a mosaic composition approaching 1:1. If somatic cell selection is occurring, it should be detectable by a significance shift from the random expected 1:1 mosaicism. The system is effective at detecting selection acting on X-linked loci and on newly arisen somatic autosomal variants, and several examples of somatic cell selection are described.

These rates are assumed to depend on the total number of cells in the combined populations. The presence of the leukemic population destabilizes the homeostatic state of the normal population, which is stable in the absence of leukemic cells, and drives the system to a new stable state consisting entirely of leukemic cells and no normal cells.

The results in this experimental group were compared with a historical control group of 26 patients. Two-thirds of all the patients had chronic myelocytic leukemia, and the mean weight of the spleens removed was just over 1,800 grams.

This factor(s) is associated with the presence of a cytoplasmic antigen which can be detected by fixed immunofluorescence test with sera of patients with osteosarcoma, leukemia and some apparently normal individuals. Cultures of leukemic bone marrow carrying this factor(s) also form multinucleated cells when exposed to RD114 virus or cels. This factor(s) is transmitted into susceptible whole human embryo cells by cell-free culture fluid. Appearance of the new antigen can be detected by fixed immunofluorescence test about 6 weeks after transmission. Cultures showing the new antigen also form multinucleated cells following co-cultivation with RD114 virus or cells. Co-cultures of human osteosarcoma cells and leukemic bone marrow cells undergo morphologic as well as antigen changes after a long period of time (at least 3 months). Cell line fluids from these cultures contain a factor which induces in recipient whole human embryo cultures both the new antigen and morphological alterations resembling those observed in the co-cultures. Cell-free fluids from leukemic bone marrow and sarcoma cultures as well as from short-term co-cultures have failed to produce morphological alterations in whole human embryo cells. Extensive electron microscope studies carried out at different stages of the experiments have failed to reveal the presence of viral particles. The morphological changes resemble those induced in susceptible cells by sarcoma viruses. The described factor(s) may conceivably represent subviral components capable of biological activity. While suggestive of viral involvement in human sarcoma of bone and soft tissues, there is no definite proof of viruses being the causative agent(s) of human sarcoma. Present evidence provides only a basis for search of additional ways of treatment of human sarcoma to those of surgery and radiotherapy. Present treatment consists of chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment directed against viral markers represented by enzymes, nucleic acids and proteins of possible viral origin, resembling those already known to be present in animal bone and soft tissue sarcomas. However tenuous the contention of the possiblity of viral involvement in human osteosarcoma may appear, adjuvant therapy directed against viral markers warrants the attention of orthopedic surgeons and other clinicians.",,,,,,,,,,

Seventy-five percent of the systemic infections and 72% of the pneumonias were caused by bacteria. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequent organisms isolated. After 1968, there was a sharp decrease in the number of fatal infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a marked increase in the incidence of fatal infections caused by Klebsiella spp. and E. coli. Infections caused by Gram-positive cocci occurred in only 3% of the cases. The incidence of systemic fungal infections was 13%; most common fungi causing infection were Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. Eighty-five percent of 159 patients with a terminal neutrophil count of less than 100/mm3 died of infection, compared to 48% of 62 patients with a terminal neutrophil count of greater than 1000/mm3. Hemorrhage was mostly due to thrombocytopenia (61%) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (12%).

Increased proliferation was associated with stimulatory sera, while inhibitory and leukemic pretreatment sera retarded proliferation of both normal and malignant cells. Exposure of normal proliferative cells to inhibitory or leukemic pretreatment sera yielded the greatest increase in mature granulocyte forms. In contrast, although the proliferative response of leukemic cells to these sera was similar to normal, maturation was minimal.

Either newborn mice (which can be considered as essentially fully differentiated animals) or preimplantation mouse embryos (at the 4-8 cell stage) were infected with M-MuLV. In both cases, animals that had developed an M-MuLV-induced leukemia were obtained. Two lines of evidence indicate that infection of preimplantation embryos, in contrast to infection of newborns, can lead to integration of the virus into the germ line. 1. Viremic males of the first backcross generation (N-1 generation) transmitted the virus to 50% of their offspring (N-2 generation) when mated with uninfected females. Likewise, a 50% transmission was observed from viremic N-2 and N-3 males to the next generations. 2. Molecular hybridization experiments revealed that viremic N-1 and N-2 animals carried one copy of M-MuLV per diploid mouse genome equivalent in all ""non-target"" organs tested. Together, both experiments indicate that the exogenous M-MuLV can be converted to an endogenous virus after infection of preimplantation embryos. The available evidence suggests that M-MuLV integrated into the germ line at one out of two possible integration sites. Thus, viremic backcross animals are heterozygous for a single Mendelian locus carrying the M-MuLV gene. During leukemogenesis an amplification of the M-MuLV from one copy to a maximum of four copies per diploid mouse genome equivalent takes place in the tumor tissues.",['10.1073/pnas.73.4.1260 [doi]'],PMC430242,,,,,,,,

In both adults and children there seemed to be a higher incidence of CNS involvement in patients with initial white blood cell counts greater than 25,000 cells/mm3.",['10.1002/1097-0142(197603)37:3<1256::aid-cncr2820370305>3.0.co;2-r [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

This suggested that the mothers of patients diagnosed in these three age groups might have been exposed to leukemogenic factors during different trimesters, but with each trimester consisting of the same specific group of months. Since a similar birth-month seasonality was not observed in rural regions, it seemed likely that leukemogenic factors might operate with a greater regularity in urban areas. Using these observations and reported trends for acute leukemia in the United States and New York State (excluding New York City), an effort was made to determine whether varicella, influenza, rubeola or rubella had similar epidemiologic features. Only varicella manifested both the urban-rural differences in seasonality and concomitant variations in time trends that were comparable to reported mortality trends for acute leukemia. Rank correlation coefficients for varicella and lymphatic leukemia incidence rates by month were also statistically significant when leukemia cases diagnosed in the three age groups and born in urban countries, were placed in the month of their appropriate trimesters.

A known inducing agent, N-methylacetamide, was dimerized through varying numbers of methylenes in an attempt to increase the local effective concentration at adjacent target sites. The simple dimer was no more effective than N-methylacetamide alone; introduction of five to eight methylenes between acetamide groups substantially increased the effectiveness of these compounds. The hexamethylene bisacetamide was active between 0.5 mM and 5 mM; the percentage of cells induced and the rate at which they were recruited to differentiation was dependent upon the concentration of inducer within this range. At 5 mM hexamethylene bisacetamide essentially the entire population (greater than 99%) was induced to a pathway of erythroid differentiation which was greater differentiation of the cultured cells than with any inducer yet tested.",['10.1073/pnas.73.3.862 [doi]'],PMC336019,,,,,,,,

When there is a choice between admitting the child or caring for him on an ambulatory basis, the parent usually chooses the latter. The census of pediatric ambulatory patient visits has increased from 6,000 in 1969, to 14,724 in 1974, as shown in Table 1. Each year the number of procedures increases, and each year more parents find this method of delivering patient care less disruptive to the family unit and more desirable, in every way, for the child under treatment. With the continuing increase in the number of patients and changes in the complexity of treatment, we find ourselves constantly changing our methods of delivering care. Today we have some children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who have never needed hospitalization; all of their treatment has been given on an outpatient basis. We hope, in the future, that cancer care will become so refined tha the majority of our patients need not be separated from their homes and families-that their care can be given completely on an outpatient basis. In the last five years many changes have been made in treating the child with cancer, and I suspect the next five years will see even greater improvement. It is important, then, when managing the care of this very special child on an ambulatory basis, to keep both the physical structure of the clinic and the clinic policies flexible, in order to accommodate the new methods of treatment that are constantly being introduced.",,,,,,,,,,

The plasma half-time of HU varied between 120 and 198 min. To synchronize leukemic cell populations the DNS-synthesis was blocked over a period of 36 hours by maintaining the HU-concentration above the critical lower level. In a second phase-specific therapeutic step cytosine-arabinoside (AraC) was given 4 times in a dose of 1 mg/kg each. A recruitment after the application of AarC made more cells available for the next following synchronization step. 4 acute myeloblastic leukemias with high peripheral cell counts were treated according to this schedule. One patient is still in complete remission for now 14 month. This synchronization/recruitment schedule seems to be successful in acute myeloblastic leukemias with high proliferation rates measured by biochemical and cytokinetic methods.,['10.1007/BF01469126 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

Reactivity in all assays of children on continuous chemotherapy was significantly depressed compared to similar patients later in the study. Patients on intermittent chemotherapy demonstrated much less immunodepression. The groups tested early during immunotherapy with BCG and allogeneic leukemic blasts were hyper-responsive (compared to published data) to primary sensitization with picryl chloride. Skin test reactivity to recall antigens and to tumor-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines was suppressed (as analyzed serial comparison) in this hyperimmunized group, possibly due to antigenic competition, and reactivity in all other assays was normal. The patients tested after 2-8 years of immunotherapy showed significantly higher positive skin-test responses to extracts of tumor-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines as compared to the other groups. The results of this multiphasic screen support the known effects of chemotherapy on immunocompetence.

Transport of HN2-OH by lymphocytes from normal individuals and patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia was stimulated by morphine and cocaine and, in each case, the effect was statistically significant (P less than 0.05 or greater). However, choline transport by normal lymphocytes was not altered by cocaine and was only slightly stimulated by morphine; choline transport by lymphocytes from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia was not stimulated by either morphine or cocaine. HN2-OH and choline transport by cells from patients with either acute lymphoblastic or myeloblastic leukemia was stimulated to a comparable degree by both drugs. Stimulation of HN2-OH transport by morphine and cocaine was greater in normal lymphocytes than in acute leukemic cells and the differences were highly significant (p less than 0.001). Conversely, stimulation of choline transport was more marked in acute leukemic cells than in normal lymphocytes, and these differences were also highly significant (p less than 0.001). It was previously shown that transport of nitrogen mustard by normal and leukemic human cells was biphasic in nature, consisting of a choline-independent component at ""high"" drug concentrations and a choline-dependent system at ""low"" substrate concentrations. The preferential stimulation of the low-dose, choline-dependent system by morphine and cocaine in acute leukemic cells relative to that observed in normal lymphocytes suggests a possible mechanism of increasing the therapeutic index of nitrogen mustard.",,,,,,,,,,

A similar failure was observed with the BN rat leukemia. In contrast, the Shay rat leukemic marrow produced an abnormally large number of colonies in the later stages of the disease. Evidence was obtained that the colonies produced by the Shay leukemic marrow consisted of leukemic cells, and that the disappearance of colonies from human AML and from BN rat leukemic marrow is caused by the numerical disappearance of normal pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells from the marrow and by the inability of the clonogenic leukemic cells to produce colonies in vitro.

A second ganglioside was tentatively identified as N-acetylneuraminyl-galactosyl-beta-N-acetylglucosaminyl-beta-(N-acetylneuraminyl) galactosyl-beta-glucosylceramide. Both gangliosides isolated were hydrolysed by neuraminidase. However, treatment of the intact cells with neuraminidase did not alter the ganglioside pattern.","['0005-2760(76)90199-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2760(76)90199-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,

""Carcinocythemia"" is suggested as a name for this unusual process observed over a six month period. Studies of the patient's immunocompetence, of circulating cell surface immunoglobulins and karyotype analysis were made. Postmortem examination revealed retroperitoneal fibrosis, splenic atrophy and extensive metastatic carcinoma but no evidence of leukemia. The cells will be contrasted to those seen in a second patient who appeared to have acute myelocytic leukemia complicating extensive cancer involving the bone marrow.

Corresponding features were evaluated at the time of diagnosis of blast crisis in 19 patients who had a previous history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Although many of the presenting symptoms and signs were similar, infections, lymphadenopathy, tissue infiltration and central nervous system involvement were more common in patients who presented with blastic leukemia. Marked leukocytosis, basophilia and marrow hypercellularity were present in both groups. Although patients in both groups had morphologic patterns that resembled acute leukemia, cytology suggestive of acute lymphocytic leukemia was more frequent in patients who initially presented with blastic leukemia. Megakaryocyte, platelet and erythroid abnormalities were more frequent in patients with a prior history of CML. Although there were clinical and morphologic features in the patients who presented with blastic leukemia which suggested the diagnosis of CML in blast crisis, chromosome studies were necessary to identify some of these patients. In both groups of patients multiple therapeutic regimens were used. Complete remissions were obtained in two patients; both presented with blastic leukemia, had ""lymphoblastic"" morphology and were treated with chemotherapeutic agents generally used for the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia.

Before incubation with CM, glycolysis and the glycolytic production of ATP were lower and the activity of the pentose cycle was higher in D+ than in D- cells. ATP depletion induced a higher degree of agglutination by concanavalin A in D- than in D+ cells, indicating a difference in their surface membrane. There were no detectable differences in the transport of glucose and the synthesis of sterols and fatty acids. After incubation with CM, the D+ cells, like normal granulocytes, showed a higher glycolysis, produced their ATP more through glycolysis than oxidative phosphorylation, became less dependent on the exogenous supply of glucose and oxygen and had a lower rate of sterol and fatty acid synthesis. The differentiating D+ cells also showed a change in their surface membrane resulting in an increased agglutinability without a change in ATP content and a stimulation of the pentose cycle by concanavalin A. These properties, which were not acquired by D- cells, were found before most of the D+ cells had differentiated to mature granulocytes. The data indicate, that the block in the ability of the D- cells to differentiate and the acquistion of the metabolic properties of normal granulocytes by differentiating D+ cells, were associated with differences in the organization of the cell surface membrane.",['10.1002/jcp.1040870205 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

Transferase activity was variable, ranging from 8 to 210 units/10(8) blasts, but it was consistently elevated at diagnosis and in relapse. Transferase levels did not correlate with the presence of lymphoblast surface receptors. During induction therapy transferase activity decreased rapidly, but it remained elevated in peripheral lymphoid cells even when blasts were not detectable in peripheral blood smears. Patients in remission had normal surface receptors and undetectable or minimally elevated levels of transferase.

A missing Y chromosome in AML was mostly associated with this karyotype. Patients of the MAKA group were usually erythroleukemic, had no or very few normal metaphases among the abnormal ones in the marrow, and almost invariably showed karyotypic instability. Karyotypic differences did not affect the patients' survival after the initiation of chemotherapy as much as did the presence or absence of normal metaphases.

Combinations with other cytotoxic drugs were used in all but eight patients. Hypersensitive reactions, decrease in Asnase activity in plasma, and bivalent antibodies to Asnase appeared more frequently in adults (28%, 46%, and 79%, respectively) than in children (16%, 17%, and 25% respectively). There was a clear association between these three parameters. Thus hypersensitive reactions generally developed at the time of or after the decrease in plasma Asnase activity. Antibodies were detected only where Asnase activity had disappeared from the plasma. This time sequence, and in vitro experiments, suggest the formation of antigen-antibody complexes which might be responsible for inactivation of Asnase and for the development of hypersensitive reactions. However in many cases antibodies were found without concomitant enzyme inactivation or hypersensitive reactions. Antibodies to Asnase of IgE type (reagins) were found in only 10 children and 6 adults. There was no correlation between hypersensitive reactions, decrease in Asnase activity, and IgE antibodies. The frequency of remission among patients developing bivalent antibodies to Asnase was 68% (13/19) in contrast to 27% (3/11) among patients whose sera contained no detectable antibodies to Asnase, but the difference was not statistically significant.",['10.1002/1097-0142(197601)37:1<220::aid-cncr2820370132>3.0.co;2-w [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

An early decrease in mitotic index and in 3H-thymidine labelling was observed in four of five patients and pretreatment values were reached again within the observation period. Changes suggesting synchronization were not observed. ARA-C induced a marked decrease in protein synthesis in the leukaemic myeloblasts as estimated from either a decrease in the 3H-leucine labelling index or the mean grain count of 3H-leucine labelled cells. It is suggested that ARA-C is incorporated also by cell which are not in S-phase and has a prolonged biochemical effect on the leukaemic cells.,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1976.tb00931.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

The presence of these antibodies was associated with febrile transfusion reactions and with immediate destruction of platelets or granulocytes.

Each entity was purified in appropriate cells by several sequential terminal dilution isolations and was grouwn to high titers. Besides ecotropic MLV-IC there was a pure xenotropic virus and a third novel virus with properties of both eco- and xenotropic viruses. The purified xenotropic virus had a wide host range, was restricted in mouse cells, and was inactivated by normal mouse sera like other xenotropic isolates. The purified virus with hybrid properties (HIX) could infect a wide range of mammalian cells, which included both N and B mouse cells. HIX gave single-hit titrations with equal titers on both mouse and cat indicator cells. Envelope properties of HIX were examined by virus preinfection interference, by interference involving viral glycoprotein, and by neutralization with specific antisera. Both xenotropic and MLV-IC type ecotropic determinants were found on the virus coat. The origins of HIX and the xenotropic virus were investigated in detail. The original MLV-IC stock had HIX type virus in low titer but no detectable pure xenotropic virus. Infection of mouse cells with a single infectious unit of the ecotropic virus from the MLV-IC virus stocks could at times give rise to HIX type virus. HIX type virus, passed once through heterologous rat cells, was subjected to long-term passage either in infected mouse or cat cells.

Moreover, the slope of the relapse curve is continuous over a five-year period with no definite plateau where it might appear that patients are no longer at risk of relapse.

The results showed that, in general, the more massive or extensive the disease at diagnosis, the poorer the outcome. Factors associated with a significantly poorer prognosis included: initial leukocyte count above 100,000/mm; spleen enlargement greater than 5 cm; mediastinal involvement and early CNS involvement. Children over 10 years old at diagnosis and Negro children also had a poor prognosis. From another viewpoint features were examined for patients who attained at least 3 years of continuous complete remission. This confirmed some earlier findings and, in addition, showed that children under 2 years of age at diagnosis or with hepatomegaly over 5 cm were less likely to attain this goal. With the exception of early CNS involvement, however, patients with excellent responses to therapy were found with each factor of poor prognosis.

Other leukocytes and their precursors did not exhibit plasma membrane PAO reactivity. The extent of surface binding was related to cell maturity, with maximal labeling evident in the mid and late promyelocytes; decreased binding occurred with subsequent maturation while myeloblasts were nonreactive. This study was initiated to ascertain if histochemical surface modifications of neutrophilic cells occur in certain myeloproliferative disorders. In this regard, we have been able to demonstrate a distinctive defect in the plasma membrane PAO binding characteristics of the leukemic cells in chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML). Limited binding of pyroantimonate to the plasma membrane of the leukemic cell series in four patients with CML contrasted with that of the normal granulocytic cell series and the neutrophilic cells seen in myelomonocytic leukemia (two patients), myelofibrosis (one patient), and acute myelocytic leukemia (three patients). Comparison of surface PAO reactivity of neutrophilic cells in all stages of maturation in two patients with CML in blast crisis revealed that, in the patient with 30% circulating blast cells, PAO reactivity was identical to that noted in CML, while in the patient with 80% circulating blast forms, the PAO reactivity of the maturing neutrophilic cells more nearly resembled that observed in neutrophilic cells from normal individuals. Many neutrophilic cells from patients with myelofibrosis and myelomonocytic leukemia and from one patient in severe blast crisis had large surface deposits of pyroantimonate considered to reflect increased membrane-associated reactive cation.",['S0006-4971(20)70900-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,

The antibody also showed reactivity against a panel of myeloblasts (12 paients) but not against the corresponding remission lymphocytes (five patients) or normal lymphocytes (20 donors). In two cases the antibody showed reactivity against the patient's own leukemic blasts. Seven of these eight patients have maintained a steady clinical course ranging from 20 to 40 mo, while one entered the blastic phase and died. Six patients were judged to be in the aggressive phase of CML because of progressive leukocytosis and splenomegaly or increasing myeloblastosis; five died an average of 16 mo after diagnosis.

Furthermore, the marrow continued to show leukemic fearures morphologically and in culture. Despite the indications of persistence or progression of the hyperdiploid, putatively leukemic line at cessation of chemotherapy and for a period of time thereafter, remission was achieved and blood and marrow cell numbers one year after cessation of all treatment are normal. The hyperdiploid line is no longer detectable.

The relation of thrombokinetics to megakaryocyte quantifications was evaluated in PT and compared to previously obtained results in polycythaemia vera (PV) and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Megakaryocyte area, number and volume per mul bone marrow were significantly higher in PT as compared to controls. The nuclear lobe number was significantly increased and the megakaryocytes were shifted towards more mature forms, suggesting a prolonged megakaryocyte generation time. In CML the megakaryocyte number and volume per mul bone marrow were also significantly above normal, but the megakaryocyte area, number of lobes and degree of megakaryocytic maturation were significantly below normal. Platelet production was in PT 6.2 times normal and proportional to the increase in megakaryocyte volume which was 6.8 times normal. In PV with major splenomegaly the mean platelet production rate was higher (9.5 times normal) although their peripheral platelet count was lower than in PT. This discrepancy is explained by the greatly enlarged splenic platelet pool in the PV patients. In ITP the mean platelet production rate was 2.2 to 3 times normal and was significantly lower than in PT and PV.",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1975.tb01087.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

Hypodiploidy not attributable to random losses was found in only 6 patients. Clones identified by rearranged or marker chromosomes were found in all types of leukaemia. Clones marked by a 7q-chromosome, in which the break point was the same, were identified in 1 adult with ALL and 2 children with AML.

The actuarial results on 100 patients show remission and survival curves presenting a plateau between three and five years for a certain percentage, suggesting a possible cure. Several parameters studied in 200 patients indicate that the factors affecting this percentage are age, cytological type, volume of the tumour, and the localization of leukaemic cells in certain areas.

After cultivation in vitro to the blastocyst stage, the embryos were surgically transferred to the uteri of pseudo-pregnant surrogate mothers. Of 15 animals born, one developed a leukemia at 8 weeks of age. When autopsied, this leukemia was found to be of the lymphatic type, as is typical for the M-MuLV-induced disease. In addition, infectious M-MuLV virus was isolated from the serum. Molecular hybridization tests for the presence of M-MuLV-specific sequences were conducted on DNA and RNA extracted from eight different organs. The DNA-DNA reannealing experiments revealed the presence of two classes of M-MuLV-specific sequences in equal concentrations in all tissues tested. The less abundant class of M-MuLV-specific sequences was not detected in tissues from uninfected animals or in non-target tissues of leukemic animals infected at birth. The results are consistent with the working hypothesis that the virus was integrated in all cells of the animal, possibly including the germ line. Fifty to 100 times more M-MuLV-specific RNA was detected in tumor tissues than was found in non-target organs such as liver, brain, and testes. Since all organs contained the same amount of virus-specific DNA, these results indicate that the M-MuLV-specific DNA can be differentially expressed in different tissues.",['10.1073/pnas.72.10.4008 [doi]'],PMC433127,,,,,,,,

The clinical picture, with little in the way of typical features, is thus that of a diffuse meningo-encephalitis. Pseudo-tumoural forms are rare.

Three such derivatives, 7-nitro-, 7-amino-, and 7-hydroxyactinomycin D, were synthesized via new methods which were first tested successfully with a chromophore model system. Of these, 7-nitro- and 7-aminoactinomycin D were assayed for growth inhibitory activity against mammalian cells (CCRF-CEM human lymphoblastic leukemia) in vitro and against the Ridgway osteogenic sarcoma and the L1210, P1534, and P388 murine leukemias in vivo. In these systems, the inhibitory activity of the 7-substituted analogs was comparable to actinomycin D. In two bacterial systems ( (L. casei and L. arabinosus) in vitro, on the other hand, these compounds showed inhibitory profiles which are distinctly different from actinomycin D. These studies demonstrate that substitution at the 7 position, which does not interfere with DNA binding, is capable of yielding experimental antitumor agents with significant activity against a variety of tumors.",['10.1021/jm00246a001 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

A total of 30 consecutive children with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) were treated from June 1971 until December 1974. Remission was induced with the use of vincristine and prednisone. After induction of remission, cranial irradiation and intrathecal methotrexate were given. Then the liver, spleen, and kidney were irradiated and 6-mercaptopurine, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate were administered during the maintenance phase. Pulsed doses of vincristine and prednisone were administered at 10- to 12-week intervals. The patients were subdivided into two groups based on their initial white blood cell (WBC) counts: a standard risk group with an initial WBC count of less than 25 000/mm3 (25 X 10(9)/1) and a high risk group with an initial WBC count greater than 25 000/mm3 (25 X 10(9)/1). Of the 30 children entered in this study one standard risk patient died in the induction phase before attaining remission. Analysis of the results is therefore based on the remaining 29 patients, 22 standard risk and 7 high risk patients, who attained complete remission. Survival rates in continuous remission were found to be 43% of the high risk group, 88% for the standard risk group, and 77% for the combined group. Analysis of the data indicates that this therapy is unsatisfactory in high risk ALL. The results to date of this therapy for standard risk are sufficiently encouraging to continue its use in this subgroup of patients.",['10.1136/adc.50.9.685 [doi]'],PMC1545634,,,,,,,,

The activity in the culture medium was viral rather than erythropoietin-like, since it was sedimentable by high-speed centrifugation and heat labile. Erythroid colonies did not develop when the bone marrow cells exposed to virus-containing medium were from mice genetically resistant to Friend virus. IS culture medium contained both Friend spleen focus-forming and XC-plaque-forming activities. No erythroid colonies were induced when genetically sensitive cells were exposed to a preparation from which the spleen focus-forming activity had been removed, but which contained XC plaque-forming activity in high concentration. Thus the spleen focus-forming component of Friend virus appeared to be responsible for inducing erythroid colony formation without erythropoietin in vitro. Some erythroid colonies were also found in control cultures to which neither virus nor erythropoietin had been added. Reduction in the concentration of fetal calf serum in the culture medium substantially decreased the number of these colonies but had only a minor effect on the number of virus-induced colonies. The number of erythroid colonies produced after 2 days of culture without erythropoietin or fetal calf serum was approximately proportional to the titer of Friend spleen focus-forming virus to whcih the bone marrow cells had been exposed. This system should prove useful for investigation in vitro of Friend virus--host cell interactions which lead to erythropoietin-independent erythropoiesis.",['10.1073/pnas.72.9.3556 [doi]'],PMC433034,,,,,,,,

The stimulation requires the presence of all four nucleoside triphosphates and depends upon an exogenous DNA template. In the absence of the factor, RNA synthesis ceases after 20-30 min, but in the presence of the factor, synthesis continues up to 60-80 min. Addition of the factor at 35 min after incubation causes resumption of RNA synthesis. The factor greatly stimulates the activity of RNA polymerase II at low enzyme concentrations. The RNA polymerase activity is more sensitive to alpha-amanitin inhibition when the factor is present. Experiments of [gamma-32P]ATP incorporation reveal that the factor provides for an increased frequency of initiation of RNA chains, both of the primary initiation events and re-initiation after previous ones were completed. A slightly higher rate of RNA chain growth was also observed with this factor but the ultimate size of RNA synthesized was not affected, as determined by formaldehyde/sucrose gradient centrifugation.

In a patient with both CGL and sickle cell anemia, the 3-way rearrangement involved chromosomes 5, 9, and 22; and he also had a second Philadelphia chromosome and two constitutional variants: pericentric inversion of the other number 9 chromosome and satellite polymorphism in the G group. The karyotype of the leukemic cells was interpreted as: 47,XY,inv(9) (p11q13),t(5;9;22)(q13;q34;q11)+del(22)(q11). In the second patient, the complex translocation in the Ph-positive cells involved chromosomes 3, 9, and 22, resulting in a karyotype interpreted as: 46,XX,t(3;9;22)(p21;q34;q11). Several reports indicate that an abnormality of chromosome 9 is not essential for the development of Ph-positive CGL, but the very high frequency of its involvement (including these unusual translocations) suggests that some type of non-random somatic association may exist between 9q and 22q which makes simultaneous breakage likely.

In four patients chronic granulocytic leukaemia had undergone metamorphosis to an acute phase: in two of these patients no dividing cells were observed in splenic cultures with or without added phytohaemagglutinin: this result may have been attributable to prior cytotoxic therapy.

The overall operative mortality was approximately 7% and the incidence of excessive bleeding which could be related to coagulopathy was 5%. Twenty-one patients with MM or CML underwent splenectomy for palliation of symptoms related to the enlarged spleen or hematologic problems. Eighty-four percent of the latter group were improved. Adverse hematologic effects which could be attributed to splenectomy in these patients were confined to two patients who developed marked thrombocytosis. Among the 23 patients with MM, 9 had portal hypertension. Three underwent portacaval shunt and one a splenorenal shunt for bleeding varices. One of the patients died of hepatic necrosis. Estimated hepatic blood flow determinations (EHBF) in 4 patients with portal hypertension demonstrated a marked absolute increase and an increase in the ratio of EHBF/Cardiac Index. Absence of any evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic obstruction in these patients and the demonstration that splenectomy relieved portal hypertension defined at surgery in 4 patients, suggests that augmented adhepatic flow contributes to portal hypertension in some cases. The review leads to the conclusions that: 1) Operative procedures in prepared patients with myeloproliferative disorders are not associated with prohibitive mortality and morbidity rates. 2) Splenectomy is indicated for patients with increasing transfusion requirements and symptomatic splenomegaly or hypersplenism and should be performed early in the course of disease. 3) When associated portal hypertension and bleeding varices are present, hemodynamic studies should be carried out to define if splenectomy alone, or a portal systemic decompressive procedure is indicated.",['10.1097/00000658-197510000-00012 [doi]'],PMC1344013,,,,,,,,

Three cases were anerythraemic, i.e. no erythroblasts were seen in the blood smears, and three were aleukaemic, i.e. no myeloblasts and/or promyelocytes were found in the blood. The percentage of erythroblasts in the bone marrow smears varied from 34 to 96. In all cases, abnormalities (often megaloblastoid changes) of varying severity were observed in the erythroblasts. Proerythroblasts showing erythrophagocytosis, multinuclearity and vacuolation of the cytoplasm are features of great diagnostic importance. Five patients had myeloblasts or promyelocytes containing Auer rods, six had neutrophilic granulocytes showing pseudo-Pelger-Huet anomaly, and in most cases agranular polymorphonuclears were present. Brief comments are given on the PAS, nuclear arylsulphatase and naphtol-AS-D-chloroacetate-esterase staining methods. Four of five patients studied cytogenetically revealed abnormal stem lines. The survival times after the onset of the disease ranged from 17 days to 20 months. The disease is closely related to myeloblastic leukaemia. In the course of Di Guglielmo's syndrome, the leukaemic component often becomes more conspicuous, so that, in the terminal phase, the disease cannot be distinguished from typical myeloblastic leukaemia. As, in Di Guglielmo's ""leukaemia"", the diagnostic problems are greater than and different from those in typical myeloblastic leukaemia, it is still reasonable to place this disease in a separate group under acute granulocytic leukaemia.",['10.1111/j.0954-6820.1975.tb19524.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

On the contrary, work in cooperative study groups aiming at further therapeutic improvement must continue. All children with leukemia in Switzerland may benefit from the advances offered by such studies if they are initially admitted to one of our centers of pediatric oncology. Further control and follow-up, however, can continue to be carried out on a decentralized basis by practicing pediatricians and hematologists.",,,,,,,,,,

There was no difference in the enzyme activity between controls and relatives of patients with AML. PK activity in patients with ALL during complete remission was higher than during untreated and relapsed stages. These data provided evidence that the altered enzyme activity is acquired rather than genetic. There was a positive correlation between PK activity and red cell creatine levels. The red cell creatine was low in patients with AML but high in patients with CML.

However, two such hybrids (one human, the other hamster) studied 4-6 weeks after fusion, were found to contain several non-mouse chromosomes. RNA extracted from the human marrow x erythroleukemia hybrid annealed equally to both human and mouse globin complementary DNA, indicating that coexpression of the globin genes of each species had occurred in the hybrid cells. Mouse and human mRNA were found to accumulate only after incubation of the cells in 2% dimethylsulfoxide. The chinese hamster x erythroleukemia hybrid appeared to contain a double complement of mouse chromosomes in addition to several chinese hamster chromosomes. After 7 days of incubation in 2% dimethylsulfoxide, [3H]leucine was incorporated into chinese hamster beta-globin and the mouse globin chains.

In most cases there were two platelet populations, one morphologically normal and one morpholigically abnormal. The most salient changes pertained to size (giant forms), shape (the platelets being rounded and probably spheroidal), decrease or absence of the microtubules, and increase in immature elements. A striking feature was the variation in size and shape of the granules, with truly giant forms (up to 2.5 mum) being present. In cytogenetic studies in 14 cases, there was no correlation between the chromosomal changes and the various types of platelet anomalies.",,,,,,,,,,

Measurements were made of leukocyte populations in blood and bone marrow leukemic blastogenic responses of blood lymphoid cells to phytohemmagglutinin and soluble leukemic blast cell membrane antigen. Antibody titers to a soluble leukemic blast-cell membrane-derived antigen were determined. Comparison was made with similar measurements during a second phase of intermittent chemotherapy without BCG inoculation (phase II). Two children showed bone-marrow relapse and two developed central nervous system leukemia during the study. Rises in blood and bone-marrow lymphoid cell numbers were found during both phases of the study. Blastogenic responses to phytohemagglutinin, depressed at the start of the study following at least 12 months of continuous chemotherapy, rose during intermittent chemotherapy and BCG and remained within normal ranges during phase II. Antibody titers and blastogenic responses to leukemia blast-cell membrane antigens increased in eight of twelve and six of seven children respectively during the BCG phase and were maintained during phase II. Only one child showed further increases in phase II.
