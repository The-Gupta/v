Choriocarcinomas (CCs) are of interest in regard to the rate of SPTs because of the potential exposure to carcinogenic therapy and reports of the benefits of its high human gonadotropin (hCG) levels on cancer incidence. METHODS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to identify patients with gestational CC who subsequently developed a SPT. This is a retrospective study, following a cohort of patients during the period 1973-2010. RESULTS: We found 818 patients with primary gestational CC. Nineteen patients had a SPT after the CC. Occurrence of several types of cancer resulted significantly higher when compared to the incidence rate in the general population. In particular the highest incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were registered for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (6.3) and thyroid cancer (2.6). The expected rate of lung, breast, colorectal and uterine corpus cancers instead resulted lower than the rate in the general population. Regarding the IRR in the population under 50 years of age, the higher IRRs were related to AML (20) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (5). CONCLUSION: The association of thyroid cancer and CC has not been described previously. Increases in hematological cancer following CC lend further support to the established data. The decrease in breast and colon cancers in all age groups supports past data and decreases in uterine and lung cancers are new observations meriting further study.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

New acid 1a was synthesized by reaction between (S)-2-amino-3-cyclohexylpropanoic acid and 1,3-dibromopropane, while the esters (1b-1e) derived from this acid were obtained by reaction of the corresponding absolute alcohol, thionyl chloride and synthesized acid. All compounds were characterized by IR, ESI-MS, ((1)H, (13)C and HSQC) NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The cytotoxic activity of all compounds was tested on several tumour cell lines: human (U251) and rat (C6) glioma, human promyelocytic leukaemia (HL-60), human neuroblastoma (SHSY-5Y) and mouse fibrosarcoma (L929) as well as primary rat astrocytes. The present study reveals potent antitumour activity of novel purely organic compounds (1a-1e), which was most pronounced in human glioma (U251) cells. The esterification is required for the novel compounds' cytotoxic action since the n-butyl ester 1e was the most efficient compound. Importantly, n-butyl ester 1e was more toxic to glioma cells in comparison to rat astrocytes, with 24-h IC50 values lower than those for cisplatin. n-Butyl ester 1e induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caused an oxidative-stress-derived accumulation of glioma cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, as well as caspase activation and DNA fragmentation, suggesting that apoptosis induction plays an important role in the novel compounds' antiglioma action.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The results showed that GA could inhibit cell growth and promote differentiation in U937 and HL-60 cells. In addition, GA upregulated the expression of p21waf1/cip1 in the two cell lines. Finally, downregulating the p21waf1/cip1 expression with small interfering RNA partially blocked GA-induced cell growth inhibition and differentiation. These results of this study revealed that GA may be used as one of the investigational drugs for acute myeloid leukemia.",,"['Chen, Yan', 'Hui, Hui', 'Li, Zheng', 'Wang, Hong-Mei', 'You, Qi-Dong', 'Lu, Na']","['Chen Y', 'Hui H', 'Li Z', 'Wang HM', 'You QD', 'Lu N']","['a Department of Physiology , Guiyang Medical University , Guiyang 550004 , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140519,England,J Asian Nat Prod Res,Journal of Asian natural products research,100888334,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Asia, Southeastern', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Garcinia/*chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Molecular Structure', 'Up-Regulation', 'Xanthones/chemistry/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'differentiation', 'gambogic acid', 'growth inhibition', 'p21waf1/cip1']",2014/05/20 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/05/20 06:00'],"['2014/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/10286020.2014.918108 [doi]'],ppublish,J Asian Nat Prod Res. 2014 Oct;16(10):1000-8. doi: 10.1080/10286020.2014.918108.

Imatinib specifically inhibits the tyrosine kinase, c-Abl. However, the mechanism of how Imatinib treatment can lead to increased insulin level is unclear. Specifically, there is little investigation into whether Imatinib directly affects beta cells to promote insulin production. In this study, we showed that Imatinib significantly induced insulin expression in both glucose-stimulated and resting beta cells. In line with this finding, c-Abl knockdown by siRNA and overexpression of c-Abl markedly enhanced and inhibited insulin expression in beta cells, respectively. Unexpectedly, high concentrations of glucose significantly induced c-Abl expression, suggesting c-Abl may play a role in balancing insulin production during glucose stimulation. Further studies demonstrated that c-Abl inhibition did not affect the major insulin gene transcription factor, pancreatic and duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX-1) expression. Of interest, inhibition of c-Abl enhanced NKx2.2 and overexpression of c-Abl in beta cells markedly down-regulated NKx2.2, which is a positive regulator for insulin gene expression. Additionally, we found that c-Abl inhibition significantly enhanced the expression of glucose transporter GLUT2 on beta cells. Our study demonstrates a previously unrecognized mechanism that controls insulin expression through c-Abl-regulated NKx2.2 and GLUT2.

Over the years different protocols have been developed with the aim of improving the outcome. The German study group protocols (GMALL), which are the most frequently used in our institutions, changed significantly between the periods 1989-93 and 1999-2003. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether the change in protocols over the years resulted in an outcome difference at two hospitals in Israel. METHODS: We thoroughly reviewed the records of 153 patients from Sheba Medical Center and Soroka Medical Center, of whom 106 comprised the study group. The patients were divided into two groups according to the treatment protocol used: 40 patients with the 1989/93 protocol and 66 with the 1999/2003 protocol. Outcome was analyzed for the two groups. RESULTS: We found a significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS) between the two groups for B cell-ALL (B-ALL) patients who achieved complete remission after induction. There was no difference in overall survival. We did not find any difference in outcome for T cell-ALL patients or for CD20-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: In our retrospective analysis, GMALL 99/2003 led to a better DFS for B-ALL patients who were in complete remission after induction. This is possibly related to the differences in medications between the protocols but may also be due to better supportive care. Despite the proven advantage of the newer protocols regarding overall survival, in our experience there was no other significant difference between the two regimens.",,"['Apel, Arie', 'Kedmi, Meirav', 'Levi, Etai', 'Berkowicz, Miriam', 'Davidovitz, Yaron', 'Kneller, Abraham', 'Ribakovsky, Elena', 'Shimoni, Avichai', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Avigdor, Abraham']","['Apel A', 'Kedmi M', 'Levi E', 'Berkowicz M', 'Davidovitz Y', 'Kneller A', 'Ribakovsky E', 'Shimoni A', 'Nagler A', 'Avigdor A']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,Israel,Isr Med Assoc J,The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,100930740,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD20/*metabolism', '*Clinical Protocols', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/05/20 06:00,2014/05/31 06:00,['2014/05/20 06:00'],"['2014/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/31 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Isr Med Assoc J. 2014 Apr;16(4):224-8.,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Eighty previously untreated patients who underwent surgical excision of ESCC were included. The expression of Bmi-1 and PAI-1 was examined immunohistochemically in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary tissue specimens. The relationships between the expression of Bmi-1 and PAI-1, the clinicopathologic features of ESCC, and the survival rate of ESCC patients were also discussed. The correlation between Bmi-1 and PAI-1 protein expression in ESCC was analyzed. The relationship between Bmi-1 and PAI-1 expression and ESCC prognosis was evaluated using a Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis. RESULTS: The rates of positive Bmi-1 and PAI-1 expression in ESCC were higher than those in normal esophageal tissue (P < 0.05). The expression of Bmi-1 and PAI-1 was correlated with depth of invasion and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05), but not with patient age, tumor size or nationality (P > 0.05). The expression of Bmi-1 was positively correlated with that of PAI-1 (P < 0.05). The 10-year overall survival rate for all patients was 20% (16/80). Univariate Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with high expression of esophageal PAI-1 and Bmi-1 had lower survival, however, the difference was not statistically significant. Cox multivariate analysis showed that PAI-1 and Bmi-1 were not independent factors for survival rate, while the depth of tumor invasion and metastasis were independent factors affecting patient survival.

Thus, diminishing ROS levels could be also detrimental to cancer cells. We surmise that avoiding ROS generation would be a better option than quenching ROS with antioxidants. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is triggered by the expression of BCR-ABL kinase, whose activity leads to increased ROS production, partly through NADPH oxidases. Here, we assessed NADPH oxidases as therapeutic targets in CML. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We have analyzed the effect of different NADPH oxidase inhibitors, either alone or in combination with BCR-ABL inhibitors, in CML cells and in two different animal models for CML. RESULTS: NADPH oxidase inhibition dramatically impaired the proliferation and viability of BCR-ABL-expressing cells due to the attenuation of BCR-ABL signaling and a pronounced cell-cycle arrest. Moreover, the combination of NADPH oxidase inhibitors with BCR-ABL inhibitors was highly synergistic. Two different animal models underscore the effectiveness of NADPH oxidase inhibitors and their combination with BCR-ABL inhibitors for CML targeting in vivo.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Clinical-grade artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPC) derived from K562 tumor cells were used as irradiated feeders to activate and expand human gammadelta T cells to clinical scale. These cells were tested for proliferation, TCR expression, memory phenotype, cytokine secretion, and tumor killing. RESULTS: gammadelta T-cell proliferation was dependent upon CD137L expression on aAPC and addition of exogenous IL2 and IL21. Propagated gammadelta T cells were polyclonal as they expressed TRDV1, TRDV2-2, TRDV3, TRDV5, TRDV7, and TRDV8 with TRGV2, TRGV3F, TRGV7, TRGV8, TRGV9*A1, TRGV10*A1, and TRGV11 TCR chains. IFNgamma production by Vdelta1, Vdelta2, and Vdelta1(neg)Vdelta2(neg) subsets was inhibited by pan-TCRgammadelta antibody when added to cocultures of polyclonal gammadelta T cells and tumor cell lines. Polyclonal gammadelta T cells killed acute and chronic leukemia, colon, pancreatic, and ovarian cancer cell lines, but not healthy autologous or allogeneic normal B cells. Blocking antibodies demonstrated that polyclonal gammadelta T cells mediated tumor cell lysis through combination of DNAM1, NKG2D, and TCRgammadelta. The adoptive transfer of activated and propagated gammadelta T cells expressing polyclonal versus defined Vdelta TCR chains imparted a hierarchy (polyclonal>Vdelta1>Vdelta1(neg)Vdelta2(neg)>Vdelta2) of survival of mice with ovarian cancer xenografts. CONCLUSIONS: Polyclonal gammadelta T cells can be activated and propagated with clinical-grade aAPCs and demonstrate broad antitumor activities, which will facilitate the implementation of gammadelta T-cell cancer immunotherapies in humans.",['(c)2014 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Deniger, Drew C', 'Maiti, Sourindra N', 'Mi, Tiejuan', 'Switzer, Kirsten C', 'Ramachandran, Vijaya', 'Hurton, Lenka V', 'Ang, Sonny', 'Olivares, Simon', 'Rabinovich, Brian A', 'Huls, M Helen', 'Lee, Dean A', 'Bast, Robert C Jr', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Cooper, Laurence J N']","['Deniger DC', 'Maiti SN', 'Mi T', 'Switzer KC', 'Ramachandran V', 'Hurton LV', 'Ang S', 'Olivares S', 'Rabinovich BA', 'Huls MH', 'Lee DA', 'Bast RC Jr', 'Champlin RE', 'Cooper LJ']","['Departments of Pediatrics, University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Houston, Houston, Texas.', 'Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Cancer Biology.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Houston, Houston, Texas.', 'Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Houston, Houston, Texas.', 'Experimental Therapeutics, and.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center; and.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Houston, Houston, Texas ljncooper@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140515,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/*metabolism/mortality/therapy', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2014/05/17 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/05/17 06:00'],"['2014/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-3451 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-3451 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Nov 15;20(22):5708-19. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-3451.

Delayed B-cell regeneration is found in patients with systemic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and is often accompanied by bone marrow (BM) suppression. Little is known about human BM GVHD. We analyzed the reconstitution kinetics of B-cell subsets in adult leukemic patients within 6 months after allo-HSCT. B-cell deficiency already existed before transplant and was aggravated after transplant. Onset of B-cell reconstitution characterized by transitional B-cell recovery occurred either early (months 2-3) or late (from month 6 on) and correlated highly positively with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction quantified numbers of kappa-deleting recombination excision circles (KRECs). Delayed recovery was associated with systemic acute GVHD and full-intensity conditioning therapy. Histological analysis of BM trephines revealed increased T-cell infiltration in late recovering patients, which was associated with reduced numbers of osteoblasts. Functionally, late recovering patients displayed less pneumococcal polysaccharide-specific immunoglobin M-producing B cells on ex vivo B-cell activation than early recovering patients. Our results provide evidence for acute BM GVHD in allo-HSCT patients with infiltrating donor T cells and osteoblast destruction. This is associated with delayed B-cell reconstitution and impaired antibody response.

Lymphocytosis in cases receiving dasatinib therapy has been shown to be associated with pleural effusion (PE) and better outcome. Although patients who gather lymphocytosis during dasatinib have superior responses, there is only little data about the correlation between PE, response rates, and survival. In order to answer this question, the aim of our study was to determine the frequency of PE and lymphocytosis among our CML patients receiving second-line dasatinib, and to compare the responses and outcomes between patients with or without PE. There were 18 patients (44%) who developed PE, in a total of 41 patients, with a median time of 15 months. Lymphocytosis was observed in nine patients (9/41, 22%) with a median duration of 6.5 months of dasatinib treatment. There were fourteen patients with at least one comorbidity that may play a role in the generation of PE. The cumulative MMR and CCyR rates were greater in PE+ patients (p<0.05). The PFS was significantly higher in PE+ group than PE- patients (p=0.013), also the OS was higher among PE+ patients than PE- group (p=0.042). In patients with a grade I/II PE, and durable responses under dasatinib, performing the management strategies for the recovery of effusion, together with continuing dasatinib can be a reasonable choice mainly in countries where third generation TKIs are not available. But alternative treatment strategies such as nilotinib or third generation TKIs can be chosen in patients with grade III/IV PE especially if the quality of life is severely affected.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We evaluated relations between chemical concentrations in dust and home age with Spearman rank correlation coefficients. RESULTS: Dust concentrations of lead, polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine insecticides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were correlated with home age (rho > 0.2; P < .001), whereas concentrations of pyrethroid insecticides and polybrominated diphenyl ethers were not.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Degranulation assay, reverse transcription PCR, enzyme-lined immunosorbent assays, western blot analyses were performed to measure allergic and proinflammatory mediators in IgE-stimulated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 mast cells treated with or without PAE or gnetin H. RESULTS: Seventeen compounds were isolated, and beta-hexosaminidase release from IgE-stimulated RBL-2H3 mast cells was measured. Of the seventeen isolated compounds, gnetin H, a resveratrol derivative, significantly inhibited beta-hexosaminidase release from RBL-2H3 cells with an IC50 value of 0.3 muM. Notably, Gnetin H reduced beta-hexosaminidase release at lower concentrations than resveratrol. Furthermore, PAE and gnetin H inhibited histamine secretion, decreased the production and mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-4 and suppressed translocation of nuclear factor kappaB. PAE and gnetin H also reduced the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and production of prostaglandin E2. PAE and gnetin H suppressed the phosphorylation of Syk, protein kinase C (PKC)mu, phospholipase Cgamma, and the mitogen-activated protein kinases, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PAE and its active compound gnetin H could be promising therapeutic agents for allergic disorders.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This paper reports on paediatric cancer incidence in Kingston and St Andrew, Jamaica, for the 20-year period 1983-2002 based on these modifications. METHODS: All cases of cancer diagnosed in children (0-14 years), between 1983 and 2002 were extracted from the Jamaica Cancer Registry archives and classified using the International Classification of Childhood Cancer, third edition. Incidence figures were calculated as per the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) reporting format for childhood cancer. RESULTS: There were 272 cases (133 males, 139 females) of childhood cancer identified in the 20-year period. The overall age standardized rate (ASR) was 69.4 per million; that for males was 67.8 per million, and for females, 70.9 per million. The three most common malignancies overall were leukaemia (21.3%), lymphoma (15.8%) and brain and spinal neoplasms (14.0%). In males, the highest ASRs were seen for leukaemia (14.8 per million), lymphoma (12.7 per million), and brain and spinal neoplasms (8.2 per million), and in females, leukaemia (14.4 per million), nephroblastoma (11.3 per million), and brain and spinal neoplasms (10.6 per million). CONCLUSIONS: The rankings of the most common childhood malignancies in Jamaica (leukaemia, brain and spinal neoplasms and lymphomas) have shown few changes since the last review.

Shared cytogenetic anomalies--particularly isochromosome 12p [i(12p)]--have suggested common clonal origins to the tumors. We report the case of a 17-year-old boy presenting with AMKL and a synchronous mediastinal GCT, with the characteristic i(12p) in both neoplasms. The common clonal origin of the AMKL and GCT was further confirmed with massively parallel sequencing, which identified somatic TP53 and PTEN mutations, as well as a rare germline ATM variant.

Therefore, it is an attractive strategy for targeting human cancers. Several HSP90 inhibitors, including AUY922 and STA9090, show promising effects in clinical trials. However, the efficacy of HSP90 inhibitors may be limited by heat shock factor 1 (HSF1)-mediated feedback mechanisms. Here, we identify, through an siRNA screen, that the histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase MLL1 functions as a coactivator of HSF1 in response to HSP90 inhibition. MLL1 is recruited to the promoters of HSF1 target genes and regulates their expression in response to HSP90 inhibition. In addition, a striking combination effect is observed when MLL1 depletion is combined with HSP90 inhibition in various human cancer cell lines and tumor models. Thus, targeting MLL1 may block a HSF1-mediated feedback mechanism induced by HSP90 inhibition and provide a new avenue to enhance HSP90 inhibitor activity in human cancers.","['(c) 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Chen, Yaoyu', 'Chen, Jinyun', 'Yu, Jianjun', 'Yang, Guizhi', 'Temple, Emilia', 'Harbinski, Fred', 'Gao, Hui', 'Wilson, Christopher', 'Pagliarini, Raymond', 'Zhou, Wenlai']","['Chen Y', 'Chen J', 'Yu J', 'Yang G', 'Temple E', 'Harbinski F', 'Gao H', 'Wilson C', 'Pagliarini R', 'Zhou W']","['From the Departments of Oncology.', 'From the Departments of Oncology.', 'the Department of Oncology, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Emeryville, California 94608.', 'From the Departments of Oncology.', 'Developmental and Molecular Pathways, and.', 'Developmental and Molecular Pathways, and.', 'From the Departments of Oncology.', 'Neuroscience, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 and.', 'From the Departments of Oncology.', 'From the Departments of Oncology, wenlai.zhou@novartis.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140515,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Heat Shock Transcription Factors', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoxazoles/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Resorcinols/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Anticancer Drug', 'Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1)', 'Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90)', 'Tumor Cell Biology', 'Tumor Therapy']",2014/05/17 06:00,2014/10/15 06:00,['2014/05/17 06:00'],"['2014/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)40480-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.574053 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Jul 4;289(27):18914-27. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.574053.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo tumor drug targeting delivery of AA13-anchored liposomes on AML cells. AA13 conjugated to the distal end of DSPE-PEG2000-maleimide was incorporated into the liposomes via a postinsertion method. To study the effect of the peptide decoration and density on tumor cell targeting and internalization by AML cells (THP-1 and NB4), stealth liposomes bearing 3% (peptide/S100PC, molar ratio, LL) and 7% (peptide/S100PC, molar ratio, HL) AA13 were prepared, respectively. Higher uptake of LL (1.9- and 2.6-fold) and HL (2.3- and 3.6-fold) targeted liposomes occurred in THP-1 and NB4 cells, respectively, compared to untargeted liposomes. An LDLR inhibitor was used to confirm inhibition of the receptor-mediated cellular association of AA13 modified liposome in both cells. Daunorubicin (DNR) demonstrated a 2.2- and 3.5-fold higher cytotoxicity with the HL formulation and a 1.2- and 2.0-fold higher cytotoxicity with the LL formulation compared to the unmodified liposomal formulation in THP-1 and NB4 cells, respectively. Tumor drug accumulation of DNR-loaded HL was greater than that of the untargeted liposome in the biodistribution assay. The in vivo efficacy study in BALB/c nude mice bearing NB4 xenografts treated with DNR loaded HL also showed more tumor volume inhibition and a longer survival time compared to the untargeted formulation. In conclusion, the AA13-anchored liposomes demonstrated desirable potential as a promising vector for enhanced AML tumor drug targeting.",,"['Liu, Mei', 'Li, Wei', 'Larregieu, Caroline A', 'Cheng, Meng', 'Yan, Bihan', 'Chu, Ting', 'Li, Hui', 'Mao, Sheng-jun']","['Liu M', 'Li W', 'Larregieu CA', 'Cheng M', 'Yan B', 'Chu T', 'Li H', 'Mao SJ']","['Key Laboratory of Drug Targeting and Drug Delivery System, Ministry of Education & West China School of Pharmacy, Sichuan University , No.17, Section 3, Southern Renmin Road, Chengdu 610041, P.

However, the action of H2AX in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells is unknown. The detailed mechanism and epigenetic regulation by H2AX remain elusive in cancer cells. Here, we report that H2AX was involved in apoptosis of CML cells. Overexpression of H2AX increased apoptotic sensitivity of CML cells (K562) induced by imatinib. However, overexpression of Ser139-mutated H2AX (blocking phosphorylation) decreased sensitivity of K562 cells to apoptosis. Similarly, knockdown of H2AX made K562 cells resistant to apoptotic induction. These results revealed that the function of H2AX involved in apoptosis is strictly related to its phosphorylation (Ser139). Our data further indicated that imatinib may stimulate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family member p38, and H2AX phosphorylation followed a similar time course, suggesting a parallel response. H2AX phosphorylation can be blocked by p38 siRNA or its inhibitor. These data demonstrated that H2AX phosphorylation was regulated by p38 MAPK pathway in K562 cells. However, the p38 MAPK downstream, mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1 and -2, which phosphorylated histone H3, were not required for H2AX phosphorylation during apoptosis. Finally, we provided epigenetic evidence that H2AX phosphorylation regulated apoptosis-related gene Bim expression. Blocking of H2AX phosphorylation inhibited Bim gene expression.

NBS1 plays an important role in the cellular response to DSB damage. A rare polymorphic variant of NBS1 that resulted in an isoleucine to valine substitution at amino acid position 171 (I171V) was first identified in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This polymorphic variant is located in the N-terminal region that interacts with other DNA repair factors. In earlier work, we had identified a remarkable number of structural chromosomal aberrations in a patient with pediatric aplastic anemia with a homozygous polymorphic variant of NBS1-I171V; however, it was unclear whether this variant affected DSB repair activity or chromosomal instability. In this report, we demonstrate that NBS1-I171V reduces DSB repair activity through a loss of association with the DNA repair factor MDC1. Furthermore, we found that heterozygosity in this polymorphic variant was associated with breast cancer risk. Finally, we showed that this variant exerted a dominant-negative effect on wild-type NBS1, attenuating DSB repair efficiency and elevating chromosomal instability.

How these phenomenas interact during carcinogenesis remains unclear. We explored this question in a human bronchial epithelial cell-based model of lung carcinogenesis that is mediated by subchronic exposure to arsenic. We found that sustained overexpression of the pro-inflammatory IL6 promoted arsenic-induced cell transformation by inhibiting autophagy. Conversely, strategies to enhance autophagy counteracted the effect of IL6 in the model. These findings were confirmed and extended in a mouse model of arsenic-induced lung cancer. Mechanistic investigations suggested that mTOR inhibition contributed to the activation of autophagy, whereas IL6 overexpression was sufficient to block autophagy by supporting Beclin-1/Mcl-1 interaction. Overall, our findings argued that chronic inflammatory states driven by IL6 could antagonize autophagic states that may help preserve cancer cell survival and promote malignant progression, suggesting a need to uncouple inflammation and autophagy controls to enable tumor progression.",['(c)2014 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Qi, Yuanlin', 'Zhang, Mingfang', 'Li, Hui', 'Frank, Jacqueline A', 'Dai, Lu', 'Liu, Huijuan', 'Zhang, Zhuo', 'Wang, Chi', 'Chen, Gang']","['Qi Y', 'Zhang M', 'Li H', 'Frank JA', 'Dai L', 'Liu H', 'Zhang Z', 'Wang C', 'Chen G']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Molecular & Biomedical Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and."", ""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Molecular & Biomedical Pharmacology, Physiology and Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China."", ""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Molecular & Biomedical Pharmacology."", ""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Molecular & Biomedical Pharmacology."", 'Graduate Center for Toxicology, University of Kentucky College of Medicine;', ""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Molecular & Biomedical Pharmacology."", 'Graduate Center for Toxicology, University of Kentucky College of Medicine;', 'Biostatistics Shared Resource Facility, Markey Cancer Center and Department of Biostatistics, University of Kentucky College of Public Health, Lexington, Kentucky; and Departments of.', ""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Molecular & Biomedical Pharmacology, gangchen6@uky.edu.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140515,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Arsenic/*pharmacology', 'Autophagy/*drug effects/genetics', 'Beclin-1', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism']",,,2014/05/17 06:00,2014/09/27 06:00,['2014/05/17 06:00'],"['2014/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-13-3182 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-3182 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2014 Jul 15;74(14):3740-52. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-3182.

Fifteen such markers have previously been identified for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Validation of these markers is necessary to assess their clinical utility for molecular diagnostics. Substantial efficiencies could be achieved with these DNA methylation markers for disease tracking with potential to replace patient-specific genetic testing. METHODS: We evaluated DNA methylation of promoter regions of TLX3 (T-cell leukemia homeobox) and FOXE3 (forkhead box E3) in bone marrow biopsies from 197 patients classified as leukemic (n = 95) or clear of the disease (n = 102) by MALDI-TOF. Using a single nucleotide extension assay (methylSABER), we tested 10 bone marrow biopsies collected throughout the course of patient chemotherapy. Using reference materials, diagnostic thresholds and limits of detection were characterized for both methods. RESULTS: Reliable detection of DNA methylation of TLX3 and FOXE3 segregated ALL from those clear of disease with minimal false-negative and false-positive results. The limit of detection with MALDI-TOF was 1000-5000 copies of methylated allele. For methylSABER, the limit of detection was 10 copies of methylated TLX3, which enabled monitoring of minimal residual disease in ALL patients. CONCLUSIONS: Mass spectrometry procedures can be used to regionally multiplex and detect rare DNA methylation events, establish DNA methylation loci as clinically applicable biomarkers for disease diagnosis, and track pediatric ALL.",['(c) 2014 The American Association for Clinical Chemistry.'],"['Chatterton, Zac', 'Burke, Daniel', 'Emslie, Kerry R', 'Craig, Jeffery M', 'Ng, Jane', 'Ashley, David M', 'Mechinaud, Francoise', 'Saffery, Richard', 'Wong, Nicholas C']","['Chatterton Z', 'Burke D', 'Emslie KR', 'Craig JM', 'Ng J', 'Ashley DM', 'Mechinaud F', 'Saffery R', 'Wong NC']","['Cancer and Disease Epigenetics and Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; current address: Fishberg Department of Neuroscience and Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY; zac.chatterton@mssm.edu.', 'National Measurement Institute, Sydney, Australia;', 'National Measurement Institute, Sydney, Australia;', ""Developmental Epigenetics, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia;"", 'Cancer and Disease Epigenetics and Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia;', 'Andrew Love Cancer Centre, Deakin University, Victoria, Australia;', ""Children's Cancer Centre, Royal Children's Hospital, Victoria, Australia;"", 'Cancer and Disease Epigenetics and Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia;', 'Cancer and Disease Epigenetics and Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; current address: Ludwig Institute of Cancer Research, Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness Centre, Austin Hospital, Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20140514,England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*DNA Methylation', 'False Negative Reactions', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genetic Markers', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Limit of Detection', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Reference Standards', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",,,2014/05/16 06:00,2014/08/15 06:00,['2014/05/16 06:00'],"['2014/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['clinchem.2013.219956 [pii]', '10.1373/clinchem.2013.219956 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2014 Jul;60(7):995-1003. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2013.219956.

Our data revealed an overall mutation incidence of 15.7%, which increases with age. Correlation with cytogenetic subgroups showed that mutations were most frequent in ALL with low hypodiploidy or MYC-rearrangements. Furthermore, for a large number of patients, both TP53 alleles were altered, either by 2 TP53 mutations (12%) or by a TP53 mutation and a TP53 deletion in the second allele (39%). A high TP53 mutation load was correlated to low hypodiploidy, high hyperdiploidy, and a complex karyotype. Moreover, a higher mutation load was found in B-lineage ALL compared with T-lineage ALL. Similar to other cancers, the median overall survival was significantly shorter in patients with TP53 mutation compared with patients with wild-type TP53.

Here, we demonstrate that circulating trisomy 12 CLL cells also have increased expression of the integrins CD11b, CD18, CD29, and ITGB7, and the adhesion molecule CD323. Notably, there was reduced expression of CD11a, CD11b, and CD18 in trisomy 12 cases with NOTCH1 mutations compared with wild type. Trisomy 12 cells also exhibit upregulation of intracellular integrin signaling molecules CALDAG-GEFI, RAP1B, and Ras-related protein ligand, resulting in enhanced very late antigen-4 [VLA-4] directed adhesion and motility. CD38 expression in CLL has prognostic significance, but the increased CD38 expression in trisomy 12 CLL cells must be taken into account in this subgroup, and the threshold of CD38 positivity should be raised to 40% for this marker to retain its prognostic value.

We evaluated the methods using paired WGS datasets of an extended family prepared using two sequencing platforms and a validated set of variants in NA12878. Using LR or ensemble genotyping based filtering, false-negative rates were significantly reduced by 1.1- to 17.8-fold at the same levels of false discovery rates (5.4% for heterozygous and 4.5% for homozygous single nucleotide variants (SNVs); 30.0% for heterozygous and 18.7% for homozygous insertions; 25.2% for heterozygous and 16.6% for homozygous deletions) compared to the filtering based on genotype quality scores.

However, the current knowledge about the soluble factors that are released during apoptosis is rather limited. Previous studies have shown that S5a and angiocidin (both encoded by PSMD4) induce human acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1 cells) to differentiate into macrophages, but the cell-surface receptor of S5a has not been identified. In this study, we show that apoptotic THP-1 cells release endogenous S5a that binds to death receptor-6 (DR6, also known as TNFRSF1), which was identified as an orphan receptor, to induce THP-1 cells to differentiate. Furthermore, we found that the NF-kappaB pathway is activated, and that the transcription factors WT1 (Wilms' tumor 1) and c-myb mediate S5a-induced THP-1 differentiation.

Native Erwinia chrysanthemi-derived ASNase (n-crisantaspase) has been approved as a second-line drug for treating patients exhibiting allergy syndromes to native and pegylated Escherichia coli-derived ASNase (EC-ASNase). However, it still induces hypersensitivity in at least 17 % of treated patients. In the present study, we investigated the pharmacological activity, immunogenicity and anti-leukemic activity of a new pegylated recombinant crisantaspase (PEG-r-crisantaspase). The results demonstrate that when compared to n-crisantaspase in vivo, PEG-r-crisantaspase maintains a complete depletion of plasma Asn for up to 72 h with a 50-fold lower dose. In mice receiving PEG-r-crisantaspase, specific antibodies against the enzyme were undetectable, indicating a lower immunogenicity of the pegylated enzyme. In vitro, PEG-r-crisantaspase exhibits similar cytotoxic effects (EC50 < 5 x 10(-4) U/mL for the most sensitive cell lines) to n-crisantaspase on various leukemia and lymphoma cells and was shown to be more efficient than EC-ASNase. Three repeated PEG-r-crisantaspase injections (2-20 U/Kg) prevented leukemia development in leukemia-bearing mice for 17 days and significantly prolonged animal survival to 7-12 days. Therefore, PEG-r-crisantaspase appears to be a promising drug candidate for ALL treatment and should be further explored in experimental and clinical trials.",,"['Chien, Wei-Wen', 'Allas, Soraya', 'Rachinel, Nicolas', 'Sahakian, Pierre', 'Julien, Michel', 'Le Beux, Celine', 'Lacroix, Claire-Emmanuelle', 'Abribat, Thierry', 'Salles, Gilles']","['Chien WW', 'Allas S', 'Rachinel N', 'Sahakian P', 'Julien M', 'Le Beux C', 'Lacroix CE', 'Abribat T', 'Salles G']","['Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, UMR 5239, CNRS, ENS, HCL, Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud Equipe du Pr.

The normal functions of these receptors can be compromised by gain-of-function mutations associated with different physiopatological impacts. Whereas KIT D816V/H mutation is a well-characterized oncogenic event and principal cause of systemic mastocytosis, the homologous CSF-1R D802V has not been identified in human cancers. The KIT D816V oncogenic mutation triggers resistance to the RTK inhibitor Imatinib used as first line treatment against chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors. CSF-1R is also sensitive to Imatinib and this sensitivity is altered by mutation D802V. Previous in silico characterization of the D816V mutation in KIT evidenced that the mutation caused a structure reorganization of the juxtamembrane region (JMR) and facilitated its departure from the kinase domain (KD). In this study, we showed that the equivalent CSF-1R D802V mutation does not promote such structural effects on the JMR despite of a reduction on some key H-bonds interactions controlling the JMR binding to the KD. In addition, this mutation disrupts the allosteric communication between two essential regulatory fragments of the receptors, the JMR and the A-loop. Nevertheless, the mutation-induced shift towards an active conformation observed in KIT D816V is not observed in CSF-1R D802V.

The ability of CLL cells to escape apoptosis is highly dependent on their microenvironment. Compared to non-malignant B cells, CLL cells are more responsive to complex stimuli that can be reproduced in vitro by the addition of cytokines. To understand the molecular mechanism of the environment-dependent anti-apoptotic signaling circuitry of CLL cells, we quantified the effect of the SDF-1, BAFF, APRIL, anti-IgM, interleukin-4 (IL4) and secreted CD40L (sCD40L) on the survival of in vitro cultured CLL cells and found IL4 and sCD40L to be most efficient in rescuing CLL cells from apoptosis. In quantitative dose-response experiments using cell survival as readout, the binding affinity of IL4 to its receptor was similar between malignant and non-malignant cells. However, the downstream signaling in terms of the amount of STAT6 and its degree of phosphorylation was highly stimulated in CLL cells. In contrast, the response to sCD40L showed a loss of cooperative binding in CLL cells but displayed a largely increased ligand binding affinity. Although a high-throughput microscopy analysis did not reveal a significant difference in the spatial CD40 receptor organization, the downstream signaling showed an enhanced activation of the NF-kB pathway in the malignant cells. Thus, we propose that the anti-apoptotic phenotype of CLL involves a sensitized response for IL4 dependent STAT6 phosphorylation, and an activation of NF-kB signaling due to an increased affinity of sCD40L to its receptor.",['(c) 2014 UICC.'],"['Bhattacharya, Nupur', 'Reichenzeller, Michaela', 'Caudron-Herger, Maiwen', 'Haebe, Sarah', 'Brady, Nathan', 'Diener, Susanne', 'Nothing, Maria', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Rippe, Karsten', 'Mertens, Daniel']","['Bhattacharya N', 'Reichenzeller M', 'Caudron-Herger M', 'Haebe S', 'Brady N', 'Diener S', 'Nothing M', 'Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Rippe K', 'Mertens D']","['Cooperation Unit, ""Mechanisms of Leukemogenesis"", University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140527,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'CD40 Ligand/*metabolism/physiology', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'STAT6 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['IL4', 'NF-kB', 'apoptosis', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'sCD40L']",2014/05/16 06:00,2014/12/23 06:00,['2014/05/16 06:00'],"['2013/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.28974 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2015 Jan 1;136(1):65-73. doi: 10.1002/ijc.28974.

Moreover, many patients suffer relapses, underscoring the need to develop new molecular targeted B-ALL therapies. Using a mouse model, we show that leukemic B cells require pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR)-independent spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) signaling in vivo for survival and proliferation. In diagnostic samples from human pediatric and adult B-ALL patients, SYK and downstream targets were phosphorylated regardless of pre-BCR expression or genetic subtype. Two small-molecule SYK inhibitors, fostamatinib and BAY61-3606, attenuated the growth of 69 B-ALL samples in vitro, including high-risk (HR) subtypes. Orally administered fostamatinib reduced heavy disease burden after xenotransplantation of HR B-ALL samples into immunodeficient mice and decreased leukemia dissemination into spleen, liver, kidneys, and the CNS of recipient mice. Thus, SYK activation sustains the growth of multiple HR B-ALL subtypes, suggesting that SYK inhibitors may improve outcomes for HR and relapsed B-ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2014, American Association for the Advancement of Science.']","['Perova, Tatiana', 'Grandal, Ildiko', 'Nutter, Lauryl M J', 'Papp, Eniko', 'Matei, Irina R', 'Beyene, Joseph', 'Kowalski, Paul E', 'Hitzler, Johann K', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Guidos, Cynthia J', 'Danska, Jayne S']","['Perova T', 'Grandal I', 'Nutter LM', 'Papp E', 'Matei IR', 'Beyene J', 'Kowalski PE', 'Hitzler JK', 'Minden MD', 'Guidos CJ', 'Danska JS']","['Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1L7, Canada.

Competition may be relevant for cancer, but an experimental link between defects in competition and tumorigenesis is elusive. In the thymus, T lymphocytes develop from precursors that are constantly replaced by bone-marrow-derived progenitors. Here we show that in mice this turnover is regulated by natural cell competition between 'young' bone-marrow-derived and 'old' thymus-resident progenitors that, although genetically identical, execute differential gene expression programs. Disruption of cell competition leads to progenitor self-renewal, upregulation of Hmga1, transformation, and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) resembling the human disease in pathology, genomic lesions, leukaemia-associated transcripts, and activating mutations in Notch1. Hence, cell competition is a tumour suppressor mechanism in the thymus.

Clinical presentation is like other acute leukemia, with extramedullary infiltration of various tissues and organs being a frequent complication. The disease has a fulminant course and poor prognosis. Morphology of PCs in PCL includes a spectrum of maturity, with most cases having lymphoplasmacytoid or plasmablastic morphology. Presentation as more primitive cells that do not resemble PCs is even rarer and requires additional morphological and immunophenotypic studies. We present a case of 79-year-old woman who presented with severe pancytopenia and lobar pneumonia. Laboratory and clinical evaluation revealed primary, nonsecretory PCL with atypical, immature blast morphology, extramedullary renal involvement, and plasmablasts in urine. Despite therapeutic efforts the patient succumbed to the disease. Detection of PCs in the urine indicates extramedullary spread of disease, especially without accompanying hematuria, and may contribute to impairment of renal function, what is already a frequent complication in these patients.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Pavlovic, Antonia', 'Ostojic Kolonic, Slobodanka', 'Radic Kristo, Delfa', 'Jelic Puskaric, Biljana', 'Kardum Skelin, Ika']","['Pavlovic A', 'Ostojic Kolonic S', 'Radic Kristo D', 'Jelic Puskaric B', 'Kardum Skelin I']","['Department of Pathology, Forensic Medicine and Cytology, Clinical Hospital Center Split, Split, Croatia.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20140515,United States,Diagn Cytopathol,Diagnostic cytopathology,8506895,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Urine/*cytology']",['NOTNLM'],"['extramedullary infiltration', 'plasma cell leukemia', 'plasmablasts', 'renal infiltration', 'urine sediment']",2014/05/16 06:00,2015/10/27 06:00,['2014/05/16 06:00'],"['2013/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/dc.23168 [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Cytopathol. 2015 Feb;43(2):158-62. doi: 10.1002/dc.23168.

Drugs for therapy should avoid allergy symptoms, especially for patients with over-expressed H(1)R. Therefore, screening of the components which could induce H(1)R activation is urgently needed for drug safety evaluation. Homoharringtonine injection is a preparation for acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, which is approved by China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) and US Food and Drug Administration. However, severely adverse reactions often occur with intravenous injection of the preparation. In present study, an H(1)R/CMC model was applied for capturing membrane retained components which could induce H(1)R activation. Retention components were enriched and analyzed by H(1)R/CMC-HPLC/MS. Homoharringtonine was recognized, separated and identified in homoharringtonine injection. Ca(2+) flux assay and p-IP3R expression founded that homoharringtonine retained by the H1 R/CMC model increased phosphorylation of IP3R and promoted cytosolic free Ca(2+) elevation in a dose-dependent manner which further verified the activity of homoharringtonine in activating the H1 R. In conclusion, homoharringtonine was screened and identified as a potential allergic factor. This provides an indication that a patient with over-expressed H1 R should be aware of possible allergic reaction when applying homoharringtonine injection.","['Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Guo, Ying', 'Han, Shengli', 'Cao, Jingjing', 'Liu, Qi', 'Zhang, Tao']","['Guo Y', 'Han S', 'Cao J', 'Liu Q', 'Zhang T']","[""School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, 76#, Yantan Westroad, Xi'an, 710061, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140514,England,Biomed Chromatogr,Biomedical chromatography : BMC,8610241,IM,"['Calcium/analysis/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*methods', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Harringtonines/*adverse effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors/analysis/chemistry/metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry/*methods', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Receptors, Histamine H1/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Ca2+ flux', 'cell membrane chromatography', 'herbal medicine injection', 'histamine H1 receptor', 'homoharringtonine']",2014/05/16 06:00,2015/05/12 06:00,['2014/05/16 06:00'],"['2013/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/19 00:00 [revised]', '2014/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/bmc.3188 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Chromatogr. 2014 Dec;28(12):1607-14. doi: 10.1002/bmc.3188.

Of the four HCADs, DFP dose dependently exerted the strongest cytotoxic effect and induction of apoptosis in the U937 cells. In addition, DFP induced distinct morphological changes characteristic of cellular apoptosis, such as chromatin condensation, apoptotic bodies, and DNA fragmentations. The DFP-induced apoptosis was also associated with released cytochrome c in the cytosol with activation of caspase 3, together with the downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins, including XIAP and cIAP2, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1. Finally, the DFP-induced apoptosis was a cell-specific response in leukemia cells, as compared with those of other cancer cells, such as Caki, HT29, SK-Hep1, and MDA-MB231.

To address this, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS), whole-exome sequencing (WES), high-resolution copy-number analysis, and Sanger resequencing of a large cohort of T-PLL. WGS and WES identified novel mutations in recurrently altered genes not previously implicated in T-PLL including EZH2, FBXW10, and CHEK2. Strikingly, WGS and/or WES showed largely mutually exclusive mutations affecting IL2RG, JAK1, JAK3, or STAT5B in 38 of 50 T-PLL genomes (76.0%). Notably, gain-of-function IL2RG mutations are novel and have not been reported in any form of cancer. Further, high-frequency mutations in STAT5B have not been previously reported in T-PLL. Functionally, IL2RG-JAK1-JAK3-STAT5B mutations led to signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) hyperactivation, transformed Ba/F3 cells resulting in cytokine-independent growth, and/or enhanced colony formation in Jurkat T cells. Importantly, primary T-PLL cells exhibited constitutive activation of STAT5, and targeted pharmacologic inhibition of STAT5 with pimozide induced apoptosis in primary T-PLL cells. These results for the first time provide a portrait of the mutational landscape of T-PLL and implicate deregulation of DNA repair and epigenetic modulators as well as high-frequency mutational activation of the IL2RG-JAK1-JAK3-STAT5B axis in the pathogenesis of T-PLL.

In mouse bone marrow transplantation (BMT) models, co-expression of BCR-ABL and Hes1 induces CML-BC-like disease; however, the underlying mechanism remained elusive. Here, based on gene expression analysis, we show that MMP-9 is upregulated by Hes1 in common myeloid progenitors (CMPs). Analysis of promoter activity demonstrated that Hes1 upregulated MMP-9 by activating NF-kappaB. Analysis of 20 samples from CML-BC patients showed that MMP-9 was highly expressed in three, with two exhibiting high levels of HES1 expression. Interestingly, MMP-9 deficiency impaired the cobblestone area-forming ability of CMPs expressing BCR-ABL and Hes1 that were in conjunction with a stromal cell layer. In addition, CMPs expressing BCR-ABL and Hes1 secreted MMP-9, promoting the release of soluble Kit-ligand (sKitL) from stromal cells, thereby enhancing proliferation of the leukemic cells. In accordance, mice transplanted with CMPs expressing BCR-ABL and Hes1 exhibited high levels of sKitL as well as MMP-9 in the serum. Importantly, MMP-9 deficiency impaired the development of CML-BC-like disease induced by BCR-ABL and Hes1 in mouse BMT models. The present results suggest that Hes1 promotes the development of CML-BC, partly through MMP-9 upregulation in leukemic cells.",['(c) 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Nakahara, Fumio', 'Kitaura, Jiro', 'Uchida, Tomoyuki', 'Nishida, Chiemi', 'Togami, Katsuhiro', 'Inoue, Daichi', 'Matsukawa, Toshihiro', 'Kagiyama, Yuki', 'Enomoto, Yutaka', 'Kawabata, Kimihito C', 'Chen-Yi, Lai', 'Komeno, Yukiko', 'Izawa, Kumi', 'Oki, Toshihiko', 'Nagae, Genta', 'Harada, Yuka', 'Harada, Hironori', 'Otsu, Makoto', 'Aburatani, Hiroyuki', 'Heissig, Beate', 'Hattori, Koichi', 'Kitamura, Toshio']","['Nakahara F', 'Kitaura J', 'Uchida T', 'Nishida C', 'Togami K', 'Inoue D', 'Matsukawa T', 'Kagiyama Y', 'Enomoto Y', 'Kawabata KC', 'Chen-Yi L', 'Komeno Y', 'Izawa K', 'Oki T', 'Nagae G', 'Harada Y', 'Harada H', 'Otsu M', 'Aburatani H', 'Heissig B', 'Hattori K', 'Kitamura T']","['Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center.', 'Division of Stem Cell Therapy, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, and.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center.', 'Division of Stem Cell Signaling, Center for Stem Cell Therapy, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Genome Science Division, Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan;', 'International Radiation Information Center and.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan; and.', 'Division of Stem Cell Therapy, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, and.', 'Genome Science Division, Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Department of Stem Cell Dynamics, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, Division of Stem Cell Signaling, Center for Stem Cell Therapy, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140513,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Genetic', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factor HES-1', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2014/05/16 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2014/05/15 06:00'],"['2014/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40081-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-01-476747 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Jun 19;123(25):3932-42. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-01-476747.

In this study, we used NOD/LtSz-scid IL2Rgamma null(c) (NSG) mouse xenotransplantation approaches to elucidate leukemia-initiating cell (LIC) biology in primary adult precursor B (pre-B) ALL to optimize disease modeling. In contrast with xenografting studies of pediatric ALL, we found that modification of the NSG host environment using preconditioning total body irradiation (TBI) was indispensable for efficient engraftment of adult non-t(4;11) pre-B ALL, whereas t(4;11) pre-B ALL was successfully reconstituted without this adaptation. Furthermore, TBI-based xenotransplantation of non-t(4;11) pre-B ALL enabled detection of a high frequency of LICs (<1:6900) and permitted frank leukemic engraftment from a remission sample containing drug-resistant minimal residual disease. Investigation of TBI-sensitive stromal-derived factor-1/chemokine receptor type 4 signaling revealed greater functional dependence of non-t(4;11) pre-B ALL on this niche-based interaction, providing a possible basis for the differential engraftment behavior. Thus, our studies establish the optimal conditions for experimental modeling of human adult pre-B ALL and demonstrate the critical protumorogenic role of microenvironment-derived SDF-1 in regulating adult pre-B LIC activity that may present a therapeutic opportunity.",['(c) 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Patel, Bella', 'Dey, Aditi', 'Castleton, Anna Z', 'Schwab, Claire', 'Samuel, Edward', 'Sivakumaran, Janani', 'Beaton, Brendan', 'Zareian, Nahid', 'Zhang, Christie Yu', 'Rai, Lena', 'Enver, Tariq', 'Moorman, Anthony V', 'Fielding, Adele K']","['Patel B', 'Dey A', 'Castleton AZ', 'Schwab C', 'Samuel E', 'Sivakumaran J', 'Beaton B', 'Zareian N', 'Zhang CY', 'Rai L', 'Enver T', 'Moorman AV', 'Fielding AK']","['University College London, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'University College London, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'University College London, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom.', 'University College London, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'University College London, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'University College London, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'University College London, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'University College London, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'University College London, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'University College London, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom.', 'University College London, London, United Kingdom; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140513,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft Survival', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*physiology']",,,2014/05/16 06:00,2014/08/29 06:00,['2014/05/15 06:00'],"['2014/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40028-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-01-549352 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Jul 3;124(1):96-105. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-01-549352.

Thus, selective killing of ALL cells is possible by targeting this receptor. Here, we have further examined therapeutic targeting of pre-B ALL based on the presence of the BAFF-R. Mouse pre-B ALL cells lacking BAFF-R function had comparable viability and proliferation to wild-type cells, but were more sensitive to drug treatment in vitro. Viability of human pre-B ALL cells was further reduced when antibodies to the BAFF-R were combined with other drugs, even in the presence of stromal protection. This indicates that inhibition of BAFF-R function reduces fitness of stressed pre-B ALL cells. We tested a novel humanized anti-BAFF-R monoclonal antibody optimalized for FcRgammaIII-mediated, antibody-dependent cell killing by effector cells. Antibody binding to human ALL cells was inhibitable, in a dose-dependent manner, by recombinant human BAFF. There was no evidence for internalization of the antibodies. The antibodies significantly stimulated natural killer cell-mediated killing of different human patient-derived ALL cells. Moreover, incubation of such ALL cells with these antibodies stimulated phagocytosis by macrophages. When this was tested in an immunodeficient transplant model, mice that were treated with the antibody had a significantly decreased leukemia burden in bone marrow and spleen. In view of the restricted expression of the BAFF-R on normal cells and the multiple anti-pre-B ALL activities stimulated by this antibody, a further examination of its use for treatment of pre-B ALL is warranted.",['(c)2014 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Parameswaran, Reshmi', 'Lim, Min', 'Fei, Fei', 'Abdel-Azim, Hisham', 'Arutyunyan, Anna', 'Schiffer, Isabelle', 'McLaughlin, Margaret E', 'Gram, Hermann', 'Huet, Heather', 'Groffen, John', 'Heisterkamp, Nora']","['Parameswaran R', 'Lim M', 'Fei F', 'Abdel-Azim H', 'Arutyunyan A', 'Schiffer I', 'McLaughlin ME', 'Gram H', 'Huet H', 'Groffen J', 'Heisterkamp N']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Section of Molecular Carcinogenesis;

Notably, as a single agent, arsenic trioxide did not benefit patients diagnosed with solid tumors. However, when it was combined with other agents, treatment benefit emerged. In this article, we have summarized the outcome of clinical trials that used arsenic trioxide as a single agent as well as in combination settings in patients diagnosed with solid tumors. We have also reviewed possible additional mechanisms by which ATO may be useful as a chemosensitizer in combination therapy. We hope that our review will encourage clinical investigators to rationally combine ATO with additional chemotherapeutic agents in treating patients diagnosed with solid tumors.",,"['Subbarayan, Pochi R', 'Ardalan, Bach']","['Subbarayan PR', 'Ardalan B']","['Department of Medicine, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, 1550 NW 10th Avenue, FOX 431A, Miami, FL, 33136, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,J Gastrointest Cancer,Journal of gastrointestinal cancer,101479627,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Brain Diseases/chemically induced', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Synergism', 'Hedgehog Proteins/physiology', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oxides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thymidylate Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Zinc Finger Protein GLI1']",,,2014/05/16 06:00,2015/04/01 06:00,['2014/05/15 06:00'],"['2014/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12029-014-9617-8 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gastrointest Cancer. 2014 Sep;45(3):363-71. doi: 10.1007/s12029-014-9617-8.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (GLI1 protein, human)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein GLI1)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,"['1UL1TR000460/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'BYNCI 1R21CA117116-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the crosstalk between the proliferative subsets and their milieu could provide clues on CLL biology. We previously identified one of these subpopulations in the peripheral blood from unmutated patients that appears to be a hallmark of a progressive disease. Aiming to characterize the molecular mechanism underlying this proliferative behavior, we performed gene expression analysis comparing the global mRNA and microRNA expression of this leukemic subpopulation, and compared it with their quiescent counterparts. Our results suggest that proliferation of this fraction depend on microRNA-22 overexpression that induces phosphatase and tensin homolog downregulation and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway activation. Transfection experiments demonstrated that miR-22 overexpression in CLL B cells switches on PI3K/AKT, leading to downregulation of p27(-Kip1) and overexpression of Survivin and Ki-67 proteins. We also demonstrated that this pathway could be triggered by microenvironment signals like CD40 ligand/interleukin-4 and, more importantly, that this regulatory loop is also present in lymph nodes from progressive unmutated patients. Altogether, these results underline the key role of PI3K/AKT pathway in the generation of the CLL proliferative pool and provide additional rationale for the usage of PI3K inhibitors.",,"['Palacios, F', 'Abreu, C', 'Prieto, D', 'Morande, P', 'Ruiz, S', 'Fernandez-Calero, T', 'Naya, H', 'Libisch, G', 'Robello, C', 'Landoni, A I', 'Gabus, R', 'Dighiero, G', 'Oppezzo, P']","['Palacios F', 'Abreu C', 'Prieto D', 'Morande P', 'Ruiz S', 'Fernandez-Calero T', 'Naya H', 'Libisch G', 'Robello C', 'Landoni AI', 'Gabus R', 'Dighiero G', 'Oppezzo P']","['1] Recombinant Protein Unit, Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay [2] Immunobiology Department, School of Medicine, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Recombinant Protein Unit, Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Recombinant Protein Unit, Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Recombinant Protein Unit, Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Department of Neurodevelopmental Biology, Instituto de Investigaciones Biologicas Clemente Estable, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Bioinformatics Unit, Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Bioinformatics Unit, Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Molecular Biology Unit, Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Molecular Biology Unit, Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Service of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hospital Maciel, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Service of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hospital Maciel, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Service of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hospital Maciel, Montevideo, Uruguay.', '1] Recombinant Protein Unit, Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay [2] Immunobiology Department, School of Medicine, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140514,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Transcriptome']",,,2014/05/16 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2014/05/15 06:00'],"['2014/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/06 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014158 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.158 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jan;29(1):115-25. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.158.

Cytokines signalling through the common gamma chains such as IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15 are important for T-cell survival but how these cytokines determine the expression of Bcl-2-family proteins is not clear. We report signalling events of cytokines that regulate expression of two key Bcl-2 proteins, pro-apoptotic Bim and anti-apoptotic Mcl-1, in resting C57BL/6 mouse T cells. IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15 inhibited apoptosis but paradoxically induced the expression of Bim, countered by concomitant induction of Mcl-1. Bim induction by IL-15 was found at the mRNA and protein levels and depended on both JAK/STAT and PI3K signals. A new STAT5-binding site was identified in the Bim promoter, which was occupied by STAT5 upon IL-15 stimulation. Although it also depended on JAK/STAT- and PI3K signalling, Mcl-1 regulation was independent of Mcl-1 mRNA levels and of regulation of protein stability, suggesting translational regulation. Concurrent CD3 signals inhibited some of the IL-7 effect but not the IL-15 effect on Bcl-2 proteins. The data suggest that cytokines induce Bim and prime T cells for apoptosis, but also inhibit apoptosis by stabilising Mcl-1. Later downregulation of short-lived Mcl-1 may induce efficient, Bim-dependent apoptosis.","['(c) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The obtained results indicated that BOR treatment reduced cell viability and induced leukemic cell apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner as compared to untreated control cells. While mRNA expression levels of STAT5A, STAT5B, and STAT3 were significantly reduced following BOR treatment when compared to untreated controls, it had no effect upon JAK2 mRNA expression. As for protein levels, STAT expressions were downregulated after BOR treatment especially at 72nd and 96th hours.

Knockdown of HOTAIRM1 in the NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line retarded all-trans retinoid acid (ATRA)-induced granulocytic differentiation, resulting in a significantly larger population of immature and proliferating cells that maintained cell cycle progression from G1 to S phases. Correspondingly, HOTAIRM1 knockdown resulted in retained expression of many otherwise ATRA-suppressed cell cycle and DNA replication genes, and abated ATRA induction of cell surface leukocyte activation, defense response, and other maturation-related genes. Resistance to ATRA-induced cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase transition in knockdown cells was accompanied by retained expression of ITGA4 (CD49d) and decreased induction of ITGAX (CD11c). The coupling of cell cycle progression with temporal dynamics in the expression patterns of these integrin genes suggests a regulated switch to control the transit from the proliferative phase to granulocytic maturation. Furthermore, ITGAX was among a small number of genes showing perturbation in transcript levels upon HOTAIRM1 knockdown even without ATRA treatment, suggesting a direct pathway of regulation.

However, the presence of MLD does not modify the favorable prognostic impact of NPM1 mutation. The prognosis of patients with AML presenting marked dysplasia lacking high-risk cytogenetics and NPM1 mutation is uncertain. We evaluated the prognostic impact of MLD in 177 patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics AML (IR-AML) and wild-type NPM1. Patients were categorized as MLD-WHO (WHO myelodysplasia criteria; n = 43, 24 %), MLD-NRW (significant MLD non-reaching WHO criteria; n = 16, 9 %), absent MLD (n = 80, 45 %), or non-evaluable MLD (n = 38, 22 %). No differences concerning the main characteristics were observed between patients with or without MLD. Outcome of patients with MLD-WHO and MLD-NRW was similar, and significantly worse than patients lacking MLD. The presence of MLD (66 vs. 80 %, p = 0.03; HR, 95 % CI = 2.3, 1.08-4.08) and higher leukocyte count at diagnosis was the only variable associated with lower probability of complete remission after frontline therapy. Concerning survival, age and leukocytes showed an independent prognostic value, whereas MLD showed a trend to a negative impact (p = 0.087, HR, 95 % CI = 1.426, 0.95-2.142).

Despite being available for 60 years, several aspects of 6MP drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics in humans are unknown. Molybdoflavoenzymes such as aldehyde oxidase (AO) and xanthine oxidase (XO) have previously been implicated in the metabolism of this drug. In this study, we investigated the in vitro metabolism of 6MP to 6-thiouric acid (6TUA) in pooled human liver cytosol. We discovered that 6MP is metabolized to 6TUA through sequential metabolism via the 6-thioxanthine (6TX) intermediate. The role of human AO and XO in the metabolism of 6MP was established using the specific inhibitors raloxifene and febuxostat. Both AO and XO were involved in the metabolism of the 6TX intermediate, whereas only XO was responsible for the conversion of 6TX to 6TUA. These findings were further confirmed using purified human AO and Escherichia coli lysate containing expressed recombinant human XO. Xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), which belongs to the family of xanthine oxidoreductases and preferentially reduces nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)), was shown to contribute to the overall production of the 6TX intermediate as well as the final product 6TUA in the presence of NAD(+) in human liver cytosol. In conclusion, we present evidence that three enzymes, AO, XO, and XDH, contribute to the production of 6TX intermediate, whereas only XO and XDH are involved in the conversion of 6TX to 6TUA in pooled HLC.","['Copyright (c) 2014 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']","['Choughule, Kanika V', 'Barnaba, Carlo', 'Joswig-Jones, Carolyn A', 'Jones, Jeffrey P']","['Choughule KV', 'Barnaba C', 'Joswig-Jones CA', 'Jones JP']","['Department of Chemistry, Washington State University, Pullman, Washington.', 'Department of Chemistry, Washington State University, Pullman, Washington.', 'Department of Chemistry, Washington State University, Pullman, Washington.', 'Department of Chemistry, Washington State University, Pullman, Washington jpj@wsu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140513,United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aldehyde Oxidase/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/enzymology/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liver/*enzymology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*metabolism', 'Metabolic Detoxication, Phase I/*physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Uric Acid/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Xanthine Dehydrogenase/*metabolism', 'Xanthine Oxidase/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/05/16 06:00,2015/02/11 06:00,['2014/05/15 06:00'],"['2014/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['dmd.114.058107 [pii]', '10.1124/dmd.114.058107 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 2014 Aug;42(8):1334-40. doi: 10.1124/dmd.114.058107.

None of the patients less than 3 years of age developed fungal infections, whereas 64% of the adolescents did (P=0.01). Blood-borne infections were the most common site of infection (44%). Eighty-four percent of infections occurred in neutropenic patients. The mortality rate in the overall cohort was 28%. Patients with fungal infections had increased mortality rate of 55%. Overall candidiasis and aspergillosis were the major pathogens (28% each), although there have been no occurrences of Aspergillus sp. since 2005.

METHOD: A total of 268 newly diagnosed children with ALL enrolled in CCLG-2008 from January, 2010 to August, 2012 were analyzed. Patients received either native Escherichia coli asparaginase or pegaspargase along with multiagent chemotherapy during remission induction treatment. Status of bone marrow aspiration was assessed on day 15, day 33 (M1, M2, M3). RESULT: Of the 268 patients stratified, 37.3% (n = 100) were SR, 32.1% (n = 86) were IR, and 31.6% (n = 82) were HR; 159 patients received native Escherichia coli asparaginase and 109 patients received pegaspargase. Characteristics of two groups in age, sex, blood count at diagnosis, immunophenotype and response to prednisolone had no significant difference (P > 0.05).

The Bcl-2 family of pro- and antiapoptotic proteins stands at the crossroads of cellular survival and death, and the expression of and interactions between these proteins determine tumor cell fate. Malignant cells, which are often primed for apoptosis, are particularly vulnerable to the simultaneous disruption of cooperative survival signaling pathways. Indeed, the single agent activity of agents such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors in AML has been modest. Much work in recent years has focused on strategies to enhance the therapeutic potential of the bona fide BH3-mimetic, ABT-737, which inhibits B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-xL. Most of these strategies target Mcl-1, an antiapoptotic protein not inhibited by ABT-737. The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathways are central to the growth, proliferation, and survival of AML cells, and there is much interest currently in pharmacologically interrupting these pathways. Dual inhibitors of PI3K and mTOR overcome some intrinsic disadvantages of rapamycin and its derivatives, which selectively inhibit mTOR.

We showed recently that mammary cancer development in a transgenic mouse model (mouse mammary tumor virus-neu; MMTV-neu) was inhibited significantly upon treatment with withaferin A (WA), a steroidal lactone derived from a medicinal plant. Herein, we demonstrate that the mammary cancer prevention by WA is accompanied by in vivo suppression of breast cancer stem cells (bCSC). In vitro mammosphere formation was dose-dependently inhibited by WA treatment in MCF-7 and SUM159 human breast cancer cells. Other markers of bCSC, including aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) activity and CD44(high)/CD24(low)/epithelial-specific antigen-positive (ESA+) fraction, were also decreased significantly in the presence of plasma achievable doses of WA. However, WA exposure resulted in cell line-specific changes in Oct4, SOX-2, and Nanog mRNA expression. WA administration to MMTV-neu mice (0.1 mg/mouse, 3 times/week for 28 weeks) resulted in inhibition of mammosphere number and ALDH1 activity in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that although urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor overexpression conferred partial protection against bCSC inhibition by WA, Notch4 was largely dispensable for this response. WA treatment also resulted in sustained (MCF-7) or transient (SUM159) downregulation of Bmi-1 (B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region-1) protein. Ectopic expression of Bmi-1 conferred partial but significant protection against ALDH1 activity inhibition by WA. Interestingly, WA treatment caused induction of Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and its knockdown augmented bCSC inhibition by WA. In conclusion, this study shows in vivo effectiveness of WA against bCSC.",['(c)2014 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Kim, Su-Hyeong', 'Singh, Shivendra V']","['Kim SH', 'Singh SV']","[""Authors' Affiliation: Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."", ""Authors' Affiliation: Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania singhs@upmc.edu.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140513,United States,Cancer Prev Res (Phila),"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",101479409,IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, Notch4', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Withanolides/*therapeutic use']",,,2014/05/16 06:00,2015/02/14 06:00,['2014/05/15 06:00'],"['2014/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1940-6207.CAPR-13-0445 [pii]', '10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-13-0445 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Prev Res (Phila). 2014 Jul;7(7):738-47. doi: 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-13-0445.

But, when self-antigen is recognized instead, mechanisms of peripheral tolerance prevent acquisition of effector function to avoid autoimmunity. These distinct responses are influenced by inflammatory and regulatory clues from the tissue environment, but the mechanism(s) by which naive T cells interpret these signals to generate the appropriate immune response are unclear. The identification of the molecules operative in these cell-fate decisions is crucial for developing new treatment options for patients with cancer or autoimmunity, where manipulation of T cell activity is desired to alter the course of disease. With the use of an in vivo murine model to examine CD8(+) T cell responses to healthy self-tissue, we correlated self-tolerance with a failure to induce the T-box transcription factors T-bet and Eomes. However, inflammation associated with acute microbial infection induced T-bet and Eomes expression and promoted effector differentiation of self-reactive T cells under conditions that normally favor tolerance. In the context of a Listeria infection, these functional responses relied on elevated T-bet expression, independent of Eomes. Alternatively, infection with LCMV induced higher Eomes expression, which was sufficient in the absence of T-bet to promote effector cytokine production. Our results place T-box transcription factors at a molecular crossroads between CD8(+) T cell anergy and effector function upon recognition of peripheral self-antigen, and suggest that inflammation during T cell priming directs these distinct cellular responses.",['(c) 2014 Society for Leukocyte Biology.'],"['Jackson, Stephanie R', 'Yuan, Jinyun', 'Berrien-Elliott, Melissa M', 'Chen, Collin L', 'Meyer, Jennifer M', 'Donlin, Maureen J', 'Teague, Ryan M']","['Jackson SR', 'Yuan J', 'Berrien-Elliott MM', 'Chen CL', 'Meyer JM', 'Donlin MJ', 'Teague RM']","['Departments of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology and.', 'Departments of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology and.', 'Departments of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology and.', 'Departments of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology and.', 'Departments of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology and.', 'Departments of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology and Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, St. Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA; and.', 'Departments of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology and St. Louis University Cancer Center, St. Louis, Missouri, USA rteague@slu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140513,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,IM,"['Animals', 'Autoantigens/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clonal Anergy/immunology', 'Clonal Deletion/*immunology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Genes, RAG-1', 'Immunization', 'Inflammation/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology/therapy', 'Listeria/immunology', 'Listeriosis/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Self Tolerance/*immunology', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Box Domain Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['effector differentiation/immunity', 'immunotherapy', 'transcription factors']",2014/05/16 06:00,2015/01/15 06:00,['2014/05/15 06:00'],"['2014/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jlb.1A0913-500RR [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.1A0913-500RR [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2014 Sep;96(3):397-410. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1A0913-500RR.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since June 1999, children with newly diagnosed ALL have been treated with triple intrathecal therapy (TIT) alone without CrRT. The first TIT was delayed until the disappearance of blasts from peripheral blood (PB) for up to 10 days of multidrug induction, and CrRT was omitted in all patients. If PB blasts persisted on treatment day 10 (d10), the TIT was then performed. RESULTS: Of a total of 156 patients, 152 were eligible. Seventeen patients did not have PB blasts at diagnosis. Three fourths of the remaining patients achieved complete clearance of PB blasts by d10. Only hyperleukocytosis at diagnosis showed a significantly lower clearance rate. Six standard-risk patients were upgraded to high risk because of detectable PB blasts on d10. TLPs were encountered in four patients (2.6%), but none were contaminated with lymphoblasts. Neither CNS-2 (less than 5 WBCs/muL with blasts in a nontraumatic sample) nor CNS-3 (>/=5 WBCs/muL with blasts in a nontraumatic sample or the presence of cranial nerve palsy) was present. The 5-year event-free survival and overall survival rates+/-SE were 84.2%+/-3.0% and 90.6%+/-2.4%, respectively. No isolated CNS relapse occurred, but two patients experienced combined CNS relapses. The 7-year cumulative risk of any CNS relapse was 1.4%+/-1.0%. CONCLUSION: Delaying first TIT until circulating blasts have cleared may improve CNS control in children with newly diagnosed ALL and preclude the need for CrRT.",['(c) 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Liu, Hsi-Che', 'Yeh, Ting-Chi', 'Hou, Jen-Yin', 'Chen, Kuan-Hao', 'Huang, Ting-Huan', 'Chang, Ching-Yi', 'Liang, Der-Cherng']","['Liu HC', 'Yeh TC', 'Hou JY', 'Chen KH', 'Huang TH', 'Chang CY', 'Liang DC']","['Hsi-Che Liu, Ting-Chi Yeh, Jen-Yin Hou, and Der-Cherng Liang, Mackay Medical College, New Taipei; and Hsi-Che Liu, Ting-Chi Yeh, Jen-Yin Hou, Kuan-Hao Chen, Ting-Huan Huang, Ching-Yi Chang, and Der-Cherng Liang, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Hsi-Che Liu, Ting-Chi Yeh, Jen-Yin Hou, and Der-Cherng Liang, Mackay Medical College, New Taipei; and Hsi-Che Liu, Ting-Chi Yeh, Jen-Yin Hou, Kuan-Hao Chen, Ting-Huan Huang, Ching-Yi Chang, and Der-Cherng Liang, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Hsi-Che Liu, Ting-Chi Yeh, Jen-Yin Hou, and Der-Cherng Liang, Mackay Medical College, New Taipei; and Hsi-Che Liu, Ting-Chi Yeh, Jen-Yin Hou, Kuan-Hao Chen, Ting-Huan Huang, Ching-Yi Chang, and Der-Cherng Liang, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Hsi-Che Liu, Ting-Chi Yeh, Jen-Yin Hou, and Der-Cherng Liang, Mackay Medical College, New Taipei; and Hsi-Che Liu, Ting-Chi Yeh, Jen-Yin Hou, Kuan-Hao Chen, Ting-Huan Huang, Ching-Yi Chang, and Der-Cherng Liang, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Hsi-Che Liu, Ting-Chi Yeh, Jen-Yin Hou, and Der-Cherng Liang, Mackay Medical College, New Taipei; and Hsi-Che Liu, Ting-Chi Yeh, Jen-Yin Hou, Kuan-Hao Chen, Ting-Huan Huang, Ching-Yi Chang, and Der-Cherng Liang, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Hsi-Che Liu, Ting-Chi Yeh, Jen-Yin Hou, and Der-Cherng Liang, Mackay Medical College, New Taipei; and Hsi-Che Liu, Ting-Chi Yeh, Jen-Yin Hou, Kuan-Hao Chen, Ting-Huan Huang, Ching-Yi Chang, and Der-Cherng Liang, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Hsi-Che Liu, Ting-Chi Yeh, Jen-Yin Hou, and Der-Cherng Liang, Mackay Medical College, New Taipei; and Hsi-Che Liu, Ting-Chi Yeh, Jen-Yin Hou, Kuan-Hao Chen, Ting-Huan Huang, Ching-Yi Chang, and Der-Cherng Liang, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. dcliang@ms1.mmh.org.tw.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140512,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/05/14 06:00,2014/10/07 06:00,['2014/05/14 06:00'],"['2014/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2013.54.5020 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2013.54.5020 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2014 Jun 10;32(17):1825-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2013.54.5020.

These molecules are required for terminal differentiation of B cells into plasma cells and expressed at high levels in plasma cell-derived multiple myeloma. Although these molecules have no known role at early stages of B-cell development, here we show that their expression transiently peaks at the pre-B-cell receptor checkpoint. Inducible, Cre-mediated deletion of Hspa5, Prdm1, and Xbp1 consistently induces cellular stress and cell death in normal pre-B cells and in pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) driven by BCR-ABL1- and NRAS(G12D) oncogenes. Mechanistically, expression and activity of the UPR downstream effector XBP1 is regulated positively by STAT5 and negatively by the B-cell-specific transcriptional repressors BACH2 and BCL6. In two clinical trials for children and adults with ALL, high XBP1 mRNA levels at the time of diagnosis predicted poor outcome. A small molecule inhibitor of ERN1-mediated XBP1 activation induced selective cell death of patient-derived pre-B ALL cells in vitro and significantly prolonged survival of transplant recipient mice in vivo. Collectively, these studies reveal that pre-B ALL cells are uniquely vulnerable to ER stress and identify the UPR pathway and its downstream effector XBP1 as novel therapeutic targets to overcome drug resistance in pre-B ALL.",,"['Kharabi Masouleh, Behzad', 'Geng, Huimin', 'Hurtz, Christian', 'Chan, Lai N', 'Logan, Aaron C', 'Chang, Mi Sook', 'Huang, Chuanxin', 'Swaminathan, Srividya', 'Sun, Haibo', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Melnick, Ari M', 'Koeffler, Phillip', 'Muschen, Markus']","['Kharabi Masouleh B', 'Geng H', 'Hurtz C', 'Chan LN', 'Logan AC', 'Chang MS', 'Huang C', 'Swaminathan S', 'Sun H', 'Paietta E', 'Melnick AM', 'Koeffler P', 'Muschen M']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine andDepartment of Oncology, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Rheinisch-Westfaelische Technische Hochschule Aachen University Medical School, 52070 Aachen, Germany;', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143;', ""Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027;"", 'Departments of Medicine andPharmacology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065;', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and.', 'Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048; and.', 'Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10466.', 'Departments of Medicine andPharmacology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065;', 'Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048; and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and markus.muschen@ucsf.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140512,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Child', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/*drug effects/physiology', 'Endoribonucleases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Mice', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Unfolded Protein Response/*drug effects/physiology', 'X-Box Binding Protein 1', 'beta-Galactosidase']",,,2014/05/14 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2014/05/14 06:00'],"['2014/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1400958111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1400958111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 May 27;111(21):E2219-28. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1400958111.

The molecular interaction between PLZF-RARalpha and the histone deacetylase corepressor was proposed to be important in leukemogenesis. We found that PLZF-RARalpha can repress transcription of the p21WAF/CDKN1A gene, which encodes the negative cell cycle regulator p21 by binding to its proximal promoter Sp1-binding GC-boxes 3, 4, 5/6, a retinoic acid response element (RARE), and distal p53-responsive elements (p53REs). PLZF-RARalpha also acts as a competitive transcriptional repressor of p53, RARalpha, and Sp1. PLZF-RARalpha interacts with co-repressors such as mSin3A, NCoR, and SMRT, thereby deacetylating histones Ac-H3 and Ac-H4 at the CDKN1A promoter. PLZF-RARalpha also interacts with the MBD3-NuRD complex, leading to epigenetic silencing of CDKN1A through DNA methylation. Furthermore, PLZF-RARalpha represses TP53 and increases p53 protein degradation by ubiquitination, further repressing p21 expression. Resultantly, PLZF-RARalpha promotes cell proliferation and significantly increases the number of cells in S-phase.","['(c) 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Choi, Won-Il', 'Yoon, Jae-Hyeon', 'Kim, Min-Young', 'Koh, Dong-In', 'Licht, Jonathan D', 'Kim, Kunhong', 'Hur, Man-Wook']","['Choi WI', 'Yoon JH', 'Kim MY', 'Koh DI', 'Licht JD', 'Kim K', 'Hur MW']","['From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Brain Korea 21 Plus Project for Medical Science, Severance Biomedical Science Institute, Yonsei University School of Medicine, 50 Yonsei-Ro, SeoDaeMoon-Gu, Seoul 120-752, Korea and.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Brain Korea 21 Plus Project for Medical Science, Severance Biomedical Science Institute, Yonsei University School of Medicine, 50 Yonsei-Ro, SeoDaeMoon-Gu, Seoul 120-752, Korea and.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Brain Korea 21 Plus Project for Medical Science, Severance Biomedical Science Institute, Yonsei University School of Medicine, 50 Yonsei-Ro, SeoDaeMoon-Gu, Seoul 120-752, Korea and.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Brain Korea 21 Plus Project for Medical Science, Severance Biomedical Science Institute, Yonsei University School of Medicine, 50 Yonsei-Ro, SeoDaeMoon-Gu, Seoul 120-752, Korea and.', 'the Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 60611.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Brain Korea 21 Plus Project for Medical Science, Severance Biomedical Science Institute, Yonsei University School of Medicine, 50 Yonsei-Ro, SeoDaeMoon-Gu, Seoul 120-752, Korea and.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Brain Korea 21 Plus Project for Medical Science, Severance Biomedical Science Institute, Yonsei University School of Medicine, 50 Yonsei-Ro, SeoDaeMoon-Gu, Seoul 120-752, Korea and mwhur2@yuhs.ac.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140512,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/deficiency/*genetics', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mi-2 Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase Complex/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Stability', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'S Phase', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia', 'Oncogene', 'PLZF-RAR', 'Transcription Regulation', 'Transcription Repressor', 'p21WAF/CDKN1A', 'p53']",2014/05/14 06:00,2014/10/15 06:00,['2014/05/14 06:00'],"['2014/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)40457-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M113.538777 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Jul 4;289(27):18641-56. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M113.538777.

PLZF is aberrantly overexpressed in various human solid tumors, such as clear cell renal carcinoma, glioblastoma, and seminoma. PLZF causes cellular transformation of NIH3T3 cells and increases cell proliferation in several cell types. PLZF also increases tumor growth in the mouse xenograft tumor model. PLZF may stimulate cell proliferation by controlling expression of the genes of the p53 pathway (ARF, TP53, and CDKN1A). We found that PLZF can directly repress transcription of CDKN1A encoding p21, a negative regulator of cell cycle progression. PLZF binds to the proximal Sp1-binding GC-box 5/6 and the distal p53-responsive elements of the CDKN1A promoter to repress transcription. Interestingly, PLZF interacts with Sp1 or p53 and competes with Sp1 or p53. PLZF interacts with corepressors, such as mSin3A, NCoR, and SMRT, thereby deacetylates Ac-H3 and Ac-H4 histones at the CDKN1A promoter, which indicated the involvement of the corepressor.HDACs complex in transcription repression by PLZF. Also, PLZF represses transcription of TP53 and also decreases p53 protein stability by ubiquitination. PLZF may act as a potential proto-oncoprotein in various cell types.","['(c) 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Choi, Won-Il', 'Kim, Min-Young', 'Jeon, Bu-Nam', 'Koh, Dong-In', 'Yun, Chae-Ok', 'Li, Yan', 'Lee, Choong-Eun', 'Oh, Jiyoung', 'Kim, Kunhong', 'Hur, Man-Wook']","['Choi WI', 'Kim MY', 'Jeon BN', 'Koh DI', 'Yun CO', 'Li Y', 'Lee CE', 'Oh J', 'Kim K', 'Hur MW']","['From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Brain Korea 21 Plus Project for Medical Science, Severance Biomedical Research Institute, Yonsei University School of Medicine, 50 Yonsei-Ro, SeoDaeMoon-Gu, Seoul 120-752.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Brain Korea 21 Plus Project for Medical Science, Severance Biomedical Research Institute, Yonsei University School of Medicine, 50 Yonsei-Ro, SeoDaeMoon-Gu, Seoul 120-752.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Brain Korea 21 Plus Project for Medical Science, Severance Biomedical Research Institute, Yonsei University School of Medicine, 50 Yonsei-Ro, SeoDaeMoon-Gu, Seoul 120-752.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Brain Korea 21 Plus Project for Medical Science, Severance Biomedical Research Institute, Yonsei University School of Medicine, 50 Yonsei-Ro, SeoDaeMoon-Gu, Seoul 120-752.', 'the Department of Bioengineering, College of Engineering, Hanyang University, 222 Wangsimni-Ro, Seongdong-Gu, Seoul 133-791, and.', 'the Department of Bioengineering, College of Engineering, Hanyang University, 222 Wangsimni-Ro, Seongdong-Gu, Seoul 133-791, and.', 'the Department of Biological Science, Sungkyunkwan University, 300 Cheon-Cheon Dong, Suwon 440-746, Korea.', 'the Department of Biological Science, Sungkyunkwan University, 300 Cheon-Cheon Dong, Suwon 440-746, Korea.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Brain Korea 21 Plus Project for Medical Science, Severance Biomedical Research Institute, Yonsei University School of Medicine, 50 Yonsei-Ro, SeoDaeMoon-Gu, Seoul 120-752.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Brain Korea 21 Plus Project for Medical Science, Severance Biomedical Research Institute, Yonsei University School of Medicine, 50 Yonsei-Ro, SeoDaeMoon-Gu, Seoul 120-752, mwhur2@yuhs.ac.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140512,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Repressor Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cell Cycle', 'PLZF', 'Specificity Protein 1 (Sp1)', 'Transcription Regulation', 'Transcription Repressor', 'p21WAF/CDKN1A', 'p53']",2014/05/14 06:00,2014/10/15 06:00,['2014/05/14 06:00'],"['2014/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)40456-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M113.538751 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Jul 4;289(27):18625-40. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M113.538751.

However, the risk of extravasation is a significant deterrent, and adoption of this practice has been variable and only hesitantly accepted in the clinical setting. PURPOSE: We carried out a study with the aims of establishing the incidence of reported extravasation of vincristine administration to paediatric and adult patients in mini-bags; here we describe motivating factors and barriers faced by clinical staff. The secondary aim was to support the need for change and implementation of the international recommendations. METHODS: Chemotherapy-certified nurses completed a survey spanning August 2009 to August 2011, to ascertain the incidence of extravasation associated with the administration of vincristine in mini-bags. RESULTS: This period captured 421 occasions of vincristine administration in 25-ml or 50-ml mini-bags (in 0.9% sodium chloride). The median age of patients was 13 years (range 2.5 months to 99 years). Vincristine was administered through peripheral lines (26.4%), portacath (52.0%), PICC line (15.9%) and Hickman line (5.7%). The majority of infusions were over at least 10 minutes (50.1%). There were no cases of extravasation reported. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of vincristine in small volume intravenous bags was safe, practical, and feasible in all patient groups. The successful implementation of the international recommendations for vincristine administration in mini-bags to eliminate potential inadvertent intrathecal administration was dependent on stakeholder buy-in.",['(c) The Author(s) 2014.'],"['Nurgat, Z A', 'Smythe, M', 'Al-Jedai, A', 'Ewing, S', 'Rasheed, W', 'Belgaumi, A', 'Ahmed, S O', 'Ashour, M', 'Al Agil, A', 'Siddiqui, K', 'Aljurf, M']","['Nurgat ZA', 'Smythe M', 'Al-Jedai A', 'Ewing S', 'Rasheed W', 'Belgaumi A', 'Ahmed SO', 'Ashour M', 'Al Agil A', 'Siddiqui K', 'Aljurf M']","['Pharmaceutical Care Division, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Adult Leukemia Unit, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia znurgat@kfshrc.edu.sa.', 'Department of Nursing Quality, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Pharmaceutical Care Division, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Adult Leukemia Unit, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Department of Nursing, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Adult Leukemia Unit, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Pediatric Leukemia Unit, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Adult Leukemia Unit, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Pharmaceutical Care Division, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Pediatric Leukemia Unit, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Pharmaceutical Care Division, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Pediatric Leukemia Unit, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Pediatric Leukemia Unit, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Adult Leukemia Unit, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140512,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Drug Packaging', 'Extravasation of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Materials/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Medication Errors/prevention & control', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Vincristine mini-bags', 'extravasation', 'intrathecal administration', 'motivations']",2014/05/14 06:00,2016/05/20 06:00,['2014/05/14 06:00'],"['2014/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1078155214531803 [pii]', '10.1177/1078155214531803 [doi]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2015 Oct;21(5):339-47. doi: 10.1177/1078155214531803.

We report in this study, the first data from the NCR for Khartoum State for the period 2009-2010. The NCR staff used passive and active approaches to collect data on cancer diagnosed by all means in Khartoum State. Rates were age standardized to the 2010 Sudan Standard Population and 1966 and 2000 World Standard Population and expressed per 100,000 populations. During 2009-2010, 6771 new cancer cases were registered. Of those, 3646 (53.8%) cases were in women and 3125 (46.2%) were in men. The most commonly diagnosed cancer among women was breast followed by leukemia, cervix, and ovary, and among men it was prostate cancer followed by leukemia, lymphoma, oral, colorectal, and liver. In children less than 15 years of age, leukemia was the most common cancer followed lymphoma, and cancer of the eye, bone, kidney, and the brain. The overall age-standardized rate (ASR) per 100,000 population was higher in women (124.3) than in men (90.8) using 2010 Sudan Standard Population. Similarly, it was higher in women (188.6 and 206.3 per 100,000 population) than in men (145.4 and 160.0 per 100,000 population) using 1966 and 2000 World Standard Population, respectively. The data from NCR indicated that prostate and breast as the most commonly diagnosed cancer sites in men and women in Khartoum, while cancer of the cervix trailed behind portraying a cancer picture similar to that of the developed world.

The immunosuppressant effect of ciclosporin on the ability of cats to mount an immune response following vaccination was determined. Thirty-two healthy, immunocompetent adult cats (16 cats/group) were treated with either ciclosporin for 56 days at a dose of 24 mg/kg once daily or sham dosed. Prior to treatment, cats had an adequate antibody response to primary vaccination against feline calicivirus (FCV), feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1), feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and rabies. Booster vaccination or novel vaccination with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) was administered 28 days after initiation of treatment with ciclosporin. There were no differences between the ciclosporin-treated and control cats for FCV and FPV antibody titers following booster vaccination. There were delays/reductions in antibody response to FHV-1, FeLV and rabies in treated cats; however, adequate protection was achieved in response to all booster vaccinations. Following primary vaccination with FIV, control cats showed a response, but treated cats showed no antibody production. Adverse events commonly associated with ciclosporin treatment, including diarrhea/loose stool, vomiting, salivation and regurgitation, were reported. In adult cats treated with 24 mg/kg/day of ciclosporin (more than three times the therapeutic dose), vaccine titer levels were adequate for protection following booster vaccination. In contrast, treated cats failed to mount a humoral response to a novel (FIV) vaccination, suggesting that memory B-cell immune responses remain intact during repeated high-dose ciclosporin administration in cats, but that primary immune responses are impaired.",['(c) ISFM and AAFP 2014.'],"['Roberts, Elizabeth S', 'VanLare, Karen A', 'Roycroft, Linda M', 'King, Stephen']","['Roberts ES', 'VanLare KA', 'Roycroft LM', 'King S']","['Novartis Animal Health US, Greensboro, NC, USA elizabeth.roberts@novartis.com.', 'Novartis Animal Health US, Greensboro, NC, USA.', 'Novartis Animal Health US, Greensboro, NC, USA.', 'Novartis Animal Health US, Greensboro, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140512,England,J Feline Med Surg,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,100897329,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Caliciviridae Infections/veterinary', 'Calicivirus, Feline/immunology', 'Cat Diseases/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Cats', 'Cyclosporine/*administration & dosage', 'Dermatologic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Feline Panleukopenia Virus/immunology', 'Herpesviridae/immunology', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/immunology', 'Vaccination/veterinary', 'Viral Vaccines/administration & dosage/immunology']",,,2014/05/14 06:00,2015/09/26 06:00,['2014/05/14 06:00'],"['2014/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1098612X14533550 [pii]', '10.1177/1098612X14533550 [doi]']",ppublish,J Feline Med Surg. 2015 Feb;17(2):101-9. doi: 10.1177/1098612X14533550.

S100A8 is a member of the S100 calcium-binding protein family and plays an important role in the drug resistance of leukemia cells, with the mechanisms largely unknown. Here we report that S100A8 contributes to drug resistance in leukemia by promoting autophagy. S100A8 level was elevated in drug resistance leukemia cell lines relative to the nondrug resistant cell lines. Adriamycin and vincristine increased S100A8 in human leukemia cells, accompanied with upregulation of autophagy. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of S100A8 restored the chemosensitivity of leukemia cells, while overexpression of S100A8 enhanced drug resistance and increased autophagy. S100A8 physically interacted with the autophagy regulator BECN1 and was required for the formation of the BECN1-PI3KC3 complex. In addition, interaction between S100A8 and BECN1 relied upon the autophagic complex ULK1-mAtg13. Furthermore, we discovered that exogenous S100A8 induced autophagy, and RAGE was involved in exogenous S100A8-regulated autophagy.

METHODS: A decision-analytic model was used to estimate life expectancy, costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Efficacy data were derived from a phase III clinical trial. Life expectancy and quality of life data were collected from the literature. A modified Delphi method was used to gather expert opinion on resource use for an IFI. Unit costs were captured from hospital and pharmacy pricelists. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was used to investigate the impact of uncertainty in the model parameters on the cost-effectiveness results. RESULTS: The estimated mean direct cost per patient with posaconazole prophylaxis was 46,893 Swedish kronor (SEK) (euro5,387) and SEK50,017 (euro5,746) with standard azoles. Prophylaxis with posaconazole resulted in 0.075 QALYs gained compared with standard azoles. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of SEK500,000/QALY the PSA demonstrated a more than 95 % probability that posaconazole is cost effective versus standard azoles for the prevention of IFI in high-risk neutropenic patients in Sweden. CONCLUSION: Given the assumptions, methods, and data used, posaconazole is expected to be cost effective compared with standard azoles when used as antifungal prophylaxis in AML or MDS patients with chemotherapy-induced prolonged neutropenia in Sweden.",,"['Lundberg, Johan', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus', 'Akerborg, Orjan']","['Lundberg J', 'Hoglund M', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Akerborg O']","['Outcomes Research, MSD Sweden (AB), Rotebersvagen 3, 19207, Sollentuna, Sweden, j_lundberg@mail.com.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,New Zealand,Clin Drug Investig,Clinical drug investigation,9504817,IM,"['Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/administration & dosage/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Itraconazole/administration & dosage/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Life Expectancy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*complications/drug therapy/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*complications/microbiology', 'Quality of Life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Sweden', 'Triazoles/administration & dosage/economics/*therapeutic use']",,,2014/05/14 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2014/05/14 06:00'],"['2014/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s40261-014-0199-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Drug Investig. 2014 Jul;34(7):483-9. doi: 10.1007/s40261-014-0199-9.,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms underlying this vulnerability have not been fully investigated. Previously, we reported that spinal motor neurons are lost likely due to autophagy and that local hypothermia prevents such spinal motor neuron death. Therefore, we investigated the role of autophagy in normothermic and hypothermic spinal cord ischemia using an immunohistochemical analysis of Beclin 1 (BCLN1; B-cell leukemia 2 protein [Bcl-2] interacting protein), Bcl-2, and gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), which are considered autophagy-related proteins. METHODS: We used rabbit normothermic and hypothermic transient spinal cord ischemia models using a balloon catheter. Neurologic function was assessed according to the Johnson score, and the spinal cord was removed at 8 hours and 1, 2, and 7 days after reperfusion, and morphologic changes were examined using hematoxylin and eosin staining. A Western blot analysis and histochemical study of BCLN1, Bcl-2, and GABARAP, and double-labeled fluorescent immunocytochemical studies were performed. RESULTS: There were significant differences in the physiologic function between the normothermic model and hypothermic model after the procedure (P < .05). In the normothermic model, most of the motor neurons were selectively lost at 7 days of reperfusion (P < .001 compared with the sham group), and they were preserved in the hypothermic model (P = .574 compared with the sham group). The Western blot analysis revealed that the sustained expression of the autophagy markers, BCLN1 and GABARAP, was observed (P < .001 compared with the sham group) and was associated with neuronal cell death in normothermic ischemic conditions. In hypothermic ischemic conditions, the autophagy inhibitory protein Bcl-2 was powerfully induced (P < .001 compared with the sham group) and was associated with blunted expression of BCLN1 and GABARAP and neuronal cell survival. The double-label fluorescent immunocytochemical study revealed that immunoreactivitiy for BCLN1, Bcl-2, and GABARAP was induced in the same motor neurons. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the prolonged induction of autophagy might be a potential factor responsible for delayed motor neuron death, and the induction of the autophagy inhibitory protein Bcl-2 using hypothermia might limit autophagy and protect against delayed motor neuron death.","['Copyright (c) 2015 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Our purpose was to evaluate the feasibility and outcome of this strategy as second HSCT incorporating donor change for acute leukaemia relapse after a first allogeneic transplantation. The courses of 20 consecutive adults (median age 37 years, 12 male) with AML (n=14), ALL (n=5) and acute bi-phenotypic leukaemia (n=1) were analysed retrospectively. Conditioning consisted of fludarabine, CY and either melphalan or TBI or tresosulfan+/-etoposide. Engraftment was achieved in 17 (85%), and a second remission was induced in 15 patients (75%) on day +30. The rate of grade II-IV acute GvHD was 35%, while chronic GvHD occurred in five patients. Most commonly observed grade III-IV toxicities were mucositis (30%), hyperbilirubinemia (20%), elevation of transaminases (20%) and creatinine (20%), while invasive fungal infection affected 30%. One-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 36%. At a median follow-up of 17 months, estimated 1-year OS was 45%, and 1-year relapse-free survival was 33%.

Here, we report for the first time that ATRA-induced differentiation of leukemia and osteosarcoma is accompanied by a decrease in the level of SUMO-1 protein. Our results also demonstrated that depletion or inhibition of SUMO-1 blocks ATRA-induced differentiation, suggesting that SUMO-1 is critical for the differentiation effect of ATRA. Further studies indicated that SUMO-1-promoted ATRA-induced differentiation might be associated with the stabilization of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha), protecting it from degradation. Moreover, our results suggested that Lys399 is a major site for SUMO-1 conjugation of RARalpha. We also found that RARalpha enhanced the transcription of its target genes, which might also contribute to the enhanced differentiating effects of ATRA; however, mutation of Lys399 of RARalpha inhibits the extents of both SUMO-1 modification and ATRA-induced differentiation. Together, these results indicate that SUMO-1 modification of RARalpha is a potent mechanism for balancing proliferation and differentiation by controlling the stability of RARalpha in cancer cells. SUMO-1 modification may thus serve an important role in controlling ATRA-induced cell differentiation in cancers.",['(c) 2014 FEBS.'],"['Zhou, Qian', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Chen, Zibo', 'Zhao, Pingge', 'Ma, Yaxi', 'Yang, Bo', 'He, Qiaojun', 'Ying, Meidan']","['Zhou Q', 'Zhang L', 'Chen Z', 'Zhao P', 'Ma Y', 'Yang B', 'He Q', 'Ying M']","['Institute of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140602,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Protein Stability', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*physiology', '*Sumoylation', 'Tretinoin/*physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['SUMOylation', 'differentiation', 'retinoic acid', 'retinoic acid receptor alpha', 'small ubiquitin-related modifier-1']",2014/05/14 06:00,2014/09/06 06:00,['2014/05/14 06:00'],"['2013/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/17 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/febs.12840 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS J. 2014 Jul;281(13):3032-47. doi: 10.1111/febs.12840.

A major limitation to the use of this strategy is the availability of adequate amounts of autologous tumor cells. Moreover, MoDCs from cancer patients are often defective in their antigen-processing and presentation machinery. In this study, two types of allogeneic cells, a leukemia plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) line (PMDC05) and pancreatic cancer cell lines (PANC-1 or MIA PaCa-2), were fused instead of autologous MoDCs and tumor cells. We created four types of pDC/tumor fusion cells by alternating fusion partners and treating with lipopolysaccharide (LPS): i) PMDC05 fused with PANC-1 (pDC/PANC-1), ii) PMDC05 fused with MIA PaCa-2 (pDC/MIA PaCa-2), iii) LPS-stimulated pDC/PANC-1 (LPS-pDC/PANC-1) and iv) LPS-stimulated pDC/MIA PaCa-2 (LPS-pDC/MIA PaCa-2) and examined their antitumor immune responses. The LPS-pDC/tumor cell fusions were the most active, as demonstrated by their: i) upregulated expression of HLA-DR and CD86 on a per-fusion-cell basis, ii) increased production of IL-12p70, iii) generation of a higher percentage of IFN-gamma-producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and iv) augmented induction of MUC1-specific CD8(+) T cells that lyse target tumor cells.

We therefore investigated testosterone (Testo) and inhibin B (InB) in blood serum from male adolescents with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) under long-term TKI treatment. Also long-term exposure to TKIs was studied in a juvenile rat model. METHODS: Serum was collected at 3 months intervals from 13 boys (age: 7.8-18.9 years, median: 12.8 years) with CML receiving TKI treatment over 3-58 months (median: 18 months). 4 weeks (w) old male rats were exposed, either chronically or intermittently, via the drinking water to a standard (SD) and a high dose (=2-fold SD) of IMA, dasatinib (DASA), or bosutinib (BOSU) over a 10 w period. Controls received water only. Animals were sacrificed after 2 w (prepubertal), 4 w (pubertal), and 10 w (postpubertal) of exposure. Testo and InB serum levels were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Boys exhibited Testo and InB levels within normal age-related reference ranges and no pattern of rising or falling levels during TKI treatment could be observed. In rats, Testo levels under IMA exposure tended to be non-significantly lowered at postpubertal age compared to controls while no significant differences were found under DASA and BOSU exposure. Animals' InB levels did not significantly differ from controls for all TKIs, at all doses, and by all application schemes tested. CONCLUSION: With the limitation that the number of individuals tested was rather small, testicular toxicity due to TKI seems unlikely as no alterations of Testo and InB blood levels neither in male adolescent patients nor in rats under long-term TKI exposure was observed.",['(c) Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive neoplastic disorder of immature hematopoietic precursors committed to the T-cell lineage. T-ALL comprises about 15% of pediatric and 25% of adult ALL cases and is prone to early relapse. Although the prognosis of T-ALL has improved especially in children due to the use of new intensified treatment protocols, the outcome of relapsed T-ALL cases is still poor. Putative LICs have been identified also in T-ALL. LICs are mostly quiescent and for this reason highly resistant to chemotherapy. Therefore, they evade treatment and give rise to disease relapse. At present great interest surrounds the development of targeted therapies against signaling networks aberrantly activated in LICs and important for their survival and drug-resistance. Both the Notch1 pathway and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) network are involved in T-ALL LIC survival and drug-resistance and could be targeted by small molecules. Thus, Notch1 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors are currently being developed for clinical use either as single agents or in combination with conventional chemotherapy for T-ALL patient treatment. In this review, we summarize the existing knowledge of the relevance of Notch1 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in T-ALL LICs and we examine the rationale for targeting these key signal transduction networks by means of selective pharmacological inhibitors.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: The study included 60 AL patients hospitalized between the period of July 2001 and August 2006. Polymorphisms for the genes ACE(I/D), CCR-5, IL-1RA, MBL-2, TLR-4, and IL-4 were typed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or PCR-restriction fragment length polymerase. Genotype frequencies for these genes were compared in the patient and control groups. The relationships between the genotypes and the body distribution of infections, pathogens, the duration of neutropenia, and febrile episodes in AL patients were evaluated. RESULTS: No significant differences in either the genotype distribution or the allelic frequencies of TLR-4, IL-4, CCR-5, IL-1RN GPs were observed between patients and healthy controls. The AB/BB genotype (53.3%) in the MBL-2 gene was found to be significantly higher in the AL patients compared with control groups. There were correlations between the presence of MBL-2, TLR-4, and ACE polymorphisms and clinical parameters due to FN. Overall, bacteremia was more common in MBL BB and ACE DD. Gram-positive bacteremia was more common in ACE for ID versus DD genotype. Gram-negative bacteremia was more common for both the MBL-2 AB/BB genotype and TLR-4 AG genotype. Median durations of febrile episodes were significantly shorter in ACE DD and MBL AB/BB. CONCLUSION: Although TLR-4, ACE, and MBL-2 GPs have been extensively investigated in different clinical pictures, this is the first study to evaluate the role of these polymorphisms in the genetic etiopathogenesis of FN in patients with ALs. As a conclusion, TLR-4, ACE, and MBL-2 genes might play roles in the genetic etiopathogenesis of FN in patients with ALs.",,"['Pehlivan, Mustafa', 'Sahin, Handan Haydaroglu', 'Ozdilli, Kursat', 'Onay, Huseyin', 'Ozcan, Ali', 'Ozkinay, Ferda', 'Pehlivan, Sacide']","['Pehlivan M', 'Sahin HH', 'Ozdilli K', 'Onay H', 'Ozcan A', 'Ozkinay F', 'Pehlivan S']","['1 Department of Hematology, School of Medicine, Gaziantep University , Gaziantep, Turkey .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140512,United States,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers,Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,101494210,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Febrile Neutropenia/complications/*genetics/immunology', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein/genetics', 'Interleukin-4/genetics', 'Leukemia/complications/*genetics/immunology', 'Mannose-Binding Lectin/*genetics', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Receptors, CCR5/genetics', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/*genetics', 'Turkey']",,,2014/05/14 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2014/05/14 06:00'],"['2014/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/gtmb.2014.0004 [doi]'],ppublish,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers. 2014 Jul;18(7):474-81. doi: 10.1089/gtmb.2014.0004.

The effect induced by As2O3 is also associated with extensive genomic-wide epigenetic changes with large-scale alterations in DNA methylation. We investigated the As2O3 metabolism in association with factors involved in the production of its methylated metabolites in APL-derived cell line, NB4. We used high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique to detect As2O3 metabolites in NB4 cells. The effects of As2O3 on glutathione level, S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) levels were investigated. Also, we studied the expression levels of arsenic methyltransferase (AS3MT) and DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b) by real-time PCR. Our results show that after As2O3 entry into the cell, it was converted into methylated metabolites, mono-methylarsenic (MMA) and dimethylarsenic (DMA). The glutathione (GSH) production was increased in parallel with the methylated metabolites formations. As2O3 treatment inhibited DNMTs (DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b) in dose- and time-dependent manners. The SAH levels in As2O3-treated cells were increased; however, the SAM level was not affected. The present study shows that APL cell is capable of metabolizing As2O3. The continuous formation of intracellular methylated metabolites, the inhibition of DNMTs expression levels and the increase of SAH level by As2O3 biotransformation would probably affect the DNMTs-methylated DNA methylation in a manner related to the extent of DNA hypomethylation. Production of intracellular methylated metabolites and epigenetic changes of DNA methylation during As2O3 metabolism may contribute to the therapeutic effect of As2O3 in APL.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Khaleghian, Ali', 'Ghaffari, Seyed H', 'Ahmadian, Shahin', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir']","['Khaleghian A', 'Ghaffari SH', 'Ahmadian S', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Ghavamzadeh A']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics (IBB), University of Tehran, P.O.

Heterozygous mutations in this gene were recently demonstrated to cause Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (OMIM 605130). Importantly, retrospective analysis of this patient's chromosomal microarray revealed decreased copy number of two probes corresponding to exons 2 and 9 of the KMT2A gene, though this result was not reported by the testing laboratory in keeping with standard protocols for reportable size cutoffs for array comparative genomic hybridization. This patient expands the clinical phenotype associated with mutations in KMT2A to include variable patterns of hypertrichosis and a significantly advanced bone age with premature eruption of the secondary dentition despite her growth retardation. This patient also represents the first report of Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome due to an exonic deletion, supporting haploinsufficiency as a causative mechanism.

ATL cells possess a CD4+ CD25+ phenotype, similar to that of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Tax has been reported to play a crucial role in the leukemogenesis of HTLV-1. The HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ), which is encoded by the minus strand of the viral genomic RNA, is expressed in all ATL cases and induces neoplastic and inflammatory disease in vivo. To test whether HBZ and Tax are both required for T cell malignancy, we generated HBZ/Tax double transgenic mice in which HBZ and Tax are expressed exclusively in CD4+ T cells. Survival was much reduced in HBZ/Tax double-transgenic mice compared with wild type littermates. Transgenic expression of HBZ and Tax induced skin lesions and T-cell lymphoma in mice, resembling diseases observed in HTLV-1 infected individuals. However, Tax single transgenic mice did not develop major health problems. In addition, memory CD4+ T cells and Foxp3+ Treg cells counts were increased in HBZ/Tax double transgenic mice, and their proliferation was enhanced.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) is a haematopoietic stem cell malignancy delineated by genetic heterogeneity. Recently characteristic mutations have been identified for this entity in a distinct group of genes (TET2, CBL, KRAS). We comparatively investigated DNA extracted from fresh mononuclear cells as well as dFFPE samples from four CMML patients employing a commercially available primer set covering the above mentioned and well characterized mutational hotspots in CMML followed by an amplicon based next-generation deep-sequencing (NGS) approach. As we observed high quality run data as well as complete concordance between both sample types in all cases, we further validated the potential of NGS in hematopathology on a larger cohort of CMML patients (n=39), detecting sequence variations in 84.6% of patients. Sequence analysis revealed 92 variants, including five known polymorphisms, ten silent mutations, 36 missense mutations, 14 nonsense mutations, 24 frame shift mutations and three potential splice site mutations. Our findings ultimately demonstrate the applicability of NGS to dFFPE biopsy specimen in CMML and thus allowing the pathologist to evaluate prognostically relevant mutations at a high resolution and further contribute to risk stratification for the individual patient.",,"['Bernard, Veronica', 'Gebauer, Niklas', 'Dinh, Thomas', 'Stegemann, Judith', 'Feller, Alfred C', 'Merz, Hartmut']","['Bernard V', 'Gebauer N', 'Dinh T', 'Stegemann J', 'Feller AC', 'Merz H']","['Department of Pathology, Reference Centre for Lymph Node Pathology and Haematopathology, University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein Campus Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Reference Centre for Lymph Node Pathology and Haematopathology, University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein Campus Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Reference Centre for Lymph Node Pathology and Haematopathology, University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein Campus Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Reference Centre for Lymph Node Pathology and Haematopathology, University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein Campus Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Reference Centre for Lymph Node Pathology and Haematopathology, University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein Campus Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Reference Centre for Lymph Node Pathology and Haematopathology, University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein Campus Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20140315,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*chemistry/pathology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Female', 'Formaldehyde', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*chemistry/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods', 'ras Proteins/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Next-generation sequencing', 'chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia', 'decalcified', 'formalin-fixed', 'paraffin-embedded samples']",2014/05/13 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/05/13 06:00'],"['2014/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2014 Mar 15;7(4):1667-76. eCollection 2014.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)']",,PMC4014247,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our retrospective analysis compared diagnostic uncertainty, resource utilization, and costs for patients with diagnostic bone marrow (BM) tests managed by commercial laboratories. METHODS: Patients with BM biopsies and suspected hematologic cancer/condition were identified from claims (2005-2011) within a large US health plan (coverage >/=6 pre- and >/=3-months post-biopsy). Cohorts defined by laboratories performing BM morphologic assessment/directing testing sequence: Genoptix (GX, specialty hematology-testing laboratory), large commercial laboratories (LL), other laboratories (OL). One-year post-biopsy changes in diagnosis or treatments, tests performed, and diagnostic/treatment medical costs (measured as per-patient-per-month [PPPM]) were examined. RESULTS: The study population included 1,387 GX, 4,162 LL, and 19,115 OL patients with suspected hematologic malignancy/disease and BM morphology assessment. GX had lower diagnostic uncertainty measured between 2 time periods by diagnostic stability (no conditions the same; 6.16% GX, 8.04% LL, 9.73% OL; p < 0.001) and changes (>/=1 condition different; 7.88% GX, 11.19% LL, and 14.08% OL; p < 0.001), fewer repeat BM biopsies, and fewer chemotherapy changes (30-days and 60-days post-initiation). One-year PPPM costs adjusted for patient characteristics differences were $8,202 GX, $7,711 LL, and $10,302 OL (p < 0.05); adjusted PPPM costs (excluding testing period) were $6,019 GX, $6,649 LL, and $7,801 OL (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that a hematopathology specialty laboratory may result in earlier final diagnosis, fewer subsequent diagnosis changes, reduced need for follow-on testing requiring repeat biopsy procedures, and may result in lower downstream healthcare costs.

Research has seldom examined the relationship between these morbidities; thus, little empirical evidence exists concerning overall salience and how morbidities converge to impair day-to-day functioning. An increased understanding of functional impairment resulting from the pediatric cancer experience can inform early risk identification as well as sources for intervention. The purpose of this study was to characterize the frequency/severity of functional impairment and identify significant neurocognitive and psychosocial determinants of functional impairment. METHODS: Fifty child-parent dyads were enrolled. Children were aged 7-19 years who were at least 2 years postdiagnosis with leukemia/lymphoma and were recruited through a pediatric oncology late effects clinic. Parents completed questionnaires, rating their own adjustment to their child's illness as well as their child's level of functional impairment, while a brief neuropsychological exam was administered to children. RESULTS: Twenty-six percent of the sample evidenced clinically significant functional impairment. Regression analyses indicated that neurocognitive deficits did not predict functional impairment, whereas parental stress was a significant predictor. CONCLUSIONS: Although children demonstrated both neurocognitive deficits and functional impairments, results favor psychosocial factors, such as parental stress, as a predictor of overall functional impairment. The implications of this study suggest that late effects aggregate to impact day-to-day functioning in pediatric cancer survivor populations and parental stress may serve as a marker for heightened risk. The results suggest that broader functional domains, especially school and self-care domains, should be evaluated and considered when identifying potential targets for psychosocial interventions.","['Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Hile, Sarah', 'Erickson, Sarah J', 'Agee, Brittany', 'Annett, Robert D']","['Hile S', 'Erickson SJ', 'Agee B', 'Annett RD']","['University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140510,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cognition', 'Executive Function', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parenting/*psychology', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Pediatrics', 'Self Care', 'Sickness Impact Profile', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Stress, Psychological/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/*psychology']",['NOTNLM'],"['functional impairment', 'neurocognitive deficit', 'parental stress', 'pediatric cancer', 'survivorship']",2014/05/13 06:00,2015/08/04 06:00,['2014/05/13 06:00'],"['2013/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/11 00:00 [revised]', '2014/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pon.3543 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2014 Oct;23(10):1157-64. doi: 10.1002/pon.3543.

METHODS: Plasma concentrations from a randomized controlled trial consist of 61 patients who received oral imatinib at doses ranged between 300 and 800 mg in various dosing interval, which were quantified using a validated reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method with UV detection method on different occasions at SS and evaluated using PPK model. RESULTS: A one-compartment model with zero-order absorption and a lag time was sufficient in describing the concentration-time profile. Inter-individual variability (IIV) was modeled for all parameters. Oral clearance (CL/F) and the volume of distribution (V/F) were estimated to 10.8 L/h with 30 % IIV and 265 L with 53 % IIV, respectively. Inter-occasion variability (IOV) was included in CL/F (17 %) and V/F (22 %).The proportional residual error of the model was 8 %. CONCLUSIONS: Simulation analysis from individual parameters shows exposure to imatinib is highly variable among patients. Imatinib trough plasma levels <1,257 ng/mL were associated with lower rates of major molecular response.

With a dexamethasone-based differentiation protocol, transcription factors ZBTB16 and NR4A3 are highly upregulated but Runx2 and other osteogenic marker genes are not. Previous studies have suggested the involvement of a Runx2-independent differentiation pathway. The objective of this study is to further elucidate this mechanism. Differentiation of DFCs was examined by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining and ALP activity measurement, by Alizarin Red S staining and by real-time reverse transcription plus the polymerase chain reaction. ZBTB16 was overexpressed by using a transient transfection method. Resulting genome-wide gene expression changes were assessed by microarray. ZBTB16 and Runx2 were inhibited by short interfering RNA transfection. Promoter binding of ZBTB16 was evaluated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Downregulation of Runx2 had no effect on dexamethasone-induced differentiation but was effective on BMP2-induced differentiation. Downregulation of ZBTB16, however, impaired dexamethasone-induced differentiation. Genes that were upregulated by dexamethasone induction were also upregulated by ZBTB16 overexpression. Genes that were not upregulated during dexamethasone-induced differentiation were also not regulated by ZBTB16 overexpression.

However, maintaining self-renewing ESCs and iPSCs in vitro requires leukemia-induced factor (LIF), an expensive reagent. Here we describe a less expensive compound that may serve as a LIF substitute-salvianolic acid B (Sal B), a Salvia miltiorrhiza extract. We found that Sal B is capable of upregulating Oct4 and Sox2, two genes considered important for the maintenance of ESC pluripotency. Our MTT data indicate that instead of triggering cell death, Sal B induced cell proliferation, especially at optimum concentrations of 0.01 nM and 0.1 nM. Other results indicate that compared to non-LIF controls, Sal B-treated ESCs expressed higher levels of several stem cell markers while still maintaining differentiation into three-germ-layer cells after six passages. Further, we found that Sal B triggers the Jak2-Stat3 and EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Following Sal B treatment, (a) levels of phosphorylated (p)-Jak2, p-Stat3, p-EGFR, and p-ERK proteins all increased; (b) these increases were suppressed by AG490 (a Jak2 inhibitor) and ZD1839 (an EGFR inhibitor); and (c) cytokines associated with the Jak2-Stat3 signaling pathway were upregulated.

This study was performed on all cases of leukemia during pregnancy identified in our institution leukemia database. PATIENTS AND METHODS: It is a retrospective study from our existing database. Thirty two cases were identified among the cohort of patients treated for acute and chronic leukemia between January 1991 and July 2003. RESULTS: Among the acute leukemia patients (n=21), 10 patients (47.6%) received chemotherapy during pregnancy, seven had live birth and three had spontaneous abortion. No teratogenicity or congenital malformations or postnatal complication were reported. The remaining 11 (52.4%) were not given chemotherapy while pregnant; three patients presented after 34 weeks of gestation ending in normal live births and then received chemotherapy and eight patients had abortion before starting chemotherapy. Among the chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients (n=11), nine patients received hydroxyurea, one patient received alfa-interferon and one patient was treated with leukapheresis. Eight patients had normal live births and three patients had abortion. Out of the 32 patients, 18 patients (56.2%) subsequently underwent HLA matched sibling allogeneic stem cell transplantation, seven for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), two for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and nine for CML. After a median follow up of 16 years, five patients (15.6%) are alive in remission (one from chemotherapy group and four from SCT group). CONCLUSIONS: Our report lends credence to the safety and feasibility of administering anti-leukemic therapy in acute and chronic leukemias during pregnancy although acute leukemia patients had possibly a poor long term outcome compared to non-pregnant patients.","['Copyright (c) 2014 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.

In this study we investigated the prognostic potential of minimal residual disease monitoring by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of NPM1 mutations in patients treated in the AMLCG 1999, 2004 and 2008 trials. Minimal residual disease was monitored - in aplasia, after induction therapy, after consolidation therapy, and during follow-up - in 588 samples from 158 patients positive for NPM1 mutations A, B and D (with a sensitivity of 10(-6)). One hundred and twenty-seven patients (80.4%) achieved complete remission after induction therapy and, of these, 56 patients (44.1%) relapsed. At each checkpoint, minimal residual disease cut-offs were calculated. After induction therapy a cut-off NPM1 mutation ratio of 0.01 was associated with a high hazard ratio of 4.26 and the highest sensitivity of 76% for the prediction of relapse. This was reflected in a cumulative incidence of relapse after 2 years of 77.8% for patients with ratios above the cut-off versus 26.4% for those with ratios below the cut-off. In the favorable subgroup according to European LeukemiaNet, the cut-off after induction therapy also separated the cohort into two prognostic groups with a cumulative incidence of relapse of 76% versus 6% after 2 years. Our data demonstrate that in addition to pre-therapeutic factors, the course of minimal residual disease in an individual is an important prognostic factor and could be included in clinical trials for the guidance of post-remission therapy. The trials from which data were obtained were registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (#NCT01382147, #NCT00266136) and at the European Leukemia Trial Registry (#LN_AMLINT2004_230).",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Hubmann, Max', 'Kohnke, Thomas', 'Hoster, Eva', 'Schneider, Stephanie', 'Dufour, Annika', 'Zellmeier, Evelyn', 'Fiegl, Michael', 'Braess, Jan', 'Bohlander, Stefan K', 'Subklewe, Marion', 'Sauerland, Maria-Cristina', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Wormann, Bernhard', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Spiekermann, Karsten']","['Hubmann M', 'Kohnke T', 'Hoster E', 'Schneider S', 'Dufour A', 'Zellmeier E', 'Fiegl M', 'Braess J', 'Bohlander SK', 'Subklewe M', 'Sauerland MC', 'Berdel WE', 'Buchner T', 'Wormann B', 'Hiddemann W', 'Spiekermann K']","['Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Munich, Germany max.hubmann@med.uni-muenchen.de.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology (IBE), Faculty of Medicine, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Barmherzige Bruder Hospital, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland, New Zealand.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Munich, Germany Clinical Cooperation Group Immunotherapy, Helmholtz Zentrum Munich, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Biostatistics and Clinical Research, University of Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Germany.', 'German Society of Hematology and Oncology, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Munich, Germany Clinical Cooperation Group Leukemia, Helmholtz Zentrum Munich, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140509,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prospective Studies', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/05/13 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/05/13 06:00'],"['2014/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.104133 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.104133 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2014 Aug;99(8):1317-25. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.104133.

However intravenous busulfan has more predictable pharmacokinetics and less toxicity than oral busulfan; we, therefore, retrospectively analyzed data from 952 patients with acute myeloid leukemia who received intravenous busulfan for autologous stem cell transplantation. Most patients were male (n=531, 56%), and the median age at transplantation was 50.5 years. Two-year overall survival, leukemia-free survival, and relapse incidence were 67+/-2%, 53+/-2%, and 40+/-2%, respectively. The non-relapse mortality rate at 2 years was 7+/-1%. Five patients died from veno-occlusive disease. Overall leukemia-free survival and relapse incidence at 2 years did not differ significantly between the 815 patients transplanted in first complete remission (52+/-2% and 40+/-2%, respectively) and the 137 patients transplanted in second complete remission (58+/-5% and 35+/-5%, respectively). Cytogenetic risk classification and age were significant prognostic factors: the 2-year leukemia-free survival was 63+/-4% in patients with good risk cytogenetics, 52+/-3% in those with intermediate risk cytogenetics, and 37 +/- 10% in those with poor risk cytogenetics (P=0.01); patients </=50 years old had better overall survival (77+/-2% versus 56+/-3%; P<0.001), leukemia-free survival (61+/-3% versus 45+/-3%; P<0.001), relapse incidence (35+/-2% versus 45+/-3%; P<0.005), and non-relapse mortality (4+/-1% versus 10+/-2%; P<0.001) than older patients.

Considering other therapeutic options that are minimally toxic to normal cells and effectively target not only the majority and more differentiated cancer cells, but also the rare residual leukemia cells, is of paramount importance. A number of immunotherapeutic options have been proposed to counter this challenge.

Patients who relapse post-allo-SCT can achieve prolonged remission after donor lymphocyte infusion. Donor lymphocyte infusion as well as other immunotherapeutic strategies are usually complicated by severe graft versus host disease. AIM: In the present study, we examined the effect of irradiation on the cytotoxic activity of mononuclear cells (MNCs). MATERIALS & METHODS: Cytotoxic activity of fresh and irradiated MNCs from healthy donors was tested against the leukemic cell line K562 and against fresh leukemic cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Cytotoxicity was assessed by using a flow-cytometry assay. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: Interestingly, we observed that 25 Gy irradiated MNCs retain significant cytotoxic activity against K562. Based on these in vitro data, the safety and efficacy of irradiated haploidentical, IL-2-activated lymphocytes were tested in six patients after allo-SCT. Acute skin graft versus host disease developed in two patients and was resolved after a short course of steroids.

PCR may also be limited by insufficient cells for DNA isolation and incomplete coverage of gene rearrangements. This study aims to evaluate a PCR method for IgH clonality using direct cell lysates. METHODS: PCR amplification used cell lysate from detergent-based lysis and BIOMED-2 primers. CSF specimens were tested for 20 patients with primary CNS lymphoma or systemic lymphoma suspected for CNS involvement. Cytology and flow cytometry analysis was performed in parallel with PCR. RESULTS: Direct lysis produced a better yield than the column-based method for DNA isolation. PCR using lysate showed an efficiency of clonality detection from a minimum of 20 tumor cells. PCR clonality was found in nine of the 20 CSFs, and positive PCR was concordant with both cytology and flow cytometry in seven cases. There were two cases positive for PCR, but indeterminate for flow cytometry because of insufficient cell events. Of the eleven PCR-negative cases, two were considered as false negative, as flow cytometry showed positive for malignant cells. The PCR was also performed successfully with a specimen from the anterior chamber of the eye. CONCLUSION: PCR clonality with direct cell lysis of CSF is feasible, and it may overcome the limitation of DNA isolation. This PCR method may be particularly useful for small volume and low cell CSF when flow cytometry is inconclusive.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Liu, L', 'Cao, F', 'Wang, S', 'Zhou, J', 'Yang, G', 'Wang, C']","['Liu L', 'Cao F', 'Wang S', 'Zhou J', 'Yang G', 'Wang C']","['Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140512,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,"['Cerebrospinal Fluid/cytology', 'Clonal Evolution/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell malignancies', 'CNS lymphoma', 'CSF', 'PCR clonality', 'cell lysis']",2014/05/13 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/05/13 06:00'],"['2014/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12255 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2015 Apr;37(2):165-73. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12255.

ATO could induce apoptosis at relatively high concentrations (0.5 to 2.0 micromol/L) and partial differentiation at low concentrations (0.1 to 0.5 micromol/L) in leukemic promyelocytes. It is known that cAMP agonists enhance low-dose ATO-induced APL cells differentiation. Less well appreciated was the possible interaction between relatively high-doses of ATO and enhanced levels of cAMP in APL cells. Here, we show that elevation of cAMP levels by forskolin inhibited ATO-mediated apoptosis in APL-derived NB4 cells, and this inhibition could be averted by cell permeable cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor (14-22) amide. Inactivating phosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein Bad at Ser118 and phosphorylation of the CREB proto-oncogene at Ser133 were observed upon elevation of cAMP levels in NB4 cells. Phosphorylation of these PKA target proteins is known to promote cell survival in AML cells. The ability of cAMP to endow the APL cells with survival advantage is of particular importance when cAMP agonists may be considered as adjuncts to APL therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

BLV-infected B-cells rarely express viral proteins in vivo, but short-term cultivation augments BLV expression in some, but not all, BLV-infected B-cells. This observation suggests that two subsets, i.e. BLV-silencing cells and BLV-expressing cells, are present among BLV-infected B-cells, although the mechanisms of viral expression have not been determined. In this study, we examined B-cell markers and viral antigen expression in B-cells from BLV-infected cattle to identify markers that may discriminate BLV-expressing cells from BLV-silencing cells. The proportions of IgM(high) B-cells were increased in blood lymphocytes from BLV-infected cattle. IgM(high) B-cells mainly expressed BLV antigens, whereas IgM(low) B-cells did not, although the provirus load was equivalent in both subsets. Several parameters were investigated in these two subsets to characterize their cellular behaviour. Real-time PCR and microarray analyses detected higher expression levels of some proto-oncogenes (e.g. Maf, Jun and Fos) in IgM(low) B-cells than those in IgM(high) B-cells. Moreover, lymphoma cells obtained from the lymph nodes of 14 BLV-infected cattle contained IgM(low) or IgM(-) B-cells but no IgM(high) B-cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that IgM(high) B-cells mainly comprise BLV-expressing cells, whereas IgM(low) B-cells comprise a high proportion of BLV-silencing B-cells in BLV-infected cattle.",['(c) 2014 The Authors.'],"['Ikebuchi, Ryoyo', 'Konnai, Satoru', 'Okagawa, Tomohiro', 'Nishimori, Asami', 'Nakahara, Ayako', 'Murata, Shiro', 'Ohashi, Kazuhiko']","['Ikebuchi R', 'Konnai S', 'Okagawa T', 'Nishimori A', 'Nakahara A', 'Murata S', 'Ohashi K']","['Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140509,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*immunology/*virology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Viral Proteins/*biosynthesis']",,,2014/05/13 06:00,2014/09/16 06:00,['2014/05/13 06:00'],"['2014/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1099/vir.0.065011-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2014 Aug;95(Pt 8):1832-1842. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.065011-0.

CreER(T2) and GFP expression from 14 different enhancer elements in stable transgenic mice allowed us to define a comprehensive regional fate map of the pallium. We explored transcriptional mechanisms that control the activity of the enhancers using informatics, in vivo occupancy by TFs that regulate cortical patterning (CoupTFI, Pax6, and Pbx1), and analysis of enhancer activity in Pax6 mutants.

During leukemogenesis, aberrant regulation of transcription factors such as RUNX1, CBFbeta, MLL, C/EBPalpha, SPI1, GATA, and TAL1 is central to the disease. Here, we will discuss the mechanisms of transcription factor deregulation in leukemia and how in recent years next-generation sequencing approaches have helped to elucidate the molecular role of many of these aberrantly expressed transcription factors. We will focus on the complexes in which these factors reside, the role of posttranslational modification of these factors, their involvement in setting up higher order chromatin structures, and their influence on the local epigenetic environment. We suggest that only comprehensive knowledge on all these aspects will increase our understanding of aberrant gene expression in leukemia as well as open new entry points for therapeutic intervention.","['Copyright (c) 2014 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Simultaneously, real-time quantitative RT-PCR detected a low copy number of MLL-AF9 transcripts, consistent with MRD detection.

Initial studies suggested that very brief exposure to kinase inhibitors was sufficient to induce apoptosis in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. However, flaws in this experimental model have subsequently been identified, leading to the conclusion that apoptosis only occurs with sustained low-level kinase inhibition. Thus, the minimum duration of complete kinase inhibition required to commit CML cells to death is unknown. Here we confirm that <1 h is insufficient to induce significant commitment to death in BCR-ABL1+ cell lines and in primary CD34+ progenitor cells, and establish that commitment to cell death only occurs if kinase inhibition is maintained for 4 h or more. Remarkably, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) inhibition in combination with transient (<1 h) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) exposure proved lethal for CML progenitors, despite the reactivation of Bcr-Abl after 1 h. JAK kinase inhibition did not induce cell death in combination with transient TKI exposure. Thus, STAT5 appears to be a critical determinant of the time-dependent sensitivity of CML progenitor cells to TKI treatment in a Bcr-Abl-dependent, but JAK-independent, manner. We conclude that combining kinase inhibition with STAT5 inhibition represents a promising therapeutic approach in BCR-ABL1+ leukemias.",,"['Schafranek, L', 'Nievergall, E', 'Powell, J A', 'Hiwase, D K', 'Leclercq, T', 'Hughes, T P', 'White, D L']","['Schafranek L', 'Nievergall E', 'Powell JA', 'Hiwase DK', 'Leclercq T', 'Hughes TP', 'White DL']","['1] Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Adelaide, South Australia, Australia [2] Centre for Personalised Cancer Medicine (CPCM), Faculty of Health Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia [3] School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', '1] Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Adelaide, South Australia, Australia [2] Centre for Personalised Cancer Medicine (CPCM), Faculty of Health Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia [3] School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', '1] Discipline of Paediatrics, Faculty of Health Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia [2] Department of Immunology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', '1] School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia [2] Department of Haematology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', '1] Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Adelaide, South Australia, Australia [2] School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', '1] Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Adelaide, South Australia, Australia [2] Centre for Personalised Cancer Medicine (CPCM), Faculty of Health Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia [3] School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia [4] Department of Haematology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia [5] Centre for Cancer Biology, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', '1] Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Adelaide, South Australia, Australia [2] Centre for Personalised Cancer Medicine (CPCM), Faculty of Health Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia [3] School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia [4] Discipline of Paediatrics, Faculty of Health Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140512,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2014/05/13 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2014/05/13 06:00'],"['2013/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014156 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.156 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jan;29(1):76-85. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.156.

We address the role of the HMT activity for MLL1, a histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase critical for maintaining hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Here, we show that the SET domain, and thus HMT activity of MLL1, is dispensable for maintaining HSCs and supporting leukemogenesis driven by the MLL-AF9 fusion oncoprotein. Upon Mll1 deletion, histone H4 lysine 16 (H4K16) acetylation is selectively depleted at MLL1 target genes in conjunction with reduced transcription. Surprisingly, inhibition of SIRT1 is sufficient to prevent the loss of H4K16 acetylation and the reduction in MLL1 target gene expression. Thus, recruited MOF activity, and not the intrinsic HMT activity of MLL1, is central for the maintenance of HSC target genes. In addition, this work reveals a role for SIRT1 in opposing MLL1 function.",['Copyright (c) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This spurred several studies on cancer risk among UN peacekeepers who served in the Balkans. Although these studies turned out to be negative, the debate about possible cancers and other health risks caused by DU exposure continues. The aim of the present study was to investigate cancer incidence and all-cause mortality in a cohort of 6076 (4.4% women) Norwegian military UN peacekeepers deployed to Kosovo between 1999 and 2011. METHODS: The cohort was followed for cancer incidence and mortality from 1999 to 2011. Standardised incidence ratios for cancer (SIR) and mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated from national rates. RESULTS: Sixty-nine cancer cases and 38 deaths were observed during follow-up. Cancer incidence in the cohort was similar to that in the general Norwegian population. No cancers in the overall cohort significantly exceeded incidence rates in the general Norwegian population, but there was an elevated SIR for melanoma of skin in men of 1.90 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95-3.40). A fivefold increased incidence of bladder cancer was observed among men who served in Kosovo for >/= 1 year, based on 2 excess cases (SIR=5.27; 95% CI 1.09-15.4). All-cause mortality was half the expected rate (SMR=0.49; 95% CI 0.35-0.67).

METHODS: Patients received lenalidomide 10 mg/d (days 1-21; n = 47) or 5 mg/d (days 1-28; n = 43) on 28-d cycles or placebo (n = 45). From the placebo and lenalidomide 5 mg groups, 84% and 58% of patients, respectively, crossed over to lenalidomide 5 or 10 mg at 16 wk, respectively. RESULTS: Rates of red blood cell-transfusion independence (RBC-TI) >/=182 d were higher in the lenalidomide 10 mg (57.4%; P < 0.0001) and 5 mg (37.2%; P = 0.0001) groups vs. placebo (2.2%). Cytogenetic response rates (major + minor responses) were 56.8% (P < 0.0001), 23.1% (P = 0.0299) and 0%, respectively. Two-year cumulative risk of acute myeloid leukaemia progression was 12.6%, 17.4% and 16.7% in the lenalidomide 10 mg, 5 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. In a 6-month landmark analysis, overall survival was longer in lenalidomide-treated patients with RBC-TI >/=182 d vs. non-responders (P = 0.0072).

In addition, 17 patients had a secondary eosinophilia and were used as controls. Eosinophilic enrichment was carried out in all cases. Genomic imbalances were found in 76% of all MPN patients. Losses on 20q were the most frequent genetic abnormality in MPNs (32%), affected the three types of MPN studied. This study also found losses at 11q13.3 in 26% of patients with MPN-Ph- and in 19p13.11 in two of the three patients with an MPN associated with a PDGFRA rearrangement. In addition, 29% of patients with CML had losses on 8q24. In summary, aCGH revealed clonality in eosinophils in most MPNs, suggesting that it could be a useful technique for defining clonality in these diseases.

In hematological cancers, the relevance of ongoing DNA damage and the mechanisms by which apoptosis is suppressed are largely unknown. We found pervasive DNA damage in hematologic malignancies, including multiple myeloma, lymphoma and leukemia, which leads to activation of a p53-independent, proapoptotic network centered on nuclear relocalization of ABL1 kinase. Although nuclear ABL1 triggers cell death through its interaction with the Hippo pathway coactivator YAP1 in normal cells, we show that low YAP1 levels prevent nuclear ABL1-induced apoptosis in these hematologic malignancies. YAP1 is under the control of a serine-threonine kinase, STK4. Notably, genetic inactivation of STK4 restores YAP1 levels, triggering cell death in vitro and in vivo.

Studies have reported that targeted next-generation sequencing assays have the potential to identify such rearrangements; however, their utility in the clinical laboratory is unknown. We examine the sensitivity and specificity of ALK and KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement detection by next-generation sequencing in the clinical laboratory. We analyzed a series of seven ALK rearranged cancers, six KMT2A rearranged leukemias, and 77 ALK/KMT2A rearrangement-negative cancers, previously tested by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Rearrangement detection was tested using publicly available software tools, including Breakdancer, ClusterFAST, CREST, and Hydra. Using Breakdancer and ClusterFAST, we detected ALK rearrangements in seven of seven FISH-positive cases and KMT2A rearrangements in six of six FISH-positive cases. Among the 77 ALK/KMT2A FISH-negative cases, no false-positive identifications were made by Breakdancer or ClusterFAST. Further, we identified one ALK rearranged case with a noncanonical intron 16 breakpoint, which is likely to affect its response to targeted inhibitors. We report that clinically relevant chromosomal rearrangements can be detected from targeted gene panel-based next-generation sequencing with sensitivity and specificity equivalent to that of FISH while providing finer-scale information and increased efficiency for molecular oncology testing.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the', 'Association for Molecular Pathology.

Conditional activation of a constitutively active oncogenic Nras (NrasG12D/G12D) in murine hematopoietic cells promotes an acute myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) that recapitulates many features of JMML and MP-CMML. We found that NrasG12D/G12D-expressing HSCs, which serve as JMML/MP-CMML-initiating cells, show strong hyperactivation of ERK1/2, promoting hyperproliferation and depletion of HSCs and expansion of downstream progenitors. Inhibition of the MEK pathway alone prolonged the presence of NrasG12D/G12D-expressing HSCs but failed to restore their proper function. Consequently, approximately 60% of NrasG12D/G12D mice treated with MEK inhibitor alone died within 20 weeks, and the remaining animals continued to display JMML/MP-CMML-like phenotypes. In contrast, combined inhibition of MEK and JAK/STAT signaling, which is commonly hyperactivated in human and mouse CMML, potently inhibited human and mouse CMML cell growth in vitro, rescued mutant NrasG12D/G12D-expressing HSC function in vivo, and promoted long-term survival without evident disease manifestation in NrasG12D/G12D animals.

We developed a murine CLL model that lacks the ER stress-associated transcription factor XBP-1 in B cells and found that XBP-1 deficiency decelerates malignant progression of CLL-associated disease. XBP-1 deficiency resulted in acquisition of phenotypes that are disadvantageous for leukemic cell survival, including compromised BCR signaling capability and increased surface expression of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1). Because XBP-1 expression requires the RNase activity of the ER transmembrane receptor IRE-1, we developed a potent IRE-1 RNase inhibitor through chemical synthesis and modified the structure to facilitate entry into cells to target the IRE-1/XBP-1 pathway. Treatment of CLL cells with this inhibitor (B-I09) mimicked XBP-1 deficiency, including upregulation of IRE-1 expression and compromised BCR signaling. Moreover, B-I09 treatment did not affect the transport of secretory and integral membrane-bound proteins.

This review highlights pleural effusions in acute and chronic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) based on the evidence to date. Diagnostic workup and recommendations for the management of these effusions are also outlined. RECENT FINDINGS: Pleural effusions in patients with leukemia are most often due to infection and to a lesser extent leukemic infiltration of the pleura. The prognostic implications of these effusions are unclear, but survival is most likely determined by the underlying malignancy and its response to treatment. New therapies have changed survival in these patients, and some of these treatments, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, have emerged as important causes for these effusions. Pleural interventions may be accomplished with few complications. SUMMARY: Pleural effusions may occur with acute and chronic leukemia and MDS. Infection remains the most common cause. Malignant pleural effusions tend to occur in advanced disease in chronic leukemia, but they can be seen at any time with acute leukemia and MDS. With standard precautions, pleural procedures may be performed safely in this population. In cases of unclear cause, pleural and bone marrow biopsy should be considered.",,"['Faiz, Saadia A', 'Sahay, Sandeep', 'Jimenez, Carlos A']","['Faiz SA', 'Sahay S', 'Jimenez CA']","['aDepartment of Pulmonary Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center bDivisions of Critical Care, Pulmonary and Sleep Medicine, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Pulm Med,Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,9503765,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Dasatinib', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/*pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*pathology', 'Pleura/pathology', 'Pleural Effusion/chemically induced/*etiology/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects', 'Thiazoles/adverse effects']",,,2014/05/09 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/05/10 06:00'],"['2014/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MCP.0000000000000060 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Pulm Med. 2014 Jul;20(4):340-6. doi: 10.1097/MCP.0000000000000060.,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both DAPK1 and p14(ARF) positively regulate p53 whereas miR-34a and -34b/c are direct transcriptional targets of p53. We studied if DNA methylation might contribute to inactivation of gene/microRNA (miRNA) in the TP53 tumour suppressor network. METHODS: Promoter methylation of DAPK1, p14(ARF), miR-34a and -34b/c were studied in 10 normal bone marrow samples, NB4 cell line and 60 APL primary samples at diagnosis by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). RESULTS: DAPK1, p14(ARF), miR-34a and -34b/c were completely unmethylated in normal bone marrow samples. DAPK1, miR-34a and -34b/c were completely methylated in NB4. Treatment of NB4 by 5'-Aza-2'-deoxyctidine resulted in promoter demethylation together with re-expression of DAPK1 and both miRNAs. In primary APL samples, methylation of miR-34b/c was detected in 43% in contrast to absence of methylation of DAPK1, p14(ARF) or miR-34a. Overexpression of miR-34b in NB4 resulted in inhibition of proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Methylation of DAPK1, miR-34a and -34b/c is tumour-specific, and associated with gene/miRNAs silencing. miR-34b/c is a tumour suppressor miRNA in APL. Methylation of miR-34b/c may contribute to APL leukaemogenesis.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Soluble Fas receptor (sFas), produced by skipping of exon 6, inhibits apoptosis by sequestering Fas ligand. Serum sFas is associated with poor prognosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. We found that the alternative splicing of Fas in lymphomas is tightly regulated by a long-noncoding RNA corresponding to an antisense transcript of Fas (FAS-AS1). Levels of FAS-AS1 correlate inversely with production of sFas, and FAS-AS1 binding to the RBM5 inhibits RBM5-mediated exon 6 skipping. EZH2, often mutated or overexpressed in lymphomas, hyper-methylates the FAS-AS1 promoter and represses the FAS-AS1 expression. EZH2-mediated repression of FAS-AS1 promoter can be released by DZNeP (3-Deazaneplanocin A) or overcome by ectopic expression of FAS-AS1, both of which increase levels of FAS-AS1 and correspondingly decrease expression of sFas. Treatment with Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor or EZH2 knockdown decreases the levels of EZH2, RBM5 and sFas, thereby enhancing Fas-mediated apoptosis. This is the first report showing functional regulation of Fas repression by its antisense RNA.

Although Noxa is a highly labile protein, recent studies suggested that it is degraded by the proteasome in a ubiquitylation-independent manner. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of Noxa degradation and its ability to regulate the stability of Mcl-1. We found that the ubiquitylation-independent degradation of Noxa does not require a physical association with Mcl-1. A short stretch of amino acid residues in the C-terminal tail was found to mediate the proteasome-dependent degradation of Noxa. Ectopic placement of this degron was able to render other proteins unstable. Surprisingly, mutation of this sequence not only attenuated the rapid degradation of Noxa, but also stabilized endogenous Mcl-1 through the BH3-mediated direct interaction.

In this review, we will discuss how RNA interference (RNAi) screening has emerged as a new and powerful tool to molecularly dissect various functional aspects of both normal and malignant HSCs, and how this may ultimately enable the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for clinical applications. RECENT FINDINGS: Advances in RNAi technology and the creation of short hairpin RNA retroviral and lentiviral vector-libraries have provided tools to perform broad forward genetic screens in primary mammalian hematopoietic cells. Recent studies have identified novel fate determinants in murine HSCs as well as potential targets for ex-vivo expansion of human HSCs. RNAi screens have further unraveled tumor suppressor genes associated with hematopoietic neoplasms as well as candidate therapeutic targets in leukemic cells.

With a focus on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 'not otherwise specified', Hodgkin lymphoma and childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, this review will provide an up-to-date account of the current literature on the development of new molecularly targeted treatment modalities for aggressive B-cell malignancies. RECENT FINDINGS: Subclassification of B-cell malignancies depending on their particular genetic 'driver' lesions and transcriptional and/or signaling signatures has led to the development of targeted therapeutic approaches using small molecule inhibitors to amend current combination chemotherapy. SUMMARY: Treatment outcome with current combination chemotherapy is still poor for subsets of aggressive B-cell malignancies, and demands development of targeted therapeutic approaches. Advanced gene expression profiling and genomic sequencing have revealed a more detailed landscape of recurrent alterations, allowing a better subclassification of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias. Many alterations directly or indirectly lead to activation of survival signaling pathways and expression of key oncoproteins and prosurvival molecules, including Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT), phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR), avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCLl-2).

Likewise, the majority of B-cell malignancies remain dependent on functional BCR signaling, whereas in some subtypes BCR expression is missing and, apparently, counterselected. Here, we summarize the recent experimental evidence for the importance of BCR signaling and clinical concepts to target the BCR pathway in B-cell leukemia and lymphoma. RECENT FINDINGS: Although the dependency on pre-BCR signaling in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) seems to be limited to few ALL subtypes (e.g. TCF3-PBX1), most mature B-cell lymphomas rely on BCR signaling provided by different stimuli, for example tonic B-cell signaling, chronic (auto)-antigen exposure, and self-binding properties of the BCR. The finding that in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, BCRs bind to an epitope on the BCR itself unravels a novel concept for chronic lymphocytic leukemia pathogenesis. SUMMARY: Targeting of the B-cell receptor tyrosine kinases spleen tyrosine kinase, Bruton's tyrosine kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase achieve promising clinical responses in various mature B-cell malignancies and might also be useful in defined subsets of ALL.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared patients with and without the mutation, and also patients with the homozygous and heterozygous mutation, in terms of different clinical and laboratory features. RESULTS: The JAK2 V617F mutation was detected in 77 (95%), 88 (68%), and 17 (77%) of polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) patients, respectively. Among JAK2 V617F-positive patients, the homozygous genotype was found in 39 (50.6%) of the 77 PV, 23 (26.1%) of the 88 ET, and 11 (64.7%) of the 17 PMF patients. Bleeding was seen in 14 (6%) of all patients. Upper gastrointestinal bleeds were the most common, seen in 11 patients. Out of 232 CMPN patients, 44 (19%) had thrombosis. The most common thrombotic event was transient ischemic attack (52%). Progression to myelofibrosis was seen in 1 (1.2%) PV and 3 (2.3%) ET patients, and progression to acute leukemia was seen in 2 (2.5%) PV and 3 (2.3%) ET patients. Three patients with PV (3.7%), 3 with ET (2.7%), and 5 with PMF (2.7%) died during follow-up. CONCLUSION: JAK2 V617F mutation frequencies in our PV and ET patients were similar to those reported previously. JAK2 V617F mutation frequency in our PMF patients was greater than in previous reports. All of our PV patients with thrombosis and most of our ET patients with thrombosis (76.1%) were JAK2 V617F mutation-positive.

To gain insight into the perceived need for information in relation to sociodemographic and clinical parameters, comorbidity, quality of life (QoL) and information satisfaction, we compiled a questionnaire based on existing validated questionnaires. A total of 458 patients diagnosed with a haematological malignancy participated. The perceived need for information was moderate to high (40-70%). Multivariate regression analyses showed that a higher need for information was related to younger age, worse QoL, being member of a patient society and moderate comorbidity. The need for disease and treatment-related information was higher than the need for psychosocial information. A higher need for disease and treatment-related information was associated to being diagnosed with multiple myeloma. A higher need for psychosocial information was related to a lower educational level. The information provision could be improved according to 41% of the patients.

This study examined access to rituximab and identified potential barriers to its use in the United States, Mexico, Turkey, Russia, and Brazil. The study also examined whether availability of a biosimilar to rituximab would improve access to, and use of, rituximab. Overall, 450 hematologists and oncologists completed a survey examining their use of rituximab in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Less than 40% of physicians considered rituximab as easy to access from a cost perspective. Furthermore, many physicians chose not to treat, were unable to treat, or had to modify treatment with rituximab despite guidelines recommending its use in NHL and CLL patients. Insurance coverage, reimbursement, and cost to patient were commonly reported as barriers to the use of rituximab.

Thirty-five rabbits were used in a Colombo model of experimental osteoarthritis (OA). Five rabbits each were sacrificed on postoperative days 3, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, and 84. Immunohistochemistry analysis for LIF expression and distribution in the cartilage and synovium of animals was performed at these times. Sixty-seven samples of human articular tissue were obtained from patients with different grades of OA according to symptoms and radiographic inspection. The mRNA expression of LIF was determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and LIF protein was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed a slight expression of LIF in normal cartilage tissue but less in synovium tissue; however, the expression of LIF was marked in synovial lining cells and superficial and middle-layer cartilage in animal OA (P<.05). Leukemia inhibitory factor mRNA was expressed at the highest level in moderate degrading subchondral bone, and LIF was expressed at the highest level in seriously degrading articular cartilage tissue. These results were similar to those found with ELISA. This study suggests that LIF in OA articular tissues varies by clinical symptoms and grade. It plays an important role in the pathogenesis of OA.","['Copyright 2014, SLACK Incorporated.']","['Jiang, YuWen', 'Xiao, Qiang', 'Hu, ZhenMing', 'Pu, Bo', 'Shu, Jun', 'Yang, QingQiu', 'Lao, HanChang', 'Hao, Jie']","['Jiang Y', 'Xiao Q', 'Hu Z', 'Pu B', 'Shu J', 'Yang Q', 'Lao H', 'Hao J']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Orthopedics,Orthopedics,7806107,IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Cartilage, Articular/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteoarthritis/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rabbits', 'Synovial Membrane/chemistry']",,,2014/05/09 06:00,2014/11/07 06:00,['2014/05/10 06:00'],"['2012/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3928/01477447-20140430-57 [doi]'],ppublish,Orthopedics. 2014 May;37(5):e460-4. doi: 10.3928/01477447-20140430-57.,"['0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our study was to evaluate the potential genes with aberrant DNA methylation in the prediction of leukemia risk by a comprehensive meta-analysis of the published data. METHODS: A series of meta-analyses were done among the eligible studies that were harvested after a careful filtration of the searching results from PubMed literature database. Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed for each methylation event assuming the appropriate model. RESULTS: A total of 535 publications were initially retrieved from PubMed literature database. After a three-step filtration, we harvested 41 case-control articles that studied the role of gene methylation in the prediction of leukemia risk. Among the involving 30 genes, 20 genes were shown to be aberrantly methylated in the leukemia patients. A further subgroup meta-analysis by subtype of leukemia showed that CDKN2A, CDKN2B, ID4 genes were significantly hypermethylated in acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analyses identified strong associations between a number of genes with aberrant DNA methylation and leukemia.

Nevertheless, in some cancers STAT1 can act in an anti-apoptotic manner. Moreover, certain malignancies are characterized by the overexpression and constitutive activation of STAT1. Here, we demonstrate that the treatment of transformed hematopoietic cells with epigenetic drugs belonging to the class of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) leads to the cleavage of STAT1 at multiple sites by caspase-3 and caspase-6. This process does not occur in solid tumor cells, normal hematopoietic cells, and leukemic cells that underwent granulocytic or monocytic differentiation. STAT1 cleavage was studied under cell free conditions with purified STAT1 and a set of candidate caspases as well as with mass spectrometry. These assays indicate that unmodified STAT1 is cleaved at multiple sites by caspase-3 and caspase-6.

However, the routine application of this strategy has been hampered by the difficulties in generating sufficient numbers of DC and the poor DC vaccine quality because of pathology or prior treatment received by the patients. The immunotherapeutic potential of other subsets of DC has not been thoroughly investigated because of their rarity in tissues and difficulties associated with their ex vivo generation. The high expansion and differentiation potential of CD34 hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC), isolated from umbilical cord blood (UCB), into different DC subsets make them an attractive alternative DC source for cancer immunotherapy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to generate a large number of different DC subsets from CD34 HPC and evaluate their functionality in comparison with MoDC. Our culture protocol generated a clinically relevant number of mature CD1a myeloid DC and CD207 Langerhans cells (LC)-like DC subsets from CD34 HPC with >95% purity. Both DC subsets exhibited a cytokine profile that favors cytotoxic T-cell responses. Furthermore, UCB-DC and UCB-LC demonstrated superior induction of proliferation of both allogeneic as well as viral antigen-specific CD8 T cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Additional studies revealed that UCC-DC and UCB-LC can efficiently expand minor histocompatibility antigen (MiHA) HA-1-specific cytotoxic T cells in the peripheral blood of leukemia patients and prime MiHA HA-1-specific and HA-2-specific cytotoxic T cells in vitro.

Optimized formulation had particle size of 166.4+/-2.42 nm, and entrapment of 56.48+/-3.63%. TEM image revealed discrete spherical structures of NPs. DSC and FTIR studies confirmed absence of interaction between drug and polymer. In vitro and ex vivo studies demonstrated sustained release from the NPs. The enhanced absorption and uptake of NPs in Caco-2 cells and in vivo absorption in intestinal tissue after oral delivery in rats was confirmed by confocal microscopy. Transport studies in Caco-2 cells confirmed 6.37-fold permeability for NPs. In vitro antiproliferative studies confirmed marked cytotoxicity of NPs on K562 leukemia cell lines.

Pathogenic mosaic TP53 mutations have only rarely been described. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We describe a 2 years old child presenting with three separate cancers over a 6 month period; two soft tissue mesenchymal tumors and an aggressive metastatic neuroblastoma. As conventional testing of blood DNA by Sanger sequencing for mutations in TP53, ALK, and SDH was negative, whole exome sequencing of the blood DNA of the patient and both parents was performed to screen more widely for cancer predisposing mutations. In the patient's but not the parents' DNA we found a c.743 G>A, p.Arg248Gln (CCDS11118.1) TP53 mutation in 3-20% of sequencing reads, a level that would not generally be detectable by Sanger sequencing. Homozygosity for this mutation was detected in all tumor samples analyzed, and germline mosaicism was demonstrated by analysis of the child's newborn blood spot DNA. The occurrence of separate tumors derived from different germ layers suggests that this de novo mutation occurred early in embryogenesis, prior to gastrulation. CONCLUSION: The case demonstrates pathogenic mosaicim, detected by next generation deep sequencing, that arose in the early stages of embryogenesis.",,"['Behjati, Sam', 'Maschietto, Mariana', 'Williams, Richard D', 'Side, Lucy', 'Hubank, Mike', 'West, Rebecca', 'Pearson, Katie', 'Sebire, Neil', 'Tarpey, Patrick', 'Futreal, Andrew', 'Brooks, Tony', 'Stratton, Michael R', 'Anderson, John']","['Behjati S', 'Maschietto M', 'Williams RD', 'Side L', 'Hubank M', 'West R', 'Pearson K', 'Sebire N', 'Tarpey P', 'Futreal A', 'Brooks T', 'Stratton MR', 'Anderson J']","['Cancer Genome Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom; Department of Paediatrics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Unit of Molecular Haematology and Cancer Biology, UCL Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom.', 'Unit of Molecular Haematology and Cancer Biology, UCL Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom.', 'Departments of Clinical Genetics, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, United Kingdom.', 'Unit of Molecular Haematology and Cancer Biology, UCL Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom.', 'Unit of Molecular Haematology and Cancer Biology, UCL Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom.', 'Unit of Molecular Haematology and Cancer Biology, UCL Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom.', 'Departments of Histopathology, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Unit of Molecular Haematology and Cancer Biology, UCL Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Genome Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom.', 'Unit of Molecular Haematology and Cancer Biology, UCL Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140508,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Li-Fraumeni Syndrome/*genetics', 'Male', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",,,2014/05/09 06:00,2015/10/16 06:00,['2014/05/10 06:00'],"['2014/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0096531 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-55145 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 May 8;9(5):e96531. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0096531. eCollection 2014.,"['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,PMC4014518,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now report that, Meis1 overexpression in primary Prep1-deficient (Prep1i/i) embryonic hematopoietic cells increases self-renewal potential of cells in vitro but not in vivo, whereas leukemia is instead obtained when Meis1 is combined with another oncogene, HoxA9. Prep1i/i Meis1-HoxA9-generated leukemic cells are less differentiated and grow more aggressively after the second passage in the mouse. These data indicate that Prep1 represents a barrier to the transforming activity of Meis1 in vitro, but its absence is not sufficient to induce early leukemogenesis. On the other hand, the Prep1i/i background appears to favor the insurgence of mutations that cause a more aggressive Meis1-HoxA9-generated leukemia. Indeed, the Prep1i/i leukemic cells upregulate the Polycomb protein Bmi-1 and expectedly down-regulate the Ink4a/Arf locus products.

It is broadly expressed on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts and, possibly, some leukemic stem cells and has therefore been exploited as target for therapeutic antibodies for many years. The improved survival seen in many patients when the antibody-drug conjugate, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, is added to conventional chemotherapy validates this approach. However, many attempts with unconjugated or conjugated antibodies have been unsuccessful, highlighting the challenges of targeting CD33 in AML. With the development of improved immunoconjugates and CD33-directed strategies that harness immune effector cells, therapeutics with enhanced efficacy may soon become available. Toxic effects on normal hematopoietic cells may increase in parallel with this increased efficacy and demand new supportive care measures, including possibly rescue with donor cells, to minimize morbidity and mortality from drug-induced cytopenias and to optimize treatment outcomes with these agents in patients with AML.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in patients who have acute myeloid leukemia is challenging: the leukemia-related thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, and systemic coagulopathy increase the risk of bleeding, and the administration of thrombolytic agents can be fatal. We report the case of a 76-year-old man who presented emergently with STEMI, myelodysplastic syndrome, and newly recognized acute myeloid leukemia transformation. Standard antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy were contraindicated by the patient's thrombocytopenia and by his reported ecchymosis and gingival bleeding upon admission. He declined cardiac catheterization, was provided palliative care, and died 2 hours after hospital admission. We searched the English-language medical literature, found 8 relevant reports, and determined that the prognosis for patients with concomitant STEMI and acute myeloid leukemia is clearly worse than that for either individual condition. No guidelines exist to direct the management of STEMI and concomitant acute myeloid leukemia. In 2 reports, dual antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, and drug-eluting stent implantation were used without an increased risk of bleeding in the short term, even in the presence of thrombocytopenia. However, we think that a more conservative approach--balloon angioplasty with the provisional use of bare-metal stents--might be safer. Simultaneous chemotherapy for the acute myeloid leukemia is crucial.

Despite its harmlessness, EDTA-PTCP frequently leads to time-consuming, costly and even invasive diagnostic investigations. EDTA-PTCP is often overlooked because blood smears are not evaluated visually in routine practice and histograms as well as warning flags of hematology analyzers are not interpreted correctly. Nonetheless, EDTA-PTCP may be diagnosed easily even by general practitioners without any experiences in blood film examinations. This is the first report illustrating the typical patterns of a platelet (PLT) and white blood cell (WBC) histograms of hematology analyzers. CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old female patient of Caucasian origin was referred with suspected acute leukemia and the crew of the emergency unit arranged extensive investigations for work-up. However, examination of EDTA blood sample revealed atypical lymphocytes and an isolated thrombocytopenia together with typical patterns of WBC and PLT histograms: a serrated curve of the platelet histogram and a peculiar peak on the left side of the WBC histogram. EDTA-PTCP was confirmed by a normal platelet count when examining citrated blood. CONCLUSION: Awareness of typical PLT and WBC patterns may alert to the presence of EDTA-PTCP in routine laboratory practice helping to avoid unnecessary investigations and over-treatment.",,"['Nagler, Michael', 'Keller, Peter', 'Siegrist, Daniel', 'Alberio, Lorenzo']","['Nagler M', 'Keller P', 'Siegrist D', 'Alberio L']","['Department of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, Inselspital University Hospital and University of Berne, CH-3010 Berne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, Inselspital University Hospital and University of Berne, CH-3010 Berne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, Inselspital University Hospital and University of Berne, CH-3010 Berne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, Inselspital University Hospital and University of Berne, CH-3010 Berne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20140501,England,BMC Clin Pathol,BMC clinical pathology,101088665,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hematology analyzers', 'Laboratory hematology', 'Thrombocytopenia']",2014/05/09 06:00,2014/05/09 06:01,['2014/05/09 06:00'],"['2013/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/1472-6890-14-19 [doi]', '1472-6890-14-19 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Clin Pathol. 2014 May 1;14:19. doi: 10.1186/1472-6890-14-19. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4012027,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gammat (RORgammat)-gfp mice, we found that RORgammat and the transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) are valuable new markers to identify the recently described natural Th17 (nTh17) cell population. nTh17 cells are thymically committed to promptly produce large amounts of IL-17 and IL-22. In this study, we show that, in addition to responding to TCR cross-linking, nTh17 cells secrete IL-17 and IL-22 when stimulated with IL-23 plus IL-1beta, either in recombinant form or in supernatants from TLR4-activated dendritic cells. This innate-like ability of RORgammat(+) nTh17 cells to respond to TLR4-induced cytokines was not shared by iTh17 cells. The other distinct properties of RORgammat(+) nTh17 cells are their high expression of PLZF and their absence from lamina propria; iTh17 cells are found therein. RORgammat(+) nTh17 cells are present in the thymus of germ-free RORgammat-gfp and IL-6(-/-) RORGamma: t-gfp mice, indicating that these cells do not require symbiotic microbiota or IL-6 for their generation. Finally, we found that PLZF(+)RORgammat(+) nTh17 cells represent one of the primary IL-17-producing innate-like T cell populations in a TLR7 imiquimod model of psoriasis-like disorder, indicating their involvement in this kind of lesion. Collectively, our results reveal RORgammat and PLZF as characteristic markers for identifying nTh17 cells and demonstrate one of their novel properties: the ability to respond promptly to TLR-dependent proinflammatory stimuli without TCR engagement, placing them as members of the innate-like T cell family.","['Copyright (c) 2014 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Massot, Berangere', 'Michel, Marie-Laure', 'Diem, Severine', 'Ohnmacht, Caspar', 'Latour, Sylvain', 'Dy, Michel', 'Eberl, Gerard', 'Leite-de-Moraes, Maria C']","['Massot B', 'Michel ML', 'Diem S', 'Ohnmacht C', 'Latour S', 'Dy M', 'Eberl G', 'Leite-de-Moraes MC']","['Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 8147, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75015 Paris, France; Institut Necker Enfants Malades, INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche 1151, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique Unite Mixte de Recherche 8253, 75015 Paris, France;', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 8147, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75015 Paris, France; Institut Necker Enfants Malades, INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche 1151, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique Unite Mixte de Recherche 8253, 75015 Paris, France;', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 8147, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75015 Paris, France;', 'Institut Pasteur, Lymphoid Tissue Development Unit, 75724 Paris, France; and.', ""Institut Imagine, INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche 1163, Laboratoire Activation Lymphocytaire et Susceptibilite a l'EBV, Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75015 Paris, France."", 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 8147, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75015 Paris, France; Institut Necker Enfants Malades, INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche 1151, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique Unite Mixte de Recherche 8253, 75015 Paris, France;', 'Institut Pasteur, Lymphoid Tissue Development Unit, 75724 Paris, France; and.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 8147, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75015 Paris, France; Institut Necker Enfants Malades, INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche 1151, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique Unite Mixte de Recherche 8253, 75015 Paris, France; maria.leite-de-moraes@parisdescartes.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140507,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Aminoquinolines/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cytokines/genetics/*immunology', 'Imiquimod', 'Inflammation/chemically induced/genetics/immunology', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 3/genetics/immunology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Psoriasis/chemically induced/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Th17 Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/genetics/*immunology']",,,2014/05/09 06:00,2014/08/19 06:00,['2014/05/09 06:00'],"['2014/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1302089 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1302089 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2014 Jun 15;192(12):5635-42. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1302089.

It has demonstrated inhibitory activity against native BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase and a variety of BCR-ABL mutants, including T315I. Ponatinib is approved for the treatment of adults with T315I-positive chronic-, accelerated- or blast-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), or Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) [in the EU and the USA], as well as those with chronic-, accelerated- or blast-phase CML, or Ph+ ALL who are resistant or intolerant to prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (EU) or for whom no other tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy is indicated (USA). In a noncomparative, multinational, phase II study, therapy with ponatinib was associated with a major cytogenetic response within the first 12 months in over half of adults with chronic-phase CML and major haematological responses within the first 6 months in at least 50% of adults with accelerated-phase CML and approximately 34% of adults with blast-phase CML or Ph+ ALL after a median follow-up duration of 15, 16 and 6 months, respectively. Such benefits were observed regardless of whether the patients were resistant to dasatinib or nilotinib, or had the T315I mutation. Serious adverse reactions have been reported with ponatinib, with vascular occlusion, heart failure and hepatotoxicity prompting the US FDA to issue boxed warnings. Ponatinib is a valuable treatment option for adults with T315I-positive chronic-, accelerated- or blast-phase CML, or Ph+ ALL, as well as those with chronic-, accelerated- or blast-phase CML, or Ph+ ALL who are resistant or intolerant to prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, but before starting treatment, clinicians need to consider whether the potential benefits of therapy will outweigh the risks.",,"['Hoy, Sheridan M']",['Hoy SM'],"['Adis, 41 Centorian Drive, Private Bag 65901, Mairangi Bay, North Shore, 0754, Auckland, New Zealand, demail@springer.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyridazines/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",,,2014/05/09 06:00,2015/05/26 06:00,['2014/05/09 06:00'],"['2014/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s40265-014-0216-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs. 2014 May;74(7):793-806. doi: 10.1007/s40265-014-0216-6.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ABL-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) induce minimal apoptosis in CML progenitor cells, yet exert potent antiproliferative effects, through as yet poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that in CD34+ CML cells, FOXO1 and 3a are inactivated and relocalized to the cytoplasm by BCR-ABL activity. TKIs caused a decrease in phosphorylation of FOXOs, leading to their relocalization from cytoplasm (inactive) to nucleus (active), where they modulated the expression of key FOXO target genes, such as Cyclin D1, ATM, CDKN1C, and BCL6 and induced G1 arrest. Activation of FOXO1 and 3a and a decreased expression of their target gene Cyclin D1 were also observed after 6 days of in vivo treatment with dasatinib in a CML transgenic mouse model. The over-expression of FOXO3a in CML cells combined with TKIs to reduce proliferation, with similar results seen for inhibitors of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. While stable expression of an active FOXO3a mutant induced a similar level of quiescence to TKIs alone, shRNA-mediated knockdown of FOXO3a drove CML cells into cell cycle and potentiated TKI-induced apoptosis. These data demonstrate that TKI-induced G1 arrest in CML cells is mediated through inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway and reactivation of FOXOs. This enhanced understanding of TKI activity and induced progenitor cell quiescence suggests that new therapeutic strategies for CML should focus on manipulation of this signaling network.","['(c) 2014 The Authors.

Recently, elevated serum tryptase has been detected in certain patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the underlying mechanism for the regulation of tryptase expression remains elusive. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of stem cell factor (SCF)/C-KIT signaling in regulating the expression of tryptase in AML cells. We found a significant positive correlation between tryptase and C-KIT expression levels in AML patients. Furthermore, real-time PCR, Western blot and ELISA analysis showed that SCF upregulated tryptase mRNA and protein expression in U937 cells, and that this effect was abolished by pretreatment with PD98059 and SB230580. In addition, levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and p38MAPK correlated with tryptase levels.

Drugs for therapeutic thrombolysis include streptokinase, urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). There is less experience with recombinant t-PA (rt-PA) in children. We aimed to present our experiences with rt-PA in children with intracardiac or peripheral arterial thrombus. We retrospectively reviewed the children who received rt-PA for thrombus. Twenty-two children (13 boys, 9 girls; age range: 1 day-17 years) with intracardiac (n = 5), prosthetic heart valve (n = 2) and peripheral arterial (n = 15) thrombus were evaluated. Twelve (54%) had congenital heart disease, two (9%) had rheumatic heart disease, three (14%) had leukemia and five (23%) had documented sepsis, prematurity or meconium aspiration syndrome. Ten of the 15 peripheral arterial thromboses were observed following cardiac catheterization. Three of the five intracardiac thrombi were detected in children with leukemia. All children received low-molecular-weight heparin. rt-PA (alteplase) infusion (at a dose of 0.01-0.5 mg/kg per h) was administered for different time periods (3-66 h). Ten of 11 patients with peripheral arterial occlusion and three of five patients with intracardiac thrombus showed full recovery. However, there was no response in two patients with intracardiac thrombus and in two patients with heart valve thrombus. Nose bleeding, melena and decreased serum fibrinogen concentration were observed in seven patients during the rt-PA infusion. All bleedings stopped after cessation of rt-PA infusion, and no blood transfusion was required in any patient.

How processing affects sensitization capacity is generally studied by administration of purified food proteins or food extracts and not allergens present in their natural food matrix. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to investigate if thermal processing increases sensitization potential of whole peanuts via the oral route. In parallel, the effect of heating on sensitization potential of the major peanut allergen Ara h 1 was assessed via the intraperitoneal route. METHODS: Sensitization potential of processed peanut products and Ara h 1 was examined in Brown Norway (BN) rats by oral administration of blanched or oil-roasted peanuts or peanut butter or by intraperitoneal immunization of purified native (N-), heated (H-) or heat glycated (G-)Ara h 1. Levels of specific IgG and IgE were determined by ELISA and IgE functionality was examined by rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cell assay. RESULTS: In rats dosed orally, roasted peanuts induced significant higher levels of specific IgE to NAra h 1 and 2 than blanched peanuts or peanut butter but with the lowest level of RBL degranulation. However, extract from roasted peanuts was found to be a superior elicitor of RBL degranulation. Process-modified Ara h 1 had similar sensitizing capacity as NAra h 1 but specific IgE reacted more readily with process-modified Ara h 1 than with native. CONCLUSIONS: Peanut products induce functional specific IgE when dosed orally to BN rats. Roasted peanuts do not have a higher sensitizing capacity than blanched peanuts. In spite of this, extract from roasted peanuts is a superior elicitor of RBL cell degranulation irrespectively of the peanut product used for sensitization. The results also suggest that new epitopes are formed or disclosed by heating Ara h 1 without glucose.",,"['Kroghsbo, Stine', 'Rigby, Neil M', 'Johnson, Philip E', 'Adel-Patient, Karine', 'Bogh, Katrine L', 'Salt, Louise J', 'Mills, E N Clare', 'Madsen, Charlotte B']","['Kroghsbo S', 'Rigby NM', 'Johnson PE', 'Adel-Patient K', 'Bogh KL', 'Salt LJ', 'Mills EN', 'Madsen CB']","['National Food Institute, Technical University of Denmark, Soborg, Denmark.', 'Institute of Food Research, Norwich Research Park, Colney, Norwich, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Food Research, Norwich Research Park, Colney, Norwich, United Kingdom.', ""INRA, UR496, Unite d'Immuno-Allergie Alimentaire, Jouy-en-Josas, France."", 'National Food Institute, Technical University of Denmark, Soborg, Denmark.', 'Institute of Food Research, Norwich Research Park, Colney, Norwich, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Food Research, Norwich Research Park, Colney, Norwich, United Kingdom.', 'National Food Institute, Technical University of Denmark, Soborg, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140507,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Allergens/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Arachis/*immunology', 'Food Handling/*methods', 'Hot Temperature', 'Immunoglobulin E/*blood/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/*blood/immunology', 'Peanut Hypersensitivity/*immunology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN']",,,2014/05/09 06:00,2015/10/08 06:00,['2014/05/09 06:00'],"['2013/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0096475 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-46321 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 May 7;9(5):e96475. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0096475. eCollection 2014.,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",,PMC4013017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PTEN dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate, thereby opposing the activity of class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases that mediate growth- and survival-factor signalling through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase effectors such as AKT and mTOR. To determine whether continued PTEN inactivation is required to maintain malignancy, here we generate an RNA interference-based transgenic mouse model that allows tetracycline-dependent regulation of PTEN in a time- and tissue-specific manner. Postnatal Pten knockdown in the haematopoietic compartment produced highly disseminated T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Notably, reactivation of PTEN mainly reduced T-cell leukaemia dissemination but had little effect on tumour load in haematopoietic organs. Leukaemia infiltration into the intestine was dependent on CCR9 G-protein-coupled receptor signalling, which was amplified by PTEN loss. Our results suggest that in the absence of PTEN, G-protein-coupled receptors may have an unanticipated role in driving tumour growth and invasion in an unsupportive environment. They further reveal that the role of PTEN loss in tumour maintenance is not invariant and can be influenced by the tissue microenvironment, thereby producing a form of intratumoral heterogeneity that is independent of cancer genotype.",,"['Miething, Cornelius', 'Scuoppo, Claudio', 'Bosbach, Benedikt', 'Appelmann, Iris', 'Nakitandwe, Joy', 'Ma, Jing', 'Wu, Gang', 'Lintault, Laura', 'Auer, Martina', 'Premsrirut, Prem K', 'Teruya-Feldstein, Julie', 'Hicks, James', 'Benveniste, Helene', 'Speicher, Michael R', 'Downing, James R', 'Lowe, Scott W']","['Miething C', 'Scuoppo C', 'Bosbach B', 'Appelmann I', 'Nakitandwe J', 'Ma J', 'Wu G', 'Lintault L', 'Auer M', 'Premsrirut PK', 'Teruya-Feldstein J', 'Hicks J', 'Benveniste H', 'Speicher MR', 'Downing JR', 'Lowe SW']","['1] Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA [2] Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA [3] Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', '1] Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA [2] Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA."", '1] Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA [2] Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Medical University of Graz, A-8010 Graz, Austria.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA.', 'Departments of Anesthesiology and Radiology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York 11794, USA.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Medical University of Graz, A-8010 Graz, Austria.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA."", '1] Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA [2] Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA [3] Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New York, New York 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140504,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Animals', 'Chemokines/metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*physiology']",,,2014/05/09 06:00,2014/07/18 06:00,['2014/05/09 06:00'],"['2013/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/18 06:00 [medline]']","['nature13239 [pii]', '10.1038/nature13239 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2014 Jun 19;510(7505):402-6. doi: 10.1038/nature13239.

AIM: To assess the pathological role of amoeboid neutrophils, we investigated amoeboid neutrophils in the peripheral blood of children with leukemia. METHODS: Amoeboid neutrophils were examined in peripheral blood from 12 children with acute B-cell precursor lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). Eight children with short stature served as healthy control subjects. RESULTS: The percentage of amoeboid neutrophils (per total neutrophil count) at onset or relapse of BCP-ALL was significantly higher than at remission. Children with short stature showed a lower percentage of amoeboid neutrophils than did children with acute leukemia.

A Fe(salen)Cl derivative has been synthesized that remains active in monomer form. The efficacy of this compound as an anti-tumor agent has been investigated in mouse and human leukemia cell lines. Fe(salen)Cl induces cell death specifically in tumor cells and not in primary cells. Mouse and human T-cell leukemia cell lines, EL4 and Jurkat cells are found to be susceptible to Fe(salen)Cl and undergo apoptosis, but normal mouse spleen cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) remain largely unaffected by Fe(salen)Cl. Fe(salen)Cl treated tumor cells show significantly higher expression level of cytochrome c that might have triggered the cascade of reactions leading to apoptosis in cancer cells. A significant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential upon Fe(salen)Cl treatment suggests that Fe(salen)Cl induces apoptosis by disrupting mitochondrial membrane potential and homeostasis, leading to cytotoxity. We also established that apoptosis in the Fe(salen)Cl-treated tumor cells is mediated through caspase-dependent pathway.

Its efficacy and toxicity may depend on many methodological aspects. The goal of the current study was to explore current clinical practice in this field. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all centers collaborating in the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation and included 19 questions regarding various aspects of TBI. A total of 56 centers from 23 countries responded. RESULTS: All centers differed with regard to at least 1 answer. The total maximum dose of TBI used for myeloablative transplantation ranged from 8 grays (Gy) to 14.4 Gy, whereas the dose per fraction was 1.65 Gy to 8 Gy. A total of 16 dose/fractionation modalities were identified. The dose rate ranged from 2.25 centigrays to 37.5 centigrays per minute. The treatment unit was linear accelerator (LINAC) (91%) or cobalt unit (9%). Beams (photons) used for LINAC were reported to range from 6 to 25 megavolts. The most frequent technique used for irradiation was ""patient in 1 field,"" in which 2 fields and 2 patient positions per fraction are used (64%). In 41% of centers, patients were immobilized during TBI. Approximately 93% of centers used in vivo dosimetry with accepted discrepancies between the planned and measured doses of 1.5% to 10%. In 84% of centers, the lungs were shielded during irradiation. The maximum accepted dose for the lungs was 6 Gy to 14.4 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: TBI is an extremely heterogeneous treatment modality.

Of 130 cases with peripheral blood flow cytometry, 15 had a blast count of </=1%, with 14 having electronic files for gating monocytes. The percentage of monocytes by flow cytometry and absolute monocyte counts (AMCs) were compared with peripheral blood samples that were negative by flow cytometry, sent due to cytopenia of at least 1 lineage (n = 39). The monocytes from the patients with leukemia averaged 0.8% and were statistically fewer than the negative controls, which averaged 7.1% (P < 0.001). Eleven of the 14 (79%) patients with leukemia had monocytes <1%, compared to only 3 (8%) of the negative controls. The AMCs were also significantly lower (P < 0.001), with 93% of the leukemia group having an AMC <100 cells/microL, compared to only 28% of the negative controls. In patients with cytopenias, percentage of monocytes may be an important diagnostic clue in determining the presence of occult leukemia.

Adenosine triphosphate ATP-binding cassette (ABCB5) and MDR1 genes are integral membrane proteins belonging to ATP-binding cassette transporters superfamily. PURPOSE: The present work aimed to investigate the impact of ABCB5 and MDR1 genes expression on the response to chemotherapy in a cohort of Egyptian AL patients. The study included 90 patients: 53 AML cases and 37 ALL cases in addition to 20 healthy volunteers as controls. METHODS: Quantitative assessment of MDR1 and ABCB5 genes expression was performed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Additional prognostic molecular markers were determined as internal tandem duplications of the FLT3 gene (FLT3-ITD) and nucleophosmin gene mutation (NPM1) for AML cases, and mbcr-abl fusion transcript for B-ALL cases. RESULTS: In AML patients, ABCB5 and MDR1 expression levels did not differ significantly between de novo and relapsed cases and did not correlate with the overall survival or disease-free survival. AML patients were stratified according to the studied genetic markers, and complete remission rate was found to be more prominent in patients having low expression of MDR1 and ABCB5 genes together with mutated NPM1 gene. In ALL patients, ABCB5 gene expression level was significantly higher in relapsed cases and MDR1 gene expression was significantly higher in patients with resistant disease. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the results obtained by the current study provide additional evidence of the role played by these genes as predictive factors for resistance of leukemic cells to chemotherapy and hence treatment outcome.",,"['Farawela, Hala M', 'Khorshied, Mervat M', 'Kassem, Neemat M', 'Kassem, Heba A', 'Zawam, Hamdy M']","['Farawela HM', 'Khorshied MM', 'Kassem NM', 'Kassem HA', 'Zawam HM']","['Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140508,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Egypt', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/05/09 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2014/05/09 06:00'],"['2014/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-014-1694-3 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2014 Aug;140(8):1323-30. doi: 10.1007/s00432-014-1694-3.

This syndrome is characterized by an array of severe neurological impairments that in part originate from striatal dysfunctions. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these dysfunctions remain largely unidentified. In this report, we demonstrate that HPRT-deficiency causes dysregulated expression of key genes essential for striatal patterning, most notably the striatally-enriched transcription factor B-cell leukemia 11b (Bcl11b). The data also reveal that the down-regulated expression of Bcl11b in HPRT-deficient immortalized mouse striatal (STHdh) neural stem cells is accompanied by aberrant expression of some of its transcriptional partners and other striatally-enriched genes, including the gene encoding dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 32, (DARPP-32). Furthermore, we demonstrate that components of the BDNF/TrkB signaling, a known activator of DARPP-32 striatal expression and effector of Bcl11b transcriptional activation are markedly increased in HPRT-deficient cells and in the striatum of HPRT knockout mouse. Consequently, the HPRT-deficient cells display superior protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated cell death upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide. These findings suggest that the purine metabolic defect caused by HPRT-deficiency, while it may provide neuroprotection to striatal neurons, affects key genes and signaling pathways that may underlie the neuropathogenesis of LNS.",,"['Guibinga, Ghiabe-Henri', 'Barron, Nikki', 'Pandori, William']","['Guibinga GH', 'Barron N', 'Pandori W']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Genetics/Rady Children's Hospital, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, California, United States of America."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Genetics/Rady Children's Hospital, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, California, United States of America."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Genetics/Rady Children's Hospital, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, California, United States of America.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140507,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Death/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Corpus Striatum/metabolism/*pathology', 'Dopamine and cAMP-Regulated Phosphoprotein 32/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/*genetics', 'Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neurons/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptor, trkB/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics']",,,2014/05/09 06:00,2015/10/08 06:00,['2014/05/09 06:00'],"['2014/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0096575 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-03559 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 May 7;9(5):e96575. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0096575. eCollection 2014.,"['0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Dopamine and cAMP-Regulated Phosphoprotein 32)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, trkB)']",,PMC4013014,"['R24 DK082840/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK082840/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a consequence, small molecule inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases may provide powerful strategies for treatment. Following the successful introduction of imatinib in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, such drugs are also now evaluated for other types of cancer. However, many developed kinase inhibitors are not very target-specific and therefore may induce side effects. The importance of such side effects is certainly cell-proteome dependent. Understanding the all-inclusive action of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor on each individual cell-type entails the identification of potential targets, combined with monitoring the downstream effects revealing the signaling networks involved. Here, we explored a multilevel quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic strategy to identify the direct targets and downstream signaling effect of four tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and nilotinib) in epidermoid carcinoma cells, as a model system for skin-cancer. More than 25 tyrosine kinases showed affinity to the drugs, with imatinib and nilotinib displaying a high specificity, especially when compared to dasatinib and bosutinib. Consequently, the latter two drugs showed a larger effect on downstream phosphotyrosine signaling. Many of the proteins affected are key regulators in cell adhesion and invasion.

Nanocarrier preparations offer the opportunity to overcome these drawbacks, which is reflected in the clinical approval of two liposomal Dox preparations. Additionally, there are many attempts to enhance the activity of Dox against multi-drug resistant (MDR) cancer cells. However, most of these strategies resulted in the increased uptake of Dox in resistant cells, only, while it remained unchanged in chemo-sensitive cells. Here, we present a new polymeric-phospholipidic hybrid delivery system which distinctly enhanced the accumulation and activity of Dox in all tested cancer cell lines including several MDR cell models. Notably, the resistance levels against Dox were reduced from about 6-fold to about 2-fold. Moreover, the new nanocarriers were shown to rapidly (within 10 min) and effectively transport Dox into resistant as well as sensitive cancer cells. Consequently, treatment with the new Dox-containing nanocarriers resulted in effective cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase and ROS-induced cell death induction. Finally, the new nanocarriers were tested against NK/Ly lymphoma and L1210 leukemia cells in vivo. In both cell models, the nanoformulation of Dox resulted in 100% cured animals already at low concentrations (0.1 mg/kg), while free Dox solely extended survival time.

S phase arrest was induced by acetonitrile fractions which matched S phase arrest seen previously following whole PGJ treatments. The acetonitrile fractions contained higher phenol content than whole PGJ whereas only low levels of phenols were seen in any other fraction. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis demonstrated that acetonitrile fractions were enriched in ellagitannins, ellagic acid, and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives but depleted in anthocyanins.

Protease-activated receptors (PARs) comprise a family of trans-membrane G-protein coupled receptors. Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) is a typical member of this family of receptors that mediate cellular responses to thrombin and related proteases. PAR1 is expressed by a wide range of tumor cells and can promote tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. The aim of this work was to study the role of PAR-1 expression in newly diagnosed ALL patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was conducted on 44 children with newly diagnosed ALL who were admitted to Hematology Unit, Pediatric department, Tanta University Hospital including 24 males and 20 females with their age ranged from 4-17 years and their mean age value of 9.06+/-3.26. All patients were subjected to complete history taking, thorough clinical examination, bone marrow aspiration and flow cytometric analysis for detection of PAR-1 expression by malignant cells. RESULTS: PAR-1 was positive in 18 cases (41%) and negative in 26 cases (59%) of studied patients. This study showed no significant relation between PAR-1 expression and age, sex and most of the clinical data including hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and purpura while generalized lymphadenopathy was significantly higher in PAR-1 positive group. PAR-1 positive expression was associated with some bad prognostic laboratory parameters including higher hemoglobin, higher white blood cells, higher peripheral blood and bone marrow blast cells, higher serum LDH and lower platelets count. No significant association was detected between PAR-1 expression and immunophenotyping. There were significantly higher remission rates in PAR-1 negative group and significantly higher relapse and death rates in PAR-1 positive group. CONCLUSION: From this study, it could be concluded that PAR-1 expression on ALL cells represents an important adverse prognostic factor. RECOMMENDATIONS: PAR-1 expression should be routinely investigated for better prognostic assessment of ALL patients at diagnosis and should be taken in consideration in designing future therapeutic strategies based on patients- specific risk factors.",,"['Hagag, Adel A', 'Nosair, Nahla A', 'Ghaith, Fatma M', 'Elshenawy, Eman H']","['Hagag AA', 'Nosair NA', 'Ghaith FM', 'Elshenawy EH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine.

However, its differentiation inducing properties and the mechanisms involved are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of Chemlali Olive Leaf Extract (COLE) for its potential differentiation inducing effect on multipotent leukemia K562 cells. Results showed that COLE inhibits K562 cells proliferation and arrests the cell cycle at G0/G1, and then at G2/M phase over treatment time. Further analysis revealed that COLE induces apoptosis and differentiation of K562 cells toward the monocyte lineage. Microarray analysis was conducted to investigate the underlying mechanism of COLE differentiation inducing effect. The differentially expressed genes such as IFI16, EGR1, NFYA, FOXP1, CXCL2, CXCL3, and CXCL8 confirmed the commitment of K562 cells to the monocyte/macrophage lineage.

Automatic analysis will allow hematologist experts to perform faster and more accurately. The proposed method uses an iterative structured circle detection algorithm for the segmentation and counting of WBCs and RBCs. The separation of WBCs from RBCs was achieved by thresholding, and specific preprocessing steps were developed for each cell type. Counting was performed for each image using the proposed method based on modified circle detection, which automatically counted the cells. Several modifications were made to the basic (RCD) algorithm to solve the initialization problem, detecting irregular circles (cells), selecting the optimal circle from the candidate circles, determining the number of iterations in a fully dynamic way to enhance algorithm detection, and running time. The validation method used to determine segmentation accuracy was a quantitative analysis that included Precision, Recall, and F-measurement tests.

All four methods successfully induced ESCs to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. There was a significant difference between groups with and without inducers. A significant difference was found between mESC and hESC groups with inducers. The average beating frequency of cardiomyocytes differentiated from hESC was lower than cardiomyocytes differentiated from mESC, while the average beating frequency of cardiomyocytes differentiated from the same cell line, despite different culture methods, did not differ. Beating cardiomyocytes of each group were positive for cTnT staining. Spontaneous action potentials of beating cardiomyocytes were detected by patch-clamp experiments in each group.

Moreover, therapeutic application of CNTF reduced body weight in mice and humans. CNTF binds to high or low affinity receptor complexes consisting of CNTFR.gp130.LIFR or IL-6R.gp130.LIFR, respectively. Clinical studies of the CNTF derivative Axokine revealed intolerance at higher concentrations, which may rely on the low-affinity binding of CNTF to the IL-6R. Here, we aimed to generate a CNTFR-selective CNTF variant (CV). CV-1 contained the single amino acid exchange R28E. Arg(28) is in close proximity to the CNTFR binding site. Using molecular modeling, we hypothesized that Arg(28) might contribute to IL-6R/CNTFR plasticity of CNTF. CV-2 to CV-5 were generated by transferring parts of the CNTFR-binding site from cardiotrophin-like cytokine to CNTF. Cardiotrophin-like cytokine selectively signals via the CNTFR.gp130.LIFR complex, albeit with a much lower affinity compared with CNTF. As shown by immunoprecipitation, all CNTF variants retained the ability to bind to CNTFR. CV-1, CV-2, and CV-5, however, lost the ability to bind to IL-6R. Although all variants induced cytokine-dependent cellular proliferation and STAT3 phosphorylation via CNTFR.gp130.LIFR, only CV-3 induced STAT3 phosphorylation via IL-6R.gp130.LIFR. Quantification of CNTF-dependent proliferation of CNTFR.gp130.LIFR expressing cells indicated that only CV-1 was as biologically active as CNTF. Thus, the CNTFR-selective CV-1 will allow discriminating between CNTFR- and IL-6R-mediated effects in vivo.","['(c) 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Wagener, Eva-Maria', 'Aurich, Matthias', 'Aparicio-Siegmund, Samadhi', 'Floss, Doreen M', 'Garbers, Christoph', 'Breusing, Kati', 'Rabe, Bjorn', 'Schwanbeck, Ralf', 'Grotzinger, Joachim', 'Rose-John, Stefan', 'Scheller, Jurgen']","['Wagener EM', 'Aurich M', 'Aparicio-Siegmund S', 'Floss DM', 'Garbers C', 'Breusing K', 'Rabe B', 'Schwanbeck R', 'Grotzinger J', 'Rose-John S', 'Scheller J']","['From the Institute of Biochemistry, Medical Faculty, Christian-Albrechts-University, 24098 Kiel, Germany and.', 'From the Institute of Biochemistry, Medical Faculty, Christian-Albrechts-University, 24098 Kiel, Germany and.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology II, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University, 40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology II, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University, 40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'From the Institute of Biochemistry, Medical Faculty, Christian-Albrechts-University, 24098 Kiel, Germany and.', 'From the Institute of Biochemistry, Medical Faculty, Christian-Albrechts-University, 24098 Kiel, Germany and.', 'From the Institute of Biochemistry, Medical Faculty, Christian-Albrechts-University, 24098 Kiel, Germany and.', 'From the Institute of Biochemistry, Medical Faculty, Christian-Albrechts-University, 24098 Kiel, Germany and.', 'From the Institute of Biochemistry, Medical Faculty, Christian-Albrechts-University, 24098 Kiel, Germany and.', 'From the Institute of Biochemistry, Medical Faculty, Christian-Albrechts-University, 24098 Kiel, Germany and.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology II, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University, 40225 Dusseldorf, Germany jscheller@uni-duesseldorf.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140506,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['*Amino Acid Substitution', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cell Surface Receptor', 'Cytokine Action', 'Interleukin', 'Receptor Structure-Function', 'Signal Transduction']",2014/05/08 06:00,2014/10/17 06:00,['2014/05/08 06:00'],"['2014/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)40550-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.568857 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Jun 27;289(26):18442-50. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.568857.

We evaluated whether fenofibrate has a renoprotective effect by ameliorating lipotoxicity in the kidney. Eight-week-old male C57BLKS/J db/m control and db/db mice, divided into four groups, received fenofibrate for 12 weeks. In db/db mice, fenofibrate ameliorated albuminuria, mesangial area expansion and inflammatory cell infiltration. Fenofibrate inhibited accumulation of intra-renal free fatty acids and triglycerides related to increases in PPARalpha expression, phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and activation of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha)-estrogen-related receptor (ERR)-1alpha-phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase (pACC), and suppression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1 and carbohydrate regulatory element-binding protein (ChREBP)-1, key downstream effectors of lipid metabolism. Fenofibrate decreased the activity of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-Akt phosphorylation and FoxO3a phosphorylation in kidneys, increasing the B cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2)/BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX) ratio and superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1 levels. Consequently, fenofibrate recovered from renal apoptosis and oxidative stress, as reflected by 24 hr urinary 8-isoprostane. In cultured mesangial cells, fenofibrate prevented high glucose-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress through phosphorylation of AMPK, activation of PGC-1alpha-ERR-1alpha, and suppression of SREBP-1 and ChREBP-1.

Previous studies showed activity to be associated with selective drug accumulation and retention in tumour tissue. Retention varied widely among different tumours and was related to antitumour activity. We determined whether differences in the uptake and retention of SN 28049 could be observed in vitro. METHODS: The Co38P and LLTC lines were derived from the murine colon 38 carcinoma and Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL), respectively. The NZM4, NZM10 and NZM52 human melanoma lines, as well as the CCRF/CEM, CEM/VLB100 and CEM/E1000 human leukaemia lines were also utilised. Cell-associated drug was measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, laser-scanning confocal microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. Data for SN 28049 were compared for four SN 28049 analogues, for the structurally related drug N-[2-(dimethylamino)-ethyl]acridine-4-carboxamide (DACA) and for doxorubicin. RESULTS: Cellular uptake of SN 28049 was rapid and associated with increased fluorescence in cytoplasmic vesicles or bodies. SN 28049 uptake after an incubation time of 1 h varied widely with different cell lines (2-98 pmol/10(6) cells) and did not correlate with growth inhibitory concentrations (IC(5)(0) values), which also varied widely (1.2-19 nM). Changes in the length of the N-linked side chain of SN 28049 had large effects on drug uptake by Co38P cells. SN 28049 uptake by CCRF/CEM cells was only slightly affected by the expression of P-glycoprotein (CEM/VLB100) or MRP1 protein (CEM/E1000). As measured by cytoplasmic fluorescence, SN 28049 was taken up rapidly and retained strongly by Co38P cells, DACA was taken up rapidly and retained poorly, and doxorubicin was taken up slowly and retained moderately. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that SN 28049 is actively transported into cytoplasmic vesicles. While vesicle-associated drug is not important for intrinsic cytotoxicity, it may play a key role as a ""slow release"" form that modifies pharmacokinetics in multicellular structures such as tumours.",,"['Chen, Ying Yi', 'Lukka, Pradeep B', 'Joseph, Wayne R', 'Finlay, Graeme J', 'Paxton, James W', 'McKeage, Mark J', 'Baguley, Bruce C']","['Chen YY', 'Lukka PB', 'Joseph WR', 'Finlay GJ', 'Paxton JW', 'McKeage MJ', 'Baguley BC']","['Auckland Cancer Society Research Centre, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, 1142, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140507,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Carcinoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytoplasmic Vesicles/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drugs, Investigational/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Melanoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Naphthyridines/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology']",,,2014/05/08 06:00,2014/09/27 06:00,['2014/05/08 06:00'],"['2014/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-014-2469-x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2014 Jul;74(1):25-35. doi: 10.1007/s00280-014-2469-x.

Coexposure of cells to minimally lethal concentrations of CFZ with very low concentration of vorinostat resulted in synergistic antiproliferative effects and enhanced apoptosis in Jurkat T-leukemia cells, accompanied with the sharply increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), the striking decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), the increased release of cytochrome c, the enhanced activation of caspase-9 and -3, and the cleavage of PARP. The combined treatment of Jurkat cells pre-treated with ROS scavengers N-acetylcysteine (NAC) significantly blocked the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, suggesting that ROS generation was a former event of the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, NAC also resulted in a marked reduction in apoptotic cells, indicating a critical role for increased ROS generation by combined treatment. In addition, combined treatment arrested the cell cycle in G2-M phase. These results imply that CFZ interacted synergistically with vorinostat in Jurkat T-leukemia cells, which raised the possibility that the combination of carfilzomib with vorinostat may represent a novel strategy in treating T-cell Leukemia.","['(c) The Author 2014.

Within this microenvironment, hematopoietic stem cells are in direct contact with mesenchymal stromal cells, osteoblasts and sinusoidal endothelial cells. These close relationships drive specialized cellular functions (proliferation/quiescence, differentiation/self-renewal) ensuring an efficient hematopoiesis. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a major model of leukemic hematopoiesis. The BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase, constitutively activated in CML, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease. An intensive cross-talk between CML progenitors and the components of the hematopoietic niche has recently been demonstrated. Consequently, the occurrence of the so-called leukemic niche promotes both the proliferation of myeloid cells and the maintenance of quiescent leukemic stem cells. This bone marrow niche could also protect CML stem cells from tyrosine kinase inhibitors and probably contribute to their resistance towards targeted therapies.",['(c) 2014 medecine/sciences - Inserm.'],"['Chomel, Jean-Claude', 'Aggoune, Djamel', 'Sorel, Nathalie', 'Turhan, Ali G']","['Chomel JC', 'Aggoune D', 'Sorel N', 'Turhan AG']","['Service de cancerologie biologique, CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France - Inserm U935, universite de Poitiers, France.', 'Inserm U935, universite de Poitiers, France.', 'Service de cancerologie biologique, CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France - Inserm U935, universite de Poitiers, France.', 'Inserm U935, universite de Poitiers, France - hopitaux universitaires Paris-Sud, le Kremlin Bicetre, France - Inserm U935, universite Paris-Sud 11, Paris, France.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20140505,France,Med Sci (Paris),Medecine sciences : M/S,8710980,IM,"['Animals', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic System/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*physiology']",,,2014/05/08 06:00,2014/07/22 06:00,['2014/05/08 06:00'],"['2014/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1051/medsci/20143004022 [doi]', 'medsci20143004p452 [pii]']",ppublish,Med Sci (Paris). 2014 Apr;30(4):452-61. doi: 10.1051/medsci/20143004022.

Meta-analysis for overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) showed FLT3-ITD to predict an unfavorable prognosis, with hazard ratios (HR) of 1.86 and 1.75, respectively. In contrast, meta-analysis of the impact of NPM1 and CEBPA mutations on OS yielded an HR of 0.56 for each mutation, while analysis of impact on RFS produced HRs of 0.37 and 0.42, respectively.

The failure of current anticancer therapies can be attributed to the relative ineffectiveness of drug and radiation treatments on CSCs, thereby preserving the full capacity of the cells to reproduce tumors. The development of new strategies is currently hindered by the lack of reliable markers for the identification of these CSCs. At present, they have been isolated from solid tumors at various locations using a variety of surface markers, including CD34, CD133, CD24, CD44, CD29 and CD31, in addition to the methods of isolation and cell culture via the Wnt, BMI1, Notch and Hedgehog pathways. The discovery of specific tumor targets for CSCs would constitute a big step in the research for the definitive therapy against cancer. More studies are being conducted that consider the role of CSCs in head and neck cancers with potential for an impact on clinical-surgical outcomes from the knowledge that is being gained. A promising intracellular marker of CSCs in head and neck cancer is the oncoprotein BMI1, with specific data about its prognostic value based on the specific location.","['(c) 2014 S.

In this study, an oral 6MP liquid suitable for pediatric use was developed and tested in the target population. METHOD: A randomized cross-over study was performed in 20 pediatric ALL patients (age 1.9 - 14.6 years), comparing pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a newly developed 6MP liquid formulation to 6MP capsules, both taken orally for 4 weeks. RESULTS: Based upon trough levels of the principal active metabolite,6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN),a relative bioavailability of the liquid vs. capsules of 1.01 was found (90% CI 0.86 - 1.20), demonstrating bioequivalence. This was supported by the similarly observed 6MP dosages needed for leucocyte depletion, for both formulations (35 mg/day (range 10 - 115 mg)). 75% of the parents/patients (p = 0.005) preferred the oral liquid over the capsules because of the ease of administration.

Belinostat (PXD101) is a hydroxamate-type HDAC inhibitor tested in phase I and II clinical trials in solid tumors and hematological cancers. However, little is known about the use of belinostat for differentiation therapy against acute myelogenous leukemia. Here, we characterize the antileukemia activity of belinostat as a single drug and in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) in promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 and NB4 cells. Belinostat exerted dose-dependent growth-inhibitory or proapoptotic effects, promoting cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 or the S transition. Apoptosis was accompanied by activation of caspase 3, degradation of PARP-1, and cell cycle-dependent changes in the expression of survivin, cyclin E1, and cyclin A2. Belinostat induced a dose-dependent reduction in the expression of EZH2 and SUZ12, HDAC-1, HDAC-2, and histone acetyltransferase PCAF (p300/CBP-associated factor). Belinostat increased acetylation of histone H4, H3 at K9 and H3 at K16 residues in a dose-dependent manner, but did not reduce trimethylation of H3 at K27 at proapoptotic doses. Combined treatment with belinostat and RA dose dependently accelerated and reinforced granulocytic differentiation, accompanied by changes in the expression of CD11b, C/EBPalpha (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha), and C/EBPepsilon. Our results concluded the usefulness of belinostat, as an epigenetic drug, for antileukemia and differentiation therapy.",,"['Savickiene, Jurate', 'Treigyte, Grazina', 'Valiuliene, Giedre', 'Stirblyte, Ieva', 'Navakauskiene, Ruta']","['Savickiene J', 'Treigyte G', 'Valiuliene G', 'Stirblyte I', 'Navakauskiene R']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,,2014/05/08 06:00,2015/05/13 06:00,['2014/05/08 06:00'],"['2014/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0000000000000122 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2014 Sep;25(8):938-49. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000122.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (SUZ12 protein, human)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'F4H96P17NZ (belinostat)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Primary and secondary lymphoid tissues are involved in the pathogenesis of CLL, and the role of these tissue microenvironments has not been explored completely. To elucidate host-tumor interactions, we performed gene expression profiling (GEP) of purified CLL cells from peripheral blood (PB; n = 20), bone marrow (BM; n = 18), and lymph node (LN; n = 15) and validated key pathway genes by real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and/or TCL1 trans-genic mice. Gene signatures representing several pathways critical for survival and activation of B cells were altered in CLL cells from different tissue compartments. Molecules associated with the B-cell receptor (BCR), B cell-activating factor/a proliferation-inducing ligand (BAFF/APRIL), nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway and immune suppression signature were enriched in LN-CLL, suggesting LNs as the primary site for tumor growth. Immune suppression genes may help LN-CLL cells to modulate antigen-presenting and T-cell behavior to suppress antitumor activity. PB CLL cells overexpressed chemokine receptors, and their cognate ligands were enriched in LN and BM, suggesting that a chemokine gradient instructs B cells to migrate toward LN or BM. Of several chemokine ligands, the expression of CCL3 was associated with poor prognostic factors. The BM gene signature was enriched with antiapoptotic, cytoskeleton and adhesion molecules. Interestingly, PB cells from lymphadenopathy patients shared GEP with LN cells. In Emu-TCL1 transgenic mice (the mouse model of the disease), a high percentage of leukemic cells from the lymphoid compartment express key BCR and NF-kappaB molecules. Together, our findings demonstrate that the lymphoid microenvironment promotes survival, proliferation and progression of CLL cells via chronic activation of BCR, BAFF/APRIL and NF-kappaB activation while suppressing the immune response.",,"['Mittal, Amit K', 'Chaturvedi, Nagendra K', 'Rai, Karan J', 'Gilling-Cutucache, Christine E', 'Nordgren, Tara M', 'Moragues, Margaret', 'Lu, Runqing', 'Opavsky, Rene', 'Bociek, Greg R', 'Weisenburger, Dennis D', 'Iqbal, Javeed', 'Joshi, Shantaram S']","['Mittal AK', 'Chaturvedi NK', 'Rai KJ', 'Gilling-Cutucache CE', 'Nordgren TM', 'Moragues M', 'Lu R', 'Opavsky R', 'Bociek GR', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Iqbal J', 'Joshi SS']","['Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.', 'Section of Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.', 'Eppley Institute, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.', 'Section of Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140715,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'B-Cell Activating Factor/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*genetics', 'Lymph Nodes/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*genetics']",,,2014/05/08 06:00,2015/05/12 06:00,['2014/05/08 06:00'],"['2012/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['molmed.2012.00303 [pii]', '10.2119/molmed.2012.00303 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Med. 2014 Jul 15;20:290-301. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2012.00303.,"['0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (TNFSF13B protein, human)']",,PMC4107103,['P30 GM110768/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the frequent causes and clinical presentation of pancytopenia in relation to age and sex in different ethnic groups of two national (Pakistani and Afghan) living in Baluchistan province. METHODS: This is a cross sectional descriptive type of study was carried out on patients (n = 180) for two years (July 2009-June 2011). Cases were successively registered in 2 provincial government hospital and 2 private clinics in Quetta with diagnosis of pancytopenia. RESULTS: The most frequent causes of pancytopenia in both national ethnic groups were malaria (29.44%) fallowed by tuberculosis (17.22%), leukaemia (16.67%), aplastic anaemia (13.33%), hepatitis (12.22%), other diseases (7.22%) and iron deficiency anaemia (3.89%). Overall, 63.89% male subjects were observed pancytopenia as compared to 36.11% female patients. The results also showed that patients with age > 41 years were highly (50%) affected by pancytopenia followed by 21-40 years (30.66%) and < 20 years (19.44%). Moreover, leukaemia cases were observed significantly higher in Afghan subjects (> 41 years). The most common symptom of patients was (71.11%) fever followed by Pallor (42.22%), fatigue (38.33%), weight loss (26.11%) and dizziness (25.56%).

This activity decreases in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL). This decrease in aKm and aVm values shows bad prognosis. Similarly the anticancer drugs like Daunorubicin and Doxorubicin further decreases the aKm and aVm values which worsen the prognosis. The objective of this study was to determine and compare the extent of inhibition of Acetylecholine Esterase by Daunorubicin and Doxorubicin in ALL. METHODS: Study of 100 patients including both male and female children who's age ranged from 4 to 8 years and were advised doxorubicin and daunorubicin separately were tested by Ellman's method using acetylcholine iodide as substrate and 5,5-dithiobis 2-nitrobenzine as a colour reagent regardless of dose regimen i.e. (once in 3 week, small dose per week or a continuous infusion for 72 to 96 hours. RESULTS: In this study the Michaelis Mentin parameters Apparent Michaelis Constant (aKm) and Apparent Maximum Velocity (aVm) of the enzyme were estimated both in normal individuals and in the patients and also during treatment with daunorubicin and doxorubicin. The value of Michaelis Mentin parameters, aKm, aVm and percentage activity of the enzyme in normal individual are 23, 70, and 100 respectively. The values of aKm, aVm and percentage activity of the enzyme were also estimated in the patients before and after treatment. The values of aKm and aVm in patients of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and percentage activity of enzyme is decreased. After the treatment with daunorubicin and doxorubicin the values and activity is further decreased.

This study aims to determine the impact of childhood ALL on emotional and behavioral pattern of the patients compared to healthy peers as assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). METHODS: We studied 100 children with ALL (aged 6-12 years) and 100 healthy sex/age peers as control group. All ALL cases were treated by chemotherapy alone. After being informed by a psychologist, parents in both groups were asked to complete the CBCL form. Final results were then compared between the two study groups. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups regarding the general characteristics. Failure in school performance, restricted group activity and less social relations were significantly higher in the ALL cases. Total competence was also significantly disturbed for the ALL cases. Social problems, attention problems, aggressive behavior, externalization, attention deficit/hyperactivity, conduct and oppositional defiant problems were significantly more prevalent in healthy children. Somatic problems were significantly higher in the ALL cases. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that except for somatic problems, behavioral problems among the ALL cases are significantly less frequent than the healthy peers, which may stem from better care and support from the families.

This benefit is affected by non-relapse mortality (NRM) due to complications such as graft versus host disease (GVHD). A new approach in analyzing time-dependent covariates in competing risks is landmark analysis. So, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of acute and chronic GVHD on long-term outcomes, relapse and NRM, after allogeneic HSCT in adult ALL using landmark analysis. This study was conducted on 252 ALL patients who were allogeneic transplanted from an HLA-identical sibling with peripheral blood (PB) as the source of stem cell from 2004 to 2012 and were followed-up until 2013. In the first 100 days after transplant, a landmark analysis on days +10, +11, +12, +17, +24, and +31 was applied to assess the effect of acute GVHD on early relapse and NRM. Similarly, for patients alive and event-free at day +100 after transplant, a landmark analysis at time points day +101, months +4, +5, +6, +9, and +12 was applied to evaluate the effect of chronic GVHD on late relapse and NRM. Five-year LFS and OS were 35.0% (95% CI: 29.1, 42.2%) and 37.5% (95% CI: 31.3, 45.0%), respectively. Five-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 44.5% (95% CI: 37.9, 51.0%) while this was 20.4% (95% CI: 15.4, 26.0%) for NRM. The landmark analysis in the first 100 days after transplant showed that the grade III/IV of aGVHD has a lower risk of relapse but higher risk of NRM after adjustment for the EBMT risk score. For patients alive at day +100, cGVHD had no significant effect on relapse. Limited cGVHD had lower risk of NRM and after 6 month post-transplant the risk of NRM decreased and there were not important difference between the groups of cGVHD.

Injection pain in children is so important that it is considered as the most stressful aspect of their disease. Distraction is one of the easiest and least costly methods of non-pharmacological pain relief that has not been paid attention to by nurses. In the present study, the effectiveness of regular breathing method (Hey-Hu) in reduction of pain of intrathecal injection in leukemic children was evaluated. METHODS: This study was conducted as a single blind randomized clinical trial among 100 patients coming to a referral hospital related to Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran. The patients were 6-15 years old children coming to oncology ward suffering from leukemia. They were selected and randomly allocated to either regular breathing group or control group in equal numbers. The pain of children was assessed by Wong pain face scale and also general behaviors of the samples were evaluated by the researcher. In Pain Rating Scale, face 0 is considered happy because there is no hurt and face 5 denotes maximum pain. FINDINGS: Mean pain score in the regular breathing group was significantly lesser than the control group (2.98+/-1.68 and 3.80+/-1.30, respectively; P=0.01). There was no significant difference between the two sexes but in the regular breathing group, mean pain score was significantly lower in children aged above 10 years. CONCLUSION: This study showed that regular breathing can significantly reduce the pain of intrathecal injection in leukemic children, especially in those aged above 10 years. Considering the key role of nurses in a health care team, the researchers hope that the results of this study can help them learn this method and implement it in hospitalized children who undergo painful procedures.",,"['Pourmovahed, Zahra', 'Dehghani, Khadije', 'Sherafat, Asghar']","['Pourmovahed Z', 'Dehghani K', 'Sherafat A']","['Department of Pediatrics, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran.', 'Afshar Hospital, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Pediatr,Iranian journal of pediatrics,101274724,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Children', 'Intrathecal Injection', 'Leukemia', 'Pain', 'Regular Breathing']",2014/05/07 06:00,2014/05/07 06:01,['2014/05/07 06:00'],"['2012/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/07 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Pediatr. 2013 Oct;23(5):564-8.,,,PMC4006507,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is not known whether this receptor has a functional role in human neutrophils. We found that fMLP (1 muM), but not histamine (0.1-1 muM), induced Mac-1-dependent adhesion, polarization, and degranulation (release of lactoferrin). A pretreatment of neutrophils with histamine (0.001-1 muM) or JNJ 28610244 (0.1-10 muM), a specific H4 receptor agonist, led to inhibition of degranulation. Total inhibition of degranulation was obtained with 0.1 muM histamine and 10 muM JNJ 28610244. Furthermore, such inhibition by histamine of degranulation was reversed by JNJ 7777120 and JNJ 28307474, two selective H4 receptor antagonists. However, neither histamine nor the H4 receptor agonist JNJ 28610244 prevented fMLP-induced, Mac-1-dependent adhesion, indicating that the H4 receptor may block signals emanating from Mac-1-controlling degranulation. Likewise, engagement of the H4 receptor by the selective agonist JNJ 28610244 blocked Mac-1-dependent activation of p38 MAPK, the kinase that controls neutrophil degranulation.

The mechanism underlying this drug effect remains unknown. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We asked whether neoplastic stem cells (NSC) in patients with MDS (n = 29) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML; n = 62) express CD52. RESULTS: As assessed by flow cytometry, CD52 was found to be expressed on NSC-enriched CD34(+)/CD38(-) cells in 8/11 patients with MDS and isolated del(5q). In most other patients with MDS, CD52 was weakly expressed or not detectable on NSC. In AML, CD34(+)/CD38(-) cells displayed CD52 in 23/62 patients, including four with complex karyotype and del(5q) and one with del(5q) and t(1;17;X). In quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses, purified NSC obtained from del(5q) patients expressed CD52 mRNA. We were also able to show that CD52 mRNA levels correlate with EVI1 expression and that NRAS induces the expression of CD52 in AML cells. The CD52-targeting drug alemtuzumab, was found to induce complement-dependent lysis of CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD52(+) NSC, but did not induce lysis in CD52(-) NSC. Alemtuzumab also suppressed engraftment of CD52(+) NSC in NSG mice. Finally, CD52 expression on NSC was found to correlate with a poor survival in patients with MDS and AML. CONCLUSIONS: The cell surface target Campath-1 (CD52) is expressed on NSC in a group of patients with MDS and AML. CD52 is a novel prognostic NSC marker and a potential NSC target in a subset of patients with MDS and AML, which may have clinical implications and may explain clinical effects produced by alemtuzumab in these patients.",['(c)2014 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Blatt, Katharina', 'Herrmann, Harald', 'Hoermann, Gregor', 'Willmann, Michael', 'Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine', 'Sadovnik, Irina', 'Herndlhofer, Susanne', 'Streubel, Berthold', 'Rabitsch, Werner', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Mayerhofer, Matthias', 'Rulicke, Thomas', 'Valent, Peter']","['Blatt K', 'Herrmann H', 'Hoermann G', 'Willmann M', 'Cerny-Reiterer S', 'Sadovnik I', 'Herndlhofer S', 'Streubel B', 'Rabitsch W', 'Sperr WR', 'Mayerhofer M', 'Rulicke T', 'Valent P']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria;"", 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria;', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Austria;', 'Department for Companion Animals and Horses, Clinic for Small Animals, Clinical Unit of Internal Medicine, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Austria;', ""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria; Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria;"", ""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria;"", ""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria;"", 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria;', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Medical University of Vienna, Austria;', ""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria; Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria;"", 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute of Osteology, Hanusch-Hospital, Vienna, Austria; and.', 'Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Austria.', ""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria; Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria; peter.valent@meduniwien.ac.at.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140505,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/*genetics/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, ras', 'Glycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2014/05/07 06:00,2015/02/25 06:00,['2014/05/07 06:00'],"['2014/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-2811 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-2811 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Jul 1;20(13):3589-602. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-2811.

Cells with loss-of-function mutations in the FANC pathway are characterized by chromosome fragility, altered mutability, and abnormal regulation of the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway. Somatic hypermutation (SHM) and immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch recombination (CSR) enable B cells to produce high-affinity antibodies of various isotypes. Both processes are initiated after the generation of dG:dU mismatches by activation-induced cytidine deaminase. Whereas SHM involves an error-prone repair process that introduces novel point mutations into the Ig gene, the mismatches generated during CSR are processed to create double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in DNA, which are then repaired by the NHEJ pathway. As several lines of evidence suggest a possible role for the FANC pathway in SHM and CSR, we analyzed both processes in B cells derived from Fanca(-/-) mice. Here we show that Fanca is required for the induction of transition mutations at A/T residues during SHM and that despite globally normal CSR function in splenic B cells, Fanca is required during CSR to stabilize duplexes between pairs of short microhomology regions, thereby impeding short-range recombination downstream of DSB formation.",['(c) 2014 Nguyen et al.'],"['Nguyen, Thuy Vy', 'Riou, Lydia', 'Aoufouchi, Said', 'Rosselli, Filippo']","['Nguyen TV', 'Riou L', 'Aoufouchi S', 'Rosselli F']","['Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR 8200, Institut Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France Universite Paris Sud, 91400 Orsay, France Programme Equipe Labellisees, Ligue Contre le Cancer, 75013 Paris, France.', ""Universite Paris Sud, 91400 Orsay, France Laboratoire de Radiopathologie, Service Cellules Souches et Radiation, Institut de Radiobiologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, Direction des Sciences du Vivant, Commissariat a L'energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U967, 92265 Fontenay-aux-Roses, France."", 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR 8200, Institut Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France Universite Paris Sud, 91400 Orsay, France filippo.rosselli@gustaveroussy.fr said.aoufouchi@gustaveroussy.fr.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR 8200, Institut Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France Universite Paris Sud, 91400 Orsay, France Programme Equipe Labellisees, Ligue Contre le Cancer, 75013 Paris, France filippo.rosselli@gustaveroussy.fr said.aoufouchi@gustaveroussy.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140505,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA End-Joining Repair', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group G Protein/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Switch Region/genetics', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'MutS Homolog 2 Protein/metabolism', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin/*genetics']",,,2014/05/07 06:00,2014/08/21 06:00,['2014/05/07 06:00'],"['2014/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20131637 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20131637 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2014 Jun 2;211(6):1011-8. doi: 10.1084/jem.20131637.

Some sub-nuclear structures may represent ""hubs"" that bring specific genetic loci into close proximity where co-regulatory mechanisms can operate. The identification of loci in proximity to a shared sub-nuclear structure can provide insights into the function of the associated structure, and reveal relationships between the loci sharing a common association. A technique is introduced based on the nano-dissection of DNA from thin sections of cells by high-precision nano-tools operated inside a scanning electron microscope. The ability to dissect and identify gene loci occupying a shared site at a single sub-nuclear structure is demonstrated here for the first time. The technique is applied to the nano-dissection of DNA in vicinity of a single promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body (PML NB), and reveals novel loci from several chromosomes that are confirmed to associate at PML NBs with statistical significance in a cell population. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that pairs of loci from different chromosomes congregate at the same nuclear body. It is proposed that this technique is the first that allows the de novo determination of gene loci associations with single nuclear sub-structures.","['(c) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This LynDeltaN fragment has been demonstrated to exert negative feedback on imatinib induced apoptosis in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) K562 cells. Our investigations focus on LynDeltaN stability and how reduced stability reduces imatinib resistance. As the proteolytical generated LynDeltaN has a leucine as an N-terminal amino acid, we hypothesized that LynDeltaN would be degraded by the N-end rule pathway. We demonstrated that LynDeltaN is unstable and that its stability is dependent on the identity of its N-terminus. Additionally we established that LynDeltaN degradation could be inhibited by inhibiting either the proteasome or knocking down the UBR1 and UBR2 ubiquitin E3 ligases. Importantly, we also demonstrate that LynDeltaN degradation by the N-end rule counters the imatinib resistance of K562 cells provided by LynDeltaN expression. Together our data suggest a possible mechanism for the N-end rule pathway having a link to imatinib resistance in CML.

METHODS: Sixty-six follow-up consultations between adolescent patients (aged 12-20 years old; mean = 16) and oncologists (n = 10) were video recorded. Emotional concerns were coded using the Verona coding definitions of emotional sequences (VR-CoDES). The content of the concerns was analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Emotional concerns (n = 115) were identified in 50% of the consultations. Of the concerns, 87% were expressed implicitly as hints to the underlying emotion (cues) rather than explicitly (concerns). The oncologists elicited 66.9% of these expressions. Four main categories of emotional concerns were identified in the thematic analysis: physical (31%), psychological (29%), social (17%), and cancer related (23%). The majority (76.5%) of the oncologists' responses to the cues and/or concerns provided space for further disclosure. The oncologists responded less explicitly to the emotional aspects of physical and cancer-related issues in comparison with the cues or concerns of psychological origin. More cues and concerns were expressed when parents were not present in the consultation. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, almost half of the adolescent patients presented emotional concerns, and a subgroup presented many concerns; these were mainly expressed when initiated by the oncologists. Oncologists should therefore be attentive to hints to underlying emotions to help the adolescent bring forward his or her concerns.","['Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Mellblom, A V', 'Finset, A', 'Korsvold, L', 'Loge, J H', 'Ruud, E', 'Lie, H C']","['Mellblom AV', 'Finset A', 'Korsvold L', 'Loge JH', 'Ruud E', 'Lie HC']","['Department of Behavioural Sciences in Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140505,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Cues', '*Emotions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology', 'Lymphoma/*psychology', 'Male', '*Medical Oncology', 'Middle Aged', '*Physician-Patient Relations', 'Qualitative Research', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Video Recording', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'clinician-patient relationship', 'communication', 'emotion', 'oncology']",2014/05/07 06:00,2015/08/21 06:00,['2014/05/07 06:00'],"['2013/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/10 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pon.3568 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2014 Dec;23(12):1365-72. doi: 10.1002/pon.3568.

MATERIALS & METHODS: To clarify the effect of common MDR1 variants on clinical response to imatinib, we performed a meta-analysis to quantify the accumulated information from genetic association studies. After a thorough search of the published literature, we undertook a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of MDR1 C1236T, G2677T and C3435T polymorphisms on imatinib response. RESULTS: Our pooled data showed a significant association between MDR1 C1236T polymorphism and the increasing risk of imatinib resistance in Asian CML patients. However, no significant association was found for the MDR1 G2677T or C3435T polymorphisms in an Asian CML population as well as a Caucasian CML population. CONCLUSION: The synonymous MDR1 C1236T polymorphism might be a risk factor for nonoptimal clinical response to imatinib in Asian CML patients.",,"['Zu, Bailing', 'Li, Yajuan', 'Wang, Xin', 'He, Dali', 'Huang, Zhenglan', 'Feng, Wenli']","['Zu B', 'Li Y', 'Wang X', 'He D', 'Huang Z', 'Feng W']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, No. 1, Yixueyuan Road, Chongqing, 400016, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Pharmacogenomics,Pharmacogenomics,100897350,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Asians', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Blacks', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Whites']",,,2014/05/07 06:00,2014/12/23 06:00,['2014/05/07 06:00'],"['2014/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/pgs.13.222 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacogenomics. 2014 Apr;15(5):667-77. doi: 10.2217/pgs.13.222.,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These interactions start intracellular signaling cascades that foster tumor growth, survival and spread. AREAS COVERED: The patent concerns the use of a humanized anti-CD44 mAb (RG7356) to treat patients with aggressive forms of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The RG7356 humanized antibody was designed to bind the constant region of CD44, preventing binding with HA. The interruption of this circuit in vitro is followed by the induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis in leukemic cells. In agreement with a functional association between CD44 and zeta-associated protein of 70 kDa (ZAP-70) in activating intracellular signaling, the strongest effects were observed in ZAP-70(+) CLL cells, generally associated to a poor prognosis. Furthermore, these effects were confirmed using in vivo models, where CLL cells were xenografted in immunocompromised mice. EXPERT OPINION: In summary, these studies suggest that this new humanized mAb may provide additional clinical benefit to CLL patients receiving current standard treatments, specifically to those with a more aggressive disease.",,"[""D'Arena, Giovanni"", 'Calapai, Gioacchino', 'Deaglio, Silvia']","[""D'Arena G"", 'Calapai G', 'Deaglio S']","['IRCCS ""Centro di Riferimento Oncologico della Basilicata"", Hematology Oncology Department , 85028 Rionero in Vulture , Italy +39 0972 726521 ; +39 0972 726217 ; giovannidarena@libero.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140506,England,Expert Opin Ther Pat,Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,9516419,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Patents as Topic']",['NOTNLM'],"['CD44', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'mAbs', 'targeted therapies']",2014/05/07 06:00,2015/02/03 06:00,['2014/05/07 06:00'],"['2014/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543776.2014.915942 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Pat. 2014 Jul;24(7):821-8. doi: 10.1517/13543776.2014.915942.

We sought to investigate the impact of relative changes of BCR-ABL transcript levels within the initial 3 months of therapy. In order to achieve accurate data for high BCR-ABL levels at diagnosis, beta glucuronidase (GUS) was used as a reference gene. Within the German CML-Study IV, samples of 408 imatinib-treated patients were available in a single laboratory for both times, diagnosis and 3 months on treatment. In total, 301 of these were treatment-naive at sample collection. RESULTS: (i) with regard to absolute transcript levels at diagnosis, no predictive cutoff could be identified; (ii) at 3 months, an individual reduction of BCR-ABL transcripts to the 0.35-fold of baseline level (0.46-log reduction, that is, roughly half-log) separated best (high risk: 16% of patients, 5-year overall survival (OS) 83% vs 98%, hazard ratio (HR) 6.3, P=0.001); (iii) at 3 months, a 6% BCR-ABL(IS) cutoff derived from BCR-ABL/GUS yielded a good and sensitive discrimination (high risk: 22% of patients, 5-year OS 85% vs 98%, HR 6.1, P=0.002).

Through Ig/TCR rearrangement analysis of MLL-AF4+ infant ALL at diagnosis and xenograft leukemias from mice transplanted with the same diagnostic samples, we established that MLL-AF4+ infant ALL is composed of a branching subclonal architecture already at diagnosis, frequently driven by an Ig/TCR-rearranged founder clone. Some MLL-AF4+ clones appear to be largely quiescent at diagnosis but can reactivate and dominate when serially transplanted into immunodeficient mice, whereas other dominant clones at diagnosis can become more quiescent, suggesting a dynamic competition between actively proliferating and quiescent subclones. Investigation of paired diagnostic and relapse samples suggested that relapses often occur from subclones already present but more quiescent at diagnosis. Copy-number alterations identified at relapse might contribute to the activation and expansion of previously quiescent subclones. Finally, each of the identified subclones is able to contribute to the diverse phenotypic pool of MLL-AF4+ leukemia-propagating cells. Unraveling of the subclonal architecture and dynamics in MLL+ infant ALL may provide possible explanations for the therapy resistance and frequent relapses observed in this group of poor prognosis ALL.",,"['Bardini, M', 'Woll, P S', 'Corral, L', 'Luc, S', 'Wittmann, L', 'Ma, Z', 'Lo Nigro, L', 'Basso, G', 'Biondi, A', 'Cazzaniga, G', 'Jacobsen, S E W']","['Bardini M', 'Woll PS', 'Corral L', 'Luc S', 'Wittmann L', 'Ma Z', 'Lo Nigro L', 'Basso G', 'Biondi A', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Jacobsen SE']","['M Tettamanti Research Center, University of Milano Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Haematopoietic Stem Cell Biology Laboratory, MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'M Tettamanti Research Center, University of Milano Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Haematopoietic Stem Cell Biology Laboratory, MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, Stem Cell Center, Lund, Sweden.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, Stem Cell Center, Lund, Sweden.', 'Center of Pediatric Haematology Oncology, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Laboratorio di Oncoematologia Pediatrica, Department of Pediatrics, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'M Tettamanti Research Center, University of Milano Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'M Tettamanti Research Center, University of Milano Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Haematopoietic Stem Cell Biology Laboratory, MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140506,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Heterografts', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/*pathology']",,,2014/05/07 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2014/05/07 06:00'],"['2014/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/04 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014154 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.154 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jan;29(1):38-50. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.154.

Little is known about outcome of leukemia in HBV infected patients in these regions. Hence, we conducted this study in two cohorts of patients. PROCEDURE: We retrospectively evaluated mortality, reduction in dose intensity and duration of therapy (intensive phase and maintenance phase) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who developed HBV infection. Sixty-three patients with ALL were included in the retrospective cohort of the study. These were followed up for a minimum of 5 years. We prospectively investigated the prevalence of anti-HBc antibodies in 105 treatment naive pediatric patients with ALL and negative for HbsAg. RESULTS: Twenty of the 63 patients developed hepatitis, of which 10 were attributed to HBV. All the 10 patients with HBV hepatitis had significantly reduced dose intensity during maintenance therapy with an average delay in completion of therapy of 140 +/- 83 days and also a high mortality (40%). In the prospective cohort of the study, 39% of treatment naive patients who were HBsAg negative were anti-HBc positive at presentation, possibly reflecting occult HBV infection. CONCLUSIONS: HBV infection poses a serious problem in patients with ALL. Hence we propose that in India, in addition to screening for HBsAg, patients with leukemia should also be screened for anti-HBc. Improved hepatitis B vaccine coverage in the community under the universal immunization programme and introduction of HBV nucleic acid test (NAT) for blood donations should also help in addressing the problem.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Guruprasad, B', 'Kavitha, S', 'Aruna Kumari, B S', 'Vijaykumar, B R', 'Sumati, B G', 'Mahua, Sinha', 'Appaji, L', 'Jayshree, R S']","['Guruprasad B', 'Kavitha S', 'Aruna Kumari BS', 'Vijaykumar BR', 'Sumati BG', 'Mahua S', 'Appaji L', 'Jayshree RS']","['Department of Paediatric Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bangalore, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140504,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hepatitis B/epidemiology/*etiology/mortality', 'Hepatitis B Antibodies/blood', 'Hepatitis B virus/*isolation & purification', 'Hepatitis C Antibodies/blood', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis/mortality/virology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/mortality/virology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Tertiary Care Centers']",['NOTNLM'],"['hematology/oncology', 'hepatitis B', 'leukemia', 'pediatric all', 'viral infection']",2014/05/07 06:00,2014/11/19 06:00,['2014/05/07 06:00'],"['2013/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25065 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Sep;61(9):1616-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25065.

We evaluated cisplatin's in vivo genotoxic potential by analyzing peripheral blood for Pig-a mutant phenotype erythrocytes and for chromosomal damage in the form of micronuclei. Mutant phenotype reticuloyte and erythrocyte frequencies, based on anti-CD59 antibody labeling and flow cytometric analysis, were determined in male Sprague Dawley rats treated for 28 consecutive days (days 1-28) with up to 0.4 mg cisplatin/kg/day, and sampled on days -4, 15, 29, and 56. Vehicle and highest dose groups were evaluated at additional time points post-treatment up to 6 months. Day 4 and 29 blood samples were also analyzed for micronucleated reticulocyte frequency using flow cytometry and anti-CD71-based labeling. Mutant phenotype reticulocytes were significantly elevated at doses >/=0.1 mg/kg/day, and mutant phenotype erythrocytes were elevated at doses >/=0.05 mg/kg/day. In the 0.4 mg/kg/day group, these effects persisted for the 6 month observation period. Cisplatin also induced a modest but statistically significant increase in micronucleus frequency at the highest dose tested.

We wanted to find out whether a male human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched unrelated donor (MUD, 8/8, n=2,014) might be an alternative to a female HLA-identical sibling donor (n=2,656) for male patients with acute leukemia. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis from the Acute Leukaemia Working Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. RESULTS: The relative risk (RR) of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of grades II to IV was increased in the MUD group with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (RR, 1.47; P<0.001) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (RR, 1.76; P<0.001). There was no difference in incidence of chronic GVHD and nonrelapse mortality between the two groups. Probability of relapse was lower in the MUD group than in the sibling group in patients with ALL (hazards ratio [HR], 0.75; P=0.04) but not in the AML patients (HR, 0.89; P=0.17). Survival was not different between the groups. Leukemia-free survival (LFS) was also similar in the sibling and MUD groups in patients with AML (HR, 1.01; P=0.81) or ALL (HR, 0.93; P=0.45). Factors significantly associated with reduced LFS included active disease, poor cytogenetics, age, year of hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, reduced-intensity conditioning, and the use of antithymocyte globulin. CONCLUSION: Male patients who received grafts from male MUDs demonstrated an increased incidence of acute GVHD and LFS same as when using HLA-identical female donors.",,"['Ringden, Olle', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Solders, Martin', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'Arnold, Renate', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Milpied, Noel', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Hamladji, Rose-Marie', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien, Slawomira', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Volin, Liisa', 'Craddock, Charles', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Ringden O', 'Labopin M', 'Solders M', 'Beelen D', 'Arnold R', 'Ehninger G', 'Milpied N', 'Niederwieser D', 'Hamladji RM', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien S', 'Ganser A', 'Socie G', 'Stelljes M', 'Volin L', 'Craddock C', 'Mohty M']","['1 Center for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation and Division of Therapeutic Immunology, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden. 2 Department of Haematology, Hopital Saint Antoine, Paris, France. 3 Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Essen, University Hospital, Essen, Germany. 4 Medizinische Klinik m.

The diagnostic karyotype was 46,XY,add(1)(p13),t(8;21)(p11;q22),der(16)t(1;16)(p13;p13)[9]/46,XY[1]; thus, no direct confirmation of the suspicion could be given although both 8p11 and 16p13 seemed to be rearranged. The leukemic cells were examined in two ways to find out whether a cryptic KAT6A-CREBBP was present. The first was the ""conventional"" approach: G-banding was followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The second was RNA-Seq followed by data analysis using FusionMap and FusionFinder programs with special emphasis on candidates located in the 1p13, 8p11, 16p13, and 21q22 breakpoints. FISH analysis indicated the presence of a KAT6A/CREBBP chimera. RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing of the amplified product showed that a chimeric KAT6A-CREBBP transcript was present in the patients bone marrow. Surprisingly, however, KATA6A-CREBBP was not among the 874 and 35 fusion transcripts identified by the FusionMap and FusionFinder programs, respectively, although 11 sequences of the raw RNA-sequencing data were KATA6A-CREBBP fragments. This illustrates that although many fusion transcripts can be found by RNA-Seq combined with FusionMap and FusionFinder, the pathogenetically essential fusion is not always picked up by the bioinformatic algorithms behind these programs. The present study not only illustrates potential pitfalls of current data analysis programs of whole transcriptome sequences which make them less useful as stand-alone techniques, but also that leukemia diagnosis still relies on integration of clinical, hematologic, and genetic disease features of which the former two by no means have become superfluous.",,"['Panagopoulos, Ioannis', 'Torkildsen, Synne', 'Gorunova, Ludmila', 'Tierens, Anne', 'Tjonnfjord, Geir E', 'Heim, Sverre']","['Panagopoulos I', 'Torkildsen S', 'Gorunova L', 'Tierens A', 'Tjonnfjord GE', 'Heim S']","['Section for Cancer Cytogenetics, Institute for Cancer Genetics and Informatics, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; Centre for Cancer Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Section for Cancer Cytogenetics, Institute for Cancer Genetics and Informatics, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; Centre for Cancer Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway; Department of Hematology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Section for Cancer Cytogenetics, Institute for Cancer Genetics and Informatics, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; Centre for Cancer Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Pathology, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Hematology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Section for Cancer Cytogenetics, Institute for Cancer Genetics and Informatics, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; Centre for Cancer Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway; Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140505,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adult', 'CREB-Binding Protein/*genetics', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,2014/05/07 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/05/07 06:00'],"['2014/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0096570 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-06530 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 May 5;9(5):e96570. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0096570. eCollection 2014.,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6A protein, human)']",,PMC4010518,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Importantly, the 37 kDa/67 kDa laminin receptor (LRP/LR) has been implicated in enhancing these two events thus facilitating cancer progression. In the current study, the role of LRP/LR in the adhesion and invasion of liver cancer (HUH-7) and leukaemia (K562) cells was investigated. Flow cytometry revealed that the HUH-7 cells displayed significantly higher cell surface LRP/LR levels compared to the poorly-invasive breast cancer (MCF-7) control cells, whilst the K562 cells displayed significantly lower cell surface LRP/LR levels in comparison to the MCF-7 control cells. However, Western blotting and densitometric analysis revealed that all three tumorigenic cell lines did not differ significantly with regards to total LRP/LR levels. Furthermore, treatment of liver cancer cells with anti-LRP/LR specific antibody IgG1-iS18 (0.2 mg/ml) significantly reduced the adhesive potential of cells to laminin-1 and the invasive potential of cells through the ECM-like Matrigel, whilst leukaemia cells showed no significant differences in both instances. Additionally, Pearson's correlation coefficients suggested direct proportionality between cell surface LRP/LR levels and the adhesive and invasive potential of liver cancer and leukaemia cells. These findings suggest the potential use of anti-LRP/LR specific antibody IgG1-iS18 as an alternative therapeutic tool for metastatic liver cancer through impediment of the LRP/LR- laminin-1 interaction.",,"['Chetty, Carryn', 'Khumalo, Thandokuhle', 'Da Costa Dias, Bianca', 'Reusch, Uwe', 'Knackmuss, Stefan', 'Little, Melvyn', 'Weiss, Stefan F T']","['Chetty C', 'Khumalo T', 'Da Costa Dias B', 'Reusch U', 'Knackmuss S', 'Little M', 'Weiss SF']","['School of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, Gauteng, The Republic of South Africa (RSA).', 'School of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, Gauteng, The Republic of South Africa (RSA).', 'School of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, Gauteng, The Republic of South Africa (RSA).', 'Affimed Therapeutics AG, Technologiepark, Im Neuenheimer Feld, Heidelberg, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany.', 'Affimed Therapeutics AG, Technologiepark, Im Neuenheimer Feld, Heidelberg, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany.', 'Affimed Therapeutics AG, Technologiepark, Im Neuenheimer Feld, Heidelberg, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany.', 'School of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, Gauteng, The Republic of South Africa (RSA).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140505,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Laminin/metabolism', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology', 'MCF-7 Cells', '*Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Receptors, Laminin/genetics/immunology/*physiology']",,,2014/05/07 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/05/07 06:00'],"['2013/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0096268 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-49627 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 May 5;9(5):e96268. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0096268. eCollection 2014.,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Receptors, Laminin)', '0 (laminin 1)']",,PMC4010454,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors determined the likelihood that patients with AML would maintain long-term remission after the completion of therapy. METHODS: The cumulative risk of relapse, the time to relapse, event-free survival, and overall survival were analyzed for 604 patients with AML who were enrolled in 7 successive clinical trials divided into 3 treatment eras (1976-1991, 1991-1997, and 2002-2008). RESULTS: The median time to relapse did not change over time (0.93 years vs 0.76 years vs 0.8 years, respectively, for each consecutive era; P = .22), but the risk of relapse decreased significantly (5-year cumulative incidence of relapse: 52.6% +/- 3.1% vs 31.5% +/- 3.9% vs 22% +/- 3%, respectively, for each consecutive era; P < .001). Among patients who were in remission 4 years from diagnosis, the probabilities of relapse were 1.7%, 2.9%, and 0.9%, respectively, for each consecutive era. In the most recent era, all but 1 of 44 relapses occurred within 4 years of diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Children with AML who receive treatment with contemporary therapy and remain in remission 4 years from diagnosis probably are cured.

However, the protein inference step can produce errors and a loss of information. To identify the information that is lost using the traditional approaches, this study compared the proteomic data of two leukemia cell lines (Jurkat and K562) at the peptide level with consideration of post-translational modifications (PTMs). METHODS: The raw files from the two cell lines were searched against the decoy IPI-human database version 3.68, which contains forward and reverse sequences. Then the observed modification name in the results was matched with the modification classification on the Unimod website by a manual search. Only the peptides with 'post-translational' modifications were compared between the two cell lines. RESULTS: After searching the database with consideration of PTMs, a total of 44046 non-redundant peptides were identified in both the Jurkat and K562 cell lines. Of these peptides, even without specific PTM enrichment, 11.43% of them (with at least two spectra in one cell line) existed in different PTM forms between the two cell lines, and 1.73% of the peptides were modified in both cell lines, but with different modifications or possibly on different sites. CONCLUSIONS: Comparing proteomic data at the peptide level with consideration of PTMs can reveal more differences between two unenriched samples.","['Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Yin, Jianrui', 'Shao, Chen', 'Jia, Lulu', 'Gao, Youhe']","['Yin J', 'Shao C', 'Jia L', 'Gao Y']","['Department of Pathophysiology, National Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100005, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom,Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,8802365,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides/*chemistry/metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Proteomics']",,,2014/05/07 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/05/07 06:00'],"['2013/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/24 00:00 [revised]', '2014/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/rcm.6911 [doi]'],ppublish,Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom. 2014 Jun 30;28(12):1364-70. doi: 10.1002/rcm.6911.,"['0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first one is given by the Earth s rotation, the latter one by its revolution around the Sun. These both do have clear biomedical counterparts. The 7-day week, basically linguistically ""period of change"" (or a similar period, e.g.10 days in Egypt or 8 days in Etrutria) was obviously originally considered mainly as a product of a societal agreement. Two groups of Czechoslovak clinicians-scientists, however, noted in forties of the XXth century an approximately week period in human laboratory data, after similar attempts abroad a few years earlier. In fifties, L.Derer, respecting the mathematical and biological principles in medicine and supported by the mathematician A.Huta, demonstrated the presence of the ""6-day"" rhythm in blood leukocyte counts in patients with leukemia, treated by cytostatics. Posing the question ""Where is it from?"", he considered also cosmic influences but was unable to study this issue more deeply due to his premature decease. Two decades later, the ""Derer s circaseptans"" found wide confirmation not only in human medicine but also in biology. The pioneering role here belongs to Franz Halberg, USA, the godfather of the ""circadians"" (originally ""Halberg s paranoia"") since the fifties. The possible geocosmic roots of circaseptans are supposed in the geomagnetic activity from interplanetary space, generating under the influence of the Sun rotation the periods around 6-7 days. This is presently documented, surprisingly, also by analysing the Derer s original data using more advanced, inferentially statistical method - the Halberg cosinor regression. Thus, the optimal approximation has been achieved for the period of 6.75 days - the 4th harmonics of the Bartels solar rotation cycle. Accordingly, the week can be now, after Derer and Halberg, understood also - same as day and year - as a biological - geocosmic phenomenon, a geomagnetic week, genetically acquired in the course of billions years of evolution, encoded in our chronome. The personality of Ladislav Derer should, in the history of the Czech and Slovak biomedical sciences, be permanenly standing by such giants as the well known Jan Evangelista Purkyne (""Purkinje"") or as Bohumil Nemec, discoverer of the mechanism of positive geotropism of plant roots (Fig. 3, Ref. 28).",,"['Mikulecky, M Sr', 'Mikulecky, M Jr']","['Mikulecky M Sr', 'Mikulecky M Jr']",,['eng'],"['Biography', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",,Slovakia,Bratisl Lek Listy,Bratislavske lekarske listy,0065324,IM,"['Chronobiology Discipline/*history', 'Chronobiology Phenomena/physiology', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Physiology/history']",,,2014/05/07 06:00,2014/06/11 06:00,['2014/05/07 06:00'],"['2014/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/bll_2014_051 [doi]'],ppublish,Bratisl Lek Listy. 2014;115(4):243-6. doi: 10.4149/bll_2014_051.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Derer L'],"['Derer, Ladislav']",,,,,,,

We describe immunophenotypic modifications, changes in the levels of mRNA and protein for transcription factors and morphological and functional events occurring during the differentiation of CLL B cells into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). The induction of differentiation differed significantly between the CD40L/c and PMA/c culture systems. The PMA/c culture system allowed CLL B cells to differentiate into IgM-secreting cells with an immunophenotype and molecular profile resembling those of preplasmablasts. By contrast, CD40L/c-stimulated cells had a phenotype and morphology similar to those of activated B cells and resembling those of the CLL B cells residing in the lymph node and bone marrow. These data suggest that the CLL B cells are not frozen permanently at a stage of differentiation and are able to differentiate into ASCs as appropriate stimulation are provided.

Recently, mutation in the STAT3 gene has been identified as a recurrent genetic abnormality in T-LGL. STAT3 mutation, therefore, represents a promising marker in T-LGL diagnostics. We developed a new quantitative next-generation sequencing assay that allows sensitive analysis of the STAT3 gene. The assay was used to study the utility of STAT3 mutation analysis as a diagnostic tool in T-LGL. The study included 16 T-LGL patients. A total of 15 mutations, including 2 new mutations (G618R and K658R), were detected in 12 patients (75%), with mutation levels ranging from 2.5% to 45.6% mutation-positive alleles. Next-generation sequencing detected 50% more mutations than Sanger sequencing. Blood samples from 20 healthy blood donors all tested negative, thus demonstrating the specificity of the assay. The results also indicated that mutation levels in blood and bone marrow are not systematically different, and next-generation sequencing-based STAT3 mutation analysis represents a sensitive method for monitoring residual disease as demonstrated in a patient receiving pentostatin. We demonstrate the clinical relevance of next-generation sequencing-based STAT3 mutation analysis, which represents a sensitive and specific diagnostic marker in T-LGL that allows assessment of molecular residual disease, which may improve clinical decision making.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the', 'Association for Molecular Pathology.

The randomized German-Austrian AML Study Group 06-04 protocol was designed on the basis of in vitro synergistic effects of valproic acid (VPA) and all-trans retinoic acid with chemotherapy. Between 2004 and 2006, 186 patients were randomly assigned to receive 2 induction cycles with idarubicin, cytarabine, and all-trans retinoic acid either with VPA or without (STANDARD). In all patients, consolidation therapy was intended. Complete remission rates after induction tended to be lower in VPA compared with STANDARD (40% vs 52%; P = .14) as a result of a higher early death rate (26% vs 14%; P = .06). The main toxicities attributed to VPA were delayed hematologic recovery and grade 3/4 infections, observed predominantly during the second induction cycle. After restricting VPA to the first induction cycle and reducing the dose of idarubicin, these toxicities dropped to rates observed in STANDARD. After a median follow-up time of 84 months, event-free and overall survival were not different between the 2 groups (P = .95 and P = .57, respectively). However, relapse-free-survival was significantly superior in VPA compared with STANDARD (24.4% vs 6.4% at 5 years; P = .02).

The multiplicity of markers, limited information on their independent prognostic value, and a lack of understanding of how to interpret discordant markers are major barriers to use in routine clinical practice. We therefore performed an analysis of 23 prognostic markers based on prospectively collected data from 1948 CLL patients participating in phase 3 trials of the German CLL Study Group to develop a comprehensive prognostic index. A multivariable Cox regression model identified 8 independent predictors of OS: sex, age, ECOG status, del(17p), del(11q), IGHV mutation status, serum beta2-microglobulin, and serum thymidine kinase. Using a weighted grading system, a prognostic index was derived that separated 4 risk categories with 5-year OS ranging from 18.7% to 95.2% and having a C-statistic of 0.75. The index stratified OS within all analyzed subgroups, including all Rai/Binet stages.

We compared the prognostic value of specific cytogenetic abnormalities, IPSS-R karyotype and monosomal karyotype for HCT outcome in 98 patients with MDS and AML post MDS. Higher-risk IPSS-R karyotype, 3q21q26 and transformation to AML before HCT were associated with increased cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), whereas OS was adversely influenced by del 5q/-5, abnormalities of chromosomes 11 and 17 and cytogenetic IPSS-R very poor category. Karyotype with 2 abnormalities and no abnormalities of chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 11 and 17 was an independent prognostic factor of lower CIR (hazard ratio (HR)=0.2, P=0.01) and longer OS (HR=0.5, P=0.03). In conclusion, some specific cytogenetic abnormalities and high cytogenetic complexity, as reflected by IPSS-R very poor karyotype, rather than monosomal karyotype, were associated with higher CIR and shorter OS after HCT.

Its close relationship with retinoic acid-induced granulopoiesis suggests that the deregulated expression of KMT2E might lead acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) blasts to become less susceptible to the conventional treatment protocols. Here, we assessed the impact of KMT2E expression on the prognosis of 121 APL patients treated with ATRA and anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Univariate analysis showed that complete remission (P = 0.006), 2-year overall survival (OS) (P = 0.005) and 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates (P = 0.037) were significantly lower in patients with low KMT2E expression; additionally, the 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse was higher in patients with low KMT2E expression (P = 0.04). Multivariate analysis revealed that low KMT2E expression was independently associated with lower remission rate (odds ratio [OR]: 7.18, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.71-30.1; P = 0.007) and shorter OS (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.08-0.87; P = 0.029).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To perform the experiments, 5-day-old C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups: the control group (0 Gy) and irradiated groups (10 and 20 Gy). Micro-CT analysis, HE staining, immunohistochemistry analysis, and TUNEL assay were then performed. RESULTS: Roots in irradiated mice were dose-dependently shorter than those of control mice. Cells located outside the root dentin, with abnormal morphology in irradiated mice, were positive for an odontoblast marker. HERS fragmentation occurred earlier in irradiated mice than in control mice, and HERS was trapped by the calcified apical tissue. A dose-dependent reduction in the number of proliferating cells within the apical dental pulp and periapical periodontal ligament surrounding HERS was observed in irradiated mice. Apoptotic cells in the dental pulp and periodontal ligament surrounding HERS were hardly seen. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the early disappearance of HERS and the proliferative suppression of the surrounding mesenchymal cells, which was induced by irradiation, caused dental root malformation.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, the exact role of sorcin in MDR cells is yet to be fully elucidated. Here we explored the role of sorcin in the development of MDR in leukemia cells, and revealed that the expression level of sorcin was directly correlated to the expression of MDR1/P-glycoprotein (P-gp). In addition, it was shown that sorcin induced the expression of MDR1/P-gp through a cAMP response element (CRE) between -716 and -709 bp of the mdr1/p-gp gene. Furthermore, overexpression of sorcin increased the phosphorylation of CREB1 and the binding of CREB1 to the CRE sequence of mdr1/p-gp promoter, and induced the expression of MDR1/P-gp. These findings suggested that sorcin induces MDR1/P-gp expression markedly through activation of the CREB pathway and is associated with the MDR phenotype. The new findings may be helpful for understanding the mechanisms of MDR in human cancer cells, prompting its further investigation as a molecular target to overcome MDR.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

B cell-depleting anti-CD20 mAb has been administered before or after cGVHD onset for preventing or treating cGVHD in the clinic. Although administration before onset appeared to be more effective, the effect is variable and sometimes minimal. Here, we used 2 mouse cGVHD models to evaluate the preventive and therapeutic effect of anti-CD20 mAb. With the model of DBA/2 donor to MHC-matched BALB/c recipient, 1 intravenous injection of anti-CD20 mAb (40 mg/kg) the following day or on day 7 after hematopoietic cell transplantation when serum autoantibodies were undetectable effectively prevented induction of cGVHD and preserved a strong graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. The separation of GVL effect from GVHD was associated with a significant reduction of donor CD4(+) T cell proliferation and expansion and protection of host thymic medullary epithelial cells. Anti-CD20 mAb administration also prevented expansion of donor T cells and induction of cGVHD in another mouse model of C57BL/6 donor to MHC-mismatched BALB/c recipients. In contrast, administration of anti-CD20 mAb after GVHD onset was not able to effectively deplete donor B cells or ameliorate cGVHD in either model. These results indicate that administration of anti-CD20 mAb before signs of cGVHD can prevent induction of autoimmune-like cGVHD while preserving a GVL effect; there is little effect if administered after cGVHD onset. This provides new insights into clinical prevention and therapy of cGVHD with B cell-depleting reagents.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

In the pathogenesis of acute GVHD, it has been established that donor-derived T-cells activated in the recipient play a major role in GVHD in initiation and maintenance within an inflammatory cascade. To reduce the risk of GVHD, intensification of GVHD prophylaxis like T-cell depletion is effective, but it inevitably increases the risk of infectious diseases and abrogates beneficial graft-versus-leukemia effects. Although various cytokines are considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of GVHD, GVHD initiation is such a complex process that cannot be prevented by means of single inflammatory cytokine inhibition. Thus, efficient methods to control the whole inflammatory milieu both on cellular and humoral view are needed. In this context, infectious diseases can theoretically contribute to an elevation of inflammatory cytokines after allogeneic HSCT and activation of various subtypes of immune effector cells, which might in summary lead to an aggravation of acute GVHD. The appropriate treatments or prophylaxis of bacterial infection during the early phase after allogeneic HSCT might be beneficial to reduce not only infectious-related but also GVHD-related mortality.

Additionally, the expression of SAP in double-positive thymocytes is mandatory for natural killer T (NKT) cells and, in mouse, for innate CD8(+) T cell development. To date, only two members of the SLAMF of receptors, Slamf1 and Slamf6, have been shown to positively cooperate during NKT cell differentiation in mouse. However, it is less clear whether other members of this family may also participate in the development of these innate T cells. Here, we show that Slamf[1 + 6](-/-) and Slamf[1 + 5 + 6](-/-) B6 mice have ~70% reduction of NKT cells compared to wild-type B6 mice. Unexpectedly, the proportion of innate CD8(+) T cells slightly increased in the Slamf[1 + 5 + 6](-/-) , but not in the Slamf[1 + 6](-/-) strain, suggesting that Slamf5 may function as a negative regulator of innate CD8(+) T cell development. Accordingly, Slamf5(-/-) B6 mice showed an exclusive expansion of innate CD8(+) T cells, but not NKT cells. Interestingly, the SAP-independent Slamf7(-/-) strain showed an expansion of both splenic innate CD8(+) T cells and thymic NKT cells. On the other hand, and similar to what was recently shown in Slamf3(-/-) BALB/c mice, the proportions of thymic promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF(hi)) NKT cells and innate CD8(+) T cells significantly increased in the SAP-independent Slamf8(-/-) BALB/c strain. In summary, these results show that NKT and innate CD8(+) T cell development can be regulated in a SAP-dependent and -independent fashion by SLAMF receptors, in which Slamf1, Slamf6, and Slamf8 affect development of NKT cells, and that Slamf5, Slamf7, and Slamf8 affect the development of innate CD8(+) T cells.",,"['De Calisto, Jaime', 'Wang, Ninghai', 'Wang, Guoxing', 'Yigit, Burcu', 'Engel, Pablo', 'Terhorst, Cox']","['De Calisto J', 'Wang N', 'Wang G', 'Yigit B', 'Engel P', 'Terhorst C']","['Division of Immunology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School , Boston, MA , USA.', 'Division of Immunology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School , Boston, MA , USA.', 'Division of Immunology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School , Boston, MA , USA.', 'Division of Immunology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School , Boston, MA , USA.', 'Immunology Unit, Department of Cell Biology, Immunology and Neurosciences, Medical School , University of Barcelona, Barcelona , Spain.', 'Division of Immunology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School , Boston, MA , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140423,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Eomes', 'NKT', 'PLZF', 'SAP', 'SLAM', 'T cell development', 'innate CD8+ T cells', 'innate-like lymphocytes']",2014/05/06 06:00,2014/05/06 06:01,['2014/05/06 06:00'],"['2014/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2014.00186 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2014 Apr 23;5:186. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2014.00186. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4005954,"['P01 AI065687/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AI076210/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI015066/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GCs activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), to regulate a complex genetic network, culminating in apoptosis. Normal lymphoblasts and many lymphoid malignancies are sensitive to GC-driven apoptosis. Resistance to GCs can be a significant clinical problem, however, and correlates with resistance to several other major chemotherapeutic agents. METHODS: We analyzed the effect of treatment with the cytosine analogue 5 aza-2' deoxycytidine (AZA) on GC resistance in two acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T or pre-T ALL) cell lines- CEM and Molt-4- and a (B-cell) myeloma cell line, RPMI 8226. Methods employed included tissue culture, flow cytometry, and assays for clonogenicity, cytosine extension, immunochemical identification of proteins, and gene transactivation. High throughput DNA sequencing was used to confirm DNA methylation status. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of these cells with AZA resulted in altered DNA methylation and restored GC-evoked apoptosis in all 3 cell lines. In CEM cells the altered epigenetic state resulted in site-specific phosphorylation of the GR, increased GR potency, and GC-driven induction of the GR from promoters that lie in CpG islands. In RPMI 8226 cells, expression of relevant coregulators of GR function was altered. Activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which is central to a feed-forward mechanism of site-specific GR phosphorylation and ultimately, apoptosis, occurred in all 3 cell lines. These data show that in certain malignant hematologic B- and T-cell types, epigenetically controlled GC resistance can be reversed by cell exposure to a compound that causes DNA demethylation.

Like all tyrosine kinase inhibitors, imatinib works by preventing a tyrosine kinase enzyme. Because the BCR-Abl tyrosine kinase enzyme exists only in cancer cells and not in healthy cells, imatinib works as a form of targeted therapy-only cancer cells are killed through the drug's action. In this regard, imatinib was one of the first cancer therapies to show the potential for such targeted action and is often cited as a paradigm for research in cancer therapeutics. This study presents a comprehensive profile of imatinib, including detailed nomenclature, formulae, physico-chemical properties, methods of preparation, and methods of analysis (including compendial, electrochemical, spectroscopic, and chromatographic methods of analysis). Spectroscopic and spectrometric analyses include UV/vis spectroscopy, vibrational spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry ((1)H and (13)C NMR), and mass spectrometry. Chromatographic methods of analyses include electrophoresis, thin layer chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography. Preliminary stability investigations for imatinib have established the main degradation pathways, for example, oxidation to N-oxide under oxidative stress conditions. Stability was also carried out for the formulation by exposing to different temperatures 0 degrees C, ambient temperature, and 40 degrees C. No remarkable change was found in the drug content of formulation. This indicates that the drug was stable at the above optimized formulation. Stability studies under acidic and alkaline conditions have established the following main degradation products: alpha-(4-Methyl-1-piperazinyl)-3'-{[4-(3-pyridyl)-2-pyrimidinyl] amino}-p-tolu-p-toluid-ide methanesulfonate and 4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-ylmethyl)-benzoic acid. The main degradation products under oxidation conditions, that is, 4-[(4-methyl-4-oxido-piperazin-1-yl)-methyl]-N-[4-methyl-3-(4-pyridin-3-yl-pyrimi din-2-ylamino)-phenyl]-enzamide, 4-[(4-methyl-1-oxido-piperazin-1-yl)-methyl]-N-[4-methyl-3-(4-pyridin-3-yl-pyrimi din-2-ylamino)-phenyl]-benzamide, and 4-[(4-methyl-1,4-dioxido-piperazin-1-yl)-methyl]-N-[4-methyl-3-(4-pyridin-3-yl-py rimidin-2-ylamino)-phenyl]-enzamide. Clinical application studies for pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, and clinical uses of the drug were also presented.

Several methods of gefitinib synthesis are included in this review. UV spectroscopy of dasatinib showed a lambdamax of approximately 320-330nm, and IR spectroscopy principal peaks were observed at 3418 (NH), 3200 (OH), 1620 (CO), 1582 (CC and CN), 1513 (CHCH) cm(-1). Characteristic NH peaks were observed in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy at 11.47 and 9.88ppm. The molecular mass was observed at m/z=487.3((35)Cl) and 488.9((37)Cl) (molecular weight=487.15) and the fragmentation pattern was studied using ion trap mass spectrometry. In addition, different analytical methods for determination of dasatinib are also described in this review. Pharmacokinetically, dasatinib is rapidly absorbed after oral administration where the solubility is dependent on pH. Dasatinib extensively binds to human plasma proteins by approximately 96%. In leukemic patient, the calculated apparent volume of distribution for dasatinib was 2502L and the estimated elimination half-life was approximately 3-5h. Dasatinib is metabolized in humans markedly by CYP3A4 to active metabolites and by phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes, such as UDP glucuronosyltransferase. Dasatinib is mainly eliminated via the feces (85%), of which relatively small amount of dasatinib is excreted unchanged as intact drug (19%). Most of the adverse effects associated with dasatinib therapy are mild to moderate in severity and are usually reversible and manageable with appropriate intervention, such as cardiac failure, hypertension, and coronary artery disease.",['(c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The search for anti-cancer drugs has then become urgent. It depends on the studies of natural and chemical synthesis products. The antitumor action of LQB-118, a pterocarpanquinone structurally related to lapachol, has been demonstrated to induce mechanisms linked to leukemia cell apoptosis. This work investigated some mechanisms of the in vitro antitumor action of LQB-118 on prostate cancer cells. LQB-118 reduced the expression of the c-Myc transcription factor, downregulated the cyclin D1 and cyclin B1 mRNA levels and upregulated the p21 cell cycle inhibitor. These effects resulted in cell cycle arrest in the S and G2/M phases and inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. LQB-118 also induced programmed cell death of the prostate cancer cells, as evidenced by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and annexin-V positive cells. Except the cell cycle arrest in the S phase and enhanced c-Myc expression, all the mechanisms observed here for the in vitro antitumor action of LQB-118 were also found for Paclitaxel, a traditional antineoplastic drug. These findings suggest new molecular mechanisms for the LQB-118 in vitro antitumor action.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Mll3 suppression impairs the differentiation of HSPC.

The role of this family in the innate immune response makes it an attractive candidate for the treatment of many viral and chronic immune-compromised diseases. Recombinant IFNA2 is clinically used to modulate hairy cell leukemia as well as hepatitis c. Historically, IFNA2 has been purified from human leukocytes as well as bacterial expression systems. In most cases, bacterial expression of IFNA2 resulted in inclusion body formation, or required numerous purification steps that decreased the protein yield. Here, we describe an expression and purification scheme for IFNA2 using a pET-SUMO bacterial expression system and a single purification step. Using the SUMO protein as the fusion tag achieved high soluble protein expression. The SUMO tag was cleaved with the Ulp1 protease leaving no additional amino acids on the fusion terminus following cleavage. Mass spectrometry, circular dichroism, 2D heteronuclear NMR, and analytical ultracentrifugation confirmed the amino acid sequence identity, secondary and tertiary protein structures, and the solution behavior of the purified IFNA2. The purified protein also had antiviral and anti-proliferative activities comparable to the WHO International Standard, NIBSC 95/650, and the IFNA2 standard available from PBL Assay Science.

METHODS: We identified 3,402 ALL cases among children 0 to 5 years of age using the California Cancer Registry. From California birth records we randomly selected controls in a 20:1 ratio and frequency matched them to cases by birth year. We investigated markers of exposure to infections, including month of birth, timing of birth in relation to influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) seasons, and birth order based on data from California birth certificates and national infection surveillance systems. RESULTS: We observed an increased risk of ALL for spring and summer births, and for those first exposed to an influenza or RSV season at nine to twelve months of age compared with those exposed during the first three months of life, and this association was stronger among first born children [odds ratios (OR), 1.44 and 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.13-1.82, for influenza exposure at nine to twelve months of age]. Decreased risk was observed with increasing birth order among non-Hispanic whites but not Hispanics (OR, 0.76 and 95% CI, 0.59-096, for fourth or higher birth order among whites).

Whereas most studies to date focused on children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), little data have been published on patients suffering from Hodgkin disease or from solid tumors. We therefore analyzed the loss of protective immunity (defined as immunity at the time of diagnosis and lack of immunity after completion of therapy) against vaccine-preventable diseases in children treated for various malignancies. METHODS: Children and adolescents <21 years of age at diagnosis and treated between 2001 and 2010 for various malignancies in the Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Frankfurt, were included in the retrospective chart review. Antibody levels against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella-zoster-virus (VZV) were routinely assessed at the time of diagnosis and within 12 months after completion of therapy. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 195 children (122 male); 80 patients had ALL, 15 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 18 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 22 Hodgkin disease, and 60 various solid tumors. Overall, 27%, 47%, 19%, and 17% of the patients lost their humoral immunity against measles, mumps, rubella, and VZV, respectively. The risk of losing protective antibody titers depended on age with a higher risk in younger children. The loss of protective humoral immunity occurred significantly more often in patients with ALL compared to patients with any other underlying malignant disease (hematological malignancies such AML and NHL, Hodgkin disease or solid tumors). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that a significant number of children lose pre-existing humoral immunity against measles, mumps, rubella, and VZV after completion of chemotherapy. This loss occurs more often in children with ALL than in children with AML, solid tumors and Hodgkin disease. Our results underline the need for post-chemotherapy revaccination of childhood cancer survivors.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we constructed a novel polyepitope vaccine which used recombinant lentiviral vector carrying BCR/ABL and WT1 genes, and determined the immunological effects of this vaccine in vitro. METHODS: The DC vaccine was constructed using lentiviral vector transduced DCs. T lymphocytes were stimulated with DC vaccine and then co-cultured in vitro with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from CML or ALL patients, respectively. The cytotoxicity of proliferous cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) was determined by the LDH assay. The IFN-gamma production of CTLs was detected using ELISPOT assay. RESULTS: We constructed an lentiviral vector encoding 50 different epitopes from BCR/ABL and WT1 antigens, and transferred it into DCs to prepare the DC vaccine successfully. The in vivo stimulation of CTLs with this DC vaccine were proved to show strong cytotoxicity and produce high level of IFN-gamma.

In this study, a polymerase chain reaction-based canine XCIP analysis of the androgen receptor (AR) gene was applied for the assessment of cell clonality in canine hematopoietic tumors. This XCIP analysis is based on the polymorphic CAG repeats in the AR gene and the difference of methylation status between active and inactive X chromosomes. We first examined the polymorphisms of 2 CAG tandem repeats in the AR gene in 52 male and 150 female dogs of various breeds. The 2 polymorphic CAG repeats contained 9 to 12 and 10 to 14 CAGs in the first and second CAG repeats, respectively. Of the 150 female dogs, 74 (49.3%) were heterozygous for the first and/or second polymorphic CAG tandem repeats, indicating the utility of XCIP analysis in these dogs. Canine XCIP analysis was then applied to clinical samples from female dogs with canine high-grade lymphoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, and benign lymph node hyperplasia. Of 10 lymphoma cell samples, 9 (90%) showed skewed XCIPs, indicating their clonal origins, whereas all the nonneoplastic lymph node samples showed balanced XCIPs. Moreover, bone marrow specimen from a dog with acute myelogenous leukemia and peripheral leukocyte specimens from 2 dogs with chronic myelogenous leukemia showed skewed XCIPs.

However, the underlying mechanism is not completely understood. Here, we show that WDR5, a subunit of the SET1/MLL complex, interacts with H3T11P, and this interaction facilitates the recruitment of the MLL1 complex and subsequent H3K4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3). Using ChIP-seq, we find that androgen stimulation results in a 6-fold increase in the number of H3T11P-marked regions and induces WDR5 colocalization to one third of H3T11P-enriched promoters, thus establishing a genome-wide relationship between H3T11P and recruitment of WDR5. Accordingly, PKN1 knockdown or chemical inhibition severely blocks WDR5 chromatin association and H3K4me3 on AR target genes. Finally, WDR5 is critical in prostate cancer cell proliferation and is hyperexpressed in human prostate cancers. Together, these results identify WDR5 as a critical epigenomic integrator of histone phosphorylation and methylation and as a major driver of androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell proliferation.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In contrast, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells show constitutionally active Wnt signaling, which is associated with upregulated levels of pathway members such as Wnt3 and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1. Functionally, this results in increased resistance to apoptosis. We therefore assumed that targeting members of the pathway could reveal new therapeutic options for the treatment of CLL. METHODS: Screening a Wnt compound library with 75 Wnt modulators via ATP assay revealed Trichostatin A as an outstanding substance with strong viability decreasing effects on CLL cells and little effect on healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Further survival analysis was performed via fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. RESULTS: A maximum effect was achieved after 48 h with a wide therapeutic window in contrast to PBMCs (CLL cells: 0.253 microM, PBMCs: 145.22 microM). Trichostatin A induced caspases and acted via a dual mechanism to reveal histone and non-histone targets. Histone targets were displayed in deacetylation inhibition at DNA level, and non-histone targeting was demonstrated by elevated levels of Dickkopf-related protein 1 mRNA. Primary cells of patients with critical mutations such as TP53 or those who had already undergone extensive previous treatment responded well to the treatment. Moreover, the approved histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor suberoylanilidehydroxamic acid (SAHA) was not as effective as Trichostatin A (Trichostatin A: 0.253 microM, SAHA: 7.88 microM). Combining Trichostatin A with established CLL drugs fludarabine or bendamustine showed an additive effect in vitro. CONCLUSION: Taken together, Trichostatin A appears to act via a dual anti-HDAC/Wnt mechanism with a high selectivity and efficacy in CLL and therefore warrants further investigation.",,"['Peiffer, Lukas', 'Poll-Wolbeck, Simon Jonas', 'Flamme, Hanna', 'Gehrke, Iris', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Kreuzer, Karl-Anton']","['Peiffer L', 'Poll-Wolbeck SJ', 'Flamme H', 'Gehrke I', 'Hallek M', 'Kreuzer KA']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, University at Cologne, Kerpener Strasse 62, 50937, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140504,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'Vorinostat', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*drug effects']",,,2014/05/06 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2014/05/06 06:00'],"['2014/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-014-1689-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2014 Aug;140(8):1283-93. doi: 10.1007/s00432-014-1689-0.

This subset of CD4+ cells is characterized by interleukin (IL)-17A and IL-17F production, which share strong homology, and surface expression of the IL-23 receptor (IL-23R). The present study aimed to determine the association between the polymorphic features located within the IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-23R genes and disease susceptibility, progression and response to therapy. In addition, the relationship between the polymorphic variants and the plasma IL-17 levels in patients was analyzed. METHODS: For this purpose, 187 individuals of Polish origin including 62 AML patients and 125 healthy controls were typed for IL-17A (rs2275913; G-197A), IL-17F (rs763780; A7488G; His161Arg) and IL-23R (rs11209026, G1142A; Arg381Gln) alleles. RESULTS: The rs763780 IL-17F polymorphism appeared to be associated with susceptibility to the disease. The presence of the minor (G) variant (RR = 4.76, p < 0.001) and its homozygosity (RR = 23.02, p < 0.005) was more frequent among patients than healthy individuals. No significant association was observed for either other polymorphisms studied or IL-17 levels.

Human exposure to myristicin is low but widespread due to consumption of these spices and essential oils, added to food (e.g. cola drinks) or in traditional medicine. Occasionally high dose exposure occurs, leading to various clinical symptoms, however the molecular mechanisms underlying them are unknown. Our previous studies revealed that myristicin is not genotoxic and yet presented apoptotic activity. Therefore, in this work we assessed the apoptotic mechanisms induced by myristicin in human leukaemia cells. In order to gain further insight on the potential of myristicin to modulate gene expression we also analysed alterations in expression of 84 genes associated with the DNA damage response pathway. The results obtained show that myristicin can induce apoptosis as characterised by alterations in the mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, PARP-cleavage and DNA fragmentation. The gene expression profile revealed an overall down regulation of DNA damage response genes after exposure to myristicin, with significant under-expression of genes associated with nucleotide excision repair (ERCC1), double strand break repair (RAD50, RAD51) and DNA damage signalling (ATM) and stress response (GADD45A, GADD45G). On the whole, we demonstrate that myristicin can alter mitochondrial membrane function, induce apoptosis and modulate gene expression in human leukaemia K562 cells.

The parents completed a battery of surveys relating to interest in and barriers to intervention participation, as well as measures of parental knowledge and beliefs and their children's cognitive functioning, and health-related quality of life. Results showed that the majority of parents expressed interest in participating in the proposed 8-week intervention, with over 90% indicating interest in learning more about improving grades, making learning more exciting, being a role model, and the impact of cancer on memory. The factors most strongly related to interest in intervention included lower maternal education as well as perceptions of greater child cognitive difficulties and lower health-related quality of life. The barriers most highly endorsed by the most parents were difficulty paying for gas, child care responsibility, and too much stress in other parts of life. Also highly endorsed as barriers were statements relating to the child's lack of interest and need for services (i.e., my child is doing fine).

We observed that 32080 cells had a striking variegated pattern in CD4 expression. There was cell-to-cell variability, with some cells expressing no CD4 and others expressing high CD4. The two populations were isogenic and yet differed in their rates of apoptosis and sensitivity to glucocorticoid. We sorted the 32080 line for CD4-positive or CD4-negative cells and observed them in culture. After 1 week, both sorted populations showed variegated CD4 expression, like the parental line, showing that the two populations could interconvert. We determined that cell replication was necessary to transit from CD4(+) to CD4(-) and CD4(-) to CD4(+). Lmo2 knockdown decreased CD4 expression, while inhibition of intracellular NOTCH1 or histone deacetylase activity induced CD4 expression. Enforced expression of RUNX1 repressed CD4 expression. We analyzed the CD4 locus by Histone 3 chromatin immunoprecipitation and found silencing marks in the CD4(-) cells and activating marks in the CD4(+) population.

The gene regulatory mechanisms that underlie endothelial progenitor-mediated vascular repair, however, remain elusive. Here, we identify the transcription factor TAL1/SCL as a key mediator of the vascular repair function of primary human endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs). Genome-wide analyses in ECFCs demonstrate that TAL1 activates a transcriptional program that promotes cell adhesion and migration. At the mechanistic level, we show that TAL1 upregulates the expression of migratory and adhesion genes through recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase p300. Based on these findings, we establish a strategy that enhances the revascularization efficiency of ECFCs after ischemia through ex vivo priming with the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA. Thus, small molecule epigenetics drugs are effective tools for modifying the epigenome of stem/progenitor cells prior to transplantation as a means to enhance their therapeutic potential.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

However, it remains to be elucidated how HTLV-1 induces both neoplastic and inflammatory diseases. A critical component in the Treg-cell machinery is the transcription factor Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), which is expressed in ~5% of CD4(+) T cells of healthy individuals. Foxp3 is expressed in around 80% of ATL cases. Recent studies point to the capacity of Treg cells to convert to other cell types, even to those with an inflammatory phenotype. These characteristics might indicate that Treg cells might be playing a critical role in HTLV-1 infection, either by being targeted by the virus or by regulating and modulating the immune response. In this review, we will discuss the interplay between Foxp3 expression and HTLV-1, focusing on important viral proteins that might help the virus to trigger the development of such diverse pathologies.","['(c) The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2014.

The hypermethylation of the TGFBI promoter, as one of the main regulatory mechanisms, is associated with TGFBI silencing. In this study, we used a methylation-specific PCR (MSP) method to evaluate the methylation status of the TGFBI promoter in human leukemias. METHODS: Real-time RT-PCR and methylation-specific PCR approaches were performed to define the TGFBI expression and promoter methylation in human leukemia cell lines and clinical samples. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from leukemia patients, bisulfite-converted, and analyzed by the MSP method. RESULTS: Hypermethylation of the TGFBI promoter occurred in leukemia cell lines and demethylation treatment reexpressed TGFBI at a substantially increased level in most of leukemia cell lines tested. Furthermore, a much higher level of CpG island methylation and a significantly lower TGFBI expression were also identified in clinical leukemia samples. CONCLUSION: The results suggest an important role of promoter methylation in regulating TGFBI expression in leukemia, which provides a useful diagnostic marker for clinical management of human leukemias.",,"['Fang, Hongbo', 'Liu, Jing', 'Guo, Dan', 'Liu, Peixiang', 'Zhao, Yongliang']","['Fang H', 'Liu J', 'Guo D', 'Liu P', 'Zhao Y']","['Center for Genome Variations and Precision Bio-Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China.', 'Center for Genome Variations and Precision Bio-Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.', 'Center for Genome Variations and Precision Bio-Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China.', ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, First People's Hospital of Yueyang, Yueyang, Hunan 414000, China."", 'Center for Genome Variations and Precision Bio-Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects/*genetics', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sulfites/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*genetics']",,,2014/05/06 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/05/06 06:00'],"['2014/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2014;127(9):1645-50.,"['0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Sulfites)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '148710-76-3 (betaIG-H3 protein)', 'OJ9787WBLU (hydrogen sulfite)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The function of plasmin in regulating the inflammatory response is not fully understood, and its role in the development of aGVHD remains unresolved. Here we show that plasmin is activated during the early phase of aGVHD in mice, and its activation correlated with aGVHD severity in humans.

Relatively, few models that use primary human cells recapitulate the full leukemic transformation as assayed in xenografts and myeloid transformation is infrequent. We report a humanized experimental leukemia model where xenografts develop aggressive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with disseminated myeloid sarcomas within 4 weeks following transplantation of cord blood transduced with vectors expressing BCR-ABL1 and a dominant-negative isoform of IKAROS, Ik6. Ik6 induced transcriptional programs in BCR-ABL1-transduced progenitors that contained repressed B-cell progenitor programs, along with strong stemness, proliferation and granulocyte-monocytic progenitor (GMP) signatures-a novel combination not induced in control groups. Thus, wild-type IKAROS restrains stemness properties and has tumor suppressor activity in BCR-ABL1-initiated leukemia. Although IKAROS mutations/deletions are common in lymphoid transformation, they are found also at low frequency in AML that progress from a prior myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) state. Our experimental system provides an excellent model to gain insight into these rare cases of AML transformation and the properties conferred by IKAROS loss of function as a secondary mutation.

Synergy was observed in both mutant neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS)- and mutant kirsten RAS viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)-positive acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell lines and primary patient samples. The observed synergy enhanced dephosphorylation of AKT, 4E-binding protein 1 and s6 kinase, and correlated with increased apoptosis.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in response to FcepsilonRI aggregation has been implicated in mast cell activation. Here, we determined the role of PTP-PEST (encoded by PTPN12) in the regulation of mast cell activation using the RBL-2H3 rat basophilic leukemia cell line as a model. PTP-PEST expression was significantly induced upon FcepsilonRI-crosslinking, and aggregation of FcepsilonRI induced the phosphorylation of PTP-PEST at Ser39, thus resulting in the suppression of PTP activity. By overexpressing a phosphatase-dead mutant (PTP-PEST CS) and a constitutively active mutant (PTP-PEST SA) in RBL-2H3 cells, we showed that PTP-PEST decreased degranulation and enhanced IL-4 and IL-13 transcription in FcepsilonRI-crosslinked RBL-2H3 cells, but PTP activity of PTP-PEST was not necessary for this regulation. However, FcepsilonRI-induced TNF-alpha transcription was increased by the overexpression of PTP-PEST SA and suppressed by the overexpression of PTP-PEST CS. Taken together, these results suggest that PTP-PEST is involved in the regulation of FcepsilonRI-mediated mast cell activation through at least two different processes represented by PTP activity-dependent and -independent pathways.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

IL-3Ralpha (CD123) is a specific marker of acute myeloid leukemia stem cells (AML-LSCs). The over-expression of IL-3Ralpha in patients with AML is related to high white blood cells counts, high percentages of blast cells, and poor prognosis. Moreover, in some studies, IL-3Ralpha has been considered a new detection marker of minimal residual disease in the bone marrow from patients with APL. In contrast to ATRA, As2O3 reduces both mRNA and protein expression of IL-3Ralpha and inhibits the activity of PI3K/Akt after 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h of exposure.

However, these genetically encoded reporters, while useful for monitoring tumor response in cancer models, can impact cell metabolism. Indeed firefly luciferase and fatty acyl-CoA synthetases differ by a single amino acid, raising the possibility that luciferase activity might alter metabolism and introduce experimental artifacts. Therefore knowledge of the metabolic response to luciferase transfection is of significant importance, especially given the thousands of research studies using luciferase as an in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) reporter. Untargeted metabolomics experiments were performed to examine three different types of lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines (Ramos, Raji and SUP T1) commonly used in cancer research, each were analyzed with and without vector transduction. The Raji model was also tested under perturbed starvation conditions to examine potential luciferase-mediated stress responses.

To develop an effective therapy against the disease, we have examined the oncolytic ability of an attenuated vaccinia virus (VV), LC16m8Delta (m8Delta), and an HTLV-I Tax-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) line, 4O1/C8, against an HTLV-I-infected rat T cell line, FPM1. Our results demonstrated that m8Delta was able to replicate in and lyse tumorigenic FPM1 cells but was incompetent to injure 4O1/C8 cells, suggesting the preferential cytolytic activity toward tumor cells. To further enhance the cytolysis of HTLV-I-infected cells, we modified m8Delta and obtained m8Delta/RT1AlSCTax180L, which can express a single chain trimer (SCT) of rat major histocompatibility complex class I with a Tax-epitope. Combined treatment with m8Delta/RT1AlSCTax180L and 4O1/C8 increased the cytolysis of FPM1V.EFGFP/8R cells, a CTL-resistant subclone of FPM1, compared with that using 4O1/C8 and m8Delta presenting an unrelated peptide, suggesting that the activation of 4O1/C8 by m8Delta/RT1AlSCTax180L further enhanced the killing of the tumorigenic HTLV-I-infected cells.

The results indicated that PEG-AuNPs markedly inhibited the viability and impaired the cell membrane integrity of K562 cells. The particles caused morphological changes typical of cell death, and a marked increase in the sub-G1 population in DNA histogram, indicating apoptosis. In addition, PEG-AuNPs reduced the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, a hallmark of the involvement of intrinsic apoptotic pathway in K562 cells.

The FISH technique enhances the capacity of conventional karyotyping to detect subtle chromosomal aberrations. Multiprobe FISH assay (Cytocell, UK) can hybridize multiple probes to a single slide, thereby increasing the detection rate of cytogenetic aberrations. This study aimed to evaluate multiprobe FISH in detecting cytogenetic abnormalities in acute leukemia. METHODS: Thirty newly diagnosed acute leukemia patients who attended the hematology clinic at Dong-A University Hospital from October 2008 to October 2012 were enrolled in the study. The multiprobe FISH results were compared with those of G-banding. RESULTS: Multiprobe FISH detected the chromosomal aberrations identified by G-banding, as well as additional aberrations in 6 of 30 (20.0%) cases, which included ETV6/RUNX1 translocation, p16 deletion, TP53 deletion, and IGH break-apart.

A 58-year-old woman with Ph-positive ALL who relapsed after bone marrow transplantation for meningeal leukemia was treated with high-dose methotrexate, which resulted in remission. She underwent allogeneic cord blood transplantation followed by reduced intensity conditioning chemotherapy with imatinib; however, she experienced CNS relapse and developed an extramedullary mass on the right side of the temporal region. We treated 40 mg of dasatinib once daily, which had to be temporarily discontinued because she developed grade 2 pleural effusion and grade 2 hematemesis. After reinitiation of dasatinib, the extramedullary mass disappeared and meningeal leukemia ameliorated almost immediately. With 40 mg dasatinib administered once daily, its trough level and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration were 32 ng/mL and below the sensitivity threshold of 1 ng/mL, respectively. Treatment was continued, and the patient remained in complete remission until she died of pneumonia 7 years after the initial diagnosis of ALL.

Recently, we found that low T cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 signaling was related to abnormal expression of the negative regulator of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) A20 in acute myeloid leukemia. To investigate the characteristics of T cell immunodeficiency in lymphomas, we analyzed the expression features of A20 and its upstream regulating factor mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1) and genes downstream of NF-kappaB in patients with different lymphoma subtypes, including T cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (T-NHL), B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) and NK/T cell lymphoma (NK/T-CL). METHODS: Real-time PCR was used to determine the expression level of the MALT1, MALT-V1 (variant 1), A20 and NF-kappaB genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 24 cases with T-NHL, 19 cases with B-NHL and 16 cases with NK/T-CL, and 31 healthy individuals (HI) served as control. RESULTS: Significantly lower A20 and NF-kappaB expression was found in patients with all three lymphoma subtypes compared with the healthy controls. Moreover, the MALT1 expression level was downregulated in all three lymphoma subtypes. A significant positive correlation between the expression level of MALT1 and A20, MALT1-V1 and A20, MALT1-V1 and NF-kappaB, and A20 and NF-kappaB was found. CONCLUSIONS: An abnormal MALT1-A20-NF-kappaB expression pattern was found in patients with lymphoma, which may result a lack of A20 and dysfunctional MALT1 and may be related to lower T cell activation, which is a common feature in Chinese patients with lymphoma.

Magnetic fields were assessed by performing spot measurements throughout the house and 24-h measurements in rooms where children spend large amounts of time. Children's exposure in Australia was generally comparable with that in other countries with average fields of 0.05-0.06 muT (95 % CI 0.05-0.06 muT). Prolonged exposure of >0.4 muT was shown in approximately 2 % of the homes (95 % CI 0.2-3.6 %) mainly being due to close proximity of the house to transmission lines. Based on the results of this survey, the public health impact of a causal association between residential magnetic fields and childhood leukaemia is expected to be small.","['(c) The Author 2014.

While survival outcomes have improved, late effects data in survivors treated on such regimens are needed. OBJECTIVE: This multi-institutional study comprehensively describes late effects in survivors treated on the Head Start I/II protocols. METHODS: Survivors of CNS tumors treated on Head Start I/II protocols were enrolled. Late effects data were collected using a validated parent-report questionnaire. Social, emotional, and behavioral functioning and quality of life were assessed using parent-report on the BASC-2 and CHQ-PF50 questionnaires. RESULTS: Twenty-one survivors (medulloblastoma = 13, sPNET = 4, ATRT = 1, ependymoma = 3) were enrolled. Ten (48%) were irradiation-free. Late effects (frequency; median time of onset since diagnosis) included >/= grade III hearing loss (67%; 3.9 years), vision (67%; 4.1 years), hypothyroidism (33%; 4 years), growth hormone (GH) deficiency (48%; 4.7 years), dental (52%; 7.1 years), and no cases of secondary leukemia. Irradiation-free (vs. irradiated) survivors reported low rates of hypothyroidism (0/10 vs. 7/11; P = 0.004) and GH deficiency (2/10 vs. 8/11; P = 0.03). The BASC-2 and CHQPF-50 mean composite scores were within average ranges relative to healthy comparison norms. Neither age at diagnosis nor irradiation was associated with these scores. CONCLUSIONS: Irradiation-free Head Start survivors have lower risk of hypothyroidism and GH deficiency. Secondary leukemias are not reported. With extended follow-up, survivors demonstrate quality of life, social, emotional, and behavioral functioning within average ranges.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Saha, Aniket', 'Salley, Christina G', 'Saigal, Preeti', 'Rolnitzky, Linda', 'Goldberg, Judith', 'Scott, Suzanne', 'Olshefski, Randal', 'Hukin, Juliette', 'Sands, Stephen A', 'Finlay, Jonathan', 'Gardner, Sharon L']","['Saha A', 'Salley CG', 'Saigal P', 'Rolnitzky L', 'Goldberg J', 'Scott S', 'Olshefski R', 'Hukin J', 'Sands SA', 'Finlay J', 'Gardner SL']","['New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140501,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/complications/*drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Growth Disorders/*chemically induced/diagnosis/mortality', 'Hearing Loss/*chemically induced/diagnosis/mortality', 'Humans', 'Hypothyroidism/*chemically induced/diagnosis/mortality', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survival Rate', '*Survivors', 'Vision Disorders/*chemically induced/diagnosis/mortality', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['CNS tumor survivors', 'CNS tumors', 'Head Start', 'late effects', 'quality of life']",2014/05/03 06:00,2014/11/19 06:00,['2014/05/03 06:00'],"['2013/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25064 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Sep;61(9):1644-52; quiz 1653-72. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25064.

METHODS: We evaluated risk of attempted and completed suicide in a cohort of 46,309 patients diagnosed with malignant lymphoma, myeloma and leukemia in Sweden 1992 to 2009 and 107,736 cancer-free subjects, using Poisson regression. RESULTS: In all, 146 suicide attempts and 63 completed suicides occurred during a median follow up of 3.1 years (maximum 19 years). The risk of completed suicide was 3.5-fold increased among patients with myeloma [incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 3.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.05-6.03] and 1.9-fold increased among patients with lymphoma (IRR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.31-2.67) but not significantly increased among patients with leukemia. Risk of attempted suicide was increased among patients with myeloma (IRR = 2.13, CI = 1.39-3.26) and lymphoma (IRR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.07-1.69). Both male and female patients were at increased risk of attempted as well as completed suicide. A pre-malignant history of mental disorders conferred 15-fold to 30-fold increased risks, but elevated risks were also observed among patients without such history. CONCLUSIONS: Suicidal actions in patients with hematological malignancies have high suicidal intent, and that subgroups of patients should be monitored for suicidal ideation.","['Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Mohammadi, Mohammad', 'Moradi, Tahereh', 'Bottai, Matteo', 'Reutfors, Johan', 'Cao, Yang', 'Smedby, Karin E']","['Mohammadi M', 'Moradi T', 'Bottai M', 'Reutfors J', 'Cao Y', 'Smedby KE']","['Unit of Biostatistics, Division of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140430,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Suicidal Ideation', 'Suicide/psychology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Suicide, Attempted/psychology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Sweden', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'myeloma', 'oncology', 'suicide']",2014/05/03 06:00,2015/07/01 06:00,['2014/05/03 06:00'],"['2013/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2014/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pon.3561 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2014 Nov;23(11):1276-82. doi: 10.1002/pon.3561.

METHODS: A computerized search of the literature was performed in December 2013. Articles were included if they investigated CIPN and QOL among cancer patients. Twenty-five articles were selected and were subjected to a 13-item quality checklist independently by two investigators. RESULTS: The methodological quality of the majority of the selected studies was adequate to high. The included studies differed tremendously with respect to study design (19 prospective studies, 5 cross-sectional, 1 both cross-sectional and prospective), patient population (lung, colorectal, ovarian, endometrial, cervical or breast cancer, lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or a mixed population), number of included patients (ranging from 14 to 1643), and ways to assess CIPN (objectively, subjectively, or both). Of the 25 included studies, 11 assessed the association of CIPN on patients' QOL. While three of these studies did not find an association between CIPN and QOL, the others concluded that more CIPN was associated with a lower QOL. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Although the included studies in this systematic review were very diverse, which impedes drawing firm conclusions on this topic, CIPN is likely to have a negative association with QOL. The variety of the studied patient populations and chemotherapeutic agents in the existing studies calls for further studies on this topic. These studies are preferably prospective in nature, include a large number of patients, and assess QOL and CIPN with validated questionnaires.",,"['Mols, Floortje', 'Beijers, Tonneke', 'Vreugdenhil, Gerard', 'van de Poll-Franse, Lonneke']","['Mols F', 'Beijers T', 'Vreugdenhil G', 'van de Poll-Franse L']","['CoRPS - Center of Research on Psychology in Somatic Diseases, Department of Medical and Clinical Psychology, Tilburg University, PO Box 90153, 5000 LE, Tilburg, The Netherlands, F.Mols@tilburguniversity.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20140501,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Quality of Life']",,,2014/05/03 06:00,2014/09/02 06:00,['2014/05/03 06:00'],"['2014/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-014-2255-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2014 Aug;22(8):2261-9. doi: 10.1007/s00520-014-2255-7.

Its importance in clinical management is demonstrated by the recent introduction into routine clinical practice of various individualised, molecularly targeted therapies with increased efficacy and/or reduced toxicity. The identification of cancer predisposition genes, such as the BRCA genes in breast cancer, permits screening programmes to identify patients ""at-risk"" of developing cancer and helps them make decisions on individual risk-modification behaviours. Personalised medicine also plays an increasingly important role in cancer treatment. It is increasingly clear that there are molecularly distinct subtypes of various common cancers, with different therapeutic approaches required for each subtype, for example, the use of the monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and cetuximab) in HER2-positive breast cancer and wild-type KRAS colorectal cancer; tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, gefitinib, erlotinib and crizotinib) in chronic myeloid leukaemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumours and non-small-cell lung cancer and intracellular agents (vemurafenib and olaparib) in metastatic malignant melanoma and ovarian, breast and prostate cancer. The efficacy of various targeted therapies in such disparate tumours suggests that we are entering an era in which treatment decisions will be based on tumour molecular abnormality profile or ""signature,"" rather than tumour tissue type or anatomical site of origin, improving patient prognosis and quality of life.

However, cancer incidence and survival trends among AYAs (15-29 years) have never been studied in Korea. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the incidence and relative survival rates and their trends among AYAs in Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cancer incidence data from 1999-2010 were obtained from the Korea Central Cancer Registry (KCCR). Each cancer was classified into subgroups according to the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) AYA site recode. Percent distributions, age-specific incidence rates, age-standardized incidence rates per million, and annual percent changes (APCs) were calculated for AYAs according to sex. Five-year relative survival rates were estimated for cases diagnosed between 1993 and 2010 and followed up to 2011. RESULTS: The age-standardized incidence rates of all cancers combined were 196.4 and 367.8 per million for males and females, respectively (male-to-female (M/F) ratio: 0.5). The age-standardized incidence rates increased from 208.7 per million in 1999 to 396.4 per million in 2010, and the APC was 6.3% (P<0.001). The five most common cancers among AYAs were thyroid carcinoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, stomach carcinoma, breast carcinoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. In males, the 5-year relative survival rate improved, from 46.5% in 1993-1995 to 75.9% in 2006-2010. In females, the 5-year relative survival rate also improved, from 66.7% in 1993-1995 to 89.1% in 2006-2010. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed increases in cancer incidence and improvements in the 5-year relative survival rate among Korean AYAs. This study also provides additional data regarding temporal and geographic trends in cancer that may enhance future efforts to identify factors affecting cancer incidence and responses to treatment among AYAs.",,"['Moon, Eun-Kyeong', 'Park, Hyeon Jin', 'Oh, Chang-Mo', 'Jung, Kyu-Won', 'Shin, Hee Young', 'Park, Byung Kiu', 'Won, Young-Joo']","['Moon EK', 'Park HJ', 'Oh CM', 'Jung KW', 'Shin HY', 'Park BK', 'Won YJ']","['Cancer Registration and Statistics Branch, National Cancer Control Institute, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Cancer for Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Cancer Registration and Statistics Branch, National Cancer Control Institute, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Cancer Registration and Statistics Branch, National Cancer Control Institute, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer for Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Cancer Registration and Statistics Branch, National Cancer Control Institute, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140501,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Registries', 'Republic of Korea/epidemiology', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/05/03 06:00,2014/12/19 06:00,['2014/05/03 06:00'],"['2013/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0096088 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-48595 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 May 1;9(5):e96088. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0096088. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC4006908,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The identification of ""druggable"" oncogenic kinases and the creation of small-molecule inhibitors designed to specifically target these mutant kinases have become an important therapeutic paradigm across several different malignancies. Often these inhibitors induce dramatic clinical responses in molecularly defined cohorts. However, resistance to such targeted therapies is an inevitable consequence of this therapeutic approach. Resistance can be either primary (de novo) or acquired. Mechanisms leading to primary resistance may be categorized as tumor intrinsic factors or as patient/drug-specific factors. Acquired resistance may be mediated by target gene modification, activation of ""bypass tracks"" that serve as compensatory signaling loops, or histologic transformation. This brief review is a snapshot of the complex problem of therapeutic resistance, with a focus on resistance to kinase inhibitors in EGF receptor mutant and ALK rearranged non-small cell lung cancer, BRAF-mutant melanoma, and BCR-ABL-positive chronic myeloid leukemia.

However, the role of PEITC in the inhibition of human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) K562 cell growth and its underlying mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, PEITC was found to induce cell death through the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress and oxidative damage. Heme oxygenase1 (HO1), which participates in the development of numerous tumors and the sensitivity of these tumors to chemotherapeutic drugs, plays a protective role by modulating oxidative injury. Therefore, the present study assessed the inhibitory effect of PEITC on K562 cells and whether HO1 facilitated cell apoptosis and ROS generation. PEITC was found to suppress cell growth and cause apoptosis by promoting Fas and Fas ligand expression, increasing ROS generation and by the successive release of cytochrome c as well as the activation of caspase9 and caspase3. PEITC was also combined with the HO1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX and the inducer hemin to assess whether HO1 determines cell survival and ROS generation. The results of the present study suggest that PEITC may be a potential antitumor compound for CML therapy, and that HO1 has a critical function in PEITCinduced apoptosis and ROS generation.",,"['Wang, Yating', 'Wei, Sixi', 'Wang, Jishi', 'Fang, Qin', 'Chai, Qixiang']","['Wang Y', 'Wei S', 'Wang J', 'Fang Q', 'Chai Q']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical College, Guiyang, Guizhou 550004, P.R.

They are also utilized as vectors for vaccination and for gene and cancer therapy, as well as tools to discover mechanisms of cancer due to their tumorigenic potential in experimental animals. The adenovirus E4-ORF1 gene encodes an oncoprotein that promotes viral replication, cell survival, and transformation by activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). While the mechanism of activation is not understood, this function depends on a complex formed between E4-ORF1 and the membrane-associated cellular PDZ protein Discs Large 1 (Dlg1), a common viral target having both tumor suppressor and oncogenic functions. Here, we report that in human epithelial cells, E4-ORF1 interacts with the regulatory and catalytic subunits of PI3K and elevates their levels. Like PI3K activation, PI3K protein elevation by E4-ORF1 requires Dlg1. We further show that Dlg1, E4-ORF1, and PI3K form a ternary complex at the plasma membrane. At this site, Dlg1 also co-localizes with the activated PI3K effector protein Akt, indicating that the ternary complex mediates PI3K signaling. Signifying the functional importance of the ternary complex, the capacity of E4-ORF1 to induce soft agar growth and focus formation in cells is ablated either by a mutation that prevents E4-ORF1 binding to Dlg1 or by a PI3K inhibitor drug. These results demonstrate that E4-ORF1 interacts with Dlg1 and PI3K to assemble a ternary complex where E4-ORF1 hijacks the Dlg1 oncogenic function to relocate cytoplasmic PI3K to the membrane for constitutive activation. This novel mechanism of Dlg1 subversion by adenovirus to dysregulate PI3K could be used by other pathogenic viruses, such as human papillomavirus, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, and influenza A virus, which also target Dlg1 and activate PI3K in cells.",,"['Kong, Kathleen', 'Kumar, Manish', 'Taruishi, Midori', 'Javier, Ronald T']","['Kong K', 'Kumar M', 'Taruishi M', 'Javier RT']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140501,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Adenoviridae Infections/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Discs Large Homolog 1 Protein', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism/virology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/metabolism/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport']",,,2014/05/03 06:00,2015/06/16 06:00,['2014/05/03 06:00'],"['2013/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1004102 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-13-02424 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2014 May 1;10(5):e1004102. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1004102. eCollection 2014 May.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DLG1 protein, human)', '0 (Discs Large Homolog 1 Protein)', '0 (E4 protein, Adenovirus 9)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)']",,PMC4006922,['R01 CA058541/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both astroglial proliferation and antiapoptotic processes are aspects of astrogliosis. However, the underlying mechanism of this response remains poorly understood. In addition, little is known about why activated astrocytes are more resistant to stress and inflammation. CCAAT/enhancer binding protein delta (CEBPD) is a transcription factor found in activated astrocytes that surround beta-amyloid plaques. In this study, we found that astrocytes activation was attenuated in the cortex and hippocampus of APPswe/PS1 E9 (AppTg)/Cebpd (-/-)mice. Furthermore, an increase in apoptotic astrocytes was observed in AppTg/Cebpd (-/-)mice, suggesting that CEBPD plays a functional role in enhancing the antiapoptotic ability of astrocytes. We found that Zinc Finger Protein 179 (ZNF179) was a CEBPD-regulated gene that played an antiapoptotic, but not proliferative, role in astrocytes. The transcriptions of the proapoptotic genes, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) and BCL2-interacting killer (BIK), were suppressed by ZNF179 via its interaction with the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein in astrocytes.

Clinical presentations of the disease vary widely from indolent to aggressive forms, and to the exceedingly rare mast cell leukemia.

An imatinib-resistant activating mutation of the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT (KIT D816V) is most frequently present in transformed mast cells and is associated with all clinical forms of the disease. Thus the etiology of the variable clinical aggressiveness of abnormal mast cells in SM is unclear. TET2 appears to be mutated in primary human samples in aggressive types of SM, suggesting a possible role in disease modification. In this report, we demonstrate the cooperation between KIT D816V and loss of function of TET2 in mast cell transformation and demonstrate a more aggressive phenotype in a murine model of SM when both mutations are present in progenitor cells. We exploit these findings to validate a combination treatment strategy targeting the epigenetic deregulation caused by loss of TET2 and the constitutively active KIT receptor for the treatment of patients with aggressive SM.",,"['De Vita, Serena', 'Schneider, Rebekka K', 'Garcia, Michael', 'Wood, Jenna', 'Gavillet, Mathilde', 'Ebert, Benjamin L', 'Gerbaulet, Alexander', 'Roers, Axel', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Mullally, Ann', 'Williams, David A']","['De Vita S', 'Schneider RK', 'Garcia M', 'Wood J', 'Gavillet M', 'Ebert BL', 'Gerbaulet A', 'Roers A', 'Levine RL', 'Mullally A', 'Williams DA']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."", ""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."", ""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."", 'Institute for Immunology, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Immunology, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, and Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, United States of America.', ""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140502,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dasatinib', 'Decitabine', 'Dioxygenases', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Esophagus/metabolism/pathology', 'Gastric Mucosa/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mast Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'RNA Interference', 'Skin/metabolism/pathology', 'Stomach/pathology', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use']",,,2014/05/03 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2014/05/03 06:00'],"['2014/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0096209 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-02373 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 May 2;9(5):e96209. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0096209. eCollection 2014.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Tet2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,PMC4008566,"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK062757/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '5R01DK062757-11/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genome-wide analysis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-polarized THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cells via chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) resulted in 1,318 high-confidence VDR binding sites, of which 789 and 364 occurred uniquely with and without 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulation, while only 165 were common. We re-analyzed five public VDR ChIP-seq datasets with identical peak calling settings (MACS, version 2) and found, using a novel consensus summit identification strategy, in total 23,409 non-overlapping VDR binding sites, 75% of which are unique within the six analyzed cellular models. LPS-differentiated THP-1 cells have 22% more genomic VDR locations than undifferentiated cells and both cell types display more overlap in their VDR locations than the other investigated cell types. In general, the intersection of VDR binding profiles of ligand-stimulated cells is higher than those of unstimulated cells. De novo binding site searches and HOMER screening for binding motifs formed by direct repeats spaced by three nucleotides (DR3) suggest for all six VDR ChIP-seq datasets that these sequences are found preferentially at highly ligand responsive VDR loci. Importantly, all VDR ChIP-seq datasets display the same relationship between the VDR occupancy and the percentage of DR3-type sequences below the peak summits. The comparative analysis of six VDR ChIP-seq datasets demonstrated that the mechanistic basis for the action of the VDR is independent of the cell type. Only the minority of genome-wide VDR binding sites contains a DR3-type sequence. Moreover, the total number of identified VDR binding sites in each ligand-stimulated cell line inversely correlates with the percentage of peak summits with DR3 sites.",,"['Tuoresmaki, Pauli', 'Vaisanen, Sami', 'Neme, Antonio', 'Heikkinen, Sami', 'Carlberg, Carsten']","['Tuoresmaki P', 'Vaisanen S', 'Neme A', 'Heikkinen S', 'Carlberg C']","['Department of Biosciences, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Biosciences, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Biosciences, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Biosciences, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Biosciences, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140430,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2014/05/03 06:00,2015/01/23 06:00,['2014/05/03 06:00'],"['2014/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0096105 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-03540 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Apr 30;9(4):e96105. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0096105. eCollection 2014.,"['0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)']",,PMC4005760,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ofatumumab elicited higher CDC levels than RTX in all CLL samples examined, particularly in poor prognosis cohorts (11q- and 17p-). Serum sample analyses revealed that 38.1% of patients were deficient in one or more complement components, correlating with reduced CDC responses. Although a proportion of patients with deficient complement levels initially induced high levels of CDC, on secondary challenge CDC activity in sera was significantly reduced, compared with that in normal human serum (NHS; P<0.01; n=52). In addition, a high CLL cell number contributed to rapid complement exhaustion. Supplementing CLL serum with NHS or individual complement components, particularly C2, restored CDC on secondary challenge to NHS levels (P<0.0001; n=9). In vivo studies revealed that complement components were exhausted in CLL patient sera post RTX treatment, correlating with an inability to elicit CDC.

However, the impact of Pim-2 inhibition on bone disease in MM remains unknown. We demonstrated here that Pim-2 expression was also upregulated in bone marrow stromal cells and MC3T3-E1 preosteoblastic cells in the presence of cytokines known as the inhibitors of osteoblastogenesis in MM, including interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-7, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and activin A, as well as MM cell conditioned media. The enforced expression of Pim-2 abrogated in vitro osteoblastogenesis by BMP-2, which suggested Pim-2 as a negative regulator for osteoblastogenesis. Treatment with Pim-2 short-interference RNA as well as the Pim inhibitor SMI-16a successfully restored osteoblastogenesis suppressed by all the above inhibitory factors and MM cells. The SMI-16a treatment potentiated BMP-2-mediated anabolic signaling while suppressing TGF-beta signaling. Furthermore, treatment with the newly synthesized thiazolidine-2,4-dione congener, 12a-OH, as well as its prototypic SMI-16a effectively prevented bone destruction while suppressing MM tumor growth in MM animal models.

For these diseases, recently compiled clinical data confirms an elevated frequency of such breakpoints within a 4 kb tract between exon 11 and a region of structural instability adjacent to exon 12. Linked primarily to cases of tAL, interference with topoisomerase II activity may either contribute to the initial DNA lesion directly or indirectly by, for example, providing a physical block to transcription progression. Alternatively, sites of fragmentation may be mis-repaired, guided by intergenic spliced transcripts of the participating genes.

Two compounds (GNF-2 and BO1) have been found able to inhibit the Abl activity through a peculiar mechanism of action. Particularly, GNF-2 acts as allosteric inhibitor against Bcr-Abl wild type (wt), but it has no activity against the gatekeeper mutant T315I. Its activity against the last mutant reappears when used together with an ATP-competitive inhibitor such as Imatinib or Nilotinib. A crystal structure of GNF-2 bound to the Abl myristoyl pocket (MP) has been released. On the contrary, BO1 shows an ATP-competitive/mixed mechanism of action against the wt, while it acts as an allosteric inhibitor against T315I. In order to better understand the mechanism of Abl allosteric inhibition, MD simulations and MM/GBSA analysis were performed on Abl wt and T315I in complex with GNF-2 and BO1, and the results were compared to those found for the natural myristoyl ligand. Similarly to that observed for the myristoyl group, the binding of an allosteric inhibitor to the MP promotes the formation of a compact and inhibited conformation of the wt protein, characterized by the stabilization of the intramolecular interactions that occur between SH2-SH3 and kinase domains. Conversely, an overall higher flexibility was observed with the Abl T315I mutant, especially in the case of GNF-2. Our analysis highlighted differences in the dynamic behavior of GNF-2 and BO1 which could explain the different biological profiles of the two allosteric inhibitors against the T315I mutant.",,"['Fallacara, Anna Lucia', 'Tintori, Cristina', 'Radi, Marco', 'Schenone, Silvia', 'Botta, Maurizio']","['Fallacara AL', 'Tintori C', 'Radi M', 'Schenone S', 'Botta M']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie, Chimica e Farmacia, Universita degli Studi di Siena , Via Aldo Moro 2, 53100 Siena, Siena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140508,United States,J Chem Inf Model,Journal of chemical information and modeling,101230060,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Allosteric Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Stability/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'src Homology Domains']",,,2014/05/03 06:00,2015/01/22 06:00,['2014/05/03 06:00'],"['2014/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ci500060k [doi]'],ppublish,J Chem Inf Model. 2014 May 27;54(5):1325-38. doi: 10.1021/ci500060k.

Here we report noncysteine in-frame mutations in IL7R and CRLF2 located in a region of the TMD closer to the cytosolic domain. Biochemical and functional assays showed that these are activating mutations conferring cytokine-independent growth of progenitor lymphoid cells in vitro and are transforming in vivo. Protein fragment complementation assays suggest that despite the absence of cysteines, the mechanism of activation is through ligand-independent dimerization. Mutagenesis experiments and ConSurf calculations suggest that the mutations stabilize the homodimeric conformation, positioning the cytosolic kinases in predefined orientation to each other, thereby inducing spontaneous receptor activation independently of external signals.

CLL cells that expressed zeta-chain-associated protein of 70 kDa (ZAP-70) or that used unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) genes, each had a median expression level of miR-150 that was significantly lower than that of ZAP-70-negative CLL cells or those that used mutated IGHV genes. In samples stratified for expression of miR-150, CLL cells with low-level miR-150 expressed relatively higher levels of forkhead box P1 (FOXP1) and GRB2-associated binding protein 1 (GAB1), genes with 3' untranslated regions having evolutionary-conserved binding sites for miR-150. High-level expression of miR-150 could repress expression of these genes, which encode proteins that enhance B-cell receptor signaling, a putative CLL-growth/survival signal. Also, high-level expression of miR-150 was a significant independent predictor of longer treatment-free survival or overall survival, whereas an inverse association was observed for high-level expression of GAB1 or FOXP1 for overall survival. This study demonstrates that expression of miR-150 can influence the relative expression of GAB1 and FOXP1 and the signaling potential of the B-cell receptor, thereby possibly accounting for the noted association of expression of miR-150 and disease outcome.",['(c) 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Mraz, Marek', 'Chen, Liguang', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Ghia, Emanuela M', 'Li, Hongying', 'Jepsen, Kristen', 'Smith, Erin N', 'Messer, Karen', 'Frazer, Kelly A', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Mraz M', 'Chen L', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Ghia EM', 'Li H', 'Jepsen K', 'Smith EN', 'Messer K', 'Frazer KA', 'Kipps TJ']","['University of California-San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, La Jolla, CA; Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic; and Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'University of California-San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, La Jolla, CA;', 'University of California-San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, La Jolla, CA;', 'University of California-San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, La Jolla, CA;', 'University of California-San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, La Jolla, CA;', 'University of California-San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, La Jolla, CA;', 'University of California-San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, La Jolla, CA;', 'University of California-San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, La Jolla, CA;', 'University of California-San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, La Jolla, CA;', 'University of California-San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, La Jolla, CA;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140501,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Transfection']",,,2014/05/03 06:00,2014/08/29 06:00,['2014/05/03 06:00'],"['2014/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40027-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-09-527234 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Jul 3;124(1):84-95. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-09-527234.

Single-nucleotide polymorphism/comparative genomic hybridization, single-cell PCR and colony-forming assays were used to evaluate genotypic evolution of high FLT3/ITD-ARs in 85 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Microarrays were used to examine molecular pathways disrupted in leukemic blasts with high FLT3/ITD-ARs. Copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) was identified at the FLT3 locus in diagnostic samples with high FLT3/ITD-ARs (N=11), but not in samples with low FLT3/ITD-ARs (N=24), FLT3-activating loop mutations (N=11) or wild-type FLT3 (N=39). Single-cell assays showed that homozygous FLT3/ITD genotype was present in subsets of leukemic blasts at diagnosis but became the dominant clone at relapse. Less differentiated CD34(+)/CD33(-) progenitor colonies were heterozygous for FLT3/ITD, whereas more differentiated CD34(+)/CD33(+) progenitor colonies were homozygous for FLT3/ITD. Expression profiling revealed that samples harboring high FLT3/ITD-ARs aberrantly expressed genes within the recombination/DNA repair pathway. Thus, the development of CN-LOH at the FLT3 locus, which results in high FLT3/ITD-ARs, likely represents a late genomic event that occurs after the acquisition of the FLT3/ITD. Although the etiology underlying the development of CN-LOH remains to be clarified, the disruption in recombination/DNA repair pathway, which is present before the development of LOH, may have a role.",,"['Stirewalt, D L', 'Pogosova-Agadjanyan, E L', 'Tsuchiya, K', 'Joaquin, J', 'Meshinchi, S']","['Stirewalt DL', 'Pogosova-Agadjanyan EL', 'Tsuchiya K', 'Joaquin J', 'Meshinchi S']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', ""1] Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA [2] Department of Pathology, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA, USA [3] Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA, USA."", 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', ""1] Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA [2] Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA, USA [3] Children's Oncology Group, Arcadia, CA, USA [4] Department of Hematology-Oncology, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140502,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,IM,"['Alleles', 'Child', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/enzymology/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,,2014/05/03 06:00,2015/04/08 06:00,['2014/05/03 06:00'],"['2014/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201427 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2014.27 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2014 May 2;4:e208. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2014.27.,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,PMC4042297,"['R01 CA114563/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA160872/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA114563/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA160872/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This leads to an overwhelming body of exciting novel findings providing insight into (1) the genetic heterogeneity of the disease with marked genetic subsets, (2) the mechanisms by which aberrant T-cell development drive leukemogenesis and (3) emerging opportunities for novel therapeutic interventions. Of further interest, recent genome wide sequencing studies identified proteins that actively participate in the regulation of the T-cell epigenome as novel oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in T-ALL. The identification of these perturbed molecular epigenetic events in the pathogenesis of T-ALL will contribute to the further exploration of novel therapies in this cancer type. As some epigenetic therapies have recently been approved for a number of hematological neoplasms, one could speculate that targeted therapies against epigenetic regulators might offer good prospects for T-ALL treatment in the near future. In this review, we summarize the epigenetic discoveries made in T-ALL hitherto and discuss possible new venues for epigenetic therapeutic intervention in this aggressive subtype of human leukemia.

Recently, through transcriptome profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), we reported dose-dependent effects of benzene exposure on gene expression and biochemical pathways in 83 workers exposed across four airborne concentration ranges (from <1 ppm to >10 ppm) compared with 42 subjects with non-workplace ambient exposure levels. Here, we further characterize these dose-dependent effects with continuous benzene exposure in all 125 study subjects. We estimated air benzene exposure levels in the 42 environmentally-exposed subjects from their unmetabolized urinary benzene levels. We used a novel non-parametric, data-adaptive model selection method to estimate the change with dose in the expression of each gene. We describe non-parametric approaches to model pathway responses and used these to estimate the dose responses of the AML pathway and 4 other pathways of interest. The response patterns of majority of genes as captured by mean estimates of the first and second principal components of the dose-response for the five pathways and the profiles of 6 AML pathway response-representative genes (identified by clustering) exhibited similar apparent supra-linear responses. Responses at or below 0.1 ppm benzene were observed for altered expression of AML pathway genes and CYP2E1. Together, these data show that benzene alters disease-relevant pathways and genes in a dose-dependent manner, with effects apparent at doses as low as 100 ppb in air.

Previous studies with Fnip1-null mice revealed that Fnip1 is essential for pre-B-cell development. Here we report a critical role of Fnip1 in invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cell development. Thymic iNKT development in Fnip1(-/-) mice was arrested at stage 2 (NK1.1(-)CD44(+)) but development of CD4, CD8, gammadelta T-cell, and NK cell lineages proceeded normally. Enforced expression of a Valpha14Jalpha18 iNKT TCR transgene or loss of the proapoptotic protein Bim did not rescue iNKT cell maturation in Fnip1(-/-) mice. Whereas most known essential transcription factors for iNKT cell development were represented normally, Fnip1(-/-) iNKT cells failed to down-regulate Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger compared with their WT counterparts. Moreover, Fnip1(-/-) iNKT cells contained hyperactive mTOR and reduced mitochondrial number despite lower ATP levels, resulting in increased sensitivity to apoptosis.

However, the distinction can be difficult to make, particularly in tissue biopsy samples. Immunohistochemistry has been established as a useful technique to aid in the diagnosis of malignancies. The advantages of immunohistochemical studies are their ease of use and interpretation. This study is the first to evaluate the utility of the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein and the histone 1.5 (H1.5) protein as potential diagnostic immunohistochemical markers for distinguishing leiomyosarcoma from leiomyoma. METHODS: Tissue samples from 21 leiomyosarcomas and 26 leiomyomas were studied. The student t-test and the Fisher exact test were used to calculate the differences in staining between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found in the staining indices of anti-PLZF and anti-H1.5 when comparing benign and malignant tumors (P < .0001 and P < .0001, respectively). The mean H1.5 staining score in leiomyosarcomas was 158.3, compared to 28.3 in leiomyomas. The mean PLZF score in leiomyosarcomas was 1.5 in contrast to 71.5 in leiomyomas. For H1.5 at a score >/=60, the sensitivity and specificity were 90.5% and 84.6%, respectively. For PLZF, a score </=15 had a test sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 80.8%, respectively. This suggests that staining for H1.5 or PLZF can serve as a good screening test. Additionally, combining the 2 immunostains results in a sensitivity and specificity of 90.5% and 97.5%, respectively, in differentiating between leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma. CONCLUSIONS: We describe immunostaining for PLZF and H1.5 in benign and malignant uterine smooth muscle tumors. Statistically significant differences in staining patterns were found, suggesting utility in distinguishing leiomyosarcomas from leiomyomas.",['(c) The Author(s) 2014.'],"['Momeni, Mazdak', 'Kalir, Tamara', 'Farag, Sara', 'Kinoshita, Yayoi', 'Roman, Taisha Y', 'Chuang, Linus', 'Fishman, David A', 'Burstein, David E']","['Momeni M', 'Kalir T', 'Farag S', 'Kinoshita Y', 'Roman TY', 'Chuang L', 'Fishman DA', 'Burstein DE']","['Department of Obstetrics, Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Gynecology and Reproductive Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA mazdak_mom@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Gynecology and Reproductive Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Gynecology and Reproductive Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Gynecology and Reproductive Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140430,United States,Reprod Sci,"Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)",101291249,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Female', 'Histones/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*analysis', 'Leiomyoma/*pathology', 'Leiomyosarcoma/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Uterine Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Zinc Fingers/*physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['histone H1.5 protein', 'leiomyoma', 'leiomyosarcoma', 'promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein']",2014/05/03 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/05/03 06:00'],"['2014/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1933719114532845 [pii]', '10.1177/1933719114532845 [doi]']",ppublish,Reprod Sci. 2014 Sep;21(9):1171-6. doi: 10.1177/1933719114532845.

Recent advances in stem cell research that enable the use of a patient's own stem cells for transplantation are very important because rejection could be avoided. In particular, Yamanaka's group in Japan gave new hope to patients with incurable diseases when they developed induced murine pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in 2006 and human iPSCs in 2007. Whereas embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are derived from the inner cell mass and are supported in culture by LIF, iPSCs are derived from fetal or adult somatic cells. Through the application of iPSC technology, adult somatic cells can develop a pluripotent state. One advantage of using iPSCs instead of ESCs in regenerative medicine is that (theoretically) immune rejection could be avoided, although there is some debate about immune rejection of a patient's own iPSCs. Many diseases occur in elderly patients. In order to use regenerative medicine with the elderly, it is important to demonstrate that iPSCs can indeed be generated from older patients. Recent findings have shown that iPSCs can be established from aged mice and aged humans. These iPSCs can differentiate to cells from all three germ layers. However, it is not known whether iPSCs from aged mice or humans show early senescence. Before clinical use of iPSCs, issues related to copy number variation, tumorigenicity and immunogenicity must be resolved. It is particularly important that researchers have succeeded in generating iPSCs that have differentiated to somatic cells related to specific diseases of the elderly, including atherosclerosis, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. These efforts will facilitate the use of personalized stem cell transplantation therapy for currently incurable diseases.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, we used a quasi-experimental sibling design to investigate the odds ratios among sibling pairs who were discordant with AUDs. RESULTS: A total of 420,489 individuals were identified with AUDs. After more than 15 million person-years of follow-up, a total of 1755 individuals developed hematological malignancies demonstrating a low risk, i.e., SIR = 0.60 (95% confidence interval = 0.57-0.63). People with AUDs had low risks for developing specific types of malignancies. The lowest risk (0.51) was for leukemia, followed by myeloma (0.52), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (0.65), and Hodgkin disease (0.71). The risk was lower among AUDs identified at an older age. The low risks of hematological malignancies were also noted using sibling analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that alcohol consumption has a protective effect against hematological malignancies. However, further studies are needed to identity the underlying mechanisms of the protective effect of alcohol consumption against hematological malignancies.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Neoplasia Press Inc.

The exact mechanism of this action is not known. Different data indicate high concentrations of histamine in tumor tissues, such as malignant melanoma, breast cancer, colon carcinoma, lymphomas and leukemia. To the best of our knowledge, the literature offers no reports about the role of histamine and of differences between expression patterns of histamine-related genes in endometrial cancer AIM: The aim of the study was a comparative analysis of the gene expression profile involved with histaminergic system in endometrioid endometrial cancer in relation to histologically normal endometrium, and identification of differentiation genes whose transcriptional activity significantly differs in pathomorphological grades G1,G2, G3 of endometrial cancer as compared to the control group. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Total RNA was extracted from 24 endometrial probes using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The expression profile of 119 transcripts associated with histaminergic system was assessed using oligonucleotide microarrays of HG-U 133A (Affymetrix). After normalization of the results with RMA Express software, differentiation genes were mined by the use of one-way analysis ANOVA and U Mann-Whitney test carried out in Gene Spring 11.5 software. RESULTS: Among 119 transcripts, 14 expressed more than 1.5-fold change and were significant at p<0.05 in endometrioid endometrial cancer in relation to the normal endometrium. Further analysis led to the identification of differentially expressed genes in grades G1, G2 and G3 of endometrial adenocarcinoma as compared to the control group, which were specific for each of the studied groups in grade G1 (CPA3), in grade G2 (HNMT LYN, DPT ITPKB, RASA4, APR RAB1 1FIP1, YWHAZ, VAMP8, RAB25) and in grade G3 (HRH3). CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed the role of the histaminergic system in the pathogenesis of endometrial adenocarcinoma. The observed differences in the expression of those genes, depending on the grade of adenocarcinoma, may indicate an important role of the isolated differentiation genes in endometrial tumorigenesis.",,"['Jeda, Agnieszka', 'Witek, Andrzej', 'Janikowska, Grazyna', 'Cwynar, Grzegorz', 'Janikowski, Tomasz', 'Cialon, Malgorzata', 'Orchel, Joanna', 'Mazurek, Urszula']","['Jeda A', 'Witek A', 'Janikowska G', 'Cwynar G', 'Janikowski T', 'Cialon M', 'Orchel J', 'Mazurek U']",,['pol'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Poland,Ginekol Pol,Ginekologia polska,0374641,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Endometrial Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Endometrium/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Genes, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Histamine/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis']",,,2014/05/03 06:00,2014/05/23 06:00,['2014/05/03 06:00'],"['2014/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.17772/gp/1709 [doi]'],ppublish,Ginekol Pol. 2014 Mar;85(3):172-9. doi: 10.17772/gp/1709.,['820484N8I3 (Histamine)'],Profil ekspresji genow zwiazanych z ukladem histaminergicznym wyznaczony technika mikromacierzy oligonukleotydowych HG-U133A u kobiet z gruczolakorakiem endometrium.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because GWAS identify genetic markers that may be indirectly associated with disease, fine-mapping based on sequence analysis provides important insights into patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and is critical in defining the optimal variants to nominate for biological follow-up. METHODS: To catalog variation in individuals of African ancestry, we resequenced a region (250 kb; chr8:128,050, 768-128, 300,801, hg19) containing several prostate cancer susceptibility loci as well as a locus associated with CLL. Our samples included 78 individuals from Ghana and 47 of African-Americans from Johns Hopkins University. RESULTS: After quality control metrics were applied to next-generation sequence data, 1,838 SNPs were identified. Of these, 285 were novel and not yet reported in any public database. Using genotypes derived from sequencing, we refined the LD and recombination hotspots within the region and determined a set of tag SNPs to be used in future fine-mapping studies. Based on LD, we annotated putative risk loci and their surrogates using ENCODE data, which should help guide laboratory studies. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to the 1000 Genome Project data, we have identified additional variants that could be important in establishing priorities for future functional work designed to explain the biological basis of associations between SNPs and both prostate cancer and CLL.",,"['Chung, Charles C', 'Hsing, Ann W', 'Edward Yeboah', 'Biritwum, Richard', 'Tettey, Yao', 'Adjei, Andrew', 'Cook, Michael B', 'De Marzo, Angelo', 'Netto, George', 'Tay, Evelyn', 'Boland, Joseph F', 'Yeager, Meredith', 'Chanock, Stephen J']","['Chung CC', 'Hsing AW', 'Edward Yeboah', 'Biritwum R', 'Tettey Y', 'Adjei A', 'Cook MB', 'De Marzo A', 'Netto G', 'Tay E', 'Boland JF', 'Yeager M', 'Chanock SJ']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Prostate,The Prostate,8101368,IM,"['Blacks/*genetics', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Loci', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics']",,,2014/05/02 06:00,2014/06/10 06:00,['2014/05/01 06:00'],"['2014/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pros.22726 [doi]'],ppublish,Prostate. 2014 May;74(6):579-89. doi: 10.1002/pros.22726.,,,PMC4199861,"['Z01 CP010178-06/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA CP010201-01/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",,['NIHMS623614'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A potential role of exosomes in predicting responses to chemotherapy (CT) was evaluated in AML patients undergoing treatment. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Plasma was obtained from AML patients at diagnosis (n = 16); post-induction CT (n = 9); during consolidation CT (n = 10); in long-term remission (Lt-CR, n = 5); and from healthy volunteers (n = 7). Exosomes were isolated by size-exclusion chromatography and ultracentrifugation. The exosomal protein, soluble TGFbeta-1 levels (ELISA), and the TGF-beta1 profiles (western blots) were compared among patients' cohorts. The results were correlated with the patients' cytogenetic profile, percentage of leukemic blast, and outcome. RESULTS: At diagnosis, protein and TGF-beta1 levels were higher (p < 0.009 and p < 0.004) in AML than control exosomes. These values decreased after induction CT (p < 0.05 and p < 0.004), increased during consolidation CT (p < 0.02 and p < 0.005), and normalized in Lt-CR. While TGF-beta1 and protein levels tracked one another, TGF-beta1 pro-peptide, latency-associated peptide (LAP), or mature TGF-beta1 differentially decorated exosomes isolated before, during, and after CT. Only TGF-beta1 pro-peptide was seen in exosomes of controls or Lt-CR patients. During consolidation CT, exosomes carried TGF-beta1 pro-peptide, LAP, and low levels of mature TGF-beta1. NK cell co-incubation with AML exosomes carrying all three TGF-beta1 forms induced down-regulation of NKG2D expression. CONCLUSION: Changes in exosomal protein and/or TGF-beta1 content may reflect responses to CT. The exosomal profile may suggest the presence of residual disease in patients considered to have achieved complete remission.",,"['Hong, Chang-Sook', 'Muller, Laurent', 'Whiteside, Theresa L', 'Boyiadzis, Michael']","['Hong CS', 'Muller L', 'Whiteside TL', 'Boyiadzis M']","['Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh, PA , USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh, PA , USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh, PA , USA ; Department of Immunology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh, PA , USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh, PA , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140410,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,['NOTNLM'],"['TGF-beta1', 'acute myelogenous leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'exosomes', 'protein levels']",2014/05/02 06:00,2014/05/02 06:01,['2014/05/01 06:00'],"['2013/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2014.00160 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2014 Apr 10;5:160. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2014.00160. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC3989594,"['P01 CA109688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA168628/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000005/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the PML-RARalpha fusion gene can be detected in >98% of APL cases, RARalpha is also found to be fused with other partner genes, which are also related to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-dependent transcriptional activity and cell differentiation. In this study, we identified a novel RARalpha fusion gene, TBLR1-RARalpha (GenBank KF589333), in a rare case of APL with a t(3;17)(q26;q21),t(7;17)(q11.2;q21) complex chromosomal rearrangement. To our knowledge, TBLR1-RARalpha is the 10th RARalpha chimeric gene that has been reported up to now. TBLR1-RARalpha contained the B-F domains of RARalpha and exhibited a distinct subcellular localization. It could form homodimers and also heterodimers with retinoid X receptor alpha. As a result, TBLR1-RARalpha exhibited diminished transcriptional activity by recruitment of more transcriptional corepressors compared with RARalpha. In the presence of pharmacologic doses of ATRA, TBLR1-RARalpha could be degraded, and its homodimerization was abrogated. Moreover, when treated with ATRA, TBLR1-RARalpha could mediate the dissociation and degradation of transcriptional corepressors, consequent transactivation of RARalpha target genes, and cell differentiation induction in a dose- and time-dependent manner.",['(c) 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Chen, Yirui', 'Li, Shouyun', 'Zhou, Chunlin', 'Li, Chengwen', 'Ru, Kun', 'Rao, Qing', 'Xing, Haiyan', 'Tian, Zheng', 'Tang, Kejing', 'Mi, Yingchang', 'Wang, Baohong', 'Wang, Min', 'Wang, Jianxiang']","['Chen Y', 'Li S', 'Zhou C', 'Li C', 'Ru K', 'Rao Q', 'Xing H', 'Tian Z', 'Tang K', 'Mi Y', 'Wang B', 'Wang M', 'Wang J']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, and.', 'Department of Hematopathology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China; and.', 'Department of Hematopathology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China; and.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, and.', ""Department of Clinical Hematology, Weifang People's Hospital, Shandong, China."", 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Clinical Hematology, and.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140429,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Trans-Activators/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,,2014/05/02 06:00,2015/04/30 06:00,['2014/05/01 06:00'],"['2014/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39880-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-10-528596 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Aug 7;124(6):936-45. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-10-528596.

Twenty-three patients (3.9%) had mutations, 19 in MYD88 (one with concurrent IRAK1 mutation), 2 TLR2 (one with concomitant TLR6 mutation), 1 IRAK1, and 1 TLR5. No mutations were found in IRAK2 and IRAK4. TLR/MYD88-mutated CLL overexpressed genes of the nuclear factor kappaB pathway. Patients with TLR/MYD88 mutations were significantly younger (83% age </=50 years) than those with no mutations. TLR/MYD88 mutations were the most frequent in young patients. Patients with mutated TLR/MYD88 CLL had a higher frequency of mutated IGHV and low expression of CD38 and ZAP-70.

Recently, a three-tiered cytogenetic risk stratification system for CMML patients has been proposed by a Spanish study group. Here we assessed the prognostic impact of cytogenetic abnormalities on overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) in 417 CMML patients from our institution. Overall, the Spanish cytogenetic risk effectively stratified patients into different risk groups, with a median OS of 33 months in the low-, 24 months in intermediate- and 14 months in the high-risk groups. Within the proposed high risk group, however, marked differences in OS were observed. Patients with isolated trisomy 8 showed a median OS of 22 months, similar to the intermediate-risk group (P = 0.132), but significantly better than other patients in the high-risk group (P = 0.018). Furthermore, patients with more than three chromosomal abnormalities showed a significantly shorter OS compared with patients with three abnormalities (8 vs. 15 months, P = 0.004), suggesting possible a separate risk category. If we simply moved trisomy 8 to the intermediate risk category, the modified cytogenetic grouping would provide a better separation of OS and LFS; and its prognostic impact was independent of other risk parameters. Our study results strongly advocate for the incorporation of cytogenetic information in the risk model for CMML.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Tang, Guilin', 'Zhang, Liping', 'Fu, Bin', 'Hu, Jianhua', 'Lu, Xinyan', 'Hu, Shimin', 'Patel, Ankita', 'Goswami, Maitrayee', 'Khoury, Joseph D', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Wang, Sa A']","['Tang G', 'Zhang L', 'Fu B', 'Hu J', 'Lu X', 'Hu S', 'Patel A', 'Goswami M', 'Khoury JD', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Wang SA']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140516,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/classification/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment/classification', 'Survival Analysis', '*Trisomy']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)', 'Cytogenetics risk classification', 'Overall survival', 'complex karyotype', 'trisomy 8']",2014/05/02 06:00,2014/09/05 06:00,['2014/05/01 06:00'],"['2014/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23751 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2014 Aug;89(8):813-8. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23751.

Thus, we conducted whole-genome sequencing on a patient with a germline GATA-2 heterozygous mutation (c. 988 C > T; p.

Analysis was conducted with DNA samples from leukocytes for immunodeficiency, bone marrow mononuclear cells for MDS and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Whereas we did not identify a candidate genomic deletion that may contribute to the evolution into MDS, a total of 280 MDS-specific nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants were identified.

The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the prevalence of CD11b and of CD56 expression in blast cells of 158 AML patients [excluding those with t(15;17)] stratified according to their cytogenetic risk and to correlate these phenotypic characteristics with OS, DFS, and CR. CD11b was more frequently expressed in intermediate and unfavorable cytogenetic prognostic groups (38.9 and 35.5 %, respectively) than in the favorable group (9.5 %). No differences were observed in CD56 expression according to the cytogenetic risk groups. When OS, DFS, and CR were analyzed according to these two markers, no statistical differences were recorded in any cytogenetic risk group.

The objective was to increase awareness of food safety issues among caregivers for pediatric cancer patients in Guatemala and El Salvador. A low-literacy booklet about food safety, ""Alimentacion del nino con cancer (Feeding the child with cancer),"" was developed for caregivers. Tests were developed to assess information acquisition and retention. An educator's guide was developed for consistency of education along with a demographics questionnaire. The efficacy of the booklet was tested with 162 caregivers of patients with newly diagnosed leukemia. Information retention was tested 1 and 3 months after the initial education. The booklet was found to be efficient for food safety education. There was no significant difference between post-educational knowledge in either country at 1 month or in Guatemala at 3 months. Pre-educational knowledge was not associated with any demographic variable except for self-reported ability to read in El Salvador. There was no significant association between learning ability and demographic variables in either country. Caregivers from El Salvador had a better ability to learn than caregivers from Guatemala.

Its misregulation has been associated with many diseases, making its early and reliable detection a key point for modern cellular biology. In this paper, we propose the use of infrared microspectroscopy (IRMS) as a label-free methodology for the detection of apoptotic-related biochemical processes induced on U937 leukemic monocytes by serum starvation and CCCP-exposure. The spectroscopic results are in agreement with parallel Flow Cytometry (FC) experiments, where plasma membrane integrity and mitochondrial activity were assessed. Spectroscopic outcomes complement FC data and allow drawing a more complete picture of the apoptotic pathways. In particular, we established that the two apoptosis-inducing treatments, cell starvation and CCCP exposure, affect the cell cycle in a different way. With the former, cell death is preceded by a cell cycle arrest, whereas the latter causes an increased cell cycle progression. Spectral data demonstrate that for both conditions apoptosis proceeds through the accumulation of lipid droplets within cells. Moreover, we were able to establish a spectral marker for DNA condensation/fragmentation: the enhancement of the PhI band component centred at ~1206 cm(-1), which is more sensitive than the relative intensity of the PhII band to which phospholipids and carbohydrates also contribute significantly. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the intrinsic multi-parametric nature of IRMS and its application on cells under physiological conditions can be well exploited for the investigation of apoptotic pathways.",,"['Birarda, Giovanni', 'Bedolla, Diana E', 'Mitri, Elisa', 'Pacor, Sabrina', 'Grenci, Gianluca', 'Vaccari, Lisa']","['Birarda G', 'Bedolla DE', 'Mitri E', 'Pacor S', 'Grenci G', 'Vaccari L']","['Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste, SISSI Beamline, S.S. 14 Km 163.5, 34149 Basovizza, Trieste, Italy. lisa.vaccari@elettra.eu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140430,England,Analyst,The Analyst,0372652,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Monocytes/*pathology', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared/*methods', 'U937 Cells']",,,2014/05/02 06:00,2015/08/05 06:00,['2014/05/01 06:00'],"['2014/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c4an00317a [doi]'],ppublish,Analyst. 2014 Jun 21;139(12):3097-106. doi: 10.1039/c4an00317a.

After the intrathecal therapy being administered to the patient, the pharmacist who checked the medication realized that the wrong formulation of Cytarabine was used to prepare the intrathecal therapy; this error resulted in five times overdose of Cytarabine. The patient was then managed conservatively without cerebrospinal fluid exchange.

Here, we report that the gamma-secretase inhibitor PF-03084014 inhibits the constitutive Notch activation and induces selective apoptosis in CLL cells carrying NOTCH1 mutations. Combination of PF-03084014 with fludarabine has a synergistic antileukemic effect in primary NOTCH1-mutated CLL cells, even in the presence of the protective stroma. At transcriptional level, PF-03084014 plus fludarabine treatment induces the upregulation of the proapoptotic gene HRK and the downmodulation of MMP9, IL32 and RAC2 genes that are related to invasion and chemotaxis. PF-03084014 also overcomes fludarabine-mediated activation of nuclear factor-kappaB signaling. Moreover, this combination impairs angiogenesis and CXCL12-induced responses in NOTCH1-mutated CLL cells, in particular those related to tumoral migration and invasion. Importantly, all these collaborative effects are specific for NOTCH1 mutation and do not occur in unmutated cases.

In six successive clinical trials between 1984 and 2007, 1291 (84.5%) patients completed all therapies in continuous complete remission. The post-therapy cumulative risk of relapse or development of a second neoplasm and the event-free survival rate and overall survival were analyzed according to the presenting features and the three treatment periods defined by relative outcome. Over the three treatment periods, there has been progressive increase in the rate of event-free survival (65.2% vs 74.8% vs 85.1% (P<0.001)) and overall survival (76.5% vs 81.1% vs 91.7% (P<0.001)) at 10 years. The most important predictor of outcome after completion of therapy was the type of treatment. In the most recent treatment period, which omitted the use of prophylactic cranial irradiation, the post-treatment cumulative risk of relapse was 6.4%, death in remission 1.5% and development of a second neoplasm 2.3% at 10 years, with all relapses except one occurring within 4 years of therapy. None of the 106 patients with the t(9;22)/BCR-ABL1, t(1;19)/TCF3-PBX1 or t(4;11)/MLL-AFF1 had relapsed after 2 years from completion of therapy.

The same mechanism operates in eliminating malignant cells (the graft-versus-tumor or GvT effect). We hypothesized that comparing the correlation between GvHD and relapse might provide a surrogate marker for the susceptibility of diseases to allo-immune effects. We studied 48 111 first allogeneic transplants performed between 1998 and 2007. In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the relapse risk declined clearly and proportionally to severity of acute and chronic GvHD. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia and BCR-ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasias were comparably sensitive to GvHD as CML, whereas myelodysplastic syndromes and lymphoproliferative disorders showed intermediate sensitivity. GvHD was only associated with modest reductions in relapse risk in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and plasma cell disorders (PCDs). Except for PCD, hazard rates for relapse decreased to almost 0 at 48 months of follow-up in all diseases. These data confirm observations of potent GvT effects associated with GvHD. The strength of the GvHD/GvT correlation differs significantly between hematological malignancies. The parallel drop of relapse rates in different diseases despite differences in GvHD/GvT ratios suggests that GvT effects might operate in the absence of GvHD, particularly in AML.",,"['Stern, M', 'de Wreede, L C', 'Brand, R', 'van Biezen, A', 'Dreger, P', 'Mohty, M', 'de Witte, T M', 'Kroger, N', 'Ruutu, T']","['Stern M', 'de Wreede LC', 'Brand R', 'van Biezen A', 'Dreger P', 'Mohty M', 'de Witte TM', 'Kroger N', 'Ruutu T']","['Immunotherapy Laboratory, Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Medical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'EBMT Data Office, University Medical Centre Leiden, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Medizinische Klinik V, Universitat Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU Nantes, Nantes, France.', 'Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140430,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology/*mortality/prevention & control', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*mortality/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/05/02 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/05/01 06:00'],"['2014/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/25 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014145 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.145 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Nov;28(11):2235-40. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.145.

Fifty percent of PRPF8 mutant and del(17p) cases were found in AML and conveyed poor prognosis. PRPF8 defects correlated with increased myeloblasts and ring sideroblasts in cases without SF3B1 mutations. Knockdown of PRPF8 in K562 and CD34+ primary bone marrow cells increased proliferative capacity. Whole-RNA deep sequencing of primary cells from patients with PRPF8 abnormalities demonstrated consistent missplicing defects. In yeast models, homologous mutations introduced into Prp8 abrogated a block experimentally produced in the second step of the RNA splicing process, suggesting that the mutants have defects in proof-reading functions.

Our aim is to analyze serum vancomycin concentrations measured 48 hours after the start of an empirical treatment regimen in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who received one of the two generic vancomycin products available in France. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-nine AML patients treated with vancomycin during two study periods were included in the study. Our vancomycin dosing regimen was based on the patients' total body weight adjusted for renal clearance. RESULTS: A total of 93 serum vancomycin concentrations were collected: 31 in period 1 and 62 in period 2. In bivariate analysis, the mean serum vancomycin concentrations were not significantly different (19.9 +/- 11.2 mg/L in period 1 vs 18.9 +/- 6.0 mg/L in period 2, P=0.64). In the final generalized estimating equations model, serum vancomycin concentrations correlated statistically with a positive coefficient for age (P<0.001) and with negative coefficients for male sex (P=0.001) and hemoglobin level (P=0.021). CONCLUSION: Serum vancomycin concentrations measured 48 hours after the start of an empirical treatment were not influenced by the nature of the generic product but correlated with age, sex and hemoglobin level in AML patients.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In rare circumstances AML may present in the form of extra-medullary disease. Gallbladder infiltration with myeloblasts is rare and only a few cases exist in the literature describing this entity. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We present a rare case of AML relapse in the form of extramedullary infiltration of the gallbladder in a 50-year-old male patient. The leukemic infiltration presented as symptomatic cholecystitis and sepsis. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed and the gallbladder was pathologically examined. Histopathologic examination demonstrated multiple scattered, highly atypical single cells admixed with some plasma cells, small lymphocytes and macrophages consistent with leukemic infiltration. The abnormal cells demonstrated immunohistochemical staining for CD68, CD33 and CD117. The patient did well post-operatively but the relapse precluded him from bone marrow transplantation. DISCUSSION: Although AML is relatively common, 3 cases per 100,000 population, extramedullary disease in the form of gallbladder infiltration is exceedingly rare. An extensive review of the literature revealed only four cases of myeloid infiltration of the gallbladder. To our knowledge this is the only case of relapsing disease in the form of gallbladder infiltration presenting as symptomatic cholecystitis in a pre-bone marrow transplantation patient. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion of atypical manifestations of AML when managing refractory sepsis. Extramedullary manifestations of AML in the form of gallbladder infiltration must be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with a history of myeloid malignancies and for patients whom fail conventional non-operative management.",['Copyright (c) 2014 The Authors.

To provide clinical information lacking in the CCR, we obtained data from five leukaemia referral centres during a similar time period. Between 1993 and 2007, there were 399 APL in Canada. Age-standardized incidence was 0.083/100,000 and was stable over time.

ABT-263 is a newly synthesized, orally available Bcl-2/xL inhibitor that shows promising efficacy in HCC therapy. ABT-263 inhibits the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, but not Mcl-1. Previous reports have shown that ABT-263 upregulates Mcl-1 in various cancer cells, which contributes to ABT-263 resistance in cancer therapy. However, the associated mechanisms are not well known. METHODS: Western blot, RNAi and CCK-8 assays were used to investigate the relationship between Mcl-1 upregulation and ABT-263 sensitivity in HCC cells. Real-time PCR and Western blot were used to detect Mcl-1 mRNA and protein levels. Luciferase reporter assay and RNA synthesis inhibition assay were adopted to analyze the mechanism of Mcl-1 mRNA upregulation. Western blot and the inhibition assays for protein synthesis and proteasome were used to explore the mechanisms of ABT-263-enhanced Mcl-1 protein stability. Trypan blue exclusion assay and flow cytometry were used to examine cell death and apoptosis. RESULTS: ABT-263 upregulated Mcl-1 mRNA and protein levels in HCC cells, which contributes to ABT-263 resistance. ABT-263 increased the mRNA level of Mcl-1 in HCC cells by enhancing the mRNA stability without influencing its transcription. Furthermore, ABT-263 increased the protein stability of Mcl-1 through promoting ERK- and JNK-induced phosphorylation of Mcl-1Thr163 and increasing the Akt-mediated inactivation of GSK-3beta. Additionally, the inhibitors of ERK, JNK or Akt sensitized ABT-263-induced apoptosis in HCC cells. CONCLUSIONS: ABT-263 increases Mcl-1 stability at both mRNA and protein levels in HCC cells. Inhibition of ERK, JNK or Akt activity sensitizes ABT-263-induced apoptosis.

Chromosome aberrations have a major role in pediatric ALL risk assessment. The aim of this work is to detect the frequency of trisomy 4 and 10 in Egyptian pediatric ALL patients and to analyze their possible prognostic significance. METHODS: Forty newly diagnosed pediatric ALL patients were subjected to bone marrow aspirate morphological examination and immunophenotyping. Detection of copy number of chromosome 4 and 10 was done using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) technique using whole chromosome painting probes. RESULTS: Combined trisomy 4 and 10 was detected in 7 cases (17.5%), all of them were of B-ALL type. Single trisomy 4 or 10 was not detected in any case. Trisomy positive patients had a statistically significant lower total leucocytic count (p = 0.041), higher platelet count (p = 0.018), and lower blast percentage in peripheral blood (p = 0.016) at diagnosis.

However, it remains to be determined whether BCR-ABL1 gene rearrangement occurs in a HPC or at an earlier stem cell and whether the degree of involvement of hematopoiesis by the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene relates to the response to therapy. Here, we have investigated by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH) the distribution of BCR-ABL1 fusion gene in FACS-sorted bone marrow (BM) populations of mesenchymal precursor cells (MPC) and other hematopoietic cell populations from 18 newly diagnosed CML patients. Overall, our results showed systematic involvement at relatively high percentages of BM maturing neutrophils (97%615%), basophils (95%612%), eosinophils (90%68%), CD341 precursors cells (90%67%),monocytes (84%630%), nucleated red blood cells (87%624%), and mast cells (77%633%). By contrast, MPC(30%634%), B-cells (15%627%), T-lymphocytes (50%626%), and NK-cells (35%634%) were involved at lower percentages. In 8/18 CML patients, 2 tumor BCR-ABL11 subclones were detected by iFISH. Of note, all tumor cell subclones were systematically detected in CD341 cells, whereas MPC were only involved by the ancestral tumor cell subclone. In summary, here we confirm the presence at diagnosis of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene inMPC, CD341 precursors, and other different BM hematopoietic myeloid cell lineages from CML patients,including also in a significant fraction of cases, a smaller percentage of T, B, and NK lymphocytes.Interestingly, involvement of MPC was restricted to the ancestral BCR-ABL11 subclone.",,"['Chandia, Mauricio', 'Sayagues, Jose-Maria', 'Gutierrez, Maria-Laura', 'Chillon, Maria-Laura', 'Aristizabal, Jose-Alejandro', 'Corrales, Alejandro', 'Castellanos, Marta', 'Melon, Alberto', 'Sanchez, Maria-Luz', 'Barcena, Paloma', 'Matarraz, Sergio', 'Gonzalez-Gonzalez, Maria', 'Barrena, Susana', 'Lopez, Antonio', 'Canizo, Maria-Consuelo', 'Sanchez-Guijo, Fermin', 'Orfao, Alberto']","['Chandia M', 'Sayagues JM', 'Gutierrez ML', 'Chillon ML', 'Aristizabal JA', 'Corrales A', 'Castellanos M', 'Melon A', 'Sanchez ML', 'Barcena P', 'Matarraz S', 'Gonzalez-Gonzalez M', 'Barrena S', 'Lopez A', 'Canizo MC', 'Sanchez-Guijo F', 'Orfao A']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,,2014/04/30 06:00,2014/06/05 06:00,['2014/04/30 06:00'],"['2014/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23626 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2014 Mar;89(3):288-94. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23626.,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is found in approximately 3-12% of normal persons depending on the accuracy of analytical techniques applied. According to the immunophenotypic profile of clonal B-cells, the majority of MBL cases (75%) are classified as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)-like. This form may progress into CLL at a rate of 1-2% per year. It is thought that CLL is always preceded by MBL. The remaining MBL cases are defined as atypical CLL-like (CD5+/CD20(bright)) and CD5(-) MBL. The MBL clone size is quite heterogenous. Accordingly, two forms of MBL are identified: i) high-count, or 'clinical' MBL, in which an evidence of lymphocytosis (<5 x 10(9)/L clonal B-cells) is seen, and ii) a low-count MBL, in which a normal leukocyte count is found and that is identified only in population-screening studies. Both forms of MBL may carry the cytogenetic abnormalities that are the hallmark of CLL, including 13q-, 17p- and trisomy 12. Consistent with the indolent phenotype of this condition, genetic lesions, such as TP53, ATM, NOTCH1 and SF3B1 mutations, usually associated with high-risk CLL, are rarely seen.

Most patients are diagnosed in their late 60s to early 70s. MDS is a risk factor for the development of acute myeloid leukemia which can occur in 10-15% of patients with MDS. A variety of pathophysiologic mechanisms contributes to the genesis and persistence of MDS including immunologic, epigenetic, cytogenetic and genetic factors. The only potential curative option for MDS is hematopoietic cell transplantation which is suitable for only a few patients. Currently approved therapeutic options for MDS, including lenalidomide, decitabine, and 5-azacytidine, are targeted to improve transfusion requirements and quality of life. Moreover, 5-azacytidine has also been demonstrated to improve survival in some patients with higher risk MDS. New ways to predict which patients will better gain benefit from currently available therapeutic agents are the primary challenges in MDS. In the last 10 years, chromosome scanning and high throughput technologies (single nucleotide polymorphism array genotyping, comparative genomic hybridization, and whole genome/ exome sequencing) have tremendously increased our knowledge of MDS pathogenesis. Indeed, the molecular heterogeneity of MDS supports the idea of different therapeutic approaches which will take into account the diverse morphologic and clinical presentations of MDS patients rather than a restricted therapeutic strategy.

Most cases are represented by clonal expansions of TCRalpha/beta+ LGL displaying a CD8+ phenotype with expression of cytotoxic T-cell antigens (CD57, CD16, TIA-1, perforin and granzyme B). Proliferations of CD3-CD16+ NK cells with a restricted patter of NK receptors are less common, usually comprising 15% of the cases. Main features are cytopenias, splenomegaly and autoimmune phenomena. Morphology, immunophenotyping and molecular analyses are crucial to establish a correct diagnosis of disease. According to the 2008 WHO classification, two separate entities account for the majority of cases, T-LGL leukemia and Chronic Lymphoproliferative Disease of NK cell (this latter still provisional). Although these disorders are characterized by the expansion of different cells types i.e. T and NK cells, with specific genetic features and abnormalities, compelling evidence supports the hypothesis that a common pathogenic mechanism would be involved in both disorders. As a matter of fact, a foreign antigen driven clonal selection is considered the initial step in the mechanism ultimately leading to generation of both conditions.

METHODS: The medical records of 12 FA patients diagnosed at Chonnam National University Hospital from 1991 to 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 6.2 years. All patients showed evidence of marrow failure and one or more physical stigmata. Chromosome breakage tests were positive in 9 out of 11 available patients. The median follow-up duration was 69.5 months. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival of all patients was 83.3% at 10 years and 34.7% at 20 years, respectively. Seven patients underwent 9 stem cell transplantations (SCTs). Among them, 5 were alive by the end of the study. Ten-year KM survival after SCT was 71.4% with a median follow-up of 3.4 years. All 5 patients treated with supportive treatment alone died of infection or progression at the median age of 13.5 years, except for one with short follow-up duration. Acute leukemia developed in 2 patients at 15.4 and 18.1 years of age. Among 6 patients who are still alive, 3 had short stature and 1 developed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

Similar results were obtained when T-ALL cells were cultured with ERK1/2-knockdown stromal cells or with conditioned medium from MEKi-treated stromal cells. Microarray analysis identified interleukin 18 (IL-18) as transcriptionally up-regulated in MEKi-treated MS5 cells. Recombinant IL-18 promoted T-ALL growth in vitro, whereas the loss of function of IL-18 receptor in T-ALL blast cells decreased blast proliferation in vitro and in NSG mice. The NFKB pathway that is downstream to IL-18R was activated by IL-18 in blast cells.

We demonstrated previously that gossypol failed to directly inhibit BCL2 in cells or induce apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells or platelets, which require BCL2 or BCLXL, respectively, for survival. Here, we demonstrate that gossypol rapidly increased activity of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which led to an increase in cytoplasmic calcium, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and up-regulation of the BH3-only protein NOXA. Pretreatment with the PLA2 inhibitor, aristolochic acid, abrogated the increase in calcium, ER stress, and NOXA. Calcium chelation also abrogated the gossypol-induced increase in calcium, ER stress, and NOXA, but not the increase in PLA2 activity, indicating that PLA2 is upstream of these events. In addition, incubating cells with the two products of PLA2 (lysophosphatidic acid and arachidonic acid) mimicked treatment with gossypol. NOXA is a pro-apoptotic protein that functions by binding the BCL2 family proteins MCL1 and BFL1. The BCL2 inhibitor ABT-199 is currently in clinical trials for CLL. Resistance to ABT-199 can occur from up-regulation of other BCL2 family proteins, and this resistance can be mimicked by culturing CLL cells on CD154(+) stroma cells. We report here that AT-101, a derivative of gossypol in clinical trials, overcomes stroma-mediated resistance to ABT-199 in primary CLL cells, suggesting that a combination of these drugs may be efficacious in the clinic.","['(c) 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Soderquist, Ryan S', 'Danilov, Alexey V', 'Eastman, Alan']","['Soderquist RS', 'Danilov AV', 'Eastman A']","['From the Departments of Pharmacology and Toxicology and.', 'Medicine and the Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, New Hampshire 03756.', 'From the Departments of Pharmacology and Toxicology and the Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, New Hampshire 03756 alan.r.eastman@dartmouth.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140428,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoplasm/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gossypol/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Phospholipases A2/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'B Cell Lymphoma 2 (BCL2)', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress (ER Stress)', 'Leukemia', 'NOXA', 'Phospholipase A']",2014/04/30 06:00,2014/10/08 06:00,['2014/04/30 06:00'],"['2014/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)33511-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.562900 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Jun 6;289(23):16190-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.562900.

However, these mice are susceptible to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) induced by the engraftment and rapid expansion of coinjected human T cells. Therefore, highly purified sample populations must be used, adding significant time, expense, and effort. Here, we have explored in vivo and in vitro methods utilizing anti-T-cell antibodies to circumvent this problem. Intraperitoneal injection of the antibody within 48 hours prevented GVHD. Alternatively, short-term in vitro incubation of cells with antibody immediately before transplant was equally effective. Although in vitro antithymocyte globulin treatment resulted in a dramatic loss of SCID-repopulating cells (SRCs), treatment with OKT3 or UCHT1 abrogated GVHD risk and preserved engraftment potential. Leukemia samples that presented with substantial human T-cell contamination were effectively rescued from GVHD. In addition, OKT3 treatment of unfractionated cord blood resulted in robust engraftment of primary and secondary mice that was indistinguishable from grafts obtained using purified CD34(+) cells. Limiting dilution analysis of unfractionated blood demonstrated a SRC frequency of 1 in 300 to 500 CD34(+) cells, similar to that of purified hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.

In functional assays, CD26 was identified as target enzyme disrupting the SDF-1-CXCR4-axis by cleaving SDF-1, a chemotaxin recruiting CXCR4(+) SC. CD26 was not detected on normal SC or LSC in other hematopoietic malignancies. Correspondingly, CD26(+) LSC decreased to low or undetectable levels during successful treatment with imatinib. CD26(+) CML LSC engrafted NOD-SCID-IL-2Rgamma(-/-) (NSG) mice with BCR/ABL1(+) cells, whereas CD26( horizontal line ) SC from the same patients produced multilineage BCR/ABL1(-) engraftment. Finally, targeting of CD26 by gliptins suppressed the expansion of BCR/ABL1(+) cells. Together, CD26 is a new biomarker and target of CML LSC.

Although many studies have identified candidate driver genes based on recurrence of mutations in individual genes, subsets of genes with nonrecurrent mutations may also be defined as putative drivers if they affect a single biological pathway. In this fashion, we previously identified Wnt signaling as significantly mutated through large-scale massively parallel DNA sequencing of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Here, we use a novel method of biomolecule delivery, vertical silicon nanowires, to efficiently introduce small interfering RNAs into CLL cells, and interrogate the effects of 8 of 15 mutated Wnt pathway members identified across 91 CLLs. In HEK293T cells, mutations in 2 genes did not generate functional changes, 3 led to dysregulated pathway activation, and 3 led to further activation or loss of repression of pathway activation.

To stimulate the BCR we incubated CLL cells with anti-IgM antibodies. Anti-IgM antibodies induced transient tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear localization of phosphorylated (p) STAT3. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that anti-JAK2 antibodies coimmunoprecipitated pSTAT3 and pJAK2 in IgM-stimulated but not unstimulated CLL cells, suggesting that activation of the BCR induces activation of JAK2, which phosphorylates STAT3. Incubation of CLL cells with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib inhibited IgM-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and induced apoptosis of IgM-stimulated but not unstimulated CLL cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner.

A mammalian ortholog, Dlg1, is involved in embryonic urogenital morphogenesis, postsynaptic densities in neurons, and immune synapses in lymphocytes. However, a potential role for Dlg1 as a mammalian TSG is unknown. Here, we present evidence that loss of Dlg1 confers strong predisposition to the development of malignancies in a murine model of pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Using mice with conditionally deleted Dlg1 alleles, we identify a novel ""pre-leukemic"" stage of developmentally arrested early B-lineage cells marked by preeminent c-Myc expression. Mechanistically, we show that in B-lineage progenitors Dlg1 interacts with and stabilizes the PTEN protein, regulating its half-life and steady-state abundance. The loss of Dlg1 does not affect the level of PTEN mRNAs but results in a dramatic decrease in PTEN protein, leading to excessive phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling and proliferation.

Our purpose is to summarize the clinical activity and safety of intravenous (IV) rigosertib delivered by an external ambulatory infusion pump in patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts-1, -2, or, -t myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) following prior treatment with DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors. A total of 39 patients with MDS who fulfilled these criteria were enrolled in four phase 1-2 clinical trials of IV rigosertib. Thirty five (88%) had higher risk disease according to the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System. Median overall survival for this group of 39 patients was 35 weeks. Of 30 evaluable patients with follow-up bone marrow biopsies, 12 (40%) achieved complete (n = 5) or partial (n = 7) bone marrow blast responses. In addition, 15 patients achieved stabilization of bone marrow blasts. One patient with a complete bone marrow response also achieved a complete cytogenetic response. A second patient with stable bone marrow blasts achieved a partial cytogenetic response. Two of the responding patients and three patients with stable disease had hematological improvements. Rigosertib-induced bone marrow blast decreases and stability appeared to be predictive of prolonged survival. IV rigosertib had a favorable safety profile without significant myelosuppression. Most common drug-related toxicities included fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, dysuria, and hematuria. In summary, IV rigosertib is well tolerated and has clinical activity in patients with higher risk MDS following DNMT inhibitor treatment. A multinational pivotal phase 3 randomized clinical trial of rigosertib versus best supportive care for patients with MDS with excess blasts following prior treatment with DNMT inhibitors (ONTIME: ON 01910.Na Trial In Myelodysplastic SyndromE) has recently completed enrollment.","['(c) 2014 The Authors.

Here, we describe a previously unrecognized mechanism that promotes MET expression in multiple tumor cell types. The levels of the Pim-1 protein kinase show a positive correlation with the levels of MET protein in human tumor cell lines and patient-derived tumor materials. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA), Pim knockout mice, small-molecule inhibitors, and overexpression of Pim-1, we confirmed this correlation and found that Pim-1 kinase activity regulates HGF-induced tumor cell migration, invasion, and cell scattering. The novel biochemical mechanism for these effects involves the ability of Pim-1 to control the translation of MET by regulating the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) on S406. This targeted phosphorylation is required for the binding of eIF4B to the eIF3 translation initiation complex. Importantly, Pim-1 action was validated by the evaluation of patient blood and bone marrow from a phase I clinical trial of a Pim kinase inhibitor, AZD1208. These results suggest that Pim inhibitors may have an important role in the treatment of patients where MET is driving tumor biology.","['Copyright (c) 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

However, it is often associated with significant GvHD and has only modest efficacy against acute leukemias. Therefore, novel cellular therapies are needed to improve the outcome of high-risk or relapsed leukemia patients following HCT. Activated T helper-1 (aTh-1) lymphocytes are CD4(+)CD25(+)CD40L(+)CD62L(lo) effector memory cells that produce large amounts of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha.

However, to study the therapeutic potential and safety of these cells, a scalable cell culture medium is needed that is free of human or bovine-derived serum proteins. Thus, cost-effective recombinant serum proteins and cytokines are needed to produce such mediums. One such cytokine, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), has been shown to be a critical paracrine factor that maintains stem cell pluripotency in murine embryonic stem cells and human naive stem cells while simultaneously inhibiting differentiation. We recently produced recombinant human LIF (rhLIF) in a rice-based protein expression system known as ExpressTec. (12) We described expression of rice-derived rhLIF and demonstrated its biological equivalency to E. coli-derived rhLIF in traditional and embryonic mouse stem cell systems.

However, the prolonged late side effects in patients who terminated SIT several years previously have been reported on in only a limited number of studies. The aim of this study was to perform a 20-year post-SIT observational evaluation for the assessment of any manifestation of serious immunological disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 1,144 patients (521 women and 623 men), with a mean age of 22.8 +/- 16.9 years (at the moment of SIT completion) and who had atopic bronchial asthma and/or allergic rhinitis, were observed 20 years after immunotherapy. New neoplastic and autoimmune disease cases were monitored. The SIT group was compared to a control group consisting of 1,154 allergic patients who had never received SIT and had only had symptomatic treatment. RESULTS: There was an inverse association between SIT treatment and the prevalence of new chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia cases (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.18-0.81 and OR 0.58, CI 0.44-0.78, respectively). In other neoplastic diseases, however, prevalences similar to those observed in the control group were confirmed. There were also no significant differences in the autoimmune disease prevalence between the analyzed groups. CONCLUSION: The results of this long-term observational study indicate a lack of a significant prevalence for new instances of neoplastic and autoimmune diseases, which suggests that SIT in the long term is indeed safe.","['(c) 2014 S.

The three magnesium salts had no effect on endothelial and leukemic cell growth, but magnesium pidolate impaired cell growth in osteoblast-like cells. In particular, in Saos-2 cells, 1 mM pidolate induced a slight accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and, in parallel, an early rise in intracellular calcium and a late decrease in intracellular magnesium content. Interestingly, when cultured in 5 mM magnesium pidolate, Saos-2 cells grew as fast as the controls. Moreover, intracellular magnesium and calcium concentrations did not vary.

This is because residual CML cells are generally present in the bone marrow microenvironment and are refractory to imatinib. Hematopoietic cytokine receptor signaling is mediated by Janus kinases (JAKs) and their downstream transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT). TG101348 (SAR302503) is an oral inhibitor of JAK2. METHODS: We investigated the efficacy of imatinib and TG101348 using the break point cluster region-c-Abelson (BCR-ABL)-positive cell line and primary CML samples wherein leukemia cells were protected by a feeder cell line (HS-5). RESULTS: Imatinib treatment resulted in partial inhibition of cell growth in HS-5-conditioned medium. Furthermore, combined treatment with imatinib and TG101348 abrogated the protective effects of HS-5-conditioned medium on K562 cells. Phosphorylation of Crk-L, a BCR-ABL substrate, decreased considerably, while apoptosis increased. In addition, the combined treatment of CD34-positive primary samples resulted in considerably increased cytotoxicity, decreased Crk-L phosphorylation, and increased apoptosis. We also investigated TG101348 activity against feeder cells and observed that STAT5 phosphorylation, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin 6 levels decreased, indicating reduced cytokine production in HS-5 cells treated with TG101348. CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that JAK inhibitors may enhance the cytotoxic effect of imatinib against residual CML cells and that a combined approach may be a powerful strategy against the stroma-associated drug resistance of Philadelphia chromosome-positive cells.",,"['Okabe, Seiichi', 'Tauchi, Tetsuzo', 'Katagiri, Seiichiro', 'Tanaka, Yuko', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma']","['Okabe S', 'Tauchi T', 'Katagiri S', 'Tanaka Y', 'Ohyashiki K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-0023, Japan. okabe@tokyo-med.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140428,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Feeder Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoblotting', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrrolidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",,,2014/04/30 06:00,2014/09/27 06:00,['2014/04/30 06:00'],"['2014/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-7-37 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-7-37 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2014 Apr 28;7:37. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-7-37.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '6L1XP550I6 (Fedratinib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",,PMC4012544,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined the prevalence of the major genetic polymorphisms in 6-MP metabolizing enzymes in Chilean children with ALL. METHODS: 103 Chilean pediatric patients with a confirmed diagnosis of ALL were enrolled. DNA was isolated from whole blood and genetic polymorphism in thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) and inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA) coding genes were detected by polymorphism chain reaction-restriction fragment length (PCR-RFLP) assay. RESULTS: The total frequency of variant TPMT alleles was 8%. TPMT*2, TPMT*3A and TPMT*3B alleles were found in 0%, 7%, and 1% of patients, respectively. For ITPA, the frequency of P32T allele was 3%.

The increased risk of SMNs is associated with adjuvant chemotherapy (development of secondary acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome) and hormonal therapy (risk of uterine cancer secondary to tamoxifen treatment). Previous studies have demonstrated an increased risk of SMNs associated with alkylating agents, topoisomerase-II inhibitors, granulocyte-stimulating factors and estrogen receptor modulators. Furthermore, analytical investigations have demonstrated that BC patients may be at an increased risk of leukemia following chemotherapy. In addition, correlations between an increased dose of hormonal therapy and solid tumor risk have been identified. Considering the ongoing alterations in the treatment of BC, with respect to lowering the daily as well as the cumulative dose of chemo-therapeutic agents, it is anticipated that leukemias will have a considerably lower impact on BC survivors in the future.

Though remission-induction is an important first step in the management of AML, additional treatment strategies are essential to ensure long-term disease-free survival. Recent pivotal advances in understanding the genetics and molecular biology of AML have allowed for a risk-adapted approach in its management based on relapse-risk. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) represents an effective therapeutic strategy in AML providing the possibility of cure with potent graft-versus-leukemia reactions, with a demonstrable survival advantage in younger patients with intermediate- or poor-risk cytogenetics. Herein we review the published data regarding the role of allo-HCT in adults with AML. We searched MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE/Ovid. In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings and ongoing trial databases. We discuss the role of allo-HCT in AML patients stratified by cytogenetic- and molecular-risk in first complete remission, as well as allo-HCT as an option in relapsed/refractory AML. Besides the conventional sibling and unrelated donor allografts, we review the available data and recent advances for alternative donor sources such as haploidentical grafts and umbilical cord blood. We also discuss conditioning regimens, including reduced intensity conditioning which has broadened the applicability of allo-HCT. Finally we explore recent advances and future possibilities and directions of allo-HCT in AML.

Crude form of propolis and its phenolic contents have both been reported to exhibit antileukaemic effects in various leukaemia cell lines. The ability of the polyphenols found in propolis to arrest cell cycle and induce apoptosis and differentiation in addition to inhibition of cell growth and proliferation makes them promising antileukaemic agents, and hence, they are believed to be a key to the antileukaemic effects of propolis in different types of leukaemia. This paper reviews the molecular bases of antileukaemic activity of both crude propolis and individual polyphenols on various leukaemia cell lines, and it indicates that propolis has the potential to be used in both treatment and prevention of leukaemia.

In this phase 1/2 study, the tolerability and overall response rate of clofarabine in combination with cytarabine was investigated in children with recurrent/refractory AML. METHODS: AAML0523 enrolled 49 children with AML in first recurrence or who were refractory to induction therapy. The study consisted of a dose-finding phase (9 patients) and an efficacy phase (40 patients). Two children received clofarabine at a dose of 40 mg/m(2)/day and 47 children at a dose of 52 mg/m(2)/day. RESULTS: Toxicities typical for intensive chemotherapy regimens were observed at all doses of clofarabine. The recommended pediatric phase 2 dose of clofarabine in combination with cytarabine was 52 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days. Of 48 evaluable patients, the overall response rate (complete remission plus complete remission with partial platelet recovery) was 48%. Four patients met conventional criteria for complete remission with incomplete count recovery. Twenty-one of 23 responders subsequently underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The overall survival rate at 3 years was 46% for responders compared with 16% for nonresponders (P < .001). Patients found to have no minimal residual disease at the end of the first cycle by flow cytometric analysis had superior overall survival after 1 year (100% vs 38%; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of clofarabine and cytarabine yielded an acceptable response rate without excess toxicity in children with recurrent AML. The nearly 50% survival rate reported in responders is highly encouraging in these high-risk patients and suggests that this combination is an effective bridge to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",['(c) 2014 American Cancer Society.'],"['Cooper, Todd M', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Perentesis, John P', 'Whitlock, James A', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Horton, Terzah M', 'Gamis, Alan S', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Loken, Michael R', 'Razzouk, Bassem I']","['Cooper TM', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gerbing RB', 'Perentesis JP', 'Whitlock JA', 'Taub JW', 'Horton TM', 'Gamis AS', 'Meshinchi S', 'Loken MR', 'Razzouk BI']","['Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Aflac Cancer Center and Blood Disorders Service, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140425,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clofarabine', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'clofarabine', 'cytarabine', 'pediatric']",2014/04/29 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/04/29 06:00'],"['2013/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/19 00:00 [revised]', '2014/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28674 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2014 Aug 15;120(16):2482-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28674.

Although, dioscin is already known to induce cell death in variety cancer cells, the molecular basis for dioscin-induced cell death was not definitely known in cancer cells. In this study, we found that dioscin treatment induced cell death in dose-dependent manner in breast cancer cells such as MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, and T47D cells. Dioscin decreased expressions of Bcl-2 and cIAP-1 proteins, which were down-regulated at the transcriptional level. Conversely, Mcl-1 protein level was down-regulated by facilitating ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated Mcl-1 degradation in dioscin-treated cells. Pretreatment with z-VAD fails to attenuate dioscin-induced cell death as well as caspase-mediated events such as cleavages of procaspase-3 and PARP. In addition, dioscin treatment increased the population of annexin V positive cells and induced DNA fragmentation in a dose-dependent manner in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) was released from the mitochondria and translocated to the nucleus. Suppression in AIF expression by siRNA reduced dioscin-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that dioscin-induced cell death was mediated via AIF-facilitating caspase-independent pathway as well as down-regulating anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, cIAP-1, and Mcl-1 in breast cancer cells.",,"['Kim, Eun-Ae', 'Jang, Ji-Hoon', 'Lee, Yun-Han', 'Sung, Eon-Gi', 'Song, In-Hwan', 'Kim, Joo-Young', 'Kim, Suji', 'Sohn, Ho-Yong', 'Lee, Tae-Jin']","['Kim EA', 'Jang JH', 'Lee YH', 'Sung EG', 'Song IH', 'Kim JY', 'Kim S', 'Sohn HY', 'Lee TJ']","['Department of Anatomy, College of Medicine, Yeungnam University, 317-1 Daemyung-Dong Nam-Gu, Daegu, 705-717, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/*metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diosgenin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism']",,,2014/04/29 06:00,2015/04/23 06:00,['2014/04/29 06:00'],"['2014/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-014-0994-z [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2014 Jul;19(7):1165-75. doi: 10.1007/s10495-014-0994-z.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (BCL2L15 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '3B95U4OLWV (dioscin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'K49P2K8WLX (Diosgenin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, asparaginase-induced hypersensitivity reactions can compromise its efficacy either by directly influencing the pharmacokinetics of asparaginase or by leading to a discontinuation of asparaginase treatment. Here, we report successful challenges using native Escherichia coli asparaginase after previous hypersensitivity reactions to both PEGylated E. coli asparaginase and Erwinia asparaginase. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The two patients included in this case report were diagnosed with B-precursor ALL at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and were treated with a common regimen.

Serum samples were collected for estimating the pharmacokinetic parameters of each patient during native E. coli asparaginase therapy. RESULTS: Challenges with native E. coli asparaginase were successful, and asparaginase serum concentrations above therapeutic levels were attained in both patients.

In order to evaluate the impact of AML and its treatment on fertility and family situation in adult long-term survivors, we used the Swedish population-based registries to identify 161 adult patients diagnosed with AML within the Leukemia Group of Middle Sweden (LGMS) 1973-2003, who survived for more than 5 years and were alive in 2010. Ninety-eight patients (61 %) completed a questionnaire including items on reproductive concerns, family situation, and infertility-related distress. After excluding women >45 years and/or postmenopausal women and men >55 years, 22 women and 38 men were included in the final analysis. Nine of the women (41 %) tried to conceive after treatment, but only three succeeded. Five (83 %) of the unwillingly childless women reported ""a moderate"" or ""a lot"" of distress caused by this. Among men in the same age group, all six who wanted children after treatment succeeded. None of the men 46-55 years old cryopreserved their sperm or tried to father a child.

We discovered that Ku70, a DNA double-strand break repair protein, functions as a deubiquitinase to stabilize Mcl-1. Ku70 knockout in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells or depletion from human lung cancer H1299 cells leads to the accumulation of polyubiquitinated Mcl-1 and a reduction in its half-life and protein expression. Conversely, expression of exogenous Ku70 in Ku70(-/-) MEF cells restores Mcl-1 expression. Subcellular fractionation indicates that Ku70 extensively colocalizes with Mcl-1 in mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus in H1299 cells. Ku70 directly interacts with Mcl-1 via its C terminus (that is, aa 536-609), which is required and sufficient for deubiquitination and stabilization of Mcl-1, leading to suppression of apoptosis. Purified Ku70 protein directly deubiquitinates Mcl-1 by removing K48-linked polyubiquitin chains. Ku70 knockdown not only promotes Mcl-1 turnover but also enhances antitumor efficacy of the BH3-mimetic ABT-737 in human lung cancer xenografts. These findings identify Ku70 as a novel Mcl-1 deubiquitinase that could be a potential target for cancer therapy by manipulating Mcl-1 deubiquitination.",,"['Wang, B', 'Xie, M', 'Li, R', 'Owonikoko, T K', 'Ramalingam, S S', 'Khuri, F R', 'Curran, W J', 'Wang, Y', 'Deng, X']","['Wang B', 'Xie M', 'Li R', 'Owonikoko TK', 'Ramalingam SS', 'Khuri FR', 'Curran WJ', 'Wang Y', 'Deng X']","['Division of Cancer Biology, Department of Radiation Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Biology, Department of Radiation Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Biology, Department of Radiation Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Biology, Department of Radiation Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Biology, Department of Radiation Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Biology, Department of Radiation Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140425,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Nuclear/*physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Ku Autoantigen', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Stability', 'Protein Transport', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', '*Ubiquitination', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2014/04/29 06:00,2015/09/02 06:00,['2014/04/29 06:00'],"['2013/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/17 00:00 [revised]', '2014/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd201442 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2014.42 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2014 Jul;21(7):1160-9. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2014.42.

This study revealed the potential mechanism of high ATRA sensitivity of mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-AF9-positive AML compared with MLL-AF4/5q31-positive AML. Treatment with ATRA induced significant myeloid differentiation accompanied by upregulation of RARalpha, C/EBPalpha, C/EBPvarepsilon and PU.1 in MLL-AF9-positive but not in MLL-AF4/5q31-positive cells. Combining ATRA with cytarabine had a synergistic antileukemic effect in MLL-AF9-positive cells in vitro. The level of dimethyl histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2) in the RARalpha gene-promoter region, PU.1 upstream regulatory region (URE) and RUNX1+24/+25 intronic enhancer was higher in MLL-AF9-positive cells than in MLL-AF4-positive cells, and inhibiting lysine-specific demethylase 1, which acts as a histone demethylase inhibitor, reactivated ATRA sensitivity in MLL-AF4-positive cells. These findings suggest that the level of H3K4me2 in the RARalpha gene-promoter region, PU.1 URE and RUNX1 intronic enhancer is determined by the MLL-fusion partner.

Bone marrow ALL burden >/= 10(-4) after induction predicts subsequent relapse. Likewise, MRD >/= 10(-4) in bone marrow before initiation of conditioning for allogeneic (allo) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) predicts transplantation failure. Current methods for MRD quantification in ALL are not sufficiently sensitive for use with peripheral blood specimens and have not been broadly implemented in the management of adults with ALL. Consensus-primed immunoglobulin (Ig), T cell receptor (TCR) amplification and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) permit use of a standardized algorithm for all patients and can detect leukemia at 10(-6) or lower. We applied the LymphoSIGHT HTS platform (Sequenta Inc., South San Francisco, CA) to quantification of MRD in 237 samples from 29 adult B cell ALL patients before and after allo-HCT. Using primers for the IGH-VDJ, IGH-DJ, IGK, TCRB, TCRD, and TCRG loci, MRD could be quantified in 93% of patients. Leukemia-associated clonotypes at these loci were identified in 52%, 28%, 10%, 35%, 28%, and 41% of patients, respectively. MRD >/= 10(-4) before HCT conditioning predicted post-HCT relapse (hazard ratio [HR], 7.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0 to 30; P = .003). In post-HCT blood samples, MRD >/=10(-6) had 100% positive predictive value for relapse with median lead time of 89 days (HR, 14; 95% CI, 4.7 to 44, P < .0001). The use of HTS-based MRD quantification in adults with ALL offers a standardized approach with sufficient sensitivity to quantify leukemia MRD in peripheral blood. Use of this approach may identify a window for clinical intervention before overt relapse.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Hence, it is a prime target for novel specific anti-cancer therapeutics. In addition to its canonical anti-apoptotic role, Bcl-2 has an inhibitory effect on cell-cycle progression. Bcl-2 acts at two different intracellular compartments, the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). At the mitochondria, Bcl-2 via its hydrophobic cleft scaffolds the Bcl-2-homology (BH) domain 3 (BH3) of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-family members. Small molecules (like BH3 mimetics) can disrupt this interaction, resulting in apoptotic cell death in cancer cells. At the ER, Bcl-2 modulates Ca(2+) signaling, thereby promoting proliferation while increasing resistance to apoptosis. Bcl-2 at the ER acts via its N-terminal BH4 domain, which directly binds and inhibits the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), the main intracellular Ca(2+)-release channel. Tools targeting the BH4 domain of Bcl-2 reverse Bcl-2's inhibitory action on IP3Rs and trigger pro-apoptotic Ca(2+) signaling in cancer B-cells, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells. The sensitivity of DLBCL cells to BH4-domain targeting tools strongly correlated with the expression levels of the IP3R2 channel, the IP3R isoform with the highest affinity for IP3. Interestingly, bio-informatic analysis of a database of primary CLL patient cells also revealed a transcriptional upregulation of IP3R2. Finally, this review proposes a model, in which cancer cell survival depends on Bcl-2 at the mitochondria and/or the ER. This dependence likely will have an impact on their responses to BH3-mimetic drugs and BH4-domain targeting tools.

We retrospectively examined patients with low-grade B-cell lymphoma presenting primarily in the bone marrow. Fourteen patients met the inclusion criteria, including 5 with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL), 3 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, 2 with follicular lymphoma (FL), and 4 with low-grade B-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (LGBCL-NOS). The median age was 69.5 years (range, 42-89 years), and a slight male predominance was noted (9 men and 5 women, 1.8: 1). Immunohistochemically, all cases were positive for CD20. One case was positive for CD138. Both cases of FL were positive for CD10 and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), and immunoglobulin heavy locus (IgH)/B-cell lymphoma 2 rearrangement was observed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The myeloid differentiation primary response gene (88) leucine to proline mutation was observed in 3 of 5 LPL, 1 of 2 FL, and 2 of 4 LGBCL-NOS patients. Paraproteinemia was observed in 10 patients; IgM and IgG paraproteinemia were observed in 6 and 3 patients, respectively. In this patient series, 3 patients had died at a median follow-up of 36.5 months; the cause of death of 1 LPL patient was malignant lymphoma itself. Thus, low-grade B-cell lymphoma presenting primarily in the bone marrow has various subtypes, and approximately one-third of the patients had LGBCL-NOS.

Our main goal was to explore the limitations of the use of CNV databases, such as the Database of Genomic Variants (DGV), as the reference. To that end, we used pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as a model. We analyzed the genome-wide copy number profile of 23 ALL patients and conducted a comparison of the results obtained using the DGV with those obtained using the normal sample from the patient as the reference.

This is the first case report of a patient in whom FLT3-ITD-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) developed more than 10 years after living donor liver transplantation for congenital biliary atresia. AML developed in a 14-year-old boy 11 years after living donor liver transplantation from his father. The patient received the transplant at the age of 3 years and was treated with tacrolimus and methylprednisolone for transplant rejection. Eleven years posttransplantation, he visited the hospital with general malaise and anemia. Blood tests revealed an elevated white blood cell count of 60,100/muL, and the patient was diagnosed with AML. Chromosome analysis revealed a t(6; 9) (p23 q34) translocation; moreover, genetic testing revealed a FLT3-ITD-positive mutation. We started treatment in accordance with the Tokyo Children's Cancer Study Group AML99 protocol. With chemotherapy treatment, the patient achieved complete remission.

In this study, the expression of miR-29b messenger RNA (mRNA) and its targeted genes, myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1, mitogen-activated protein kinase 10 (MAPK10), and autophagy-related protein 9A (ATG9A), were investigated in ovarian carcinomas, and their associations with clinicopathological characteristics and survival of patients with ovarian cancer were analyzed. The protein expression of MCL1, MAPK10, and ATG9A was measured using immunohistochemistry. miR-29b mRNA and ATG9A gene mRNA levels were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results demonstrated that the percentage of MCL1, MAPK10, and ATG9A protein-positive cases were significantly higher, whereas miR-29b was significantly lower in ovarian serous, mucinous, and clear cell carcinomas than that in normal tissues. MAPK10 was significantly associated with higher histopathologic grading. The percentage of positive myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1, ATG9A, and MAPK10 protein expression and low miR-29b mRNA expression were significantly higher in cases with clinical stage III and IV ovarian cancer than in cases with clinical stage II ovarian cancer. High ATG9A protein and low miR-29b mRNA expression were significantly associated with relapse. Univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a negative correlation between MAPK10 or ATG9A protein expression and overall as well as progression-free survival, whereas a positive correlation was observed between miR-29b mRNA expression and overall as well as progression-free survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that elevated MAPK10 or ATG9A protein and lowered miR-29b mRNA expression in ovarian carcinoma was an independent poor prognostic predictor.

RESULTS: For all 54 FLT3-ITD positive patients, the 3-year overall survival (3-OS) rate was 56% and 3-year leukemia-free survival (3-LFS) rate was 47%. The outcome of haplo-identical HSCT was similar as that of sibling donors (3-OS rate: 60% vs 54%; 3-LFS rate: 54% vs 45%, respectively) .

METHODS: From January 2003 to December 2012, 95 patients with MDS or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were treated with HLA-identical allo-HSCT in our hospital. The median age was 43 (21-59) years. Conditioning regimens including modified busulfan (Bu)/cyclophosphamide (Cy) or Bu/ fludarabine (Flu) were used. All patients received transfusion of donor stem cells mobilized by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) from bone marrow and/or peripheral blood. Eleven patients had refractory anemia (RA) or RA with ringed sideroblasts, 53 of RA with excess blasts (RAEB), 15 of RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t), and 16 progressing to secondary AML. RESULTS: A total of 93 patients achieved sustained myeloid engraftment. The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) was 12.9% +/- 3.5%. The 3-year cumulative incidence of chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) was 80.3% +/- 4.9%. After a median follow-up of 28.7 months, 29 patients died. The 3-year estimated overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 69.9% +/- 5.0% and 58.0% +/- 5.4% respectively. The cumulative relapse rate (RR) was 25.9% +/- 4.7%, while non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 16.1% +/- 4.0%. Multivariate analyses showed that non II-IV aGVHD and cGVHD were favorable factors associated with OS. Low DFS rate was correlated with high scores of international prognostic scoring system (IPSS). Patients with RAEB-t and AML (n = 31) were divided into 3 groups: no chemotherapy before HSCT (Group 1), chemotherapy but not achieving remission (Group 2) and chemotherapy and achieving remission (Group 3). The 3-year OS rate was 100.0% in Group 3, which was significantly higher than those of Groups 1 and 2 with 33.9%, 32.7% respectively (P < 0.05). The difference of DFS and RR in the three groups did not reach statistic difference. CONCLUSIONS: Allo-HSCT from HLA-identical siblings is effective for patients with MDS.

However cranial irradiation carries a latent risk of the induction of secondary intracranial tumors. We encountered a patient who developed multiple intracranial radiation-induced meningiomas (RIMs) 25 years after prophylactic cranial irradiation for the treatment of acute leukemia in childhood. The patient had 3 intracranial lesions, 1 of which showed rapid growth within 6 months; another of the tumors also enlarged within a short period. All of the tumors were surgically treated, and immunohistochemistry indicated a high MIB-1 labeling index in each of the multiple lesions. In the literature, the MIB-1 labeling indices of 27 tumors from 21 patients were examined. Among them, 12 recurrent tumors showed higher MIB-1 labeling indices compared to the MIB-1 labeling indices of the non-recurrent tumors. Overall, 11 of the patients with RIM had multiple lesions and 8 cases developed recurrence (72.7%). RIM cases with multiple lesions had higher MIB-1 labeling indices compared to the MIB-1 labeling indices of cases with single lesions. Collectively, these data showed that the MIB-1 labeling index is as important for predicting RIM recurrences, as it is for predicting sporadic meningioma (SM) recurrences.

The encoded product is a 230-KDa protein. Despite the remarkable responses to treatment of most patients, a small but significant fraction of them develop clinical resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The most common mechanism of resistance is point mutations in the ABL1 kinase domain. The recently approved third-generation TKI ponatinib demonstrated remarkable activity in patients with multi-TKI-resistant disease. Particularly impressive was its efficacy in patients with T315I mutation that is resistant to all other TKIs. METHODS: Qualitative PCR was carried out by multiplex approach. Relative transcripts quantification was performed by one-step real-time PCR, with a specific Taqman probe and primers for the e19a2 rearrangement. We carried out a mutational screening by high-resolution melting, and the mutation was identified by Sanger method. The mutation burden was quantified by quantitative PCR using allele-specific primers. RESULTS: In a patient with CML, we identified a PCR product corresponding to e19a2 rearrangement harboring T315I mutation. At the time of mutational analysis, during dasatinib treatment, the T315I clone was 100% and the quantification of BCR-ABL1 was 18%. After ponatinib therapy, the T315I mutation burden decreased down to undetectable levels and the BCR-ABL1 transcripts showed a very low value (0.011%). CONCLUSIONS: Here, we report the hematological, cytogenetic, and molecular response of a patient with refractory CML in chronic phase with e19a2 transcripts, carrying T315I mutation that was successfully treated with ponatinib.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Presently, three risk scores-the Sokal, Hasford, and European Treatment and Outcome Study (EUTOS) metrics-have been implemented clinically in CML-CP.

Despite its wide clinical use, 2-3% of patients treated with etoposide eventually develop treatment-related acute myeloid leukemias (t-AMLs) characterized by rearrangements of the MLL gene. The molecular basis underlying the development of these t-AMLs is not well understood; however, previous studies have implicated etoposide metabolites (i.e., etoposide quinone) and topoisomerase IIbeta in the leukemogenic process. Although interactions between etoposide quinone and topoisomerase IIalpha have been characterized, the effects of the drug metabolite on the activity of human topoisomerase IIbeta have not been reported. Thus, we examined the ability of etoposide quinone to poison human topoisomerase IIbeta. The quinone induced ~4 times more enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage than did the parent drug. Furthermore, the potency of etoposide quinone was ~2 times greater against topoisomerase IIbeta than it was against topoisomerase IIalpha, and the drug reacted ~2-4 times faster with the beta isoform. Etoposide quinone induced a higher ratio of double- to single-stranded breaks than etoposide, and its activity was less dependent on ATP. Whereas etoposide acts as an interfacial topoisomerase II poison, etoposide quinone displayed all of the hallmarks of a covalent poison: the activity of the metabolite was abolished by reducing agents, and the compound inactivated topoisomerase IIbeta when it was incubated with the enzyme prior to the addition of DNA. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that etoposide quinone contributes to etoposide-related leukemogenesis through an interaction with topoisomerase IIbeta.",,"['Smith, Nicholas A', 'Byl, Jo Ann W', 'Mercer, Susan L', 'Deweese, Joseph E', 'Osheroff, Neil']","['Smith NA', 'Byl JA', 'Mercer SL', 'Deweese JE', 'Osheroff N']","['Departments of daggerBiochemistry, double daggerMedicine (Hematology/Oncology), and section signPharmacology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , Nashville, Tennessee 37232-0146, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140502,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['DNA/chemistry/metabolism', '*DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/chemistry', '*DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Etoposide/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*ethnology', '*Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Quinones/*chemistry', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/*chemistry/metabolism']",,,2014/04/29 06:00,2014/07/06 06:00,['2014/04/29 06:00'],"['2014/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bi500421q [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2014 May 20;53(19):3229-36. doi: 10.1021/bi500421q.

However, without validation against measured environmental concentrations, personal exposure levels, or biologic doses, these models cannot be assumed a priori to be accurate. This article discusses three examples of epidemiologic associations involving exposures estimated using geographic modeling, and identifies important issues that affect geographically modeled exposure assessment in these areas. In air pollution epidemiology, geographic models of fine particulate matter levels have frequently been validated against measured environmental levels, but comparisons between ambient and personal exposure levels have shown only moderate correlations. Estimating exposure to magnetic fields by using geographically modeled distances is problematic because the error is larger at short distances, where field levels can vary substantially. Geographic models of environmental exposure to pesticides, including paraquat, have seldom been validated against environmental or personal levels, and validation studies have yielded inconsistent and typically modest results. In general, the exposure misclassification resulting from geographic models of environmental exposures can be differential and can result in bias away from the null even if non-differential. Therefore, geographic exposure models must be rigorously constructed and validated if they are to be relied upon to produce credible scientific results to inform epidemiologic research. To our knowledge, such models have not yet successfully predicted an association between an environmental exposure and a chronic disease outcome that has eventually been established as causal, and may not be capable of doing so in the absence of thorough validation.",,"['Chang, Ellen T', 'Adami, Hans-Olov', 'Bailey, William H', 'Boffetta, Paolo', 'Krieger, Robert I', 'Moolgavkar, Suresh H', 'Mandel, Jack S']","['Chang ET', 'Adami HO', 'Bailey WH', 'Boffetta P', 'Krieger RI', 'Moolgavkar SH', 'Mandel JS']","['Health Sciences Practice, Exponent, Inc. , Menlo Park, CA, Bowie, MD, and Bellevue, WA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Crit Rev Toxicol,Critical reviews in toxicology,8914275,IM,"['Air Pollutants/analysis', 'Air Pollution/analysis', 'Child', 'Environmental Exposure/*analysis', 'Geography', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/pathology', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Paraquat/analysis/toxicity', 'Particulate Matter/analysis', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,,2014/04/29 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/04/29 06:00'],"['2014/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10408444.2014.902029 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Toxicol. 2014 May;44(5):450-66. doi: 10.3109/10408444.2014.902029.,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Particulate Matter)', 'PLG39H7695 (Paraquat)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Targeted therapies that inhibit and regulate this pathway are reasonable strategies for disease management. Only one JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor has gained FDA approval for treatment of myelofibrosis. Despite significant reductions in splenomegaly and disease-associated symptoms, additional agents are necessary to manage disease in those that do not respond. AREAS COVERED: A review of the currently available literature and meeting abstracts for JAK inhibitors in myeloproliferative neoplasms identified studies aimed at improving outcomes and establishing alternative therapies in MPNs. Development of specific JAK inhibitors and ongoing trials involving ruxolitinib, CYT387, SAR302503, CEP701, SB 1518, XL-019, LY2784544, BMS-911453, NS-018, AZD1480 and INCB039110 are reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: The identification of JAK2V617F mutation and its link to MPNs has revolutionized treatment options. Resultant research in targeting the JAK/STAT pathway led to the approval of ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor with activity in MPNs. While ruxolitinib produces durable reductions in splenomegaly and improvement of symptoms, and prolongs survival, there is room for new and more specific agents to be developed. Minimizing toxicity and avoiding drug resistance are challenges that lie ahead. Combining agents with different mechanisms seems to be a rational strategy.",,"['Rosenthal, Allison', 'Mesa, Ruben A']","['Rosenthal A', 'Mesa RA']","['Mayo Clinic, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology , Arizona , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140425,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['JAK2', 'Janus kinase', 'essential thrombocytosis', 'myelofibrosis', 'myeloproliferative neoplasm', 'polycythemia vera']",2014/04/29 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/04/29 06:00'],"['2014/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14656566.2014.913024 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2014 Jun;15(9):1265-76. doi: 10.1517/14656566.2014.913024.

The capsaicin analogues, rinvanil and phenylacetylrinvanil (PhAR), share a binding affinity for vanilloid receptors and may have biological activities similar to capsaicin; however, their anticancer potential has not yet been reported. This study analyses the antineoplastic activities of rinvanil and PhAR in leukaemia versus normal cells. P388, J774 and WEHI-3 leukaemia cell lines, as well as mouse bone marrow mononuclear cells, were cultured with varying concentrations of rinvanil and PhAR. Following this, proliferation and apoptosis were determined by the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay and DNA ladder. Cultured leukaemia cell lines and mouse bone marrow mononuclear cells demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation, while non-diseased cells were less sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of capsaicin, rinvanil and PhAR.

However, since most series in the literature report on the features of all patients regardless of the type of mutation, NPM1-A(+) cases have not been well characterized yet. Therefore, we evaluated the prevalence of NPM1-A in Bulgarian AML patients and searched for an association with clinical and laboratory features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and four adults (51 men, 53 women) were included in the study. NPM1-A status was determined using allele-specific reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction with co-amplification of NPM1-A and beta-actin and real-time quantitative TaqMan-based polymerase chain reaction. Patients received conventional induction chemotherapy and were followed for 13.2+/-16.4 months. RESULTS: NPM1-A was detected in 26 (24.8%) patients. NPM1-A mutation was detected in all AML categories, including in one patient with RUNX1-RUNX1T1. There were no differences associated with the NPM1-A status with respect to age, sex, hemoglobin, platelet counts, percentage of bone marrow blasts, splenomegaly, complete remission rates, and overall survival. NPM1-A(+) patients, compared to NPM1-A(-) patients, were characterized by higher leukocyte counts [(75.4+/-81.9)x109/L vs. (42.5+/-65.9)x109/L; p=0.049], higher frequency of normal karyotype [14/18 (77.8%) vs. 26/62 (41.9%); p=0.014], higher frequency of FLT3-ITD [11/26 (42.3%) vs. 8/77 (10.4%); p=0.001], and lower incidence of CD34(+) [6/21 (28.8%) vs. 28/45 (62.2%); p=0.017]. Within the FLT3-ITD(-) group, the median overall survival of NPM1-A(-) patients was 14 months, while NPM1-A(+) patients did not reach the median (p=0.10). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of NPM1-A mutation in adult Bulgarian AML patients was similar to that reported in other studies. NPM1-A(+) patients were characterized by higher leukocyte counts, higher frequency of normal karyotypes and FLT3-ITD, and lower incidence of CD34(+), supporting the idea that the specific features of type A mutations might contribute to the general clinical and laboratory profile of NPM1(+) AML patients.",,"['Balatzenko, Gueorgui', 'Spassov, Branimir', 'Stoyanov, Nikolay', 'Ganeva, Penka', 'Dikov, Tihomit', 'Konstantinov, Spiro', 'Hrischev, Vasil', 'Romanova, Malina', 'Toshkov, Stavri', 'Guenova, Margarita']","['Balatzenko G', 'Spassov B', 'Stoyanov N', 'Ganeva P', 'Dikov T', 'Konstantinov S', 'Hrischev V', 'Romanova M', 'Toshkov S', 'Guenova M']","['National Specialized Hospital for Active Treatment of Hematological Diseases, Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Biology, Sofia, Bulgaria ; Center of Excellence for Translational Research in Hematology, Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'Center of Excellence for Translational Research in Hematology, Sofia, Bulgaria ; National Specialized Hospital for Active Treatment of Hematological Diseases, Hematology Clinic, Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'Center of Excellence for Translational Research in Hematology, Sofia, Bulgaria ; National Specialized Hospital for Active Treatment of Hematological Diseases, Laboratory of Hematopathology and Immunology, Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'Center of Excellence for Translational Research in Hematology, Sofia, Bulgaria ; National Specialized Hospital for Active Treatment of Hematological Diseases, Hematology Clinic, Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'National Specialized Hospital for Active Treatment of Hematological Diseases, Laboratory of Hematopathology and Immunology, Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'National Specialized Hospital for Active Treatment of Hematological Diseases, Hematology Clinic, Sofia, Bulgaria ; Medical University of Sofia, Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmacotherapy, Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'National Specialized Hospital for Active Treatment of Hematological Diseases, Hematology Clinic, Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'National Specialized Hospital for Active Treatment of Hematological Diseases, Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Biology, Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'National Specialized Hospital for Active Treatment of Hematological Diseases, Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Biology, Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'Center of Excellence for Translational Research in Hematology, Sofia, Bulgaria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140305,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'FLT3-ITD', 'NPM1 gene type A mutation', 'allele-specific polymerase chain reaction']",2014/04/26 06:00,2014/04/26 06:01,['2014/04/26 06:00'],"['2013/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4274/Tjh.2013.0023 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2014 Mar;31(1):40-8. doi: 10.4274/Tjh.2013.0023.

METHODS: The study included patients with confirmed cml currently being treated with a tki. The survey was conducted by structured interview using a standard form. Patient preferences were explored in a case-based scenario using 0%-100% visual analog scales and 5-point Likert scales. Data were analyzed using proportions for dichotomous variables and medians and interquartile ranges for continuous variables. RESULTS: Of 63 patients approached, 56 completed the survey. Participant responses suggest that the idea of stopping tki use is appealing to many patients if there is a chance of long-term stable disease and a high probability of response upon restarting a tki. Participants were more likely to stop their tki as the risk of relapse decreased. Participants reported loss of disease control and failure of disease to respond to treatment as important concerns if they chose to stop their tki. CONCLUSIONS: Given the current 60% estimated rate of relapse after discontinuation of tki therapy, most patients with cml chose to continue with tki. However, at the lower relapse rates reported with second-generation tkis, participants were more undecided, demonstrating a basic understanding of risk. Contrary to our hypothesis, neither compliance nor occurrence of side effects significantly affected patient willingness to stop their tki.",,"['Sanford, D', 'Kyle, R', 'Lazo-Langner, A', 'Xenocostas, A', 'Chin-Yee, I', 'Howson-Jan, K', 'Hsia, C']","['Sanford D', 'Kyle R', 'Lazo-Langner A', 'Xenocostas A', 'Chin-Yee I', 'Howson-Jan K', 'Hsia C']","['Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Western Ontario, London, ON. ; Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, London Health Sciences Centre, University of Western Ontario, London, ON.', 'Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Western Ontario, London, ON.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, London Health Sciences Centre, University of Western Ontario, London, ON. ; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Western Ontario, London, ON.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, London Health Sciences Centre, University of Western Ontario, London, ON.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, London Health Sciences Centre, University of Western Ontario, London, ON.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, London Health Sciences Centre, University of Western Ontario, London, ON.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, London Health Sciences Centre, University of Western Ontario, London, ON.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Curr Oncol,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",9502503,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'patient preference', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2014/04/26 06:00,2014/04/26 06:01,['2014/04/26 06:00'],"['2014/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3747/co.21.1736 [doi]', 'conc-21-e241 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Oncol. 2014 Apr;21(2):e241-9. doi: 10.3747/co.21.1736.,,,PMC3997457,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The synthesized compound NU7026 specifically inhibits dna-dependent protein kinase (dna-pk) within the non-homologous end-joining repair mechanism. Earlier studies demonstrated increased radiosensitivity in dna-pk deficient cells compared with wild-type cells. In chronic leukemia cells, NU7026 appears to enhance the cytotoxic effect of chlorambucil. The radio-modifying effects of NU7026 on cell survival, cell cycle, apoptosis, and dna double-strand break repair have yet to be studied in gastric cancer cells. METHODS: The gastric cancer cell line N87 was treated with 0 Gy or 4 Gy in the presence of NU7026 at a dose range of 0-20 mumol/L. Clonogenic assays were used to assess cell survival after treatment. Cell-cycle distribution was analyzed using propidium iodide with fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Apoptosis was detected using annexin-V and propidium iodide with fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The gammaH2AX assay was used to measure dna double-strand breaks. RESULTS: Statistically significant increases in G2/M arrest were observed in N87 cells treated with radiation and NU7026 compared with those treated with radiation alone (p = 0.0004). Combined treatment also led to an increase in apoptosis (p = 0.01). At 24 hours, the gammaH2AX analysis revealed more dna double-strand breaks in N87 cells treated with radiation and NU7026 than in those treated with radiation alone (p = 0.04). Clonogenic assays demonstrated declining cell survival as both the radiation and the NU7026 dose increased. The dose enhancement factor at 0.1 survival fraction was 1.28 when N87 cells were treated with 4 Gy radiation and 5 mumol/L NU7026. CONCLUSIONS: In gastric cancer cells, NU7026 appears to enhance the cytotoxic effect of irradiation as assessed by clonogenic assays. This increased cytotoxicity might be the result of an increase in dna double-strand breaks resulting in G2/M cell arrest and possibly higher levels of apoptosis.",,"['Niazi, M T', 'Mok, G', 'Heravi, M', 'Lee, L', 'Vuong, T', 'Aloyz, R', 'Panasci, L', 'Muanza, T']","['Niazi MT', 'Mok G', 'Heravi M', 'Lee L', 'Vuong T', 'Aloyz R', 'Panasci L', 'Muanza T']","['Segal Cancer Centre, Department of Oncology, Division of Radiation Oncology, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, QC.', 'Department of Oncology, Division of Radiation Oncology, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, QC.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC.', 'McGill University, Montreal, QC.', 'Segal Cancer Centre, Department of Oncology, Division of Radiation Oncology, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, QC.', 'Segal Cancer Centre, Lady Davis Institute of Research, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, QC.', 'Segal Cancer Centre, Department of Oncology, Division of Radiation Oncology, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, QC.', 'Segal Cancer Centre, Department of Oncology, Division of Radiation Oncology, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, QC.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Curr Oncol,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",9502503,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Gastric cancer', 'NU7026', 'dna pk inhibitor', 'radiation therapy', 'radiosensitization']",2014/04/26 06:00,2014/04/26 06:01,['2014/04/26 06:00'],"['2014/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3747/co.21.1509 [doi]', 'conc-21-91 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Oncol. 2014 Apr;21(2):91-6. doi: 10.3747/co.21.1509.,,,PMC3997448,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Insights into MLL fusion-mediated leukemogenesis have not yet translated into better therapies because MLL is difficult to target directly, and the identity of the genes downstream of MLL whose altered transcription mediates leukemic transformation are poorly annotated. We used a functional genetic approach to uncover that AML cells driven by MLL-AF9 are exceptionally reliant on the cell-cycle regulator CDK6, but not its functional homolog CDK4, and that the preferential growth inhibition induced by CDK6 depletion is mediated through enhanced myeloid differentiation. CDK6 essentiality is also evident in AML cells harboring alternate MLL fusions and a mouse model of MLL-AF9-driven leukemia and can be ascribed to transcriptional activation of CDK6 by mutant MLL. Importantly, the context-dependent effects of lowering CDK6 expression are closely phenocopied by a small-molecule CDK6 inhibitor currently in clinical development. These data identify CDK6 as critical effector of MLL fusions in leukemogenesis that might be targeted to overcome the differentiation block associated with MLL-rearranged AML, and underscore that cell-cycle regulators may have distinct, noncanonical, and nonredundant functions in different contexts.",['(c) 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Placke, Theresa', 'Faber, Katrin', 'Nonami, Atsushi', 'Putwain, Sarah L', 'Salih, Helmut R', 'Heidel, Florian H', 'Kramer, Alwin', 'Root, David E', 'Barbie, David A', 'Krivtsov, Andrei V', 'Armstrong, Scott A', 'Hahn, William C', 'Huntly, Brian J', 'Sykes, Stephen M', 'Milsom, Michael D', 'Scholl, Claudia', 'Frohling, Stefan']","['Placke T', 'Faber K', 'Nonami A', 'Putwain SL', 'Salih HR', 'Heidel FH', 'Kramer A', 'Root DE', 'Barbie DA', 'Krivtsov AV', 'Armstrong SA', 'Hahn WC', 'Huntly BJ', 'Sykes SM', 'Milsom MD', 'Scholl C', 'Frohling S']","['Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases and German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany; German Consortium for Translational Cancer Research, Heidelberg, Germany;', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany;', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA;', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute of Medical Research, and Wellcome Trust - Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom;', 'German Consortium for Translational Cancer Research, Heidelberg, Germany; Department of Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Tubingen, Germany;', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Otto von Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany;', 'German Consortium for Translational Cancer Research, Heidelberg, Germany; Clinical Cooperation Unit Molecular Hematology and Oncology, German Cancer Research Center, and Department of Internal Medicine V, Ruprecht Karls University, Heidelberg, Germany;', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA;', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; Broad Institute of Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA;', 'Leukemia Center, Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY;', 'Leukemia Center, Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY;', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; Broad Institute of Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA;', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute of Medical Research, and Wellcome Trust - Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom;', 'Immune Cell Development and Host Defense Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA; and.', 'Heidelberg Institute for Stem Cell Technology and Experimental Medicine and Division of Stem Cells and Cancer, Experimental Hematology Group, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany;', 'Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases and German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany; German Consortium for Translational Cancer Research, Heidelberg, Germany;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140424,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,,2014/04/26 06:00,2014/08/29 06:00,['2014/04/26 06:00'],"['2014/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40019-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-02-558114 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Jul 3;124(1):13-23. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-02-558114.

Bone marrow samples from 101 newly diagnosed non - M3 AML patients and 26 healthy controls for comparison were quantified by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the comparative cycle threshold (Ct) method was used to determine their relative expression levels to GUS control gene. The results showed that expression of all selected Eph receptors was significantly lower in AML patients comparing to controls. It also differed according to FAB subtypes. The decreased expression levels of Eph A4 were associated with higher leukocytes (p = 0.022) and blast cell counts (p = 0.001), and unfavorable FLT3-ITD mutation. Our study revealed significant correlation between lower EphB2 expression levels, and higher complete remission rate (p = 0.009724) and longer overall survival.

Mutations were found to be higher in sokal high- (45.0 %) and intermediate- (68.42 %) compared to low-risk (29.16 %) group. Mutations were observed in 38.09 % of patients with EUTOS (European Treatment and Outcome Study) high risk and in 50.0 % with low risk. The frequency of mutations was 50.0 % in advanced phase, 47.36 % in late chronic-phase, and 43.33 % in chronic-phase patients. 42.10 % of patients with primary resistance and 52.0 % with secondary resistance had mutations. P-loop and T315I mutations were associated with poor survival in advanced phase patients (85.71 %) (P = 0.03). No significant variation was observed with Bcr-Abl transcript levels between the patients with the presence or absence of mutations (P = 0.73). Bcr-Abl levels were found to be significantly elevated in P-loop and T315I mutation carriers (P = 0.001) and also in T315I mutation-positive patients (P = 0.01). P-loop mutations and T315I are frequent in advanced phases and strongly associated with poor prognosis and survival. Hence, the identification of mutations in IM-resistant CML patients will help in treatment optimization with 2nd- or 3rd-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).",,"['Kagita, Sailaja', 'Uppalapati, Srihari', 'Jiwatani, Sangeeta', 'Linga, Vijay Gandhi', 'Gundeti, Sadasivudu', 'Nagesh, Narayana', 'Digumarti, Raghunadharao']","['Kagita S', 'Uppalapati S', 'Jiwatani S', 'Linga VG', 'Gundeti S', 'Nagesh N', 'Digumarti R']","['Nizams Institute of Medical Sciences, Punjagutta, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, 500082, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140426,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'India', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage']",,,2014/04/26 06:00,2014/10/07 06:00,['2014/04/26 06:00'],"['2014/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-014-1926-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2014 Jul;35(7):7187-93. doi: 10.1007/s13277-014-1926-9.

Analyses of a series of deletion mutants revealed that the FIP1 motif in FIP1L1-RARA plays a pivotal role in its homodimerization and transcriptional repressor activity. However, in FIP1L1-PDGFRA, the C-terminal PDGFRA portion possesses the ability of forming a homodimer by itself, making FIP1L1 dispensable for constitutive activation of this kinase. Both the full-length and the C-terminal PDGFRA portion of FIP1L1-PDGFRA could transform the IL-3-dependent hematopoietic cell line, BAF-B03. Moreover, when either the full-length or the C-terminal PDGFRA portion of FIP1L1-PDGFRA was introduced in these cells, they grew in the absence of IL-3. The cells having the C-terminal PDGFRA portion of FIP1L1-PDGFRA, however, were partially IL-3 dependent, whereas the cells having the full-length FIP1L1-PDGFRA became completely IL-3 independent for their growth.

Genome-wide there are several thousand binding sites and hundreds of primary 1,25(OH)2D3 target genes, but their functional relation is largely elusive. In this study, we used ChIA-PET data of the transcription factor CTCF in combination with VDR ChIP-seq data, in order to map chromatin domains containing VDR binding sites. In total, we found 1,599 such VDR containing chromatin domains and studied in THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cells four representatives of them. Our combined ChIP-seq and FAIRE-seq time course data showed that each of these four domains contained a master VDR binding site, where an increase of VDR binding pairs with 1,25(OH)2D3-promoted chromatin opening and the presence of a highly significant DR3-type sequence below the peak summit. These sites differed in their relative VDR binding but not in their kinetics, while other loci either had a weaker and delayed VDR association or could not be confirmed at all. All studied chromatin domains contained at least one primary 1,25(OH)2D3 target gene demonstrating a characteristic slope of mRNA increase, while neighboring genes responded delayed, if at all. In conclusion, the observation of ligand-inducible VDR binding and chromatin opening combined with a DR3-type sequence highlighted genome-wide 160 VDR loci that have within their chromatin domain a more than 4-fold increased likelihood to identify a primary 1,25(OH)2D3 target gene than in the vicinity of other genomic VDR binding sites.",,"['Seuter, Sabine', 'Neme, Antonio', 'Carlberg, Carsten']","['Seuter S', 'Neme A', 'Carlberg C']","['School of Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'School of Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'School of Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140424,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism']",,,2014/04/26 06:00,2015/08/01 06:00,['2014/04/26 06:00'],"['2014/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0096184 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-00646 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Apr 24;9(4):e96184. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0096184. eCollection 2014.,"['0 (CCCTC-Binding Factor)', '0 (CTCF protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (VDR protein, human)']",,PMC3999108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The study analyzed census, ISTAT death cards, both from the epidemiological point of view with admirers that SMR standardized spatial analysis using Bayesian models. RESULTS: Overall, both approaches highlighted major risks for the area south of the capital for major cancers such as colorectal and lung and increases worthy of investigation for the young-adult age groups in both genders.

In order to identify an early and easily applicable prognostic factor allowing subsequent treatment modifications, we assessed leukemic blast counts in the bone marrow by morphology on days 15 and 28 after first reinduction in 338 patients of the international Relapsed-AML2001/01 trial. Both day 15 and day 28 status was classified as good (</=20% leukemic blasts) in 77% of patients. The correlation between day 15 and 28 blast percentages was significant, but not strong (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.49, P<0.001). Survival probability decreased in a stepwise fashion along with rising blast counts at day 28. Patients with bone marrow blast counts at this time-point of </=5%, 6-10%, 11-20% and >20% had 4-year probabilities of survival of 52%+/-3% versus 36%+/-10% versus 21%+/-9% versus 14%+/-4%, respectively, P<0.0001; this trend was not seen for day 15 results. Multivariate analysis showed that early treatment response at day 28 had the strongest prognostic significance, superseding even time to relapse (< or >/=12 months).

Decreasing the level of ER stress either by inactivating components of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway or by expression of ER chaperone protein glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) decreases OPT-induced cell death. We show that OPT induces the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and the stabilization of unstable proteins, suggesting that OPT functions, at least in part, through interfering with the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. In support of this, inhibition of protein synthesis significantly decreased the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, which is correlated with significantly decreased OPT-induced ER stress and cell death. Finally, we show that OPT treatment significantly induced the expression of BH3-only proteins, Noxa and Bim. Knockdown of both Noxa and Bim significantly blocked OPT-induced cell death.

Microenvironment and immune system play a key role in the pathogenesis of CLL. The immune system is aggravated by the use of chemotherapeutic agents, such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with rituximab(FCR) which are the current standards in frontline therapy. This leads to an increase of infection incidence in patients, resulting in a poor prognosis. The present situation was changed by lenalidomide. Recent studies indicated that lenalidomide monotherapy in treatment of refractory or relapsed CLL patients, the overall response rate(ORR) reached about 32%-47%, CR roughly was 7%-13%; when lenalidomide and rituximab were combined for treatment of refractory or relapsed CLL patients, the ORR reached about 53%-66%, CR about 12%-13%. Moreover, when lenalidomide and ofatumumab were combined, the efficacy is improved significantly and the adverse reactions are greatly reduced.

Under injury, infection and chemotherapy, HMGB1 can be released by nature immunocyte and necrosis cells as a DAMP, exerting pleiotropic biological effects by binding to RAGE, TLR and CXCL12, which lead to activation of CDC42, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), c-IAP and NF-kappaB, thereby promoting angiogenesis, unlimited replicative potential, tissue invasion and metastasis. And it also involves in immune response by regulating immunocyte function as a immunocyte warning signal. Scholars have detected that HMGB1 is over expressed and released following chemotherapy and radiation therapy in cells of hematological malignancies, promoting malignant cell replication, decreasing therapeutic effect. Recently, endogenous HMGB1 has been implied to be an intrinsic modulator of autophagy and referenced to resistant to apoptosis in malignant hematosis cells. In contrast, through suppression of HMGB1 expression, tumor cell apoptosis and chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity were increased, which will be a new strategy for the treatment of hematological malignancies.

The peripheral blood T lymphocyte subsets were detected using flow cytometry and TREC were detected using real-time quantitative PCR for 40 patients with hematologic malignancies in the first six months after myeloablative allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The results showed that in the first month after transplantation, the absolute counts of CD3(+), CD3(+) CD4(+), CD3(+) CD8(+) cells were lower significantly in the UCBT group than those in the BMT/PBSCT group.

The results indicated that the proportion of disease progression into bone marrow abnormality in patients treated with chemotherapy and in patients treated without chemotherapy was 25% and 85.7% respectively, suggesting that the chemotherapy can reduce the incidence of progression into bone marrow abnormality (P < 0.05). The average survival time of PGS patients treated with chemotherapy or without chemotherapy was 26.063 +/- 14.97 and 12.214 +/- 6.83 months (P < 0.05),suggesting prolonging of survival time of patients treated with chemotherapy, moreover 2 patients who were treated using chemotherapy combined with bone marrow transplantation still alive now,and their living times were 39 months and 45 months respectively.

The results indicated that the detected rates of chromosome abnormal karyotypes in MDS and AML patients were 41% and 61% respectively. The abnormal karyotype analysis of MDS and AML group showed that the abnormal karyotype in MDS group displayed number abnormality as the dominate (mainly the +8), while the abnormal karyotype in AML group displayed structure abnormality as the dominant [mainly, t(15;17) and t(8;21)]. The detected abnormal karyotype are mainly for the +8 which has ambiguous correlation with FAB subtype; the detection rates of complex karyotype abnormalities, favourable prognosis karyotype as well as poor prognosis karyotype in the MDS group obviously higher than that of AML group.

Therefore, the splenectomy are usually needed to confirm the diagnosis, but the majority of patients could not accept such management, resulting in early difficult diagnosis. This study was purposed to explore the more prior way for diagnosis based flow cytometry (FCM). Six patients with suspected diagnosis of SMZL were used as research objects, 10 healthy bone marrow donors and 10 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 3 cases of hairy cell leukemia (HCL), 3 cases of lymphatic plasma cell lymphoma/Waldenstro's macroglobulinemia (LPL/WM) were selected as control. The immunophenotype of bone marrow cells were analyzed and compared by FCM using a panel of antibodies including CD45, CD5, CD10, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD23, CD25, CD103, CD11c, CD123, kappa,lambda, Cyclin D1, and combined with bone marrow cell morphology. The results indicated that 6 cases of suspected SMZL showed a large increase of lymphocytes and splenomegaly. Because absence of peripheral lymphadenopathy, 6 patients did not suffer from lymph node biopsy, only 1 patient underwent diagnostic splenectomy. The immunophenotypes of bone marrow in patients and controls were analyzed by FCM, as a result, except for the healthy donors, varying degrees of abnormal mature B cell clones were found in bone marrow of all patients, and the further differentiation from other B-cell tumors was performed through CD5, CD10 expression and combination with other B-cell phenotype. All 6 cases of SMZL patients expressed CD19(+) and CD20(+), but CD10 expression was negative, 4 patients expressed CD5(-), 2 patients expressed CD5(+). The expressions of CD23, CD38, ZAP-70, CD11c, CD103, CD123, Cyclin D1 were negative. The morphological examination of bone marrow cells showed velutinous abnormal lymphocytes. Combined with clinical characteristics, 6 patients were diagnosed as SMZL, 1 patient suffered from splenectomy because of concurrent hypersplenism, and this postoperative pathologic examination confirmed the patient with SMZL. Ten cases of CLL mainly expressed CD5, CD23; 3 cases of HCL had more typical morphology of ""hair like"" in addition to CD11c, CD103 and CD123 positive; 3 cases of LPL/WM had significantly increased light chain restriction expression, IgM, plasmacytoid lymphocytes.

The K562 cells were divided into 3 groups:single drug-treated group, combined 2 drugs-treated group, group without drug treatment as control. The concentration of 5-aza-CdR were 0.5, 1, 2 micromol/L; the concentration of ATO was 1, 2.5, 5 micromol/L; the concentration of combined drugs was ATO 1 micromol/L + 5-aza-CdR 0.5 micromol/L, ATO 2.5 micromol/L + 5-aza-CdR 1 micromol/L, and ATO 5 micromol/L + 5-aza-CdR 2 micromol/L. The K562 cells were treated with above-mentioned concentration of drugs for 24, 48 and 72 hours, then the total RNA of cells was extracted, the JAK3, TYK2 and SHP-1 expressions were detected by real-time quantitative-PCR. The results showed that after the K562 cells were treated with ATO and 5-aza-CdR alone and their combination, the expression of SHP-1 mRNA increased, the expressions of JAK3 mRNA and TYK2 mRNA decreased along with increasing of concentration and prolonging of time, displaying the concentration and time-dependency. The SHP-1 negatively related with JAK3 and TYK2. The effect of SHP-1 on JAK3 was significantly higher than that on TYK2.

The 25 patients were given ATRA 20 mg orally twice a day and arsenic trioxide (ATO) 10 mg intravenously once a day to induce differentiation therapy, the chemotherapy was added after degranulation of promyelocytes. At the same time the platelets, fresh frozen plasma, fibrinogen, cryoprecipitate,prothrombin complex and amino methylbenzoic acid, low molecular weight heparin were given to treat DIC. According to the laboratorial examination of coagulation and fibrinolysis, the medication was adjusted.The white blood cell count, platelet level, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time of plasma (APTT), fibrinogen level were detected, and the relation of those factors and age with bleeding severity was analyzed by multivariate manner. The results showed that among 25 patients with APL (low-risk 5 cases, intermediate risk 13 cases and high risk 7 cases), 22 cases combined with DIC, incidence of DIC was 88%. Out of 22 patients with DIC 21 patients (95.5%) were corrected, except 1 case death. After the first course of treatment, 23 cases (92%) gained complete remission (CR) with average CR time 31.8 +/- 7.2 days. During the induction of CR, the average platelet transfusion level was 75.68 +/- 55.88 U, the RBC level was 8.90 +/- 5.69 U, the average level of fresh frozen plasma transfusion of APL patients with DIC was 21.92 +/- 19.32 U. The recovery time of platelet level to normal was 29.3 +/- 9.3 days, the recovery time of PT, APTT, FDP and fibrinogen to normal were 12.7 +/- 9.5 days, 11.6 +/- 8.6 days, 16.0 +/- 9.3 days and 125.3 +/- 85.3 days respectively. The multivariate analysis showed that WBC count at onset was >10 x 10(9)/L and APTT was prolonged. These two factors were main reasons resulting in severe bleeding. It is concluded that the newly diagnosed APL always combined with DIC, therefore in the early phase of disease active transfusion of blood products, application of anti-coagulation and anti-fibrinolytic drugs as well as heparin should be performed; the coagulation function should be as soon as recovered to normal so as to early correct DIC. These measures can significantly decrease the mortality of APL patients resulting from DIC.

Recent clinical and basic proofs indicated an improved treatment outcome by the combination of interferon and Imatinib. This study was purposed to evaluated systematically the efficacy and safety of interferon plus Imatinib in patients with CML. Data from relative clinical trials were from clinical trial of gov and Cochrane Collaboration. A comprehensive literature search was performed from data bases such as pubMed and EM. The results indicated that 7 clinical trials and 12 research papers met the criteria enrolled in study, included 697 cases in total. The combination group had higher complete cytogenetic remission (CCgR) rate than imatinib alone at 6 months (58% vs 42%; P = 0.0001) and 12 months (74% vs 68%; P = 0.004). The major molecular remission (MMR) rate was also higher in the combination group at 6 months (58% vs 34%; P = 0.0001) and 12 months (66% vs 47%; P < 0.0001). Furthermore, compared with single drug, the combination group had superior CMR rate at 6 months (13% vs 2%; P = 0.0002) and 12 months (14% vs 5%; P = 0.0009). The major adverse effects of combination therapy were rash, asthenia, edema and musculoskeletal events, and combination therapy was more prone to inducing neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and mild anemia. It is concluded that compared with Imatinib alone, the combination of interferon and Imatinib has better clinical efficacy in treating CML with earlier cytogenetic and molecular remission.

Four indexes were used to assess early response to treatment including response to prednisone on day 8 (D8-PR), percentage of lymphoblast in bone marrow on day 22 (D22-BM) and day 33 (D33-BM), the level of minimal residual disease (MRD) on day 33 (D33-MRD) by morphological and molecular biological method in 426 children with ALL. Prognostic impact of early response to treatment was analyzed, and multivariate analysis of the predictive value was performed by Cox-regression analysis. All patients were followed up until October 31, 2013, with a median follow-up time of 80 months (0.5 to 106 months). The results showed that there were significant differences between event free survivals (EFS) of the sub-groups divided according to the four indexes. The 8 years-EFS in patients with prednisone good response (PGR) was significantly higher than that in patients with prednisone poor response (PPR);patients with M1 in bone marrow on day 22 or day 33 had the better outcomes than that of patients with M2/M3;patients with high level of MRD ( >/= 10(-4)) had the worse outcomes as compared with patients with low level of MRD (<10(-4)) (P < 0.001). Cox proportional hazard model analysis showed that BCR/ABL fusion gene positive, D8-PR, D33-BM and D33-MRD were the independent prognostic factors for childhood ALL, and the hazard ratio of D33-MRD >/= 10(-2) was highest (HR:11.886, P < 0.001).

The plasmids combined with target gene as well as with internal reference were constructed, and the standard curves were set up by using above mentioned plasmids. The specificity of this detection system in cell lines was verified through techniques of MSP and quantitative MSP. The sensitivity of this detection system was verified by mixing methylation-positive and negative cell lines in varying proportions and through amplification of qualitative MSP. The results showed that the standard curves were establish successfully. The results of quantitative MS-PCR in cell lines were consistent with those of MS-PCR, and as low as 1: 10(-5) of ID4 methylation positive cells could be detected by the new methylation detection assay.

Quiescent, proliferating, and differentiating stem cells have different metabolism, and accordingly different amounts of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, ROS is not just a byproduct of metabolism, but also plays a role in stem cell state and function. RECENT ADVANCES: ROS levels are dynamic and reversibly dictate enhanced cycling and myeloid bias in ROS(high) short-term repopulating stem cells, and ROS(low) quiescent long-term repopulating stem cells. Low levels of ROS, regulated by intrinsic factors such as cell respiration or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase (NADPH oxidase) activity, or extrinsic factors such as stem cell factor or prostaglandin E2 are required for maintaining stem cell self-renewal. High ROS levels, due to stress and inflammation, induce stem cell differentiation and enhanced motility. CRITICAL ISSUES: Stem cells need to be protected from high ROS levels to avoid stem cell exhaustion, insufficient host immunity, and leukemic transformation that may occur during chronic inflammation.

Ultimately, balanced ROS levels are crucial for maintaining the small stem cell pool and host immunity, both in homeostasis and during stress situations.

TGF-beta1 is expressed in fibrotic lung and promotes fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation (FMD) as well as matrix deposition. METHODS: To identify the mechanism of Arsenic trioxide's (ATO)'s anti-fibrotic effect in vitro, normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) were treated with ATO for 24 hours and were then exposed to TGF-beta1 (1 ng/ml) before harvesting at multiple time points. To investigate whether ATO is able to alleviate lung fibrosis in vivo, C57BL/6 mice were administered bleomycin by oropharyngeal aspiration and ATO was injected intraperitoneally daily for 14 days. Quantitative real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescent staining were used to assess the expression of fibrotic markers such as alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and alpha-1 type I collagen. RESULTS: Treatment of NHLFs with ATO at very low concentrations (10-20nM) inhibits TGF-beta1-induced alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and alpha-1 type I collagen mRNA and protein expression. ATO also diminishes the TGF-beta1-mediated contractile response in NHLFs. ATO's down-regulation of profibrotic molecules is associated with inhibition of Akt, as well as Smad2/Smad3 phosphorylation. TGF-beta1-induced H2O2 and NOX-4 mRNA expression are also blocked by ATO. ATO-mediated reduction in Smad3 phosphorylation correlated with a reduction of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies and PML protein expression. PML-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) showed decreased fibronectin and PAI-1 expression in response to TGF-beta1. Daily intraperitoneal injection of ATO (1 mg/kg) in C57BL/6 mice inhibits bleomycin induced lung alpha-1 type I collagen mRNA and protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, these data indicate that low concentrations of ATO inhibit TGF-beta1-induced fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation and decreases bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis.",,"['Luo, Fayong', 'Zhuang, Yan', 'Sides, Mark D', 'Sanchez, Cecilia G', 'Shan, Bin', 'White, Eric S', 'Lasky, Joseph A']","['Luo F', 'Zhuang Y', 'Sides MD', 'Sanchez CG', 'Shan B', 'White ES', 'Lasky JA']","['Department of Medicine, Section of Pulmonary Diseases, Critical Care and Environmental Medicine, Tulane University Health Science Center, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA. jlasky@tulane.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140424,England,Respir Res,Respiratory research,101090633,IM,"['Animals', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/antagonists & inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Cell Transdifferentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibroblasts/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lung/drug effects/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myofibroblasts/drug effects/*pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/chemically induced/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology']",,,2014/04/26 06:00,2014/10/07 06:00,['2014/04/26 06:00'],"['2013/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1465-9921-15-51 [pii]', '10.1186/1465-9921-15-51 [doi]']",epublish,Respir Res. 2014 Apr 24;15:51. doi: 10.1186/1465-9921-15-51.,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,PMC4113202,"['P20 GM103629/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL085083/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL111016/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By comparing microarray data from multiple model systems, we identified HBP1 (high-mobility group-box protein 1) as a novel downstream target of this pathway. HBP1 mRNA was down-regulated by PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor), FGF (fibroblast growth factor), PI3K and PKB, whereas it was up-regulated by FOXO factors. This observation was confirmed in human and murine fibroblasts as well as in cell lines derived from leukaemia, breast adenocarcinoma and colon carcinoma. Bioinformatics analysis led to the identification of a conserved consensus FOXO-binding site in the HBP1 promoter. By luciferase activity assay and ChIP, we demonstrated that FOXO bound to this site and regulated the HBP1 promoter activity in a PI3K-dependent manner. Silencing of HBP1 by shRNA increased the proliferation of human fibroblasts in response to growth factors, suggesting that HBP1 limits cell growth. Finally, by analysing a transcriptomics dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we observed that HBP1 expression was lower in breast tumours that had lost FOXO expression.

The EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) that occurs during normal development and malignant progression is a typical example of the phenotypic switch associated with profound actin remodelling and changes in gene expression. For instance, actin dynamics control motile cell functions in EMT, in part, through regulating the subcellular localization of the myocardin-related transcription factor MKL1 (megakaryoblastic leukaemia translocation 1), a co-activator of SRF (serum-responsive factor). In the present paper, we show that MKL1 participates also to the control of the cellular switch between growth and quiescence. Experimental disconnection between MKL1 and G-actin (globular actin), by using an MKL1 mutant or enhancing the F (filamentous)-/G-actin ratio, generates a widely open chromatin state and a global increase in biosynthetic activity, classically associated with cell growth. Conversely, G-actin accumulation favours nuclear condensation and cell quiescence. These large-scale chromatin changes rely upon extensive histone modifications, exemplified by that of H3K9 (H3 Lys9) shifting from trimethylation, a heterochromatin mark, to acetylation, a mark of euchromatin. The present study provides the first evidence for a global reversible hetero/euchromatinization phenomenon triggered by the actin/MKL1 signalling pathway.",,"['Flouriot, Gilles', 'Huet, Guillaume', 'Demay, Florence', 'Pakdel, Farzad', 'Boujrad, Noureddine', 'Michel, Denis']","['Flouriot G', 'Huet G', 'Demay F', 'Pakdel F', 'Boujrad N', 'Michel D']","['*University of Rennes 1, Institut de Recherche en Sante, Environnement et Travail, IRSET, INSERM U1085, Team TREC, Biosit, Rennes, France.', '*University of Rennes 1, Institut de Recherche en Sante, Environnement et Travail, IRSET, INSERM U1085, Team TREC, Biosit, Rennes, France.', '*University of Rennes 1, Institut de Recherche en Sante, Environnement et Travail, IRSET, INSERM U1085, Team TREC, Biosit, Rennes, France.', '*University of Rennes 1, Institut de Recherche en Sante, Environnement et Travail, IRSET, INSERM U1085, Team TREC, Biosit, Rennes, France.', '*University of Rennes 1, Institut de Recherche en Sante, Environnement et Travail, IRSET, INSERM U1085, Team TREC, Biosit, Rennes, France.', '*University of Rennes 1, Institut de Recherche en Sante, Environnement et Travail, IRSET, INSERM U1085, Team TREC, Biosit, Rennes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Actins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin/chemistry', '*Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Histones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators']",,,2014/04/26 06:00,2014/08/19 06:00,['2014/04/26 06:00'],"['2014/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['BJ20131240 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20131240 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2014 Jul 15;461(2):257-68. doi: 10.1042/BJ20131240.,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (MRTFA protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Atypical lymphocytes with irregular nuclei were observed in the peripheral blood. An open biopsy of the thyroid provided pathological evidence of T-PLL, and bone marrow examination showed infiltration by T-PLL. The diagnosis was therefore infiltration of the thyroid gland by T-PLL. Chemotherapy was initiated, but six months after termination, recurrence of neck swelling was observed. The patient was then treated with radiotherapy, but she died of a major stroke 15 months after onset.

This retrospective cohort study of 548 adults with SM diagnosed 1997-2010 was constructed using linked Danish national health registries. The most common subtype of mastocytosis was indolent SM (including urticaria pigmentosa) (n = 450; 82%), followed by SM with subtype unknown (n = 61; 11%), SM with associated clonal haematological non-mast cell lineage disease (n = 24; 4%), aggressive SM (n = 8; 2%), and mast cell leukaemia (n = 5; 1%). The incidence rate for SM (all subtypes including urticaria pigmentosa) was 0.89 per 100 000 per year. Cumulative incidence was 12.46 per 100 000, and the 14-year limited-duration prevalence as of 1 January, 2011 was 9.59 per 100 000.

We have earlier reported an increased expression of the TP53 encoded protein p53, in bone marrow samples from pediatric patients with aggressive leukemia. Our aim was now to evaluate p53 protein expression at different time points before and after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as a predictor of relapse in a group of children diagnosed with MDS, JMML and CML, and also investigate if potential alterations in expression could be correlated to mutations in TP53. PROCEDURE: Paraffin embedded bone marrow samples from 33 pediatric patients diagnosed with MDS, JMML and CML between 1997 and 2010 were collected retrospectively from time of diagnosis and pre and post HSCT. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on tissue microarrays (TMA) with antibodies to p53 and p21. DNA sequencing of exon 2-11 of TP53 was performed in 7 patients with JMML and 5 patients with MDS. RESULTS: Elevated p53 protein expression at diagnosis predicted for relapse, odds ratio (OR) 1.19 (95% CI: 1.02-1.40, p = .028). Sequencing of TP53 did not reveal any mutations in the 12 patients analyzed and p53 expression correlated positively to p21 expression indicating a functional p53/p21 protein pathway.

So far, no curative therapy is available for affected patients. We have identified the cell surface antigen CD52 (CAMPATH-1) as a molecular target expressed abundantly on the surface of primary neoplastic mast cells (MCs) in patients with advanced SM. In contrast, neoplastic MCs of patients with indolent SM and normal MCs expressed only low levels or did not express CD52. To study the mechanisms of CD52 expression and the value of this antigen as a potential therapeutic target, we generated a human MC cell line, designated MCPV-1, by lentiviral immortalization of cord blood-derived MC progenitor cells. Functional studies revealed that activated RAS profoundly promotes surface expression of CD52. The CD52-targeting antibody alemtuzumab induced cell death in CD52(+) primary neoplastic MCs obtained from patients with SM as well as in MCPV-1 cells.

METHODS: A population-based cohort of children treated for AML according to the NOPHO-AML-84, -88, and -93 trials included 138 eligible survivors of whom 102 (74%) completed a questionnaire and 104 (75%) had a clinical examination and blood sampling performed. Eighty-five of 94 (90%) eligible sibling controls completed a similar questionnaire. Siblings had no clinical examination or blood sampling performed. RESULTS: At a median of 11 years (range 4-25) after diagnosis, renal, gastrointestinal, and hepatic disorders were rare both in survivors of childhood AML and in sibling controls, with no significant differences. Ferritin was elevated in 21 (21%) AML survivors but none had biochemical signs of liver damage. Viral hepatitis was present in three and cholelithiasis in two AML survivors. One adult survivor had hypertension, two had slightly elevated systolic blood pressure, and eight survivors had slightly elevated diastolic blood pressure. These persons all had normal creatinine and cystatin C levels. Marginal abnormalities in potassium, magnesium, calcium, or bicarbonate levels were found in 34 survivors. CONCLUSION: Survivors of childhood AML treated with chemotherapy only experienced few renal, gastrointestinal, and hepatic late effects.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Skou, Anne-Sofie', 'Glosli, Heidi', 'Jahnukainen, Kirsi', 'Jarfelt, Marianne', 'Jonmundsson, Guethmundur K', 'Malmros-Svennilson, Johan', 'Nysom, Karsten', 'Hasle, Henrik']","['Skou AS', 'Glosli H', 'Jahnukainen K', 'Jarfelt M', 'Jonmundsson GK', 'Malmros-Svennilson J', 'Nysom K', 'Hasle H']","['Department of Paediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140424,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/*chemically induced/diagnosis/mortality', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kidney Diseases/*chemically induced/diagnosis/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Liver Diseases/diagnosis/*etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'children', 'gastrointestinal', 'hepatic', 'late effects', 'renal']",2014/04/25 06:00,2014/11/19 06:00,['2014/04/25 06:00'],"['2014/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25069 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Sep;61(9):1638-43. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25069.

An intriguing aspect of IDH-mutant tumors is the aberrant production and accumulation of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which may play a pivotal oncogenic role in these malignancies. We describe the first reported case of an IDH1 p.R132L mutation in a patient with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast adenocarcinoma. This patient was initially treated for locally advanced disease, but then suffered a relapse and metastasis, at which point an IDH1-R132 mutation was discovered in an affected lymph node. The mutation was subsequently found in the primary tumor tissue and all metastatic sites, but not in an uninvolved lymph node. In addition, the patient's serum and urine displayed marked elevations in the concentration of 2-HG, significantly higher than that measured in six other patients with metastatic HR+ breast carcinoma whose tumors were found to harbor wild-type IDH1. In summary, IDH1 mutations may impact a rare subgroup of patients with breast adenocarcinoma. This may suggest future avenues for disease monitoring through noninvasive measurement of 2-HG, as well as for the development and study of targeted therapies against the aberrant IDH1 enzyme.",['(c)AlphaMed Press.'],"['Fathi, Amir T', 'Sadrzadeh, Hossein', 'Comander, Amy H', 'Higgins, Michaela J', 'Bardia, Aditya', 'Perry, Ashley', 'Burke, Meghan', 'Silver, Regina', 'Matulis, Christina R', 'Straley, Kimberly S', 'Yen, Katharine E', 'Agresta, Sam', 'Kim, Hyeryun', 'Schenkein, David P', 'Borger, Darrell R']","['Fathi AT', 'Sadrzadeh H', 'Comander AH', 'Higgins MJ', 'Bardia A', 'Perry A', 'Burke M', 'Silver R', 'Matulis CR', 'Straley KS', 'Yen KE', 'Agresta S', 'Kim H', 'Schenkein DP', 'Borger DR']","['Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA afathi@partners.org.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140423,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/blood/*genetics/pathology/urine', 'Breast Neoplasms/blood/*genetics/pathology/urine', 'Female', 'Glutarates/blood/urine', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms, Hormone-Dependent/blood/*genetics/pathology/urine']",['NOTNLM'],"['2-Hydroxyglutarate', 'Breast adenocarcinoma', 'Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1', 'Targeted therapy']",2014/04/25 06:00,2015/02/13 06:00,['2014/04/25 06:00'],"['2014/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['theoncologist.2013-0417 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2013-0417 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2014 Jun;19(6):602-7. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2013-0417.

Osteolineage cells are derived from mesenchymal progenitor cells, and differentiate into several types of bone-forming cells. Of the various types of cell constituents in bone marrow, osteolineage cells have been shown to play important roles in hematopoiesis. Early studies have identified osteoblasts as a hematopoietic stem cell niche component. Since that time, the role of endosteal microenvironment as a critical regulator of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSC/HPC) behavior has been appreciated particularly under stress conditions, such as cytokine-induced HSC/HPC mobilization, homing/engraftment after bone marrow transplantation, and disease models of leukemia/myelodysplasia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 47 patients with clinically proven leukemia involving the abdominal and pelvic lymph nodes. Of these 47 patients, 10 had acute myeloid leukemia, 9 had acute lymphocytic leukemia, and 28 had chronic lymphocytic leukemia. MDCT was used to determine lymph node features such as morphology, growth patterns, size, enhancement patterns, anatomical distribution, and manifestations in extramedullary organs. RESULTS: Incidence of leukemia was higher in men than in women. Enlarged lymph nodes were more frequently conglomerated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (96.4%) than in acute myeloid leukemia (50%) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (55.6%; P < 0.05 for both). Lymph nodes associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia were larger than those associated with acute myeloid and lymphocytic leukemias (P < 0.05 for both). The enlarged lymph nodes appeared homogeneous (80.9%) and homogeneous mixed with peripheral (19.1%). No statistically significant differences were observed between the three types of leukemias with respect to enhancement patterns (all P > 0.05). The lymph nodes commonly associated with these three leukemias were located in the lesser omentum, upper and lower para-aortic regions, and groin region.

The macaque had an 8-month history of gradual weight loss and increasing lymphocytosis. Most of the lymphocytes present were small to medium and had a mature morphology. Based on the degree and duration of the lymphocytosis, and the appearance of the lymphocytes, a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia was made. The animal tested negative for 4 viral diseases that are commonly associated with lymphoproliferative disorders in Old World monkeys. Over the course of 12 months, the lymphocytosis progressed from 18.4 to 384 x 10(3) lymphocytes/microl (reference range: 0.8-17 x 10(3) cells/microl), and euthanasia was elected. On histologic examination, cluster of differentiation (CD)3- and CD8-positive, CD79-negative neoplastic cells comprised 40-60% of the bone marrow, diffusely obscured the normal splenic architecture, and were present in the vascular channels in other organs.

Here we proposed a novel combination regimen, a co-administration of S116836, a novel small molecule multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that was synthesized by rational design, and histone deacetylases inhibitor (HDACi) suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), to overcome IM resistance in CML. S116836 at low concentrations used in the present study mildly downregulates auto-tyrosine phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl. SAHA, an FDA-approved HDACi drug, at 1 muM has modest anti-tumor activity in treating CML. However, we found a synergistic interaction between SAHA and S116836 in Bcr-Abl-positive CML cells that were sensitive or resistant to IM. Exposure of KBM5 and KBM5-T315I cells to minimal or non-toxic concentrations of SAHA and S116836 synergistically reduced cell viability and induced cell death. Co-treatment with SAHA and S116838 repressed the expressions of anti-apoptosis proteins, such as Mcl-1 and XIAP, but promoted Bim expression and mitochondrial damage. Of importance, treatment with both drugs significantly reduced cell viability of primary human CML cells, as compared with either agent alone. Taken together, our findings suggest that SAHA exerts synergistically with S116836 at a non-toxic concentration to promote apoptosis in the CML, including those resistant to imatinib or dasatinib.",,"['Bu, Qiangui', 'Cui, Lijing', 'Li, Juan', 'Du, Xin', 'Zou, Waiyi', 'Ding, Ke', 'Pan, Jingxuan']","['Bu Q', 'Cui L', 'Li J', 'Du X', 'Zou W', 'Ding K', 'Pan J']","['Department of Pathophysiology; Zhongshan School of Medicine; Sun Yat-sen University; Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology; Zhongshan School of Medicine; Sun Yat-sen University; Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology; The First Affiliated Hospital; Sun Yat-sen University; Guangzhou, PR China.', ""Department of Hematology; Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital; Guangzhou, PR China."", 'Department of Hematology; The First Affiliated Hospital; Sun Yat-sen University; Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology and Institute of Chemical Biology; Guangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology; Zhongshan School of Medicine; Sun Yat-sen University; Guangzhou, PR China; State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology; Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center; Sun Yat-sen University; Guangzhou, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China; Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center; Guangzhou, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140423,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'Vorinostat']",['NOTNLM'],"['Bcr-Abl', 'CML', 'S116836', 'T315I mutation', 'apoptosis', 'imatinib', 'resistance', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2014/04/25 06:00,2015/02/14 06:00,['2014/04/25 06:00'],"['2014/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['28931 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.28931 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2014 Jul;15(7):951-62. doi: 10.4161/cbt.28931.

METHODS: Immunophenotyping of bone marrow and (or) of peripheral blood was performed in patients with B-LPD by four color multiparameter flow cytometry analysis using a panel of monoclonal antibodies, and the patients clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. The difference in immunophenotypes and the related clinical features were retrospectively analyzed. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for t(11;14) detection was applied to diagnose or exclude mantle cell lymphoma. RESULTS: (1)A total 260 CD5(+) B-LPD patients were enrolled in this study, including 186 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 40 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), other B-LPD including 5 splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), 2 B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL), 3 hairy cell leukemia (HCL). The other 26 cases (10%)were not classified and defined as unclassified B-LPD (BLPD-U). MCL patients were all positive for t(11;14) detected by FISH, while all the BLPD-U patients were negative for t(11;14). (2) All patients expressed CD19, CD20 and CD5. According to the immunophenotypic score system, 186 CLL patients scored 4-5, 99.5% of patients with CD23(+), 11.3% with sIgM(+), 10.2% with FMC7(+), 44.1% with CD22(+) and 51.1% with CD11c(+). MCL patients scored 2-3, with 50% expressing CD23 and sIgM, 81.6% expressing FMC7, 92.1% expressing CD22 and 5.3% expressing CD11c. In aspect of BLPD-U and other B-LPD, the expression of CD23, sIgM, FMC7, CD22 and CD11c were 73.1% and 50%, 34.6% and 50%, 88.5% and 100%, 92.3% and 90%, 69.2% and 70%, respectively. (3)In comparison of CLL with MCL, there was a significant difference in the expression of CD23, sIgM, FMC7, CD22 and CD11c between the two groups (P<0.01). Between MCL and BLPD-U, similar expression type of CD23, sIgM, FMC7 and CD22 was found except CD11c, which was highly expressed in BLPD-U (P<0.001). The difference of CD11c expression was also statistically significant between MCL and other B-LPD (P<0.01). In comparison of MCL with other B-LPD, there was a significant difference in the expression of CD11c (P<0.01). The expression of CD23 and sIgM in MCL are 7%-21% and 82%-100% respectively in Western population, while the expression of other immunophenotypic markers is similar with our study.

METHODS: Thirty LBL patients in complete remission received ASCT from 1996 to 2012 in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: (1)Of the 30 patients, 25 were T-LBL and 5 B-LBL with a median age of 19(7-53) years old. Ratio of male to female is 23:7. Fourteen (46.7%) patients presented with bulky mediastinal masses and 15(50.0%) with bone marrow involvement. The distribution of stages was 2(6.7%), 5(16.7%) and 23 (76.6%)patients with stages II, III, and IV, respectively. The distribution according to age-adjusted international prognostic index (aaIPI) was 5(16.7%) patients in 1 score, 14(46.6%) in 2 scores and 11(36.7%) in 3 scores. (2)At a median follow-up of 32(range, 10-171) months, 17 patients were alive and 13 relapsed and died from LBL after ASCT. The estimated 5-year probability of DFS and OS was (50.4+/-10.7) % and (53.9 +/-10.2)% for all the patients. (3)According to the treatment regimens before ASCT, the patients were divided into NHL-type group (n=12) and ALL-type group (n=18). In NHL-type group, 9 patients relapsed and died, the estimated 5-year probability of DFS and OS was (22.2 +/-12.8) % and (33.3 +/-13.6) %, respectively. Median DFS and OS time were 24 months and 36 months. In ALL-type group, 4 patients relapsed and died from lymphoma, the estimated 5-year probability of DFS and OS was (77.8 +/- 9.8) % and (77.8 +/- 9.8) %, respectively. Median DFS and OS time were not reached. For DFS and OS, ALL-type group were better than that of NHL-type group and the difference was significant (P=0.022 and P=0.049).

Some studies suggest a seasonal pattern, since most of the cases are registered during summer. Our objective was to estimate the relationship between the different subtypes of acute leukemia with the age when the disease arose, and the season of the year. METHODS: Retrospective and observational study, based on records of a hematology department from January 2006 to April 2012. Only the patients diagnosed with de novo acute leukemia, stratified according to the French-American-British classification, were included. Seasonal analysis was performed using Edward's periodic model. RESULTS: The study included 833 acute leukemia cases: 48 % of women (400), and 52 % of men (433). Median age was 36.2 +/- 19.8 years. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia predominated over acute myeloblastic leukemia subtype M4 (p < 0.05), and we found differences (p < 0.01) between lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemias: 32.3 and 41.8. Despite the existence of pronounced peaks in the time series, they did not repeat periodically. CONCLUSIONS: The most common variety of acute leukemia was lymphoblastic type L2, followed by myeloblastic type M4. People over 40 years of age were the most affected.

The tests were conducted at the Pacific Proving Grounds and the Nevada Test Site. Dose estimates to specific organs will be used in an epidemiological study to investigate leukemia and male breast cancer. Previous doses had been estimated for the purpose of compensation and were generally high-sided to favor the veteran's claim for compensation in accordance with public law. Recent efforts by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to digitize the historical records supporting the veterans' compensation assessments make it possible to calculate doses and associated uncertainties. Our approach builds upon available film badge dosimetry and other measurement data recorded at the time of the tests and incorporates detailed scenarios of exposure for each veteran based on personal, unit, and other available historical records. Film badge results were available for approximately 25% of the individuals, and these results assisted greatly in reconstructing doses to unbadged persons and in developing distributions of dose among military units.

METHODS: We quantified E2F3a expression at diagnosis in 148 children with ALL by real-time PCR. In the test cohort (n = 48), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to find the best cut-off point to divide the patients into E2F3a low- and high-expression groups. The prognostic significance of E2F3a expression was investigated in the test cohort and confirmed in the validation cohort (n = 100). The correlations of E2F3a expression with the clinical features and treatment outcome of these patients were analyzed. RESULTS: ROC curve analysis indicated that the best cut-off point of E2F3a expression was 0.3780. In the test cohort, leukemia-free survival (LFS) and event-free survival (EFS) of the low-expression group were lower than those of the high-expression group (log rank: P = 0.026 for both). This finding was verified in the validation cohort. LFS, EFS, and overall survival were also lower in the low-expression group than in the high-expression group (log rank, P = 0.015, 0.008, and 0.002 respectively). E2F3a low expression was correlated with the existence of BCR-ABL fusion. An algorithm composed of E2F3a expression and minimal residual disease (MRD) could predict relapse or induction failure more precisely than current risk stratification.

It is believed that SRF can toggle between disparate programs of gene expression through association with different cofactors. However, the direct evidence as to how these factors function on a genome-wide level is still lacking. RESULTS: In the present study, I explored the functions of SRF and its representative cofactors, megakaryoblastic leukemia 1/2 (MKL1/2) and ETS-domain protein 4 (ELK4), during fungal infection challenge in macrophages. The knockdown study, combined with gene expression array analysis, revealed that MKL1/2 regulated SRF-dependent genes were related to actin cytoskeleton organization, while ELK4 regulated SRF-dependent genes were related to external stimulus responses. Subsequent chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) suggested that many of these regulations were mediated directly in cis. CONCLUSIONS: I conclude that SRF utilizes MKL1/2 to fulfill steady state cellular functions, including cytoskeletal organization, and utilizes ELK4 to facilitate acute responses to external infection. Together, these findings indicate that SRF, along with its two cofactors, are important players in both cellular homeostasis and stress responses in macrophages.",,"['Xie, Lan']",['Xie L'],"['Medical Systems Biology Research Center, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tsinghua University School of Medicine, Beijing 100084, China. xielan@tsinghua.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140423,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Nucleotide Motifs', 'Position-Specific Scoring Matrices', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Serum Response Factor/*genetics', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Zymosan/pharmacology', 'ets-Domain Protein Elk-4/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2014/04/25 06:00,2014/11/19 06:00,['2014/04/25 06:00'],"['2014/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-15-301 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-15-301 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2014 Apr 23;15:301. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-15-301.,"['0 (Elk4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mrtfa protein, mouse)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (myocardin-like protein 2, mouse)', '146481-62-1 (ets-Domain Protein Elk-4)', '9010-72-4 (Zymosan)']",,PMC4023608,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much of what we know today about the structure and function, as well as the evolution and pathogenic potential, of ERVs was fleshed out over several decades during the last century using the avian leukosis virus subgroup E-related (ALVE) family of endogenous retroviruses of chickens as a model system. A critical enabling factor in the elucidation of ALVE structure and function is the ability to detect and unambiguously identify specific ALVE proviral elements and to develop accurate element profiles for individual chickens under study. Currently, the most common approach for ALVE locus detection involves element-specific PCR assays carried out using primers that target host DNA near the insertion site of the provirus (i.e., the upstream and downstream flanks of the unoccupied site). Here we describe a new approach for proviral detection that exploits restriction enzyme sites in flanking DNA to develop ALVE element profiles more rapidly than with assays currently in use.

GBMs display a deregulated apoptotic pathway with high levels of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins and overt activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. Therefore, combined interference of the PI3K pathway and the Bcl-2 family of proteins is a reasonable therapeutic strategy. ABT-263 (Navitoclax), an orally available small-molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor, and GDC-0941, a PI3K inhibitor, were used to treat established glioblastoma and glioblastoma neurosphere cells, alone or in combination. Although GDC-0941 alone had a modest effect on cell viability, treatment with ABT-263 displayed a marked reduction of cell viability and induction of apoptotic cell death. Moreover, combinatorial therapy using ABT-263 and GDC-0941 showed an enhanced effect, with a further decrease in cellular viability. Furthermore, combination treatment abrogated the ability of stem cell-like glioma cells to form neurospheres. ABT-263 and GDC-0941, in combination, resulted in a consistent and significant increase of Annexin V positive cells and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential compared with either monotherapy. The combination treatment led to enhanced cleavage of both initiator and effector caspases. Mechanistically, GDC-0941 depleted pAKT (Serine 473) levels and suppressed Mcl-1 protein levels, lowering the threshold for the cytotoxic actions of ABT-263. GDC-0941 decreased Mcl-1 in a posttranslational manner and significantly decreased the half-life of Mcl-1 protein.

Regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are increased in AML patients, can contribute to immune evasion by residual leukemic cells. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a pro-inflammatory cytokine present at high levels within patients, can induce TNF receptor-2 (TNFR2) expression on Tregs. We hypothesized that since TNFR2 is required for Treg stabilization and TNFR2+ Tregs are potent suppressors, targeting TNFR2+ Tregs may restore the effectiveness of immune-surveillance mechanisms. In this pilot study, we report AML patients in clinical remission have substantially increased levels of TNFR2+ T cells, including TNFR2+ Tregs and impaired effector CD4 T cell function with reduced IL-2 and IFNgamma production. The immunomodulatory drug, lenalidomide, and the demethylating agent, azacitidine have been moderately successful in treating AML patients, but their combined effects on TNFR2+ T cells, including Tregs are currently unknown. Our data indicates that although treatment with lenalidomide and azacitidine increased cytokine production by effector T cells in all patients, durable clinical remissions may be observed in patients with a concomitant reduction in TNFR2+ T cells and TNFR2+ Tregs. In vitro studies further demonstrated that lenalidomide can reduce TNFR2 expression and can augment effector cytokine production by T cells, which can be further enhanced by azacitidine. These results indicate that reduction of TNFR2+ T cells in AML postremission phase may result from combined azacitidine/lenalidomide therapy and may contribute to an improved clinical outcome.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Govindaraj, Chindu', 'Madondo, Mutsa', 'Kong, Ying Ying', 'Tan, Peter', 'Wei, Andrew', 'Plebanski, Magdalena']","['Govindaraj C', 'Madondo M', 'Kong YY', 'Tan P', 'Wei A', 'Plebanski M']","['Department of Immunology, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140516,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",,,2014/04/24 06:00,2014/09/05 06:00,['2014/04/24 06:00'],"['2013/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23746 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2014 Aug;89(8):795-802. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23746.

Due to occurring intolerance and resistance against the drug, developing newer inhibitors was promoted. This led to the second-generation inhibitors dasatinib, nilotinib and bosutinib. Despite all achieved improvement, all first- and second-generation inhibitors are ineffective against the BCR-ABL T315I ""gatekeeper"" mutation. In order to overcome this issue and to further improve the inhibitory effect, the third-generation inhibitor ponatinib was developed. Various clinical trials have been launched to study the effect of ponatinib in the clinical setting. Based on positive phase 1 and phase 2 trials, ponatinib was approved for the second-line treatment of CML and Ph+ ALL in December 2012 in the United States and in July 2013 in the European Union. Further trials investigate the potential effect of ponatinib in kinase-dependent subgroups of other malignancies. In conclusion, ponatinib has proved to be a powerful BCR-ABL inhibitor, which exhibits clinical activity both in BCR-ABL wild-type and mutant CML, including activity against the T315I mutation.

In addition, the BCR-ABL fusion gene product, a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase which is crucial for the development of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), is highly sensitive to bosutinib. Interestingly, distinctly lower concentrations of bosutinib are required to ablate BCR-ABL phosphorylation when compared to the first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (IM). Bosutinib is a potent inhibitor of CML cell proliferation in vitro and has demonstrated promising activity in CML patients resistant or intolerant to IM as well as in newly diagnosed patients with chronic phase CML (CML-CP). Remarkably, bosutinib has been found to be capable of overcoming the majority of IM-resistant BCR-ABL mutations. Bosutinib has the potency to induce deep and fast responses in second- and third-/fourth-line treatment, and as a consequence, the drug has recently been licensed for patients previously treated with one or more tyrosine kinase inhibitor(s) and for whom imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib are not considered appropriate treatment options. Due to its potency and differing toxicity profile, it promises to be a good therapeutic option for a defined cohort of patients. The most common side effects are gastrointestinal with most of the patients suffering from nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. For the most part, these gastrointestinal symptoms occur early after treatment initiation, are manageable, and often self-limiting. Continuous monitoring of liver enzymes upon treatment initiation is necessary during bosutinib treatment. In addition to CML treatment, bosutinib has shown some efficacy in selected patients suffering from advanced-stage solid tumors.

Randomized trial data in CML show that first-line dasatinib provides superior responses compared with imatinib and enables patients to achieve early, deep responses, correlated with improved longer-term outcomes. A once-daily dose of 100 mg in chronic phase CML results in high hematologic and molecular remission rates and prolongation of survival. In accelerated and blastic phase of CML, as well as in Ph+ ALL, complete hematologic and cytogenetic remissions frequently occur. Remissions however are very short. In these patients, once-daily 140 mg is the recommended dose. The effect of dasatinib in other malignancies including solid tumors is subject of clinical studies. Regardless of many clinical trials in different tumor types and in different combinations of dasatinib with other agents, the role of dasatinib in the treatment of solid tumors has not yet been defined.

They have a high selectivity against a specific molecular target known to be the cause for the establishment and maintenance of the malignant phenotype. Imatinib is a rationally designed oral signal transduction inhibitor that specifically targets several protein tyrosine kinases, Abl, Arg (Abl-related gene), the stem cell factor receptor (c-KIT), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R), and their oncogenic forms, most notably BCR-ABL. Imatinib has been shown to have remarkable clinical activity in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and malignant gastrointestinal stroma tumors (GIST) leading to its approval for treatment of these diseases. Treatment with imatinib is generally well tolerated with a low incidence of severe side effects. The most common adverse events include mild to moderate edema, muscle cramps, diarrhea, nausea, skin rashes, and myelosuppression. Several mechanisms of resistance have been identified. Clonal evolution, amplification, or overexpression of BCR-ABL as well as mutations in the catalytic domain, P-loop, and other mutations have been demonstrated to play a role in primary and secondary resistance to imatinib, respectively. Understanding of the underlying mechanisms of resistance has led to the development of new second- and third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (see chapters on dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib).",,"['Waller, Cornelius F']",['Waller CF'],"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Hugstetter Street 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany, cornelius.waller@uniklinik-freiburg.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Recent Results Cancer Res,Recent results in cancer research.

In this study, we investigated the role of ATO in regulating the invasive activity of HCC after transarterial embolization (TAE). METHODS: Cell migration and invasion were observed using Transwell and wound-healing assay. The molecular changes in E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin of surviving tumor cells were determined by Western blotting. The effects of ATO on Twist activity of the tumor cells were further analyzed. In animal study, 40 male buffalo rats implanted with McA-RH7777 tumor in the liver were randomly divided into four groups: control, TAE, ATO, and TAE + ATO. TAE procedures were performed on the 14th day after implantation. Lung metastases were observed using fluorescence imaging, and the molecular changes in residual tumor cells were evaluated by Western blotting or immunohistochemistry. Tumor growth and survival analysis were also evaluated. RESULTS: Arsenic trioxide markedly reduced cell migration and invasiveness, which were enhanced by hypoxia after TAE. Western blot analysis revealed ATO inhibited the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers by suppressing Twist. The marked suppression effect of ATO on invasiveness and metastatic potential related to EMT was also shown in tissue. CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrated that ATO is an effective anticancer agent in combination with TAE in the treatment of HCC, by suppressing tumor progression and metastasis via selectively inducing tumor cell apoptosis and arresting EMT by inhibiting the Twist activation.",,"['Wang, Guang-Zhi', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Fang, Zhu-Ting', 'Zhang, Wen', 'Yang, Min-Jie', 'Yang, Guo-Wei', 'Li, Shuo', 'Zhu, Lian', 'Wang, Li-Li', 'Zhang, Wei-Sheng', 'Liu, Rong', 'Qian, Sheng', 'Wang, Jian-Hua', 'Qu, Xu-Dong']","['Wang GZ', 'Zhang W', 'Fang ZT', 'Zhang W', 'Yang MJ', 'Yang GW', 'Li S', 'Zhu L', 'Wang LL', 'Zhang WS', 'Liu R', 'Qian S', 'Wang JH', 'Qu XD']","['Department of Intervention Radiology, Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University, No. 180 Fenglin Road, Xuhui, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140423,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy/secondary', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Embolization, Therapeutic/*adverse effects', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*prevention & control/secondary', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BUF', 'Twist-Related Protein 1/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2014/04/24 06:00,2014/08/05 06:00,['2014/04/24 06:00'],"['2013/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-014-1659-6 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2014 Jul;140(7):1125-36. doi: 10.1007/s00432-014-1659-6.

Emerging evidence shows that drug resistance not only exists against conventional chemotherapeutic drugs, but also limits the efficacy of new biological agents. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the mechanisms through which AML patients develop drug resistance. MicroRNAs have been shown to play an important role in regulating the chemotherapy resistance in AML. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms of microRNA that are clinically relevant in AML may enhance our ability to predict and overcome drug resistance. Here, we demonstrated, for the first time, that miR-181b was decreased significantly in human multidrug-resistant leukemia cells and relapsed/refractory AML patient samples. Overexpression of miR-181b increased the sensitivity of leukemia cells to cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents and promoted drug-induced apoptosis. Moreover, miR-181b inhibited HMGB1 and Mcl-1 expression by direct binding to their 3'-untranslated regions. In addition, HMGB1 was expressed at high levels in relapsed/refractory AML patients and suppression of HMGB1 via RNA interference sensitized multidrug-resistant leukemia cells to chemotherapy and induced apoptosis.

AIM: The aim of the authors was to analyse the outcome of treatment in their patients with acute myeloid leukemia. METHOD: From 2007 to 2013, 173 patients with acute myeloid leukemia were treated. Patients were classified according to the European LeukemiaNet prognostic guideline. Association between mortality and the type of acute myeloid leukemia (secondary or primary), dose of daunoblastin at induction of treatment, and the rate of minimal residual disease were investigated. RESULTS: The 5-year survival probability was 25% in young adults and 2% in the elderly. The survival was significantly influenced by these prognostic factors. The 5-year survival rate was 50% in the young, favorable prognostic group. The 90 mg/m2 daunoblastin dose was found to be beneficial.

However, it is not known if the autophagic process differs at basal levels between CML patients and healthy individuals and if pretreatment CML cells harbor unique autophagy characteristics that could predict patients' clinical outcomes. We now demonstrate that several key autophagy genes are differentially expressed in CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, with the highest transcript levels detected for ATG4B, and that the transcript and protein expression levels of ATG4 family members, ATG5 and BECLIN-1 are significantly increased in CD34(+) cells from chronic-phase CML patients (P < .05). Importantly, ATG4B is differentially expressed in pretreatment CML stem/progenitor cells from subsequent IM responders vs IM nonresponders (P < .05). Knockdown of ATG4B suppresses autophagy, impairs the survival of CML stem/progenitor cells and sensitizes them to IM treatment. Moreover, deregulated expression of ATG4B in CD34(+) CML cells inversely correlates with transcript levels of miR-34a, and ATG4B is shown to be a direct target of miR-34a. This study identifies ATG4B as a potential biomarker for predicting therapeutic response in treatment-naive CML stem/progenitor cells and uncovers ATG4B as a possible drug target in these cells.",['(c) 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Rothe, Katharina', 'Lin, Hanyang', 'Lin, Kevin B L', 'Leung, Amy', 'Wang, Hui Mi', 'Malekesmaeili, Mehrnoush', 'Brinkman, Ryan R', 'Forrest, Donna L', 'Gorski, Sharon M', 'Jiang, Xiaoyan']","['Rothe K', 'Lin H', 'Lin KB', 'Leung A', 'Wang HM', 'Malekesmaeili M', 'Brinkman RR', 'Forrest DL', 'Gorski SM', 'Jiang X']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada; Department of Medical Genetics and.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada; Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada;', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada;', 'Genome Sciences Centre and.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada;', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada;', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada;', 'Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of British Columbia, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada; and.', 'Genome Sciences Centre and Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada; Department of Medical Genetics and Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140422,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Autophagy/genetics', 'Autophagy-Related Proteins', '*Biomarkers, Pharmacological/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/pathology/therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/04/24 06:00,2014/08/15 06:00,['2014/04/24 06:00'],"['2014/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40145-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-07-516807 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Jun 5;123(23):3622-34. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-07-516807.

Some miRNAs may act as either tumor suppressors or oncomiRs in AML and CML by targeting key genes in AML and CML pathways. Expression patterns of cell type-specific miRNAs could partially reflect the characteristics of K562, HL-60 and THP-1 cell lines, such as actin filament-based processes, responsiveness to stimulus and phagocytic activity. miRNAs may also regulate myeloid differentiation, since they usually suppress differentiation regulators.

In the present study, we examined the mechanisms of action of dioscin, a glucosides saponin isolated from Polygonatum zanlanscianense pump, in human myeloblast leukemia HL-60 cells. Dioscin suppressed HL-60 cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition was due to the induction of apoptosis as revealed by the externalization of phosphatidylserine, and cleavages of lamin A/C and PARP-1. Treatment with dioscin induced apoptosis through activation of caspases 3, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK contributed to dioscin-induced apoptosis upstream of caspase activation. Using various inhibitors and antioxidant agents, we found that mitochondrial derived reactive oxygen species and depletion of mitochondrial transmembrane potential lead to the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK. Taken together, our results demonstrated that dioscin induces apoptosis by activation of p38 MAPK and JNK through the caspase-dependent mitochondrial death pathway.

She has history of thrombocytopenia for 25 years and a significant family history of thrombocytopenia, affecting her mother, siblings and their children, as well as her own children. Both her mother and maternal aunt died from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Additional genetic analysis was performed and identified two heterozygous missence mutations in the second zinc finger domain of GATA2 gene (p.Thr358Lys, and p.Leu359Val), occurring in cis on the same allele. Given the patient's family history and clinical manifestation, this was interpreted as an acute myeloid leukemia with heritable GATA2 mutations associated with familial AML-MDS. Germline GATA2 mutations are involved in a group of complex syndromes with overlapping clinical features of immune deficiency, lymphedema and propensity to acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (AML-MDS). Here we reported a case of familial AML-MDS with two novel GATA2 mutations. This case illustrates the importance of recognizing the clinical features for this rare category of AML-MDS and performing the appropriate molecular testing.

Bone marrow biopsies showing involvement with follicular lymphoma at our institution over the past 34 months were evaluated for the presence of CD5 positivity by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Two of eight cases (25%) of the follicular lymphomas with marrow involvement at our institution were found to be CD5-positive.

Molecular remission is sustained in around 30% of imatinib-treated patients who stop treatment after >/=2 years with undetectable minimal residual disease (UMRD) by conventional real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. An additional 20-30% of patients will lose UMRD, but remain in stable major molecular remission off treatment. Most patients with molecular recurrence have a significant increase in BCR-ABL1 within the first 6 months off treatment, but there are also rare late relapses. As re-treatment with imatinib restores control, a trial of TFR is safe so long as careful molecular monitoring is provided to enable prompt re-treatment. The minimum eligibility criteria for a trial of TFR are not yet defined, but the available data support a MRD level of around a molecular response of 4.5 log for at least 2 years. Factors associated with a higher probability of TFR include low risk Sokal score, prior interferon treatment, longer total duration of imatinib treatment and higher numbers of natural killer cells at the time of imatinib discontinuation. Preliminary data suggest that the rate of TFR in patients treated with more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors will probably be higher.

We extracted data on baseline characteristics and survival data following LT. RESULTS: Total of 84 patients are analyzed. Age at time of LT was median of 22 yr (range 1-66). Seventy-nine patients were recipients of allogeneic HSCT. The indications for LT were bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS; 63 patients), pulmonary fibrosis (13 patients), BOS/pulmonary fibrosis (five patients), and graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) of lung (three patients). The median time between HSCT and LT was 52.3 months (range 6-240). The median follow-up after LT was 36 months (range 0-168). During this time, BOS was documented in 25 patients. Relapse of hematological malignancy was reported in two patients, and new malignancy developed in four patients. At the end of follow-up, 60 patients were alive and 24 patients died. The probability of survival following LT at 24 and 36 months was 0.88 (95% CI 0.78-0.93) and 0.79 (95% CI 0.67-0.87), respectively. CONCLUSION: LT is a potential therapeutic option in selected patients with severe chronic pulmonary disease following HSCT. Further studies are needed to determine the appropriate timing and the outcome of this approach.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Liver is one of the main targets of the leukemia cells spread to, where they may continue to proliferate and differentiate and cause liver function damage, even liver failure. Our previous studies showed that Angelica polysscharides (APS), the main effective components in Angelica sinensis of Chinese traditional medicine, was able to inhibit the proliferation and induced differentiation of the leukemia cells, however, its effect on the liver during the treatment remains elucidated. In the present study, the human leukemia NOD/SCID mouse model were established by implantation human leukemia K562 cells line, then the leukemia mouse were treated with APS, Ara-c or APS + Ara-c respectively by peritoneal injection for 14 days, to explore the effect and mechanism of the chemicals on the mouse liver. Compared to the human leukemia NOD/SCID mouse model group with the treatments of APS, Ara-c and APS + Ara-c, We found that severe liver damage and pathological changes of the liver were able to alleviate: First, the number of white blood cells in the peripheral blood was significantly lower and with less transplanted K562 leukemia cells; Second, liver function damage was alleviated as liver function tests showed that alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and total bilirubin (TBiL) were significantly reduced, while the albumin (Alb) was notably increased; Third, liver antioxidant ability was improved as the activities of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were significantly increased, and the contents of GSH and malonaldehyde (MDA) were decreased significantly in the liver; Fourth, the inflammation of the liver was relieved as the level of IL-1beta and IL-6, the inflammatory cytokines, were decreased significantly in the liver. Fifth, liver index was increased as the pathological observation showed that leukemia cells with diffused infiltration into the liver lobules were significantly reduced and with a remarkable increase of apoptotic positive cell rate by TUNEL test. Furthermore, the APS + Ara-c combined administration showed an even more significant positive effect. In conclusion, the APS, Ara-c therapy reduced the accumulation of leukemia cells within the liver, reduced the liver function damage and levels of inflammatory factors, improved antioxidant capacity of the liver tissue and thus alleviate the pathological changes of the liver.

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of Mcl-1 small interference RNA (siRNA) on the proliferation and apoptosis of HL-60 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. METHODS: siRNA transfection was performed using Lipofectamine2000 reagent. Relative mRNA and protein expressions were quantified by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Trypan blue assay was performed to assess tumor cell proliferation after siRNA transfection. The cytotoxic effect of Mcl-1 siRNA on leukemic cells was measured using MTT assay. Apoptosis was detected using ELISA cell death assay. RESULTS: Mcl-1 siRNA clearly lowered both Mcl-1 mRNA and protein levels in a time-dependent manner, leading to marked inhibition of cell survival and proliferation. Furthermore, Mcl-1 down-regulation significantly enhanced the extent of HL-60 apoptotic cells. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the down-regulation of Mcl-1 by siRNA can effectively trigger apoptosis and inhibit the proliferation of leukemic cells.

Suicide gene therapy for cancer has been attractive but with limited clinical efficacy. In this study, we investigated the potential application of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSV-TK/GCV) based system to inhibit chemoresistant AML cells. We first generated Ara-C resistant K562 cells and doxorubicin-resistant THP-1 cells. We found that the HSV-TK/GCV anticancer system suppressed drug resistant leukemic cells in culture. Chemoresistant AML cell lines displayed similar sensitivity to HSV-TK/GCV. Moreover, HSV-TK/GCV killing of leukemic cells was augmented to a mild but significant extent by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) with concomitant upregulation of Connexin 43, a major component of gap junctions. Interestingly, HSV-TK/GCV killing was enhanced by expression of vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G), a fusogenic membrane protein, which also increased leukemic cell fusion. Co-culture resistant cells expressing HSV-TK and cells stably transduced with VSV-G showed that expression of VSV-G could promote the bystander killing effect of HSV-TK/GCV. Furthermore, combination of HSV-TK/GCV with VSV-G plus ATRA produced more pronounced antileukemia effect. These results suggest that the HSV-TK/GCV system in combination with fusogenic membrane proteins and/or ATRA could provide a strategy to mitigate the chemoresistance of AML.",,"['Hu, Chenxi', 'Chen, Zheng', 'Zhao, Wenjun', 'Wei, Lirong', 'Zheng, Yanwen', 'He, Chao', 'Zeng, Yan', 'Yin, Bin']","['Hu C', 'Chen Z', 'Zhao W', 'Wei L', 'Zheng Y', 'He C', 'Zeng Y', 'Yin B']","['Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu province, 215123, PR China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu province, 215123, PR China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu province, 215123, PR China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu province, 215123, PR China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu province, 215123, PR China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu province, 215123, PR China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu province, 215123, PR China ; Thrombosis and Hemostasis Key Lab of the Ministry of Health, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, 215006, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Biomol Ther (Seoul),Biomolecules & therapeutics,101472832,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ATRA', 'Bystander killing', 'Chemoresisitant leukemia cells', 'HSV-TK/GCV', 'VSV-G']",2014/04/23 06:00,2014/04/23 06:01,['2014/04/23 06:00'],"['2013/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2014/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4062/biomolther.2013.112 [doi]', 'bt22-2-0114 [pii]']",ppublish,Biomol Ther (Seoul). 2014 Feb;22(2):114-21. doi: 10.4062/biomolther.2013.112.,,,PMC3975477,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate fabrication of a novel microfluidic device utilizing Braille perfusion for peristaltic fluid flow to enable switching between recirculation and refresh flow modes. Utilizing fluid flow simulations and the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60, non-adherent cells, we demonstrate the utility of this RECIR-REFRESH device. With computer simulations, we profiled fluid flow and concentration gradients of autocrine factors and found that the geometry of the cell culture well plays a key role in cell entrapping and retaining autocrine and soluble factors. We subjected HL-60 cells, in the device, to a treatment regimen of 1.25% dimethylsulfoxide, every other day, to provoke differentiation and measured subsequent expression of CD11b on day 2 and day 4 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on day 4. Our findings display perfusion sensitive CD11b expression, but not TNF-alpha build-up, by day 4 of culture, with a 1:1 ratio of recirculation to refresh flow yielding the greatest increase in CD11b levels.

Thus, patients who develop GvHD after infusion of allodepleted donor-derived T cells expressing an inducible human caspase 9 (iC9) had their disease effectively controlled by a single administration of a small-molecule drug (AP1903) that dimerizes and activates the iC9 transgene. We now report the long-term follow-up of 10 patients infused with such safety switch-modified T cells. We find long-term persistence of iC9-modified (iC9-T) T cells in vivo in the absence of emerging oligoclonality and a robust immunologic benefit, mediated initially by the infused cells themselves and subsequently by an apparently accelerated reconstitution of endogenous naive T lymphocytes. As a consequence, these patients have immediate and sustained protection from major pathogens, including cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, BK virus, and Epstein-Barr virus in the absence of acute or chronic GvHD, supporting the beneficial effects of this approach to immune reconstitution after haplo-HSCT.

Hypodiploidy constituted 8% of all AML and was associated with older age (median age 9 years), male predominance (60%), FAB M2 (56%), and t(8;21)(q22;q22) (56%) with loss of sex chromosomes. Inferior outcome was observed for hypodiploid cases (5-year event-free survival 40% and 5-year overall survival 40%) but did not reach statistical significance. Chromosomes were gained in a nonrandom pattern, where chromosomes 8, 21, 19, and 6 were the most commonly gained. In conclusion, based on MNs, two cytogenetic subgroups with characteristic clinical features are described; hypodiploidy found in 8% and associated with high median age, male sex, t(8;21)(q22;q22), and FAB M2 and possibly associated with inferior outcome (P = 0.13), and hyperdiploidy with MN 48-65 in 11% associated with early onset, female sex, and AMKL.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Sandahl, Julie Damgaard', 'Kjeldsen, Eigil', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Ha, Shau-Yin', 'Heldrup, Jesper', 'Jahnukainen, Kirsi', 'Jonsson, Olafur G', 'Lausen, Birgitte', 'Palle, Josefine', 'Zeller, Bernward', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Hasle, Henrik']","['Sandahl JD', 'Kjeldsen E', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Ha SY', 'Heldrup J', 'Jahnukainen K', 'Jonsson OG', 'Lausen B', 'Palle J', 'Zeller B', 'Forestier E', 'Hasle H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140418,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', '*Ploidies', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2014/04/23 06:00,2014/12/20 06:00,['2014/04/23 06:00'],"['2013/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22177 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2014 Aug;53(8):667-75. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22177.

This complex function is carried out via two distinct binding sites located on opposite sides of the protein; namely, the 'c-Myb site' and the 'MLL site', named after their characteristic ligands-the transactivation domain of c-Myb and the mixed lineage leukemia protein (MLL). Both these ligands are unstructured in isolation and fold only upon binding, posing the KIX domain as an ideal candidate to explore the binding induced folding reaction of intrinsically unstructured proteins. Here, we complement the recent kinetic description on the interaction between KIX and c-Myb, by characterizing the binding kinetics between KIX and MLL, at different pH and ionic strength conditions. Furthermore, we analyze quantitatively the mechanism of allosteric communication between the topologically distinct c-Myb and MLL sites.

Unfortunately, some patients are resistant primarily to imatinib and others develop drug resistance, prompting interest in the discovery of new drug targets. Although much of this resistance can be explained by the presence of mutations within the tyrosine kinase domain of BCR-ABL, such mutations are not universally identified. Interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF-8) is a transcription factor that is essential for myelopoiesis. Depressed IRF-8 levels are observed in a majority of CML patients and Irf-8(-/-) mice exhibit a CML-like disease. The underlying mechanisms of IRF-8 loss in CML are unknown. We hypothesized that BCR-ABL suppresses transcription of IRF-8 through STAT5, a proximal BCR-ABL target. Treatment of primary cells from newly diagnosed CML patients in chronic phase as well as BCR-ABL(+) cell lines with imatinib increased IRF-8 transcription. Furthermore, IRF-8 expression in cell line models was necessary for imatinib-induced antitumor responses. We have demonstrated that IRF-8 is a direct target of STAT5 and that silencing of STAT5 induced IRF-8 expression. Conversely, activating STAT5 suppressed IRF-8 transcription. Finally, we showed that STAT5 blockade using a recently discovered antagonist increased IRF-8 expression in patient samples. These data reveal a previously unrecognized BCR-ABL-STAT5-IRF-8 network, which widens the repertoire of potentially new anti-CML targets.","['(c) 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Waight, Jeremy D', 'Banik, Debarati', 'Griffiths, Elizabeth A', 'Nemeth, Michael J', 'Abrams, Scott I']","['Waight JD', 'Banik D', 'Griffiths EA', 'Nemeth MJ', 'Abrams SI']","['From the Departments of Immunology.', 'From the Departments of Immunology.', 'Pharmacology and Therapeutics, and Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.', 'From the Departments of Immunology, Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263 Michael.Nemeth@RoswellPark.org.', 'Pharmacology and Therapeutics, and Scott.Abrams@RoswellPark.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140421,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/physiology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/physiology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer Therapy', 'Cell Death', 'Leukemia', 'STAT Transcription Factor', 'Tumor Suppressor Gene']",2014/04/23 06:00,2014/10/11 06:00,['2014/04/23 06:00'],"['2014/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)38623-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M113.544320 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 May 30;289(22):15642-52. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M113.544320.

Morphological analysis of bone marrow smears, together with the screening panel, is mandatory for the primary identification of AL. The disease-oriented panels proposed here are divided into three levels of recommendations (mandatory, recommendable, and optional) in order to provide an accurate final diagnosis, as well as allow some degree of flexibility based on available local resources and patient-specific needs.

The primary objective of this meta-analysis of observational studies was to evaluate the epidemiologic relationship between smoking and the risk of development of AML. Twenty-three studies published between January 1993 and December 2013 were included in our analysis, and accounted for 7,746 cases of AML. The outcome of interest was the relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of developing AML in adult cigarette smokers in comparison with non-smokers, and was estimated using the random-effects model. Our results showed that current and ever smokers have 40% (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.22-1.60; P < 0.001) and 25% (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15-1.36; P < 0.001) increased risk of developing AML when compared with non-smokers. The increased RR of AML was increased regardless of sex, study design, geographical region, and quality of the studies. Intensity of smoking of <10, 10-20, 20-30, and >30 cigarettes per day was associated with RRs of AML of 1.27, 1.36, 1.55, and 1.77, respectively (P < 0.001 for trend). Duration of smoking of <20 and >20 years was associated with RRs of 1.07 and 1.44, respectively (P < 0.001 for trend). Cumulative smoking of <10, 10-20, 20-30, and >30 pack-years was associated with RRs of 1.13, 1.23, 1.39, and 1.71, respectively (P < 0.001 for trend).

Genome-wide array data were used to estimate each participant's percent membership in the three Hispanic ancestral populations: Native American, African, and European. Each 20% increase in European ancestry was associated with a six month younger age at diagnosis (95% CI = 0.36-11.6 months, P = 0.037).

Because younger age at diagnosis is associated with improved treatment outcomes for children with ALL, the effect of European ancestry on ALL survival may be mediated by its effect on age at diagnosis, or by proxy, its association with more treatable molecular subtypes of ALL.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Walsh, Kyle M', 'de Smith, Adam J', 'Welch, Tara C', 'Smirnov, Ivan', 'Cunningham, Marc J', 'Ma, Xiaomei', 'Chokkalingam, Anand P', 'Dahl, Gary V', 'Roberts, William', 'Barcellos, Lisa F', 'Buffler, Patricia A', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Wiemels, Joseph L']","['Walsh KM', 'de Smith AJ', 'Welch TC', 'Smirnov I', 'Cunningham MJ', 'Ma X', 'Chokkalingam AP', 'Dahl GV', 'Roberts W', 'Barcellos LF', 'Buffler PA', 'Metayer C', 'Wiemels JL']","['Division of Neuroepidemiology, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, 94143; Program in Cancer Genetics, Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, 94143.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140418,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Genomics', 'Hispanic or Latino/*genetics/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*ethnology/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*ethnology/*genetics', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,2014/04/23 06:00,2014/10/10 06:00,['2014/04/23 06:00'],"['2013/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/27 00:00 [revised]', '2014/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23727 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2014 Jul;89(7):721-5. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23727.

We describe a RUNX1-intragenic long noncoding RNA RUNXOR that is transcribed as unspliced transcript from an upstream overlapping promoter. RUNXOR was upregulated in AML samples and in response to Ara-C treatment in vitro. RUNXOR utilizes its 3'-terminal fragment to directly interact with the RUNX1 promoter and enhancers and participates in the orchestration of an intrachromosomal loop. The 3' region of RUNXOR also participates in long-range interchromosomal interactions with chromatin regions that are involved in multiple RUNX1 translocations.

Previous work using animals lacking secondary lymphoid tissue (SLT) suggested that activation of donor T cells in SLT is critically important for the pathogenesis of aGvHD. However, these studies did not determine if impaired migration into, and more importantly, out of SLT, would ameliorate aGvHD. Here, we show that T cells from mice lacking Coronin 1A (Coro 1A(-/-)), an actin-associated protein shown to be important for thymocyte egress, do not mediate acute GvHD. The attenuation of aGvHD was associated with decreased expression of the critical trafficking proteins C-C chemokines receptor type 7 (CCR7) and sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor on donor T cells. This was mediated in part by impaired activation of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway in the absence of Coro 1A. As a result of these alterations, donor T cells from Coro 1A(-/-) mice were not able to initially traffic to SLT or exit SLT after BM transplantation. However, this alteration did not abrogate the graft-versus-leukemia response. Our data suggest that blocking T-cell migration into and out of SLT is a valid approach to prevent aGvHD.","['(c) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This study was designed to examine the protective effect of vitamin D, if any, against hepatic IRI in rats and the underlying mechanism involved. Adult female Wistar rats were randomly divided into control, sham-operated (sham), ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), and ischemic-reperfused vitamin D-treated (vit D) groups. Rats in the I/R and vit D groups were subjected to partial (70%) hepatic ischemia for 45 min, followed by 1 h of reperfusion. Vitamin D was given to rats orally in a dose of 500 IU/kg daily for 2 weeks before being subjected to I/R. Markers of liver damage, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis were evaluated. Hepatic morphology was also examined. Vit D-treated rats had significantly lower serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and gamma glutamyl transferase compared to rats in the I/R group. Also, vit D-treated rats showed a significant decrease in malondialdehyde, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nuclear factor kappaB, B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2-associated X protein, cytochrome c, and caspase-3 levels, with higher levels of glutathione peroxidase and B cell lymphoma 2 protein levels in liver tissues compared to I/R rats. Histological examination showed less damaged liver tissues with amelioration of apoptotic signs in the vit D group compared to the I/R group.

The number of murine B-1 progenitors peaks during fetal development whereas B-2 B cell production predominates in adult bone marrow. Many genetic mutations that underlie B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) occur in the fetus, at which time B-1 progenitor numbers are high. However, whether B-ALL can initiate in B-1 progenitors is unknown. In the present study, we report that BCR-ABL-transformed murine B-1 progenitors can be B-ALL cells of origin and demonstrate that they initiate disease more rapidly than do oncogene-expressing B-2 progenitors. We further demonstrate that B-1 progenitors exhibit relative resistance to apoptosis and undergo significant growth following oncogene expression, and we propose that these properties underlie the accelerated kinetics with which they initiate leukemia. These results provide a developmental perspective on the origin of B-ALL and indicate B cell lineage as a factor influencing disease progression.","['Copyright (c) 2014 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Montecino-Rodriguez, Encarnacion', 'Li, Katy', 'Fice, Michael', 'Dorshkind, Kenneth']","['Montecino-Rodriguez E', 'Li K', 'Fice M', 'Dorshkind K']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 kdorshki@mednet.ucla.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140421,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*immunology/pathology']",,,2014/04/23 06:00,2014/07/06 06:00,['2014/04/23 06:00'],"['2014/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1303170 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1303170 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2014 Jun 1;192(11):5171-8. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1303170.

Flow cytometry (FCM) is considered more sensitive than CC, but clinical implications of CC negativity/CC positivity are not yet established. CSF samples from 38 adult patients with newly diagnosed ALL/LL were examined. Five (13 %) and nine (24 %) specimens were CC positive-FC positive (FCM(pos)/CC(pos)) and CC negative-FC positive (CC(neg)/FCM(pos)), respectively. The remaining 24 (63 %) samples were double negative (CC(neg)/FCM(neg)) (p = 0.001). CC(neg)/FCM(pos) patients showed a significantly shorter overall survival (OS) compared to CC(neg)/FCM(neg) ones.

DREF is a transcription factor that regulates proliferation-related genes in Drosophila. It is known that overexpression of dMLF in the wing imaginal discs through the engrailed-GAL4 driver causes an atrophied wing phenotype associated with the induction of apoptosis. However, the precise mechanisms involved have yet to be clarified. Here, we found the atrophied phenotype to be suppressed by loss-of-function mutation of Drosophila Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), basket (bsk). Overexpression of dMLF induced ectopic JNK activation in the wing disc monitored with the puckered-lacZ reporter line, resulting in induction of apoptosis. The DREF-binding consensus DRE sequence could be shown to exist in the bsk promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in S2 cells with anti-dMLF IgG and quantitative real-time PCR revealed that dMLF binds specifically to the bsk promoter region containing the DRE sequence. Furthermore, using a transient luciferase expression assay, we provide evidence that knockdown of dMLF reduced bsk gene promoter activity in S2 cells. Finally, we show that dMLF interacts with DREF in vivo. Altogether, these data indicate that dMLF acts with DREF to stimulate the bsk promoter and consequently activates the JNK pathway to promote apoptosis.",,"['Yanai, H', 'Yoshioka, Y', 'Yoshida, H', 'Nakao, Y', 'Plessis, A', 'Yamaguchi, M']","['Yanai H', 'Yoshioka Y', 'Yoshida H', 'Nakao Y', 'Plessis A', 'Yamaguchi M']","['Department of Applied Biology, Kyoto Institute of Technology, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Applied Biology, Kyoto Institute of Technology, Kyoto, Japan.', '1] Department of Applied Biology, Kyoto Institute of Technology, Kyoto, Japan [2] Insect Biomedical Research Center, Kyoto Institute of Technology, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Applied Biology, Kyoto Institute of Technology, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Institut Jacques Monod, CNRS, UMR 7592, Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', '1] Department of Applied Biology, Kyoto Institute of Technology, Kyoto, Japan [2] Insect Biomedical Research Center, Kyoto Institute of Technology, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140421,United States,Oncogenesis,Oncogenesis,101580004,,,,,2014/04/23 06:00,2014/04/23 06:01,['2014/04/23 06:00'],"['2013/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2014/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/23 06:01 [medline]']","['oncsis201413 [pii]', '10.1038/oncsis.2014.13 [doi]']",epublish,Oncogenesis. 2014 Apr 21;3:e98. doi: 10.1038/oncsis.2014.13.,,,PMC4007195,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the detailed mechanisms are not clear. This study was to identify the cytotoxic effects of ultrasound-activated protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) on U937 cells. METHODS: Flow cytometry was performed to detect the time course for PpIX uptake in U937 cells. Sub-cellular localization of PpIX in U937 cells was visualized by inverted confocal laser scanning microscope. Following PpIX-mediated SDT treatment, cell viability was evaluated by the 3-(4, 5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay; nuclear damage was observed under fluorescent microscope; DNA fragmentation and mitochondrial membrane potential disruption were measured by flow cytometry. The role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SDT-induced cell death was also evaluated. RESULTS: We observed that PpIX is mainly localized in the mitochondria, with a maximal uptake within 2 h. Compared with PpIX or ultrasound alone, PpIX plus ultrasound treatment significantly declined cell viability, caused more serious damage of cell morphology, DNA and mitochondria. In the combined treatment group, the intracellular ROS was greatly higher than in other groups; ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine could effectively rescue the loss of mitochondria membrane potential and cell viability induced by SDT. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings primarily indicated that fatal damage could be induced by PpIX-mediated SDT in U937 cells, and the intracellular ROS was involved during this process.

METHODS: Jurkat leukemia cells were co-cultured with hUC-MSCs isolated from human umbilical cord tissues by plastic adherence at a ratio of 10:1. The proliferation and survival of the co-cultured Jurkat cells, separated by immunomagnetic bead cell sorting on day 4, were evaluated by flow cytometry. Western blotting was performed to evaluate the activation of Notch signaling in the co-cultured Jurkat cells. RESULTS: Jurkat leukemia cells co-cultured with hUC-MSCs for 4 days showed a lowered proliferation rate and cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase with a reduction in the cell apoptotic rate. Notch signaling pathway was activated in the co-cultured Jurkat cells as evidenced by an increased cellular expression of HES-1.

The Programa Espanol de Tratamientos en Hematologia (PETHEMA) ALL-AR-03 trial (Treatment of High Risk Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia [LAL-AR/2003]) assigned adolescent and adult patients (age 15 to 60 years) with high-risk ALL (HR-ALL) without the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome to chemotherapy or to allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) according to early cytologic response (day 14) and flow-MRD level after consolidation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with good early cytologic response (< 10% blasts in bone marrow at day 14 of induction) and a flow-MRD level less than 5 x 10(-4) at the end of consolidation were assigned to delayed consolidation and maintenance therapy, and allo-HSCT was scheduled in patients with poor early cytologic response or flow-MRD level >/= 5 x 10(-4). RESULTS: Complete remission was attained in 282 (87%) of 326 patients, and 179 (76%) of 236 patients who completed early consolidation were assigned by intention-to treat to receive allo-HSCT (71) or chemotherapy (108). Five-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) probabilities were 37% and 35% for the whole series, 32% and 37% for patients assigned to allo-HSCT, and 55% and 59% for those assigned to chemotherapy. Multivariable analysis showed poor MRD clearance (>/= 1 x 10(-3) after induction and >/= 5 x 10(-4) after early consolidation) as the only prognostic factor for DFS and OS. CONCLUSION: Prognosis for Ph-negative HR-ALL in adolescents and adults with good early response to induction and low flow-MRD levels after consolidation is quite favorable when allo-HSCT is avoided. In this study, the pattern of MRD clearance was the only prognostic factor for DFS and OS.",['(c) 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Ribera, Josep-Maria', 'Oriol, Albert', 'Morgades, Mireia', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Sarra, Josep', 'Gonzalez-Campos, Jose', 'Brunet, Salut', 'Tormo, Mar', 'Fernandez-Abellan, Pascual', 'Guardia, Ramon', 'Bernal, Maria-Teresa', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Barba, Pere', 'Moreno, Maria-Jose', 'Bermudez, Arancha', 'Cladera, Antonia', 'Escoda, Lourdes', 'Garcia-Boyero, Raimundo', 'Del Potro, Eloy', 'Bergua, Juan', 'Amigo, Maria-Luz', 'Grande, Carlos', 'Rabunal, Maria-Jose', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus-Maria', 'Feliu, Evarist']","['Ribera JM', 'Oriol A', 'Morgades M', 'Montesinos P', 'Sarra J', 'Gonzalez-Campos J', 'Brunet S', 'Tormo M', 'Fernandez-Abellan P', 'Guardia R', 'Bernal MT', 'Esteve J', 'Barba P', 'Moreno MJ', 'Bermudez A', 'Cladera A', 'Escoda L', 'Garcia-Boyero R', 'Del Potro E', 'Bergua J', 'Amigo ML', 'Grande C', 'Rabunal MJ', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM', 'Feliu E']","[""Josep-Maria Ribera, Albert Oriol, Mireia Morgades, and Evarist Feliu, Institut Catala d'Oncologia-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol-Jose Carreras Research Institute;

Its morbidity and mortality is similar to other severe childhood diseases such as meningitis and leukemia, and is becoming increasingly recognized as a major cause of neurodevelopmental delays. The etiology of NEC remains obscure despite over 40 years of research, partly because it is more than one disease and databases including NEC have been diluted by these different entities. Furthermore, good animal models that represent the most classic form of the disease seen in preterm human infants are lacking.

OBJECTIVES: We analyzed our experience in conducting PS at home for terminally ill children with cancer during a seven-year period. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of medical records of children with cancer treated at home between the years 2005 and 2011. RESULTS: We analyzed the data of 42 cancer patients (18% of all patients); in 21 cases, PS was initiated (solid tumors n = 11, brain tumors [5], bone tumors [4], leukemia [1]). Sedation was introduced because of pain (n = 13), dyspnea (9), anxiety (5), or two of those symptoms (6). The main drug used for sedation was midazolam; all patients received morphine. There were no significant differences in the dose of morphine or midazolam depending on the patient's sex; age was correlated with an increase of midazolam dose (R = 0.68; P = 0.005). Duration of sedation (R = 0.61; P = 0.003) and its later initiation (R = 0.43; P = 0.05) were correlated with an increase of the morphine dose. All patients received adjuvant treatment; in patients who required a morphine dose increase, metoclopramide was used more often (P = 0.0002). Patients did not experience any adverse reactions. Later introduction of sedation was associated with a marginally higher number of intervention visits and a significantly higher number of planned visits (R = 0.53; P = 0.013).

METHODS: CD34(+) CD38(-) cells (enriched for HSC) and CD34(+) CD38(+) cells (enriched for HPC) were resolved on the basis of CD34 and CD38 expression. Concomitantly, expression of CD90 and CD96 or CD117 and CD123 was assessed by multicolor flow cytometry in each cell population. RESULTS: CD90 and CD117 were expressed in a low proportion of CD34(+) CD38(-) and CD34(+) CD38(+) cells and no significant differences were observed between normal marrow and AML at diagnosis. In contrast, CD96(+) cells and CD123(+) cells were found at significantly higher levels in both cell populations from AML at diagnosis, as compared to normal marrow. Levels of both cell surface markers after treatment remained higher than in normal marrow. DISCUSSION: These results show an increased frequency of CD96(+) and CD123(+) cells within the CD34(+) cell population from pediatric AML; this is consistent with the findings reported previously for adult AML. Our study supports the notion that expression of such antigens should be explored for their use as markers for diagnosis and prognosis.",['Copyright (c) 2014 IMSS. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The best molecularly clarified scenario is that of concurrent AA and unsuspected (occult) T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia. Several reported cases of AA and concurrent small B-cell lymphomas/leukemias and Hodgkin lymphomas suggest also a possible link to simultaneous or preceding AA that might be sought in an antineoplastic immunological attempt to 'eradicate' the underlying malignant clone. The 'immuno-deregulatory' potential and the direct cytotoxicity of regimens used for lymphoma therapy might be able to trigger AA in cases evolving after lymphoma treatment too. Alternative explanations of AA associated with lymphoproliferative disorders might be particular (immuno-)genetic patient backgrounds predisposing to both AA and lymphoid neoplasms or exposures to environmental factors, increasing the risk for both diseases. Finally, the most common causal relationship of AA and lymphoma is that of immunosuppression- or allogeneous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-associated posttransplantational lymphoproliferative disorders in AA patients, who are treated in the respective manner. As all above scenarios are differently (specifically) therapeutically approachable and accompanied by diverse outcomes, they should be actively sought for and diagnosed as precisely as possible.

Still, CD33 is a challenging target because of its low expression and slow internalization; these characteristics limit antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and intracellular drug accumulation and, consequently, the activity of unlabeled and toxin-carrying antibodies. Very promising preclinical data are now available from an improved antibody-drug conjugate and CD33-targeted strategies that redirect immune effector cells to eradicate the leukemia, most notably bispecific antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy. In parallel to their clinical testing, efforts will be needed to identify the patients that most likely benefit from such agents and the disease stage in which they are most efficacious. With enhanced activity of CD33-directed therapies, toxic effects on normal hematopoiesis will increase and require excellent supportive care measures, or even rescue with donor cells, to minimize morbidity and mortality from expected cytopenias and to optimize treatment outcomes with these therapeutics.",,"['Walter, Roland B']",['Walter RB'],"['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division , 1100 Fairview Ave N, D2-190, Seattle, WA 98109-1024 , USA +1 206 667 3599 ; +1 206 667 5255 ; rwalter@fhcrc.org.']",['eng'],"['Editorial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140421,England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/*immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['CD33', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'antibody', 'antibody-drug conjugate', 'bispecific T-cell engager', 'bispecific antibody', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'gemtuzumab ozogamicin', 'immunotherapy']",2014/04/23 06:00,2015/02/05 06:00,['2014/04/23 06:00'],"['2014/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14728222.2014.909413 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2014 Jul;18(7):715-8. doi: 10.1517/14728222.2014.909413.

Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in the understanding of the cytogenetic and molecular determinants of AML pathogenesis. One such advance is the identification of recurring mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene (FLT3). Currently, this marker, which appears in approximately one-third of all AML patients, not only signifies a poorer prognosis but also identifies an important target for therapy. FLT3 inhibitors have now undergone clinical evaluation in Phase I, II and III clinical trials, as both single agents and in combination with chemotherapeutics. Unfortunately, to date, none of the FLT3 inhibitors have gained FDA approval for the treatment of patients with AML. Yet, several promising FLT3 inhibitors are being evaluated in all phases of drug development. AREAS COVERED: This review aims to highlight the agents furthest along in their development. It also focuses on those FLT3 inhibitors that are being evaluated in combination with other anti-leukemia agents. EXPERT OPINION: The authors believe that the field of research for FLT3 inhibitors remains promising, despite the historically poor prognosis of this subgroup of patients with AML. The most promising areas of research will likely be the elucidation of the mechanisms of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors, and development of potent FLT3 inhibitors alone or in combination with hypomethylating agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy or with other targeted agents.",,"['Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Pemmaraju N', 'Kantarjian H', 'Andreeff M', 'Cortes J', 'Ravandi F']","['MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Leukemia , 1515 Holcombe Blvd Houston, TX 77030 , USA fravandi@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140421,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzimidazoles/therapeutic use', 'Benzothiazoles/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Phenylurea Compounds/therapeutic use', 'Piperidines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyridazines/therapeutic use', 'Sorafenib', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene', 'FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene inhibitor', 'crenolanib', 'quizartinib', 'sorafenib']",2014/04/23 06:00,2015/01/24 06:00,['2014/04/23 06:00'],"['2014/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2014.911839 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2014 Jul;23(7):943-54. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2014.911839.

There has been no consensus on indication for HSCT. Reserving HSCT for high-risk and relapsed patients spare many patients from the long-term toxicity of this treatment. The results of matched unrelated donor HSCT equal family donor transplantation and the presence of a matched sibling should no longer be a transplant indication. Minimal residual disease measured by flow cytometry may identify poor responders benefitting from HSCT in first complete remission (CR1) and those with a favourable response to induction therapy who do not need HSCT even with adverse cytogenetic aberrations. FLT3-internal tandem duplication without NPM1 mutation has a very high relapse rate despite favourable response and HSCT is indicated in CR1 in these cases.

Many B cell malignancies remain dependent on constitutive BCR signalling, making BTK a functional therapeutic target. Several BTK inhibitors (BTKi) with different kinomes and modes of action are being assessed clinically. This review documents the efficacy and toxicity of BTKi in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Clinically, the furthest in development is ibrutinib (trade name, Imbruvica), an irreversible BTKi, which has shown spectacular preliminary efficacy, with rapid reductions in lymph nodes accompanied by peripheral blood lymphocytosis. The lymphocytosis resolves slowly and most patients do not enter a complete remission. Nevertheless, it is possible to maintain many CLL patients, even those with adverse cytogenetic features, on drug for many months with minimal toxicities, thus potentially transforming the therapeutic paradigms for CLL.

The commercial electroporation systems have been widely adopted in the past two decades while still carry drawbacks associated with the high applied electric voltage, unsatisfied delivery efficiency, and/or low cell viability. By adding highly conductive gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in electroporation solution, we demonstrated enhanced electroporation performance (i.e., better DNA delivery efficiency and higher cell viability) on mammalian cells from two different aspects: the free, naked AuNPs reduce the resistance of the electroporation solution so that the local pulse strength on cells was enhanced; targeting AuNPs (e.g., Tf-AuNPs) were brought to the cell membrane to work as virtual microelectrodes to porate cells with limited area from many different sites. The enhancement was confirmed with leukemia cells in both a commercial batch electroporation system and a home-made flow-through system using pWizGFP plasmid DNA probes. Such enhancement depends on the size, concentration, and the mixing ratio of free AuNPs/Tf-AuNPs. An equivalent mixture of free AuNPs and Tf-AuNPs exhibited the best enhancement with the transfection efficiency increased 2-3 folds at minimum sacrifice of cell viability.

METHODS: A prospective observational study was carried out in the Departments of Pathology, Medicine, and Pediatrics, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Medical Center (UKMMC), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia during a period of 19 months from April 2009 to December 2010 to assess the bone marrow recovery in patients with acute leukemia. A total of 22 patients in remission induction phases were enrolled in this study. The blood specimens were collected from day zero after chemotherapy, and every 3 days until patients recovered hematologically. All blood samples were measured for ANC and IRF using an automated hematology analyzer (Beckman-Coulter LH750). RESULTS: The percentage of patients showing IRF recovery earlier than ANC recovery was 63.6% (14 out of 22 patients). There was a significant difference in the mean number of days for IRF recovery as compared with ANC recovery (14.05 and 17.18 days), p=0.005.

METHODS: A 1-day prevalence survey was carried out in 154 French hospital wards. Malnutrition was defined as a body mass index (BMI) <18.5 in patients <75 years old or <21 in patients >/=75 years old and/or body weight loss >10% since disease onset. Oral food intake was measured using a visual analog scale. RESULTS: Nutrition status was collected for 1903 patients (1109 men and 794 women, 59.3 +/- 13.2 years). Cancer was local in 25%, regional in 31%, and metastatic in 44% of patients. Performance status was 0 or 1 in 49.8%, 2 in 23.7%, 3 or 4 in 19.6% and not available in 6.5% of patients. Overall, 39% of patients were malnourished. The prevalence of malnutrition by disease site was as follows: head and neck, 48.9%; leukemia/lymphoma, 34.0%; lung, 45.3%; colon/rectum, 39.3%; esophagus and/or stomach, 60.2%; pancreas, 66.7%; breast, 20.5%; ovaries/uterus, 44.8%; and prostate, 13.9%. Regional cancer (odds ratio, 1.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.42-2.70), metastatic cancer (2.97; 2.14-4.12), previous chemotherapy (1.41; 1.05-1.89), and previous radiotherapy (1.53; 1.21-1.92) were associated with malnutrition. Only 28.4% of non-malnourished patients and 57.6% of malnourished patients received nutrition support. In all, 55% of patients stated that they were eating less than before the cancer, while 41.4% of patients stated that they had received nutrition counseling.

These interactions affect the outcome of unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). We have shown previously that donors with KIR B versus KIR A haplotypes improve the clinical outcome for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia by reducing the incidence of leukemic relapse and improving leukemia-free survival (LFS). Both centromeric and telomeric KIR B genes contribute to the effect, but the centromeric genes are dominant. They include the genes encoding inhibitory KIRs that are specific for the C1 and C2 epitopes of HLA-C. We used an expanded cohort of 1532 T cell-replete transplants to examine the interaction between donor KIR B genes and recipient class I HLA KIR ligands. The relapse protection associated with donor KIR B is enhanced in recipients who have one or two C1-bearing HLA-C allotypes, compared with C2 homozygous recipients, with no effect due to donor HLA. The protective interaction between donors with two or more, versus none or one, KIR B motifs and recipient C1 was specific to transplants with class I mismatch at HLA-C (RR of leukemia-free survival, 0.57 [0.40-0.79]; p = 0.001) irrespective of the KIR ligand mismatch status of the transplant. The survival advantage and relapse protection in C1/x recipients compared with C2/C2 recipients was similar irrespective of the particular donor KIR B genes.

Children are of particular concern because they are more sensitive to radiation-induced cancer compared with adults and have a long lifespan to express harmful effects which may offset clinical benefits of performing a scan. This paper describes the design and methodology of a nationwide study, the Dutch Pediatric CT Study, regarding risk of leukemia and brain tumors in children after radiation exposure from CT scans. It is a retrospective record-linkage cohort study with an expected number of 100,000 children who received at least one electronically archived CT scan covering the calendar period since the introduction of digital archiving until 2012. Information on all archived CT scans of these children will be obtained, including date of examination, scanned body part and radiologist's report, as well as the machine settings required for organ dose estimation. We will obtain cancer incidence by record linkage with external databases. In this article, we describe several approaches to the collection of data on archived CT scans, the estimation of radiation doses and the assessment of confounding. The proposed approaches provide useful strategies for data collection and confounder assessment for general retrospective record-linkage studies, particular those using hospital databases on radiological procedures for the assessment of exposure to ionizing or non-ionizing radiation.",,"['Meulepas, Johanna M', 'Ronckers, Cecile M', 'Smets, Anne M J B', 'Nievelstein, Rutger A J', 'Jahnen, Andreas', 'Lee, Choonsik', 'Kieft, Mariette', 'Lameris, Johan S', 'van Herk, Marcel', 'Greuter, Marcel J W', 'Jeukens, Cecile R L P N', 'van Straten, Marcel', 'Visser, Otto', 'van Leeuwen, Flora E', 'Hauptmann, Michael']","['Meulepas JM', 'Ronckers CM', 'Smets AM', 'Nievelstein RA', 'Jahnen A', 'Lee C', 'Kieft M', 'Lameris JS', 'van Herk M', 'Greuter MJ', 'Jeukens CR', 'van Straten M', 'Visser O', 'van Leeuwen FE', 'Hauptmann M']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140419,Netherlands,Eur J Epidemiol,European journal of epidemiology,8508062,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Databases, Factual', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', '*Medical Record Linkage', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Pediatrics', '*Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*adverse effects/methods', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/04/22 06:00,2014/07/08 06:00,['2014/04/22 06:00'],"['2013/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10654-014-9900-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Epidemiol. 2014 Apr;29(4):293-301. doi: 10.1007/s10654-014-9900-9.

Ecotropic viral integration site 1 (EVI1), a key transcription factor in HSC regulation, is known to predict poor outcomes in myeloid malignancies, however, incapability of prospective isolation of EVI1-high leukemic cells precludes the functional evaluation of intraindividual EVI1-high cells. Introduction of CML into Evi1-internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) knock-in mice, a versatile HSC-reporter strain, enables us to separate Evi1-high CML cells from the individual. Evi1-IRES-GFP allele models of CML in chronic phase (CML-CP), by retroviral overexpression of BCR-ABL and by crossing BCR-ABL transgenic mice, revealed that Evi1 is predominantly enriched in the stem cell fraction and associated with an enhanced proliferative as well as a leukemia-initiating capacity and that Evi1-high CML-CP cells exhibit resistance to TKIs. Overexpressing BCR-ABL and NUP98-HOXA9 in Evi1-IRES-GFP knock-in mice to model CML in blast crisis (CML-BC), in which Evi1-high cells turned to be a major population as opposed to a minor population in CML-CP models, showed that Evi1-high CML-BC cells have a greater potential to recapitulate the disease and appear resistant to TKIs. Furthermore, given that Evi1 heterozygosity ameliorates CML-CP and CML-BC development and that the combination of Evi1 and BCR-ABL causes acute myeloid leukemia resembling CML-BC, Evi1 could regulate CML development as a potent driver. In addition, in human CML-CP cases, we show that EVI1 is highly expressed in stem cell-enriched CD34+CD38-CD90+ fraction at single-cell level. This is the first report to clarify directly that Evi1-high leukemic cells themselves possess the superior potential to Evi1-low cells in oncogenic self-renewal, which highlights the role of Evi1 as a valuable and a functional marker of CML stem cells.",,"['Sato, T', 'Goyama, S', 'Kataoka, K', 'Nasu, R', 'Tsuruta-Kishino, T', 'Kagoya, Y', 'Nukina, A', 'Kumagai, K', 'Kubota, N', 'Nakagawa, M', 'Arai, S', 'Yoshimi, A', 'Honda, H', 'Kadowaki, T', 'Kurokawa, M']","['Sato T', 'Goyama S', 'Kataoka K', 'Nasu R', 'Tsuruta-Kishino T', 'Kagoya Y', 'Nukina A', 'Kumagai K', 'Kubota N', 'Nakagawa M', 'Arai S', 'Yoshimi A', 'Honda H', 'Kadowaki T', 'Kurokawa M']","['1] Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan [2] Department of Transfusion Medicine, The University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Metabolic and Diabetic Diseases, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Metabolic and Diabetic Diseases, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Model, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Metabolic and Diabetic Diseases, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140421,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Blast Crisis/*metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2014/04/22 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/04/22 06:00'],"['2013/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/17 00:00 [revised]', '2014/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2014108 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2014.108 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2014 Oct 16;33(42):5028-38. doi: 10.1038/onc.2014.108.

Nano-formulations have potential to minimise the adverse effects of chemotherapy. We present here a liposomal formulation encapsulating both the anthracycline daunorubicin (DNR) and emetine (Eme) for enhanced cytotoxic effect against AML cells. Eme could be loaded into the PEGylated liposomes together with DNR by the acid precipitation principle, with a loading efficiency of Eme at about 50% of that of DNR. The liposome surface was modified with folate to enhance drug loading into cells, giving higher cytotoxic activity. Both intracellular drug loading and cytotoxic activity could be further increased by anti-folate treatment of AML cells with methotrexate (MTX). The combination of DNR and Eme also increased drug loading in MTX-treated cells compared to DNR alone. Liposomes with both DNR and Eme were particularly efficient against AMLs with deficient p53. In conclusion, we have produced a multi-functional liposomal anti-leukaemic drug formulation designed to overcome some of the problems in anthracycline chemotherapy: (1) Combination of DNR and Eme to diminish drug resistance. (2) Using PEGylated stealth liposomes to minimise adverse side-effects. (3) Molecules on the liposomal surface target proteins on AML-cells ensure selectivity, which was enhanced by priming the leukaemia cells with MTX.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, the signals involved in autophagy regulation relative to BCR-ABL1 are still elusive. The autophagic flux proceeding from the inhibition of BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase represents a regulatory mechanism of beta-catenin stability through events encompassing the activation of calpain, which targets beta-catenin for proteasome-independent degradation. Accordingly, its inactivation may contribute to induce autophagy and autophagy induction may, in turn, promote beta-catenin autolysosomal degradation to originate a regulatory loop where beta-catenin plays a central role in cell decision between life and death. Here we proved that the cytoplasmic accumulation of beta-catenin driven by up-regulation of its antagonist Chibby1 is a component of autophagy induction in response to imatinib in BCR-ABL1+ cells opposing the apoptotic death. It is contingent upon ER stress and elevation of free Ca(2+) cytosolic concentration and results in the calpain cleavage into a 28kDa fragment implicated in beta-catenin proteasome-independent degradation. More important for BCR-ABL1+ cell survival and proliferation following IM treatment, might be the calpain-mediated cleavage of beta-catenin accumulated within the cytoplasmic compartment into a 75kDa fragment, still owning TCF-dependent transcriptional activity. Such a beta-catenin fragment might be crucial for BCR-ABL1+ cell survival following the fusion protein TK inhibition.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Although this is an effective treatment, it results in untoward toxicity. Bendamustine is a newly approved and better-tolerated alkylating agent. We hypothesized that similar to cyclophosphamide, bendamustine-induced DNA damage will be inhibited by fludarabine, resulting in increased cytotoxicity. To test this hypothesis and the role of the stromal microenvironment in this process, we treated CLL lymphocytes in vitro with each drug alone and in combination. Simultaneous or prior addition of fludarabine to bendamustine resulted in maximum cytotoxicity assayed by 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodine negativity, annexin positivity, and poly (adenosine 5'-diphosphate-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Cytotoxicity elicited by combination of both agents was similar in these malignant B cells cultured either in suspension or on marrow stroma cells. Cell death was associated with DNA damage response, which was determined by phosphorylation of H2AX and unscheduled DNA synthesis. H2AX activation was maximum with the drug combination, and unscheduled DNA synthesis induced by bendamustine was blocked by fludarabine. In parallel, ATM, Chk2, and p53 were phosphorylated and PUMA was induced. Cell death was caspase independent; however, caspases did decrease levels of Mcl-1 survival protein.

From August 2009 to August 2013, 38 consecutive patients using TBI/Cy plus ATG regimen for T cell-replete haplo-HSCT (TBI group) at our center were eligible, which contained 28 high-risk and 10 standard-risk patients. A nested case-control study was designed. Seventy-seven patients using modified Bu/Cy plus ATG regimen (Bu group) were randomly selected in a 1 to 3:1 ratio matching for age, disease and status, year of HSCT (+/-2 years), and length of follow-up. Only 1 graft failure occurred in the TBI group. The incidence and time of neutrophil and platelet engraftment were comparable between the 2 groups. Severe grades III/IV graft-versus-host disease was observed in 13.4% of Bu group and only 2.6% of TBI group (P = .083). More toxicity of the liver (37.7% versus 10.5%; P = .002) and more hemorrhagic cystitis occurred in the Bu group (49.3% versus 23.7%, P = .008). Diarrhea was more common in the TBI group (44.7% versus 22.1%; P = .031). No significant differences were found in the 2-year incidences of relapse (26.5% for TBI group versus 32.3% for Bu group, P = .742), 1-year transplant-related mortality (12.6% versus 16.2%, P = .862), 2-year overall survival (60.2% versus 57.0%, P = .937), and 2-year incidence of disease-free survival (57.9% versus 56.6%, P = .845) between the 2 groups. We conclude that the TBI/Cy plus ATG regimen seems to be feasible in T cell-replete haplo-HSCT, which promotes stable engraftment and a lower incidence of liver toxicity and hemorrhagic cystitis.

Of these patients, 59 received chemotherapy alone (group A) and 79 received unmanipulated haploidentical HSCT (group B). Cumulative incidence of relapse at 5 years in group A was significantly higher than that in group B (66.3% versus 29.9%, P < .0001). Overall and disease-free survival in group A were significantly inferior to group B (P < .0001). Moreover, multivariate analyses demonstrated that central nervous system leukemia (P = .002), T cell immunophenotype (P = .044), expression of E2A-PBX1 (P = .007), and positive minimal residual disease after the first cycle of consolidation (P = .004) were correlated with relapse. Patients with 1 of 4 risk factors were assigned to the high-risk group. Otherwise, patients without risk factors were assigned to the low-risk group. In the high-risk group, HSCT had lower relapse rates and superior DFS compared with chemotherapy (P < .05), but in the low-risk group, there were no differences between HSCT and chemotherapy (P > .05). This study is the first to demonstrate that compared with chemotherapy alone, haploidentical HSCT is a better postremission therapy in adults with standard-risk ALL in CR1. Moreover, based on the 4 risk factors, the establishment of risk stratification could identify the subgroup of patients with a higher risk of relapse in adults with standard-risk ALL in CR1. Furthermore, risk stratification-directed postremission therapies using haploidentical HSCT or chemotherapy alone not only reduce relapse rate but also avoid unnecessary treatment-related mortality and improve survival.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, prediction of DILI is difficult because the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. To establish a novel cell-based screening system to suggest drugs with hepatotoxic potential in preclinical drug development, comprehensive gene expression analyses during in vivo DILI are necessary. Using in vivo mouse DILI models and 4 sets of hepatotoxic positive and non-hepatotoxic drugs, we found that the hepatic mRNA levels of S100A8; S100A9; ""NATCH, LRR, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3"" (NALP3); interleukin (IL)-1beta; and the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) were commonly increased in hepatotoxic drug-administered mice compared to non-hepatotoxic drug-administered mice. To clarify whether these 5 in vivo biomarkers can be applied to a cell-based screening system, we adapted human liver microsomes (HLM) in the presence of NADPH to assess the metabolic activation reaction, and we also adapted human monocytic leukemia cells HL-60, K562, KG-1 and THP-1 to assess the effects on mRNA expression of immune- and inflammatory-related factors. We investigated 30 clinical drugs with different safety profiles with regard to DILI and found that the total sum score of gene expression levels of S100A8, S100A9, RAGE, NALP3 and IL-1beta mRNA in HL-60 or K562 cells incubated with HLM, could identify drugs at high risk for hepatotoxicity.

We also examined the effects of exposure to nanosized metal oxide particles on macrophage cholesterol uptake and foam cell formation. The 16-hour exposure to ZnO particles increased the level of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and induced the migration of THP-1 monocyte mediated by increased MCP-1. Exposure to ZnO particles also induced adhesion of THP-1 cells to HUVECs. Moreover, exposure to ZnO particles, but not TiO2 particles, upregulated the expression of membrane scavenger receptors of modified LDL and increased cholesterol uptake in THP-1 monocytes/macrophages. In the present study, we found that exposure to ZnO particles increased macrophage cholesterol uptake, which was mediated by an upregulation of membrane scavenger receptors of modified LDL.

CSF3R mutations were detected in 2 cases out of 156 de novo AML patients (1.2%) and eighteen cases out of 23 secondary AML patients (78.2%). It was noticed that most of the mutant cases are of younger age, have a high white blood cells count, high bone marrow blasts, bad performance status, and absence of extra medullary disease and with low rate induction remission. Also the overall survival of AML patient's secondary to CSF3R mutations was shorter as compared to those with wild type AML cases.

Profiling mRNA and microRNA expression are discussed in view of their applicability to class prediction, class discovery, and comparison, as well as outcome prediction, and special attention is paid to the recent advances in our understanding of the role of alternative RNA splicing in AML. In addition to microarray-based GEP approaches, over the last few years RNA sequencing based on next-generation sequencing technology is gaining wider recognition as an advanced tool for transcriptome profiling. Therefore, the advantages of RNA sequencing-based GEP and its current and potential implications in AML are discussed. Finally, we also highlight recent efforts to integrate already available and newly acquired omics data sets so that a more precise understanding of AML biology and clinical behavior can be achieved, which ultimately will contribute to further refine leukemia management.","['Copyright (c) 2014 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

In response to DNA damage, this complex regulates pre-mRNA splicing of a number of genes involved in DNA damage signaling and repair, thereby promoting the stability of these transcripts/proteins. Further, we show that abrogation of this complex results in sensitivity to DNA damage, defective DNA repair, and genomic instability. Interestingly, mutations in a number of proteins found within this complex have been identified in numerous cancer types.

We recently described the hematopoietic tissue distribution patterns of CD137 and CD137 ligand (CD137L), which have shown promise as immunotherapeutic targets. CD137 expression was primarily confined to cells in the microenvironment, whereas CD137L was expressed in neoplastic cells in most B-cell lymphomas. Here we evaluate the use of CD137L in the detection of small B-cell lymphomas involving the bone marrow. To test the potential efficacy of CD137L in detecting bone marrow lymphoid infiltrates, 166 small B-cell lymphomas were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and double-immunofluorescence labeling on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded bone marrow core biopsies. CD137L was highly expressed in bone marrows involved by small B-cell lymphomas and included hairy cell leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, B-lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In addition, a small subset of marginal zone lymphoma and most of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma showed staining. Normal bone marrow cells including myeloid, erythroid and megakaryocytic precursors, and reactive lymphoid aggregates lacked staining. Our findings show that immunohistochemistry for CD137L is capable of reliably distinguishing small B-cell lymphomas from reactive lymphoid aggregates. These data also suggest that CD137L is useful in providing staging information for clinical diagnosis and is likely to furnish a potential target for minimal residual disease assessment as well as immunotherapy in patients with stage 4 disease.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, we analyzed fetal liver hematopoiesis from second trimester pregnancies in trisomy 21 and screened for GATA1 mutations. We examined 57 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded fetal liver specimens (49 harboring trisomy 21 and 8 controls) by immunohistochemistry for CD34, CD61, factor VIII, and glycophorin A.

Making use of laminar flows, which formed in microchannels, single cells were aligned and continuously introduced into the sample channel and then detection channel in the chip. In order to rapidly lyse the moving cells and completely transport cellular contents into the detection channel, the angle of the side-flow channels, the asymmetric design of the channels, and the number, shape and layout of micro-obstacles were optimized for effectively redistributing and mixing the laminar flows of single cells suspension, cell lysing reagent and detection buffer. The optimized microfluidic chip was an asymmetric structure of three microchannels, with three microcylinders at the proper positions in the intersections of channels. The microchip was evaluated by detection of anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) uptake and membrane surface P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression in single leukemia K562 cells. An average throughput of 6-8 cells min(-1) was achieved. The detection results showed the cellular heterogeneity in DOX uptake and surface P-gp expression within K562 cells.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are closely involved in the development and progression of various tumors. Here we investigated the dysregulation of miRNAs in ATL and its clinical significance. Studies using miRNA arrays and subsequent real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that, in the 9 ATL cell lines examined, 1 miRNA was consistently up-regulated, whereas another 3 were consistently down-regulated, compared with normal CD4-positive lymphocytes. Next, we analyzed the prognostic impact of these 4 miRNAs in patients with aggressive-type ATL (n = 40). Of the 4 dysregulated miRNAs selected, 3 (miR-130b higher expression, miR-145 lower expression, and miR-223 lower expression) were significantly associated with a worsened overall patient survival. We found that expressions of these 3 miRNAs were correlated with each other. To clarify which of the 3 had the most significant impact on overall survival, we performed a multivariate prognostic analysis that included these 3 miRNAs, and only miR-145 lower expression was selected as an independent risk factor (P = .0005). When overexpressed in an ATL cell line in vitro, miR-145 specifically inhibited tumor cell growth. In conclusion, our study suggests that miR-145 down-regulation provides a growth advantage in ATL and is highly associated with a worsened prognosis for patients with ALT. Hence, miR-145 may be a useful prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target for ATL.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Cancer patients canexperience >1 infectious episode during the same period of neutropenia. This study aimed to determine the etiologicaland clinical characteristics of secondary infectious episodes in cancer patients with febrile neutropenia and to identifythe factors associated with the risk of secondary infectious episodes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All cancer patients that received antineoplastic chemotherapy at Ankara University, School ofMedicine, Department of Hematology between May 2004 and May 2005 and developed neutropenia were included in thestudy. Data were collected using survey forms that were completed during routine infectious diseases consultation visits.Categorical data were analyzed using the chi-square test, whereas Student's t-test was used for continuous variables.Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of secondary infections (SIs). RESULTS: SIs were observed during 138 (53%) of 259 febrile neutropenic episodes. Of the 138 episodes, 89 (64.5%)occurred in male patients with a mean age of 40.9 years (range: 17-76 years). In total, 80% of the SIs were clinically ormicrobiologically documented. Factors on d 4 of the initial febrile episode were analyzed via a logistic regression model. The presence of a central intravenous catheter (OR: 3.01; P<0.001), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as the underlyingdisease (OR: 2.12; P=0.008), diarrhea (OR: 4.59; P=0.005), and invasive aspergillosis (IA) during the initial febrileepisode (OR: 3.96; P=0.009) were statistically significant risk factors for SIs.

The aim of this study was to determine the rate of t(14;18) positivity based onthe detection of mbr or mcr in paraffin-embedded tissue samples. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 32 paraffin-embedded tissue samples collected from 32 consecutive FL patients that were diagnosed and followed-up at our hospital between 1999 and 2006. The MBR breakpoint wasidentified based on real-time PCR using a LightCycler v.2.0 t(14;18) Quantification Kit (MBR), multiplex PCR, and seminestedPCR. To identify the mcr breakpoint, real-time PCR was performed using specific primers and the FastStart DNAMaster SYBR Green I Kit. To detect t(14;18) via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) nuclei from paraffin-embeddedtissue sections were extracted and used together with LSI IgH (immunoglobulin heavy chain) (spectrum green)/bcl-2(B-cell leukemia-lymphoma 2) (spectrum orange) probes. RESULTS: The DNA and nuclei isolation success rate for B5 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections (n = 12)was 42% and 33%, respectively, versus 95% and 60%, respectively, for 20 tissue sections fixed in formalin only. In all,24 paraffin-embedded tissue sections were analyzed and mbr positivity was observed in the DNA of 82.14% via seminested PCR, in 53.57% via multiplex PCR, and in 28.57% via real-time PCR.

RESULTS: The distributions of the cell cycle S phase were 10, 63%, 6, 72% and 3, 59%; for CML, MM and controlpatients, respectively. Among all the cyclins expressed during the S phase, cyclin D expression was the lowest in the CMLpatients. Distribution of cyclins and CDKIs during the G2/M phase was similar in the MM and control groups, whereascyclin expression was similar during all 3 phases in the MM and CML groups.

A total of 297 patients between 65 and 82 years were enrolled in the study. The 141 patients received standard-dose therapy (daunorubicin 45 mg/m(2) x 3 days with cytarabine 100 mg/m(2) x 7 days for induction therapy, while post-induction therapy consisted of high-dose cytarabine 1.5 g/m(2) x 4 days), and the attenuated treatment (daunorubicin 30 mg/m(2) x 3 days with cytarabine 75 mg/m(2) x 7 days for induction therapy, while post-induction therapy consisted of attenuated high-dose Ara-C 1.0 g/m(2) x 3 days) was administered to the remaining 156 patients, based on a random number assigned. Total 168 patients (56.6%) achieved complete remission with an incomplete blood recovery (CR)/CRi. No significant differences were observed between the two treatments (P = 0.60). Attenuated chemotherapy improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to standard-dose therapy; 5-year OS values for these two groups were 39 and 24 months, respectively (P < 0.001), and the PFS values for these two groups were 35 versus 23 months (P < 0.001). In addition, the attenuated treatment with a poor risk profile overcame the negative impact and yielded OS and PFS values similar to those of the standard-dose chemotherapy with a better-to-intermediate risk profile. Five-year OS values for these two groups were 28 versus 28 months (P = 0.89), and the 5-year PFS values were 27 and 28 months, respectively (P = 0.89).

It also aims to understand the effectiveness of several treatments used. METHODS: This is a longitudinal observational single-center study-convenience sample-which includes malignant hematologic inpatients submitted to high-dose CT from February to August 2012. We registered epidemiological data, diagnosis, oral mucositis daily questionnaire (OMDQ), World Health Organization (WHO) oral toxicity scale, and supportive medications used for mucositis. RESULTS: We evaluated 30 patients who had 73 episodes of hospitalization, having recorded the development of mucositis in 21.9 % (n = 16) episodes (22 patients with acute leukemia (AL) and 8 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)). Grades 3-4 mucositis was reported in 4.1 % of the total episodes. The results of OMDQ showed some limitations in the quality of life, of patients with mucositis, related with the ability to eat and drink due to mouth pain (p < 0.001). In patients with NHL and AL, neutropenia entails an increased risk of mucositis (p < 0.001). Patients who did not initiate early prophylaxis with conservative measures developed mucositis earlier (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of mucositis is high, being reported mainly in AL patients, with limitations in quality of life. Grade 4 neutropenia increases mucositis risk. Early prophylaxis with basic oral care may delay mucositis. Further studies are crucial to characterize mucositis epidemiology, physiopathology, and its management.",,"['Martinez, Jose Manuel', 'Pereira, Dulcineia', 'Chacim, Sergio', 'Mesquita, Edgar', 'Sousa, Ines', 'Martins, Angelo', 'Azevedo, Teresa', 'Mariz, Jose Mario']","['Martinez JM', 'Pereira D', 'Chacim S', 'Mesquita E', 'Sousa I', 'Martins A', 'Azevedo T', 'Mariz JM']","['Servico de OncoHematologia, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia do Porto, Francisco Gentil, Rua Dr. Antonio Bernardino de Almeida, 4200-072, Porto, Portugal, jmmartinez@ipoporto.min-saude.pt.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20140418,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quality of Life', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/04/20 06:00,2015/05/13 06:00,['2014/04/19 06:00'],"['2013/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-014-2199-y [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2014 Sep;22(9):2563-9. doi: 10.1007/s00520-014-2199-y.

Accurate diagnosis of this type of AMKL can be difficult, because a subset of patients have a bone marrow (BM) blast percentage of less than 20% due to BM fibrosis. Therefore, it is possible that past studies have underestimated this type of AMKL. We present here the case of a 4-month-old female AMKL patient who was diagnosed by presence of the RBM15-MKL1 (OTT-MAL) fusion transcript by RT-PCR. In addition, we monitored RBM15-MKL1 fusion at several time points as a marker of minimal residual disease (MRD), and found that it was continuously negative after the first induction chemotherapy even by nested RT-PCR. Detection of the RBM15-MKL1 fusion transcript thus seems to be useful for accurate diagnosis of AMKL with t(1;22)(p13;q13). We recommend that the RBM15-MKL1 fusion transcript be analyzed for all suspected AMKL in infants and young children.

CyclinD2, one of the cyclinD family, is overexpressed in T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and involved in the pathogenesis of leukemias. Recent reports indicated that CCND2 polymorphisms are associated with human cancer risk, thusly we hypothesized that CCND2 gene polymorphisms may contribute to childhood ALL susceptibility. We selected the polymorphism rs3217927 located in the 3'UTR region of CCND2 to assess its associations with childhood ALL risk in a case-control study. A significant difference was found in the genotype distributions of rs3217927 polymorphism between cases and controls (P = 0.019) and homozygous GG genotype may be an increased risk factor for childhood ALL (adjusted OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.14 -2.99). Furthermore, this increased risk was more pronounced with GG genotype among high-risk ALL (adjusted OR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.04-3.67), low-risk ALL (adjusted OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.13-3.87), B-phenotype ALL patients (adjusted OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.08-2.95) and T-phenotype ALL patients (adjusted OR = 2.87, 95% CI = 1.16-7.13). Our results provide evidence that CCND2 polymorphism rs3217927 may be involved in the etiology of childhood ALL, and the GG genotype of rs3217927 may modulate the genetic susceptibility to childhood ALL in the Chinese population.

The knockdown of Foxm1 results in the loss of mESC pluripotency in the presence of LIF, and the overexpression of Foxm1 alone maintains mESC pluripotency in the absence of LIF and feeder layers, indicating that Foxm1 is a mediator of LIF/Stat3-dependent maintenance of pluripotency in mESCs.

Currently, minimal residual disease may be detected by RQ-PCR or flow cytometry, both of which have practical and diagnostic limitations. Here, we describe a next-generation sequencing assay for minimal residual disease detection in NPM1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia, which encompasses approximately 60% of patients with normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia. Exon 12 of NPM1 was PCR amplified using sequencing adaptor-linked primers and deep sequenced to enable detection of low-prevalence, acute myeloid leukemia-specific activating mutations. We benchmarked our results against flow cytometry, the standard of care for acute myeloid leukemia minimal residual disease diagnosis at our institution. The performance of both approaches was evaluated using defined dilutions of an NPM1 mutation-positive cell line and longitudinal clinical samples from acute myeloid leukemia patients. Using defined control material, we found this assay sensitive to approximately 0.001% mutant cells, outperforming flow cytometry by an order of magnitude. Next-generation sequencing was precise and semiquantitative over four orders of magnitude. In 22 longitudinal samples from six acute myeloid leukemia patients, next-generation sequencing detected minimal residual disease in all samples deemed negative by flow cytometry. Further, in one-third of patients, sequencing detected alternate NPM1 mutations in addition to the patient's index mutation, consistent with tumor heterogeneity. Next-generation sequencing provides information without prior knowledge of NPM1 mutation subtype or validation of allele-specific probes as required for RQ-PCR assays, and without generation and interpretation of complex multidimensional flow cytometry data.

Dysregulation of this pathway, resulting in its constitutive activation, is associated with chronic inflammation and cancer development. In the present study, we show that activity of protein kinase II (CK2), a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase, is needed for induced activation of STAT1 and STAT3 by IL-6 classic and trans-signaling, IL-11, IL-27, oncostatin M (OSM), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1). Inhibition of CK2 efficiently prevented STAT phosphorylation and inhibited cytokine-dependent cell proliferation in a Jak1-dependent manner. Conversely, forced activation of CK2 alone was not sufficient to induce activation of the Jak/STAT signaling pathway. Inhibition of CK2 in turn inhibited Jak1-dependent STAT activation by oncogenic gp130 mutations. Furthermore, CK2 inhibition diminished the Jak1- and Src kinase-dependent phosphorylation of a constitutively active STAT3 mutant recently described in human large granular lymphocytic leukemia. In conclusion, we characterize CK2 as an essential component of the Jak/STAT pathway.

The transcriptional profile of pluripotent stem cells has been demonstrated to be extremely heterogeneous from cell to cell, and how the silencing of retroviral DNAs is achieved is not yet well characterized. RESULTS: In the current study, we investigated the transcriptional silencing dynamics in stem cells by independently monitoring the expression of two Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) retroviral vectors newly introduced into embryonic carcinoma (EC) cells. Although MMLV is efficiently silenced by epigenetic mechanisms in most such cells, a small number of the doubly-transduced EC cells transiently show double-positive proviral expression. These cells were sorted and their expression patterns were studied over time as silencing is established. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that retroviral silencing occurs stochastically, in an individual locus-specific fashion, and often without synchronous silencing of both viruses in the same cells. Surprisingly, the chromatin modifications that mark the silenced proviruses are unchanged even in cells that temporarily escape silencing.

CCA cells frequently overexpress the antiapoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia-1(Mcl-1), which is responsible for its extraordinary ability to evade cell death. Triptolide, a bioactive ingredient extracted from Chinese medicinal plant, has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in several cancers. METHODS: CCK-8 assay was performed to detect cell survival rate in vitro. DAPI staining and Flow cytometry were used to analyze apoptosis. Western blot was performed to determine the expression levels of caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-9, PARP, and Mcl-1. Quantitative real-time PCR and immunofluorescence were used to detect the expression levels of Mcl-1. The nude mice xenograft model was used to evaluate the antitumor effect of triptolide in vivo. RESULTS: Triptolide reduced cell viability in cholangiocarcinoma cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 12.6 +/- 0.6 nM, 20.5 +/- 4.2 nM, and 18.5 +/- 0.7 nM at 48 h for HuCCT1, QBC939, and FRH0201 respectively. Triptolide induced apoptosis in CCA cell lines in part through mitochondrial pathway. Using quantitative real-time PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence, we have shown that triptolide downregulates Mcl-1 mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, triptolide inhibited the CCA growth in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Triptolide has profound antitumor effect on CCA, probably by inducing apoptosis through inhibition of Mcl-1.

Although CD40 agonists have clinical activity in humans, the associated systemic activation of the immune system triggers dose-limiting side-effects. METHODS: To increase the tumor selectivity of CD40 agonist-based therapies, we developed an approach in which soluble trimeric CD40L (sCD40L) is genetically fused to tumor targeting antibody fragments, yielding scFv:CD40L fusion proteins. We hypothesized that scFv:CD40L fusion proteins would have reduced CD40 agonist activity similar to sCD40L but will be converted to a highly agonistic membrane CD40L-like form of CD40L upon anchoring to cell surface exposed antigen via the scFv domain. RESULTS: Targeted delivery of CD40L to the carcinoma marker EpCAM on carcinoma cells induced dose-dependent paracrine maturation of DCs ~20-fold more effective than a non-targeted control scFv:CD40L fusion protein. Similarly, targeted delivery of CD40L to the B cell leukemia marker CD20 induced effective paracrine maturation of DCs. Of note, the CD20-selective delivery of CD40L also triggered loss of cell viability in certain B cell leukemic cell lines as a result of CD20-induced apoptosis.

The clinical relevance of HLA-G in several malignancies has been reported. However, the role of HLA-G expression and functions in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is still controversial. Our group identified a subset of tolerogenic dendritic cells, DC-10 that express HLA-G and secrete IL-10. DC-10 are present in the peripheral blood and are essential in promoting and maintaining tolerance via the induction of adaptive T regulatory (Treg) cells. We investigated HLA-G expression on blasts and the presence of HLA-G-expressing DC-10 and CD4(+) T cells in the peripheral blood of AML patients at diagnosis. Moreover, we explored the possible influence of the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of HLA-G, which has been associated with HLA-G expression, on AML susceptibility.

MATERIALS/METHODS: Cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide) assay. Apoptosis was detected using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenyllindile (DAPI) staining, agarose gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry. The protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis. Caspase activity was measured using a colorimetric assay. RESULTS: Exposure to HEABG was found to result in a concentration- and time-dependent growth inhibition by induction of apoptosis, which was associated with an up-regulation of death receptor 4 and Fas legend, and an increase in the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 protein expression. Apoptosis-inducing concentrations of HEABG induced the activation of caspase-9, an initiator caspase of the mitochodrial mediated intrinsic pathway, and caspase-3, accompanied by proteolytic degradation of poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase. HEABG also induced apoptosis via a death receptor mediated extrinsic pathway by caspase-8 activation, resulting in the truncation of Bid, and suggesting the existence of cross-talk between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. However, pre-treatment of U937 cells with the caspase-3 inhibitor, z-DEVD-fmk, significantly blocked the HEABG-induced apoptosis of these cells, and increased the survival rate of HEABG-treated cells, confirming that HEABG-induced apoptosis is mediated through activation of caspase cascade. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the overall results, we suggest that HEABG reduces leukemic cell growth by inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, implying its potential therapeutic value in the treatment of leukemia.",,"['Park, Cheol', 'Park, Sejin', 'Chung, Yoon Ho', 'Kim, Gi-Young', 'Choi, Young Whan', 'Kim, Byung Woo', 'Choi, Yung Hyun']","['Park C', 'Park S', 'Chung YH', 'Kim GY', 'Choi YW', 'Kim BW', 'Choi YH']","['Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, Dongeui University, Busan 614-714, Korea.', 'Department of Horticultural Bioscience, College of Natural Resource and Life Sciences, Pusan National University, Gyeongnam 627-706, Korea.', 'Duksan B&F Co.

The mechanisms that regulate these proportions are unknown. Here, we examined whether virion proportions of Gag, Gag-Pol, and gRNA were determined by sampling (that is, if they reflected expression ratios or intracellular concentrations) or more specific recruitment. To this end, MoMLV Gag, Gag-Pol, and gRNA were expressed separately or together in various ratios. Varying the expression ratios of Gag and Gag-Pol revealed that Gag-Pol incorporation was stochastic and that the conserved 20:1 Gag/Gag-Pol ratio coincided with maximal particle production. When skewed expression ratios resulted in excess Gag-Pol, the released virions maintained the intracellular Gag/Gag-Pol ratios and the infectivity per virion was largely maintained, but virion production decreased sharply with high levels of Gag-Pol. The determinants of gRNA proportions were addressed by manipulating the amounts and contexts of functional nucleocapsid (NC) and the ratios of Gag to gRNA. The results showed that the NC domain of either Gag or Gag-Pol could provide gRNA packaging functions equally well. Unlike Gag-Pol, gRNA incorporation was saturable. An upper limit of gRNA incorporation was observed, and particle production was not disrupted by excess gRNA expression. These results indicate that the determinants of Gag/Gag-Pol proportions differ from those for Gag/gRNA. On the basis of the assumption that MoMLV evolved to produce virion components in optimal proportions, these data provide a means of estimating the proportion of unspliced MoMLV RNA that serves as genomic RNA. IMPORTANCE: Viruses assemble their progeny from within the cells that they parasitize, where they must sort through a rich milieu of host proteins and nucleic acids to gather together their own building blocks, which are also proteins and nucleic acids. The research described here addresses whether or not the proportions of viral proteins and nucleic acids that are brought together to form a retroviral particle are determined by random sampling from the cell-and thus dictated by the components' availabilities within the cell-or if the amounts of each molecule are specified by the virus replication process. The results indicated that protein components of the murine retrovirus studied here are recruited by chance but that a specific counting mechanism defines the amount of nucleic acid incorporated into each progeny virion.","['Copyright (c) 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

We developed a facile and inexpensive fluorimetric microplate assay for the quantitation of 2HG and performed an unbiased small-molecule screen in live cells to identify compounds capable of perturbing 2HG production. Zaprinast, a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, was identified as an efficacious modulator of 2HG production and confirmed to lower 2HG levels in vivo. The mechanism of action was not due to cGMP stabilization, but rather, profiling of metabolites upstream of mutant IDH1 pointed to targeted inhibition of the enzyme glutaminase (GLS). Zaprinast treatment reversed histone hypermethylation and soft-agar growth of IDH1-mutant cells, and treatment of glutamine-addicted pancreatic cancer cells reduced growth and sensitized cells to oxidative damage. Thus, Zaprinast is efficacious against glutamine metabolism and further establishes the therapeutic linkages between GLS and 2HG-mediated oncogenesis. SIGNIFICANCE: Gain-of-function IDH mutations are common events in glioma, acute myelogenous leukemia, and other cancer types, which lead to the accumulation of the oncometabolite 2HG. We show that the drug Zaprinast is capable of reducing cellular 2HG levels by inhibiting the upstream enzyme GLS, thus identifying a new strategy to target 2HG production in selected IDH-mutant cancers.",['(c)2014 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Elhammali, Adnan', 'Ippolito, Joseph E', 'Collins, Lynne', 'Crowley, Jan', 'Marasa, Jayne', 'Piwnica-Worms, David']","['Elhammali A', 'Ippolito JE', 'Collins L', 'Crowley J', 'Marasa J', 'Piwnica-Worms D']","[""Authors' Affiliations:BRIGHT Institute, Molecular Imaging Center, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology;"", ""Authors' Affiliations:BRIGHT Institute, Molecular Imaging Center, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology;"", ""Authors' Affiliations:BRIGHT Institute, Molecular Imaging Center, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology;"", 'Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri; and.', ""Authors' Affiliations:BRIGHT Institute, Molecular Imaging Center, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology;"", ""Authors' Affiliations:BRIGHT Institute, Molecular Imaging Center, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology; Department of Cancer Systems Imaging, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas dpiwnica-worms@mdanderson.org.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140416,United States,Cancer Discov,Cancer discovery,101561693,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fibrosarcoma/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Glutaminase', 'Glutarates/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Histones', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Purinones/*pharmacology']",,,2014/04/18 06:00,2015/02/25 06:00,['2014/04/18 06:00'],"['2014/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['2159-8290.CD-13-0572 [pii]', '10.1158/2159-8290.CD-13-0572 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Discov. 2014 Jul;4(7):828-39. doi: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-13-0572.

In this new context, we aimed to reassess the value of conventional risk factors with regard to new genetic alterations and early response to therapy, as assessed by immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor minimal residual disease (MRD) levels. The study was performed in 423 younger adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL in first remission (265 B-cell precursor [BCP] and 158 T-cell ALL), with cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) as the primary end point. In addition to conventional risk factors, the most frequent currently available genetic alterations were included in the analysis. A higher specific hazard of relapse was independently associated with postinduction MRD level >/=10(-4) and unfavorable genetic characteristics (ie, MLL gene rearrangement or focal IKZF1 gene deletion in BCP-ALL and no NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutation and/or N/K-RAS mutation and/or PTEN gene alteration in T-cell ALL). These 2 factors allowed definition of a new risk classification that is strongly associated with higher CIR and shorter relapse-free and overall survival.

24740538,NLM,MEDLINE,20140818,20211021,1522-1563 (Electronic) 0363-6143 (Linking),306,12,2014 Jun 15,Jun kinase-induced overexpression of leukemia-associated Rho GEF (LARG) mediates sustained hypercontraction of longitudinal smooth muscle in inflammation.,C1129-41,10.1152/ajpcell.00021.2014 [doi],"The signaling pathways mediating sustained contraction of mouse colonic longitudinal smooth muscle and the mechanisms involved in hypercontractility of this muscle layer in response to cytokines and TNBS-induced colitis have not been fully explored. In control longitudinal smooth muscle cells, ACh acting via m3 receptors activated sequentially Galpha12, RhoGEF (LARG), and the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway. There was abundant expression of MYPT1, minimal expression of CPI-17, and a notable absence of a PKC/CPI-17 pathway. LARG expression was increased in longitudinal muscle cells isolated from muscle strips cultured for 24 h with IL-1beta or TNF-alpha or obtained from the colon of TNBS-treated mice. The increase in LARG expression was accompanied by a significant increase in ACh-stimulated Rho kinase and ZIP kinase activities, and sustained muscle contraction. The increase in LARG expression, Rho kinase and ZIP kinase activities, and sustained muscle contraction was abolished in cells pretreated with the Jun kinase inhibitor, SP600125. Expression of the MLCP activator, telokin, and MLCP activity were also decreased in longitudinal muscle cells from TNBS-treated mice or from strips treated with IL-1beta or TNF-alpha. In contrast, previous studies had shown that sustained contraction in circular smooth muscle is mediated by sequential activation of Galpha13, p115RhoGEF, and dual RhoA-dependent pathways involving phosphorylation of MYPT1 and CPI-17. In colonic circular smooth muscle cells isolated from TNBS-treated mice or from strips treated with IL-1beta or TNF-alpha, CPI-17 expression and sustained muscle contraction were decreased.

SSc is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by immune activation, fibrosis of the skin and internal organs and obliterative vasculopathy affecting predominantly the microvessels. Remarkable progress has been made in the past few years emphasizing the importance of epigenetic modifications in the pathogenesis of many disorders, including SSc. Current evidence demonstrates alterations in DNA methylation, histone code modifications and changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression levels in SSc cells. Recent reports have described the differential expression of numerous regulatory miRNAs in SSc, mainly in SSc fibroblasts, a number of which are important in TGF-beta pathways and downstream signalling cascades. While studies to date have revealed the significant role of epigenetic modifications in the pathogenesis of SSc, the causal nature of epigenetic alterations in SSc pathogenesis remains elusive. Additional longitudinal and comprehensive epigenetic studies designed to evaluate the effect of environmental epigenetic factors on disease pathogenesis are needed.","['(c) The Author 2014.

Diosgenin, a plant steroid, is able to induce megakaryocytic differentiation or apoptosis in human HEL erythroleukemia cells in a dose-dependent manner. However, the exact mechanism by which diosgenin induces megakaryocytic differentiation has not been elucidated. In this study, we studied the involvement of Sonic Hedgehog in megakaryocytic differentiation induced by diosgenin in HEL cells. First, we showed that different elements of the Hedgehog pathway are expressed in our model by qRT-PCR. Then, we focused our interest on key elements in the Sonic Hedgehog pathway: Smoothened receptor, GLI transcription factor and the ligand Sonic Hedgehog. We showed that Smoothened and Sonic Hedgehog were overexpressed in disogenin-treated cells and that GLI transcription factors were activated. Then, we showed that SMO inhibition using siSMO or the GLI antagonist GANT-61, blocked megakaryocytic differentiation induced by diosgenin in HEL cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Sonic Hedgehog pathway inhibition led to inhibition of ERK1/2 activation, a major physiological pathway involved in megakaryocytic differentiation.

AIMS: To assess the therapy related serial bone marrow changes in patients of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Prospective study, carried out in Lymphoma- Leukemia Lab, Department of Pathology, K.G.M.U from March 2011 to March 2012. A total of 60 cases were studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: History, complete hemogram, bone marrow examination at pretherapy (Day-0), intratherapy (Day-14), and end of induction chemotherapy (Day-28) were done. Peripheral blood smears were evaluated at regular interval to assess clearance of blast cells. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The statistical analysis was done using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) Version 15.0 statistical Analysis Software. The values were represented in Number (%) and Mean +/- SD. The following Statistical formulas were used: Mean, standard deviation, Chi square test, Paired ""t"" test, Student 't' test, Level of significance P. RESULTS: Incidence of ALL-L1 (46.7%) and ALL-L2 (53.3%) was equal. ALL-L2 patients had poor survival.Day 0 (D-0) bone marrow was hypercellular with flooding of marrow by leukemic cells. High levels of tumor load at D'0' were associated with poor survival. 14 th day of Induction phase showed significant decrease in hemoglobin and TLC as compared to D '0' parameters. D28 showed marrow regeneration. Cellularity, Blast%, and Leukemic Index showed significant drop from day '0' to day 14 due to myelosupression, whereas regeneration reflected by increased cellularity as per day 28 marrow. Lymphocytosis (>20%) at end of induction chemotherapy had better survival and longer remission.Risk of mortality was directly proportional to blast clearance and was a major independent prognostic factor for achievement of complete remission. CONCLUSIONS: A bone marrow examination at the end of induction chemotherapy provides information whether patient has achieved remission with regeneration of cells or still has residual leukemia. If the patient is in remission, maintenance treatment is started and if not more intensive chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation may be embarked upon.",,"['Kushwaha, Rashmi', 'Kumar, Ashutosh', 'Aggrawal, Kamal', 'Nigam, Neha', 'Kumar, Archana']","['Kushwaha R', 'Kumar A', 'Aggrawal K', 'Nigam N', 'Kumar A']","['Department of Pathology, K.G.M.U, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,7605904,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Blood Cells', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Prospective Studies']",,,2014/04/18 06:00,2015/04/08 06:00,['2014/04/18 06:00'],"['2014/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJPatholMicrobiol_2014_57_1_72_130903 [pii]', '10.4103/0377-4929.130903 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Pathol Microbiol. 2014 Jan-Mar;57(1):72-7. doi: 10.4103/0377-4929.130903.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the magnitude of this drug interaction remains unclear. At present, quantitative information about the interaction profile of imatinib is scarce. METHODS: The authors report the effect of imatinib on cyclosporine exposure in 6 pediatric patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia who received cyclosporine after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Dose-normalized cyclosporine trough blood concentrations (TBC) were obtained before and after imatinib introduction. In addition, a validated model-based approach was used to derive quantitative predictions of CYP3A4-mediated drug interactions with imatinib as a victim or precipitant drug. RESULTS: The mean dose-normalized cyclosporine TBC significantly increased after 3 to 7 days of imatinib therapy. The modeling approach predicted weak-to-moderate effect of major CYP3A4 inhibitors on imatinib exposure. However, the inhibitory potency of imatinib was found to be similar to that of verapamil, suggesting significant influence of imatinib on the pharmacokinetics of drugs highly metabolized by CYP3A4. Observed increases in cyclosporine dose-normalized TBC of the 6 patients were compatible with model predictions. The observations and predictions suggest that imatinib may substantially increase cyclosporine exposure.

Previous research with mTOR or MEK inhibitors revealed cytostatic, rather than cytotoxic, effects in in vitro and in vivo AML models. We evaluated the combination effect of the mTOR inhibitor AZD8055 and the MEK inhibitor selumetinib on human AML cell lines and primary AML samples. This combination demonstrated synergistic proapoptotic effects in AML cells with high basal activation of MEK and mTOR. We next incorporated the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 into this combination regimen to block Bcl-2, which further enhanced the apoptogenic effect of MEK/mTOR inhibition. The combination treatment also had a striking proapoptotic effect in CD33(+)/CD34(+) AML progenitor cells from primary AML samples with NRAS mutations. Mechanistically, upregulation of the proapoptotic protein Bim, accompanied by the downregulation of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 (mainly via protein degradation), seemed to play critical roles in enhancing the combination drug effect. Furthermore, the modulation of survivin, Bax, Puma, and X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) expression suggested a role for mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in the cytotoxicity of the drug combination. Consequently, the concomitant blockade of prosurvival MEK/mTOR signaling and the deactivation of Bcl-2 could provide a mechanism-based integrated therapeutic strategy for the eradication of AML cells.",['(c)2014 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Zhang, Weiguo', 'Ruvolo, Vivian R', 'Gao, Chen', 'Zhou, Liran', 'Bornmann, William', 'Tsao, Twee', 'Schober, Wendy D', 'Smith, Paul', 'Guichard, Sylvie', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Zhang W', 'Ruvolo VR', 'Gao C', 'Zhou L', 'Bornmann W', 'Tsao T', 'Schober WD', 'Smith P', 'Guichard S', 'Konopleva M', 'Andreeff M']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy; Departments of."", ""Authors' Affiliations: Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy; Departments of."", ""Authors' Affiliations: Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy; Departments of."", ""Authors' Affiliations: Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy; Departments of."", 'Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas; and.', ""Authors' Affiliations: Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy; Departments of."", ""Authors' Affiliations: Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy; Departments of."", 'Oncology iMED, AstraZeneca, Alderley Park, Macclesfield, United Kingdom.', 'Oncology iMED, AstraZeneca, Alderley Park, Macclesfield, United Kingdom.', ""Authors' Affiliations: Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy; Departments of Leukemia and mandreef@mdanderson.org mkonople@mdanderson.org."", ""Authors' Affiliations: Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy; Departments of Leukemia and mandreef@mdanderson.org mkonople@mdanderson.org.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140416,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzimidazoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Morpholines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells']",,,2014/04/18 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2014/04/18 06:00'],"['2014/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-13-0576 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-13-0576 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2014 Jul;13(7):1848-59. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-13-0576.

To biochemically characterize this interaction and identify potential therapeutic targets, we prepared GST-PEX9 forms containing structural blades B1B2 or B3B4. We recently described a sequence in blade B4 (P3 sequence) that bound alpha4beta1 integrin and partially impaired cell adhesion and migration. We have now studied the possible contribution of the B1B2 region to cell interaction with PEX9. CLL cells bound to GST-B1B2 and CD44 was the primary receptor. GST-B1B2 inhibited CLL cell migration as effectively as GST-B3B4. Overlapping synthetic peptides spanning the B1B2 region identified the sequence FDAIAEIGNQLYLFKDGKYW, present in B1 and contained in peptide P6, as the most effective site. P6 inhibited cell adhesion to PEX9 in a dose-dependent manner and with an IC50 value of 90 muM. P6 also inhibited cell adhesion to hyaluronan but had no effect on adhesion to VCAM-1 (alpha4beta1 integrin ligand), confirming its specific interaction with CD44. Spatial localization analyses mapped P6 to the central cavity of PEX9, in close proximity to the previously identified P3 sequence. Both P6 and P3 equally impaired cell adhesion to (pro)MMP-9. Moreover, P6 synergistically cooperated with P3, resulting in complete inhibition of CLL cell binding to PEX9, chemotaxis, and transendothelial migration. Thus, P6 is a novel sequence in PEX9 involved in cell-PEX9/(pro)MMP-9 binding by interacting with CD44. Targeting both sites, P6 and P3, should efficiently prevent (pro)MMP-9 binding to CLL cells and its pathological consequences.","['(c) 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Ugarte-Berzal, Estefania', 'Bailon, Elvira', 'Amigo-Jimenez, Irene', 'Albar, Juan Pablo', 'Garcia-Marco, Jose A', 'Garcia-Pardo, Angeles']","['Ugarte-Berzal E', 'Bailon E', 'Amigo-Jimenez I', 'Albar JP', 'Garcia-Marco JA', 'Garcia-Pardo A']","['From the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'From the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'From the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'the Proteomics Facility, Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, 28049 Madrid, Spain, and.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, 28222 Madrid, Spain.', 'From the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, 28040 Madrid, Spain, agarciapardo@cib.csic.es.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140416,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion/*physiology', 'Cell Movement/*physiology', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Design', 'Enzyme Precursors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Female', 'Hemopexin/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary']",['NOTNLM'],"['CD44', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Migration', 'Leukemia', 'Metalloprotease']",2014/04/18 06:00,2014/10/11 06:00,['2014/04/18 06:00'],"['2014/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)38595-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.559187 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 May 30;289(22):15340-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.559187.

Here, we evaluate CD8 T-cell immune response against this epitope in the presence and absence of dendritic cells (DCs) given the recent encouraging observations made with Phase 1 DC-based vaccine trial for ATL. To facilitate these studies, we first generated an HLA-A2/DTR hybrid mouse strain carrying the HLA-A2.1 and CD11c-DTR genes. We then studied CD8 T-cell immune response against Tax(11-19) epitope delivered in the absence or presence of Freund's adjuvant and/or DCs. Overall results demonstrate that naturally presented Tax epitope could initiate an antigen-specific CD8T cell response in vivo but failed to do so upon DC depletion.

Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and Cav-1 are frequently colocalized, suggesting an important role played by this interaction on cancer cell survival and proliferation. Thus, our attention was directed to a leukemia cell line (B1647) that constitutively produces VEGF and expresses the tyrosine-kinase receptor VEGFR-2. We investigated the presence of VEGFR-2 in caveolae/lipid rafts, focusing on the correlation between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and glucose transport modulation induced by VEGF, peculiar features of tumor proliferation. In order to better understand the involvement of VEGF/VEGFR-2 in the redox signal transduction, we evaluated the effect of different compounds able to inhibit VEGF interaction with its receptor by different mechanisms, corroborating the obtained results by immunoprecipitation and fluorescence techniques. Results here reported showed that, in B1647 leukemia cells, VEGFR-2 is present in caveolae through association with Cav-1, demonstrating that caveolae/lipid rafts act as platforms for negative modulation of VEGF redox signal transduction cascades leading to glucose uptake and cell proliferation, suggesting therefore novel potential targets.",,"['Caliceti, Cristiana', 'Zambonin, Laura', 'Rizzo, Benedetta', 'Fiorentini, Diana', 'Vieceli Dalla Sega, Francesco', 'Hrelia, Silvana', 'Prata, Cecilia']","['Caliceti C', 'Zambonin L', 'Rizzo B', 'Fiorentini D', 'Vieceli Dalla Sega F', 'Hrelia S', 'Prata C']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Via Fossato di Mortara 66, 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Via Irnerio 48, 40126 Bologna, Italy.', 'Department for Life Quality Studies, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, C.so Augusto 237, 47921 Rimini, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Via Irnerio 48, 40126 Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Via Irnerio 48, 40126 Bologna, Italy.', 'Department for Life Quality Studies, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, C.so Augusto 237, 47921 Rimini, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Via Irnerio 48, 40126 Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140311,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,IM,"['Caveolae/metabolism', 'Caveolin 1/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Microdomains/*metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phosphorylation', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/*metabolism']",,,2014/04/17 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/04/17 06:00'],"['2013/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/857504 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2014;2014:857504. doi: 10.1155/2014/857504.

Recent studies have indicated that some patients with positive mutations were refractory to EGFR TKIs if they harbored a B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma (Bcl-2)-like 11 (Bim) deletion polymorphism. The objective of the current work was to retrospectively study the Bim deletion polymorphism in Chinese patients with NSCLC and its correlation with the efficacy of EGFR TKIs. METHODS: Distribution of the Bim polymorphism was detected using polymerase chain reaction analysis and direct sequencing of DNA from peripheral neutrophils in samples from 352 patients with NSCLC. Of the 352 patients, 166 who received TKI therapy and had an activating mutation identified were involved in further analysis. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint of the subsequent analyses, and the incidence of the Bim polymorphism and its relation to clinical benefit from EGFR TKIs also were investigated. RESULTS: In total, 45 of 352 patient samples (12.8%) had the Bim deletion polymorphism, which was distributed randomly with regard to various clinical characteristics. In patients with EGFR mutations who received treatment with TKIs, the median PFS and the median objective response rate were 4.7 months and 25%, respectively, for those with the Bim deletion polymorphism versus 11 months (P = .003) and 66% (P = .001), respectively, for those with wild-type Bim. Cox regression analysis identified Bim status (P = .016) and sex (P = .002) as independent factors predicting clinical benefit from EGFR TKIs in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of the Bim deletion polymorphism was approximately 13% in this study, and it was associated with a poor clinical response to EGFR TKIs in patients who had NSCLC with EGFR mutations.",['(c) 2014 American Cancer Society.'],"['Zhao, Mingchuan', 'Zhang, Yishi', 'Cai, Weijing', 'Li, Jiayu', 'Zhou, Fei', 'Cheng, Ningning', 'Ren, Ruixin', 'Zhao, Chao', 'Li, Xuefei', 'Ren, Shengxiang', 'Zhou, Caicun', 'Hirsch, Fred R']","['Zhao M', 'Zhang Y', 'Cai W', 'Li J', 'Zhou F', 'Cheng N', 'Ren R', 'Zhao C', 'Li X', 'Ren S', 'Zhou C', 'Hirsch FR']","['Department of Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140415,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'China', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'ErbB Receptors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma (Bcl-2)-like 11', 'Bim', 'EGFR', 'epidermal growth factor receptor', 'non-small cell lung cancer', 'polymorphism', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2014/04/17 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/04/17 06:00'],"['2013/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2014/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28725 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2014 Aug 1;120(15):2299-307. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28725.

However, accurate risk-stratification at diagnosis or prognosis remained difficult. In order to further investigate the prognosis evaluation biomarker, the transcription or expression of neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) in 87 AML patients and 32 non-malignant controls were examined. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot were used to detect the NRP-1 expression. Clinical data were collected and analyzed for the 87 AML patients. The results indicated that high NRP-1 expression discriminated the complete remission (CR) rate of AML patients (22.12 % vs. 68.04 % for AML, P < 0.01). De novo AML patients tended to express higher NRP-1 proteins than relapsed AML patients. The overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) rate of the high NRP-1 expression patients decreased significantly compared with the low NRP-1 expression patients (P < 0.001). NRP-1 was revealed to be an independent risk factor for OS in AML (P = 0.003). In conclusion, NRP-1 could predict the shorter OS and RFS rate, and also related with the CR response in AML.

FLT3 inhibitors have shown clinical activity in AML with FLT3-ITD, but responses are usually short-lived. METHODS: This study examined 69 FLT3-mutated patients with AML, who were treated with different FLT3 inhibitors to analyze emergence of new mutations. RESULTS: At baseline, 87% of patients had an ITD mutation, 7% had a D835/I836 mutation, and 6% had combined ITD and D835/I836 mutations. Responses occurred in 32% of patients, all with FLT3-ITD; none of the patients with D835/I836 or ITD+D835/I836 responded. Mutational assessment at the time of FLT3 inhibitor discontinuation showed that 68% of patients were unchanged, 10% had become undetectable, and 22% of patients progressed from a single ITD to have combined ITD+D835/I836 mutations. In those patients with unchanged FLT3 mutation at progression, the median survival was 5 months, whereas in those with undetectable and with combined ITD+D835/I836 mutations, the median survival was 7 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm in vitro observations that a secondary tyrosine kinase domain mutation may arise after the use of FLT3 inhibitors in patients with single FLT3-ITD mutated AML, a phenomenon that is associated with resistance and a poor prognosis.",['(c) 2014 American Cancer Society.'],"['Alvarado, Yesid', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Cortes, Jorge E']","['Alvarado Y', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Luthra R', 'Ravandi F', 'Borthakur G', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Konopleva M', 'Estrov Z', 'Andreeff M', 'Cortes JE']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140415,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzothiazoles/therapeutic use', 'Carbazoles/therapeutic use', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Furans', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Medical Records', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Phenylurea Compounds/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sorafenib', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3 inhibitors', 'FLT3-ITD', 'FLT3-TKD', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'secondary FLT3 mutations']",2014/04/17 06:00,2014/08/29 06:00,['2014/04/17 06:00'],"['2013/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/23 00:00 [revised]', '2014/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28705 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2014 Jul 15;120(14):2142-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28705.

The expression of SODD proteins in different ALL groups was determined by immunocytochemistry. The SODD RNAi-interfering plasmid was constructed and transferred to Jurkat cells, and the effects of SODD expression on cell proliferation and apoptosis were analyzed using the MTT and FCM methods. The expressions of SODD, Phospho-NF-kappaB-P65, Bcl-2, and Caspase 3 were detected by Western blot analysis. The expression of SODD proteins was significantly higher in the ALL groups than in the control group (P < 0.05). The positive expression rate of SODD was significantly higher in refractory/relapsed and clinical high-risk groups than in standard-risk, initial treatment, and complete remission groups (P < 0.05). Microtubule-targeting drugs such as vincristine and taxol can notably down-regulate SODD expression during apoptosis, whereas DNR, and Ara-c cannot. The sensitivity of Jurkat cells to chemotherapeutic drugs increased with down-regulated SODD expression induced by SODD-interfering plasmid transfection. The sensitivity of the cells transfected with SODD-cloning genes decreased. SODD expression was high in the ALL children. These findings indicated that SODD over-expression might be correlated with the clinical classification, curative effect, and prognosis of ALL cells. Microtubule-targeting drugs can specifically down-regulate SODD expression in leukemic cells, thereby increasing the sensitivity of leukemic cells to SODD-targeting chemotherapeutics. In contrast, increased SODD expression tends to reduce sensitivity.",,"['Tao, H F', 'Liu, Y S', 'Fang, J L', 'Su, Y Z', 'Chen, F H', 'Zhou, L Y', 'Zhu, Y S']","['Tao HF', 'Liu YS', 'Fang JL', 'Su YZ', 'Chen FH', 'Zhou LY', 'Zhu YS']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China yuanshengliucn@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140324,Brazil,Genet Mol Res,Genetics and molecular research : GMR,101169387,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/04/17 06:00,2014/11/07 06:00,['2014/04/17 06:00'],"['2014/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/07 06:00 [medline]']","['gmr2849 [pii]', '10.4238/2014.March.24.6 [doi]']",epublish,Genet Mol Res. 2014 Mar 24;13(1):2020-31. doi: 10.4238/2014.March.24.6.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (BAG4 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study identifies protein tyrosine phophatase PRL-3 as a key mediator of FLT3-ITD-negative AML. METHODS: A total of 112 FLT3-ITD-negative AML patients were sampled between 2010 and 2013, and the occurrence of PRL-3 hyperexpression in FLT3-ITD-negative AML was evaluated by multivariate probit regression analysis. Overexpression or depletion of endogenous PRL-3 expression with the specific small interfering RNAs was performed to investigate the role of PRL-3 in AML progression. Xenograft models were also used to confirm the oncogenic role of PRL-3. RESULTS: Compared to healthy donors, PRL-3 is upregulated more than 3-fold in 40.2% of FLT3-ITD-negative AML patients. PRL-3 expression level is adversely correlated to the overall survival of the AML patients, and the AML relapses accompany with re-upregulation of PRL-3. Mechanistically, aberrant PRL-3 expression promoted cell cycle progression and enhanced the antiapoptotic machinery of AML cells to drug cytotoxicity through downregulation of p21 and upregulation of Cyclin D1 and CDK2 and activation of STAT5 and AKT. Depletion of endogenous PRL-3 sensitizes AML cells to therapeutic drugs, concomitant with apoptosis by upregulation of cleaved PARP (poly ADP ribose polymerase) and apoptosis-related caspases. Xenograft assays further confirmed PRL-3's oncogenic role in leukemogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that PRL-3 is a novel independent crucial player in both FLT3-ITD-positive and FLT3-ITD-negative AML and could be a potential therapeutic target.","['(c) 2014 The Authors.

Recently, these actinobacteria were shown to harbor self-resistance properties to salinosporamide A by expressing redundant catalytically active mutants of the 20S proteasome beta-subunit, reminiscent of PSMB5 mutations identified in cancer cells with acquired resistance to the founding proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ). Here, we assessed the growth inhibitory potential of salinosporamide A in human acute lymphocytic leukemia CCRF-CEM cells, and its 10-fold (CEM/BTZ7) and 123-fold (CEM/BTZ200) bortezomib-resistant sublines harboring PSMB5 mutations. Parental cells displayed sensitivity to salinosporamide A (IC50 = 5.1 nM), whereas their bortezomib-resistant sublines were 9- and 17-fold cross-resistant to salinosporamide A, respectively. Notably, combination experiments of salinosporamide A and bortezomib showed synergistic activity in CEM/BTZ200 cells. CEM cells gradually exposed to 20 nM salinosporamide A (CEM/S20) displayed stable 5-fold acquired resistance to salinosporamide A and were 3-fold cross-resistant to bortezomib. Consistent with the acquisition of a PSMB5 point mutation (M45V) in CEM/S20 cells, salinosporamide A displayed a markedly impaired capacity to inhibit beta5-associated catalytic activity. Last, compared with parental CEM cells, CEM/S20 cells exhibited up to 2.5-fold upregulation of constitutive proteasome subunits, while retaining unaltered immunoproteasome subunit expression. In conclusion, salinosporamide A displayed potent antileukemic activity against bortezomib-resistant leukemia cells. beta-Subunit point mutations as a common feature of acquired resistance to salinosporamide A and bortezomib in hematologic cells and S. tropica suggest an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of resistance to proteasome inhibitors.","['Copyright (c) 2014 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']","['Niewerth, Denise', 'Jansen, Gerrit', 'Riethoff, Lesley F V', 'van Meerloo, Johan', 'Kale, Andrew J', 'Moore, Bradley S', 'Assaraf, Yehuda G', 'Anderl, Janet L', 'Zweegman, Sonja', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Cloos, Jacqueline']","['Niewerth D', 'Jansen G', 'Riethoff LF', 'van Meerloo J', 'Kale AJ', 'Moore BS', 'Assaraf YG', 'Anderl JL', 'Zweegman S', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Cloos J']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology (D.N., L.F.V.R., J.v.M., G.J.L.K., J.C.), Department of Rheumatology (G.J.), and Department of Hematology (J.v.M., S.Z., J.C.), VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands;

They are highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), an aggressive form of leukemia with poor prognosis. Here, we show that miR-99a/100 approximately 125b tricistrons are transcribed as a polycistronic message transactivated by the homeobox transcription factor HOXA10. Integrative analysis of global gene expression profiling, miRNA target prediction, and pathway architecture revealed that miR-99a/100, let-7, and miR-125b functionally converge at the combinatorial block of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) pathway by targeting four receptor subunits and two SMAD signaling transducers. In addition, down-regulation of tumor suppressor genes adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)/APC2 stabilizes active beta-catenin and enhances Wnt signaling. By switching the balance between Wnt and TGFbeta signaling, the concerted action of these tricistronic miRNAs promoted sustained expansion of murine and human HSCs in vitro or in vivo while favoring megakaryocytic differentiation. Hence, our study explains the high phylogenetic conservation of the miR-99a/100 approximately 125b tricistrons controlling stem cell homeostasis, the deregulation of which contributes to the development of AMKL.",,"['Emmrich, Stephan', 'Rasche, Mareike', 'Schoning, Jennifer', 'Reimer, Christina', 'Keihani, Sarva', 'Maroz, Aliaksandra', 'Xie, Ying', 'Li, Zhe', 'Schambach, Axel', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Klusmann, Jan-Henning']","['Emmrich S', 'Rasche M', 'Schoning J', 'Reimer C', 'Keihani S', 'Maroz A', 'Xie Y', 'Li Z', 'Schambach A', 'Reinhardt D', 'Klusmann JH']","['Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover 30625, Germany;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, APC/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Homeostasis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', '*Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Thrombopoiesis/genetics', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['AMKL', 'TGFbeta', 'Wnt', 'hematopoiesis', 'let-7', 'miR-125']",2014/04/17 06:00,2014/05/30 06:00,['2014/04/17 06:00'],"['2014/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/30 06:00 [medline]']","['28/8/858 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.233791.113 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2014 Apr 15;28(8):858-74. doi: 10.1101/gad.233791.113.,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)']",,PMC4003278,"['R01 HL107663/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL107663/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['GEO/GSE56335'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, direct targets of the MLL fusion protein have been identified. However, functional validation of the identified targets remained unacknowledged. In this study, we identify CDK6 as a direct target of the MLL fusion protein and an important player in the proliferation advantage of MLL-rearranged leukemia. CDK6 mRNA was significantly higher expressed in MLL-rearranged infant ALL patients compared with MLL wild-type ALL patients (P < 0.001). Decrease of MLL-AF4 and MLL-ENL fusion mRNA expression by siRNAs resulted in downregulation of CDK6, affirming a direct relationship between the presence of the MLL fusion and CDK6 expression. Knockdown of CDK6 itself significantly inhibited proliferation in the MLL-AF4-positive cell line SEM, whereas knockdown of the highly homologous gene CDK4 had virtually no effect on the cell cycle. Furthermore, we show in vitro sensitivity of MLL-rearranged leukemia cell lines to the CDK4/6-inhibitor PD0332991, inducing a remarkable G 1 arrest, and downregulation of its downstream targets pRB1 and EZH2.

Older acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with high expression of both miR-3151 and the BAALC mRNA transcript have a low survival prognosis, and miR-3151 and BAALC expression is associated with poor survival independently of each other. We found that miR-3151 functioned as the oncogenic driver of the BAALC/miR-3151 locus. Increased production of miR-3151 reduced the apoptosis and chemosensitivity of AML cell lines and increased leukemogenesis in mice. Disruption of the TP53-mediated apoptosis pathway occurred in leukemia cells overexpressing miR-3151 and the miR-3151 bound to the 3' untranslated region of TP53. In contrast, BAALC alone had only limited oncogenic activity. We found that miR-3151 contains its own regulatory element, thus partly uncoupling miR-3151 expression from that of the BAALC transcript. Both genes were bound and stimulated by a complex of the transcription factors SP1 and nuclear factor kappaB (SP1/NF-kappaB). Disruption of SP1/NF-kappaB binding reduced both miR-3151 and BAALC expression. However, expression of only BAALC, but not miR-3151, was stimulated by the transcription factor RUNX1, suggesting a mechanism for the partly discordant expression of miR-3151 and BAALC observed in AML patients. Similar to the AML cells, in melanoma cell lines, overexpression of miR-3151 reduced the abundance of TP53, and knockdown of miR-3151 increased caspase activity, whereas miR-3151 overexpression reduced caspase activity.

However, targeting scaffolding proteins with traditional small molecule drugs has been challenging. Inhibition of beta-arrestin 2 with a novel aptamer impedes multiple oncogenic signaling pathways simultaneously. Additionally, delivery of the beta-arrestin 2-targeting aptamer into leukemia cells through coupling to a recently described cancer cell-specific delivery aptamer, inhibits multiple beta-arrestin-mediated signaling pathways known to be required for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) disease progression, and impairs tumorigenic growth in CML patient samples. The ability to target scaffolding proteins such as beta-arrestin 2 with RNA aptamers may prove beneficial as a therapeutic strategy.

We have applied an immunopeptidomic approach and isolated human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligands from primary leukemia cells. We identified a number of ligands derived from different genes that are restrictedly expressed in the hematopoietic system. We exemplarily selected myeloperoxidase (MPO) as a potential target and isolated a high-avidity TCR with specificity for a HLA-B*07:02-(HLA-B7)-restricted epitope of MPO in the single HLA-mismatched setting. T cells transgenic for this TCR demonstrated high peptide and antigen specificity as well as leukemia reactivity in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, no significant on- and off-target toxicity could be observed. In conclusion, we here demonstrate, exemplarily for MPO, that leukemia-derived HLA ligands can be selected for specific effector tool development to redirect T cells to be used for graft manipulation or adoptive T-cell therapies in diverse transplant settings.

Of these cases, the majority are older males. The underlying hematologic malignancies range from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The molecular pathogenesis and prognostic significance of isolated trisomy 2 remains unknown. Herein, we report 11 cases of isolated trisomy 2 in hematologic disorders seen in the Mayo Clinic Cytogenetics laboratory from 1996-2012. The majority were older males between the ages of 63-93 years. The underlying bone marrow pathologic diagnoses ranged from no diagnostic features of malignancy to AML. Our data suggest that isolated trisomy 2 could represent an age-related phenomenon since all 11 cases were age 63 and over. It appears that isolated trisomy 2 harbors little prognostic significance and that, instead, the prognostic significance is driven by the underlying pathologic diagnosis. For example, whereas 3 of the cases with AML survived only 7-10 weeks post-bone marrow biopsy, 1 of the cases without diagnostic features of malignancy survived 10 additional years. Therefore, trisomy 2 as a sole abnormality should not be considered as definitive evidence for a myeloid neoplasm in the absence of diagnostic morphologic criteria.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Here, using a sensitive high-throughput method, we quantified clonality in 197 ATL cases, identified genomic characteristics of the proviral integration sites in malignant and nonmalignant clones, and investigated the proviral features (genomic structure and 5' long terminal repeat methylation) that determine its capacity to express the HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax. Of the dominant, presumed malignant clones, 91% contained a single provirus. The genomic characteristics of the integration sites in the ATL clones resembled those of the frequent low-abundance clones (present in both ATL cases and carriers) and not those of the intermediate-abundance clones observed in 24% of ATL cases, suggesting that oligoclonal proliferation per se does not cause malignant transformation. Gene ontology analysis revealed an association in 6% of cases between ATL and integration near host genes in 3 functional categories, including genes previously implicated in hematologic malignancies. In all cases of HTLV-1 infection, regardless of ATL, there was evidence of preferential survival of the provirus in vivo in acrocentric chromosomes (13, 14, 15, 21, and 22).",['(c) 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Cook, Lucy B', 'Melamed, Anat', 'Niederer, Heather', 'Valganon, Mikel', 'Laydon, Daniel', 'Foroni, Letizia', 'Taylor, Graham P', 'Matsuoka, Masao', 'Bangham, Charles R M']","['Cook LB', 'Melamed A', 'Niederer H', 'Valganon M', 'Laydon D', 'Foroni L', 'Taylor GP', 'Matsuoka M', 'Bangham CR']","['Section of Immunology, Wright-Fleming Institute, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom;', 'Section of Immunology, Wright-Fleming Institute, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom;', 'Section of Immunology, Wright-Fleming Institute, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom;', 'Imperial Molecular Pathology Laboratory, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust and Academic Health Sciences Centre, Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom; Centre for Haematology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom;', 'Section of Immunology, Wright-Fleming Institute, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom;', 'Imperial Molecular Pathology Laboratory, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust and Academic Health Sciences Centre, Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom; Centre for Haematology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom;', 'Section of Virology, Wright-Fleming Institute, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'Institute for Viral Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Section of Immunology, Wright-Fleming Institute, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140415,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clone Cells/metabolism/virology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Ontology', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics', 'Genome, Human/genetics', 'HTLV-I Infections/*genetics/virology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/virology', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Rats', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",,,2014/04/17 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2014/04/17 06:00'],"['2014/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40080-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-02-553602 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Jun 19;123(25):3925-31. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-02-553602.

Fit patients were randomized to receive either 6 28-day cycles of oral FC chemotherapy (days 1 through 3: fludarabine 40 mg/m(2) per day and cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m(2) per day: n = 139) or FC plus subcutaneous alemtuzumab 30 mg day 1 (FCA, n = 133). FCA prolonged the primary end point, progression-free survival (3-year progression-free survival 53 vs 37%, P = .01), but not the secondary end point, overall survival (OS). However, a post hoc analysis showed that FCA increased OS in patients younger than 65 years (3-year OS 85% vs 76%, P = .035). FCA also increased the overall response rate (88 vs 78%, P = .036), and the bone marrow minimal residual disease-negative complete remission rate (64% vs 43%, P = .016). Opportunistic infections were more frequent following FCA, but without an increase in treatment related mortality (FCA: 3.8%, FC: 4.3%).

The course of disease is regulated by pro-inflammatory agents, and malignant cell infiltration of tissues plays a deleterious role in disease progression, greatly impacting quality of life, especially in the cognitive domains. Our hypothesis is that significant serum concentrations of interleukin 15 (IL-15) are responsible for higher expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells of blood-brain barrier (BBB) which allow leukaemia cells and/or normal lymphocytes the infiltration into the brain. In brain tissue these cells could be stimulated to release perforin and granulysin causing induction of apoptosis in brain cells that are involved in complex neural signalling mediated by neurotransmitters, and consequent fine cognitive impairment. Such changes could be detected early, even before notable clinical psycho-neurological or radiological changes in patients with ALL. To evaluate this hypothesis we propose measuring cognitive function using Complex Reactiometer Drenovac (CRD) scores in patients with ALL. The expression of different adhesion molecules on BBB as well as presence and distribution of different lymphocytes in brain tissue will be analyzed. We will then correlate CRD scores with levels of IL-15 and the percentages of T cells, natural killer T cells, and natural killer cells expressing perforin and/or granulysin proteins. CRD is a scientifically recognised and highly sensitive psychometric laboratory test based on the complex chronometric mathematical measuring of speed of reaction to various stimuli. It provides an objective assessment of cognitive functions from the most complex mental activities to the simplest reaction reflexes. Early recognition of cognitive dysfunction might be important when selecting the most appropriate chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy regimens, and could allow for the implementation of preventive measures against further deterioration in cognitive function and quality of life in patients with ALL.",['Copyright (c) 2014.

Further, more promising compounds viz., 3b, 3i and 3l were tested for their cytotoxic activity. Compound 3l was found to display excellent activity (IC50 < 10 mug mL(-1)) with 100% cell lysis at 30 mug mL(-1) concentration against A549 (Human lung carcinoma) and 8E5 (Human; Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) cell lines.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The presence of FLT3 mutations confers a poor prognosis. Thus, pharmacological inhibitors of FLT3 are of therapeutic interest for AML. Go6976 is an indolocarbazole with a similar structural backbone to staurosporine. In the present study, we demonstrated that Go6976 displays a potent inhibitory activity against recombinant FLT3 using an in vitro kinase assay, with an IC50 value of 0.7nM. Go6976 markedly inhibited the proliferation of human leukemia cells having FLT3-ITD such as MV4-11 and MOLM13. We also observed that Go6976 showed minimal toxicity for human normal CD34(+) cells. Go6976 suppressed the phosphorylation of FLT3 and downstream signaling molecules such as STAT3/5, Erk1/2, and Akt in MV4-11 and MOLM13 cells. Interestingly, induction of apoptosis by Go6976 was associated with rapid and pronounced down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein survivin and MCL-1. Suppression of survivin protein expression by Go6976 was due to the inhibition of transcription via the suppression of STAT3/5. On the other hand, Go6976 induced proteasome-mediated degradation of MCL-1. Previously described FLT3 inhibitors such as PKC412 are bound by the human plasma protein, alpha1-acid glycoprotein, resulting in diminished inhibitory activity against FLT3. In contrast, we found that Go6976 potently inhibited phosphorylation of FLT3 and exerted cytotoxicity in the presence of human serum. In conclusion, Go6976 is a potent FLT3 inhibitor that displays a significant antiproliferative activity against leukemia cells with FLT3-ITD through the profound down-regulation of survivin and MCL-1.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Secondly, we investigated the sensitivity and specificity of flow cytometry (FC) compared to molecular analyses for MRD detection. A total of 462 CLL samples were evaluated by basic FC; in 143, ERIC consensus method was also performed and all three FC methodologies were applied in a subgroup of 10 cases. No discordance in defining MRD-positive/negative samples was observed between the FC methods; within positive samples, the ERIC consensus method and 8-colour analysis showed the most accurate results. MRD was analysed by FC and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 243 cases: concordant results were obtained in 199/243 samples (81.9%); 42/243 were FC-/PCR+. Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of FC compared to PCR was 96.5% and 77.2%, respectively.

We injected ESCs modified with a suicide gene into a leukemia mouse model through peripheral blood to observe the treatment effectiveness. In addition, according to the pre-test, we set the time point of differentiation after transplantation and then activated the suicide gene to kill the ESCs that we had initially implanted, hoping to avoid the risks mentioned earlier. Our results indicated that the body weight and survival rates of mice treated with an ESC microenvironment increased, and leukemic cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow decreased compared with untreated mice. There was no obvious teratoma in mice that received ESC therapy and induced the suicide gene at the proper time during the observation period, while an apparent teratoma was observed in the lungs of mice which received ESC therapy and never induced the suicide gene.

However, the detailed cellular mechanisms for AgNPs to inhibit the growth of leukemic cells and their efficacy on clinical isolates of leukemic patients are not elucidated. In this study, the cellular uptake and cytotoxic mechanism of AgNPs in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells were investigated. AgNPs were synthesized with a modified polyol method, which were stable under cell culture conditions with fetal bovine serum (FBS). AgNPs were demonstrated to be able to enter K562 cells (a CML cell line) in a dose-dependent manner and locate in endosomes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) could be generated upon AgNPs exposure and cause cytotoxicity and apoptosis. It was also found that AgNPs treatment inhibited the viability of cells from CML patients (n = 4). The cell cycle status and several critical regulators were altered upon AgNPs treatment as well. All these cellular and molecular alterations caused by AgNPs exposure could be reversed by the addition of Vitamin C (an antioxidant).

The majority of patients ultimately require allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for cure. Recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease now permit over 90% of patients to be molecularly characterized. Pre-HCT management of patients with JMML is currently symptom-driven. However, evaluation of potential high-risk clinical and molecular features will determine which patients could benefit from pre-HCT chemotherapy and/or local control of splenic disease. Furthermore, new techniques to quantify minimal residual disease burden will determine whether pre-HCT response to chemotherapy is beneficial for long-term disease-free survival. The optimal approach to HCT for JMML is unclear, with high relapse rates regardless of conditioning intensity. An ongoing clinical trial in the Children's Oncology Group will test if less toxic approaches can be equally effective, thereby shifting the focus to post-HCT immunomanipulation strategies to achieve long-term disease control. Finally, our unraveling of the molecular basis of JMML is beginning to identify possible targets for selective therapeutic interventions, either pre- or post-HCT, an approach which may ultimately provide the best opportunity to improve outcomes for this aggressive disease.",,"['Dvorak, Christopher C', 'Loh, Mignon L']","['Dvorak CC', 'Loh ML']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco , San Francisco, CA , USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco , San Francisco, CA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140328,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,,['NOTNLM'],"['chemotherapy', 'hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'immunotherapy', 'juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia', 'minimal residual disease', 'splenectomy']",2014/04/16 06:00,2014/04/16 06:01,['2014/04/16 06:00'],"['2014/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2014.00025 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2014 Mar 28;2:25. doi: 10.3389/fped.2014.00025. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC3975112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is involved in the metabolism of all thiopurines and is one of the main enzymes that inactivates mercaptopurine. 6-MP is now used as a combination therapies for maintenance therapy of children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). In all patients receiving mercaptopurine, there is a risk of bone marrow suppression. TPMT activity is inherited as a monogenic, co-dominant trait. More than 25 variants are known. Genetic testing is available for several TPMT variant alleles. Most commonly TPMT*2, *3A, and *3C are tested for, which account for >90% of inactivating alleles. Differences in DNA that alter the expression or function of proteins that are targeted by drugs can contribute significantly to variation in the responses of individuals.Genotyping may become part of routine investigations to help clinicians tailor drug treatment effectively. This success is mainly due to the development of combination therapies and stratification of patients according to risk of treatment failure and relapse, rather than the discovery of new drugs. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of genotype or methyltransferase enzyme activity before starting therapy in children with ALL. This can prevent the side effect of thiopurine drugs.

Their role in human neurodevelopmental disorders, however, is poorly understood, with very few examples described. The cerebellum is an excellent system to study mechanisms of cell fate specification. Although signals from the isthmic organizer are known to specify cerebellar territory along the anterior-posterior axis of the neural tube, the mechanisms establishing the cerebellar anlage along the dorsal-ventral axis are unknown. Here we show that the gene encoding pancreatic transcription factor PTF1A, which is inactivated in human patients with cerebellar agenesis, is required to segregate the cerebellum from more ventral extracerebellar fates. Using genetic fate mapping in mice, we show that in the absence of Ptf1a, cells originating in the cerebellar ventricular zone initiate a more ventral brainstem expression program, including LIM homeobox transcription factor 1 beta and T-cell leukemia homeobox 3. Misspecified cells exit the cerebellar anlage and contribute to the adjacent brainstem or die, leading to cerebellar agenesis in Ptf1a mutants. Our data identify Ptf1a as the first gene involved in the segregation of the cerebellum from the more ventral brainstem.

Therapeutic leukapheresis is currently recommended by the American Society of Apheresis in patients with a WBC>100 G/l with signs of leukostasis, but the role of prophylactic leukapheresis before clinical signs of leukostasis occur is unclear. PATIENTS: We retrospectively analyzed the role of leukapheresis in 52 patients (median age 60 years) with hyperleukocytotic AML with and without clinical signs of leukostasis. Since leukapheresis was performed more frequently in patients with signs of leukostasis due to the therapeutic policy in our hospital, we developed a risk score for early death within seven days after start of therapy (EDd7) to account for this selection bias and to independently measure the effect of leukapheresis on EDd7. RESULTS: 20 patients received leukapheresis in combination to chemotherapy compared to 32 patients who received chemotherapy only. In a multivariate logistic regression model for the estimation of the probability of EDd7 thromboplastin time and creatinine remained as independent significant parameters and were combined to create an EDd7 risk score. The effect of leukapheresis on EDd7 was evaluated in a bivariate logistic regression together with the risk score. Leukapheresis did not significantly change early mortality in all patients with a WBC>/=100 G/l. DISCUSSION: Prophylactic leukapheresis in hyperleukocytotic patients with and without leukostasis did not improve early mortality in our retrospective study. Larger and prospective clinical trials are needed to validate the risk score and to further explore the role of leukapheresis in AML with hyperleukocytosis.",,"['Pastore, Friederike', 'Pastore, Alessandro', 'Wittmann, Georg', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Spiekermann, Karsten']","['Pastore F', 'Pastore A', 'Wittmann G', 'Hiddemann W', 'Spiekermann K']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Munich, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich - Campus Grobetahadern, Munich, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Munich, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich - Campus Grobetahadern, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Munich, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich - Campus Grobetahadern, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Munich, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich - Campus Grobetahadern, Munich, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Munich, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich - Campus Grobetahadern, Munich, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140414,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytosis/drug therapy/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/04/16 06:00,2015/05/29 06:00,['2014/04/16 06:00'],"['2013/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0095062 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-30600 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Apr 14;9(4):e95062. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0095062. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC3986260,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Tumour Registry Lymphatic Neoplasms prospectively collects data on the treatment of patients with lymphoid B-cell neoplasm as administered by office-based haematologists in Germany. Data on patient and tumour characteristics, co-morbidities, systemic treatments, and outcome parameters are recorded. Eight hundred and six patients with CLL were recruited between May 2009 and August 2013. At the start of first-line treatment, median age was 71 years, 64% were male, and 44% had a Binet stage C disease. The most frequently used first-line/second-line regimens were bendamustine + rituximab (BR, 56%/55%), fludarabine + cyclophosphamide + rituximab (FCR, 22%/11%), and bendamustine (B, 5%/9%). Chlorambucil was used in only 7% (first-line) and 6% (second-line) of patients. Patients treated with FCR were younger and healthier than patients treated with BR. Overall, 91% of first-line treatments were successful (40% complete response). Real-life patient populations differ considerably from patients treated in randomized controlled trials. BR and FCR dominate the first-line and second-line treatments of CLL by office-based haematologists in Germany.

METHODS: The clinical features and histological findings at the time of the renal biopsy were assessed for each patient. RESULTS: We identified 20 patients with NHL and renal involvement, and the diagnosis of NHL was established following the kidney biopsy in 18 (90%) patients. The types of NHL include the following: chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (n = 8), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 4), T/NK cell lymphoma (n = 3), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (n = 2), cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (n = 1), mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (n = 1) and mantle cell lymphoma (n = 1). All presented with proteinuria, and 15 patients had impaired renal function. The pathological findings included (1) membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis-like pattern in seven patients; (2) crescent glomerulonephritis in four; (3) minimal-change disease in three, and glomeruli without specific pathological abnormalities in three; (4) intraglomerular large B-cell lymphoma in one; (5) intracapillary monoclonal IgM deposits in one; (6) primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the kidneys in one; and (7) lymphoma infiltration of the kidney in eight patients. CONCLUSION: A wide spectrum of renal lesions can be observed in patients with NHL, and NHL may be first proven by renal biopsies for evaluation of kidney injury or proteinuria.

Although biological systems are robust against changes in many external and internal conditions, even a single mutation can perturb the system substantially, giving rise to a pathophenotype. Recent advances in identifying and analyzing the sequential variations beneath human disorders help to comprehend a systemic view of the mechanisms underlying various disease phenotypes. Network-based disease-gene prioritization methods rank the relevance of genes in a disease under the hypothesis that genes whose proteins interact with each other tend to exhibit similar phenotypes. In this study, we have tested the robustness of several network-based disease-gene prioritization methods with respect to the perturbations of the system using various disease phenotypes from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database. These perturbations have been introduced either in the protein-protein interaction network or in the set of known disease-gene associations. As the network-based disease-gene prioritization methods are based on the connectivity between known disease-gene associations, we have further used these methods to categorize the pathophenotypes with respect to the recoverability of hidden disease-genes. Our results have suggested that, in general, disease-genes are connected through multiple paths in the human interactome. Moreover, even when these paths are disturbed, network-based prioritization can reveal hidden disease-gene associations in some pathophenotypes such as breast cancer, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, leukemia, parkinson disease and obesity to a greater extend compared to the rest of the pathophenotypes tested in this study.

Use of gene expression profile (GEP) is considered an important tool in predicting outcome; however, it is unclear whether such genomic analysis alone can adequately predict therapeutic response. We evaluated the ability of GEP to predict complete response (CR) in MM. GEP from pretreatment MM cells from 136 uniformly treated MM patients with response data on an IFM, France led study were analyzed. To evaluate variability in predictive power due to microarray platform or treatment types, additional data sets from three different studies (n=511) were analyzed using same methods. We used several machine learning methods to derive a prediction model using training and test subsets of the original four data sets. Among all methods employed for GEP-based CR predictive capability, we got accuracy range of 56-78% in test data sets and no significant difference with regard to GEP platforms, treatment regimens or in newly diagnosed or relapsed patients. Importantly, permuted P-value showed no statistically significant CR predictive information in GEP data.

However, the role of RUNX1 in human hematopoiesis has never been tested in experimental settings. Familial platelet disorder (FPD)/AML is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline mutation of RUNX1, marked by thrombocytopenia and propensity to acute leukemia. To investigate the physiological function of RUNX1 in human hematopoiesis and pathophysiology of FPD/AML, we derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from three distinct FPD/AML pedigrees (FPD-iPSCs) and examined their defects in hematopoietic differentiation. By in vitro differentiation assays, FPD-iPSCs were clearly defective in the emergence of hematopoietic progenitors and differentiation of megakaryocytes, and overexpression of wild-type (WT)-RUNX1 reversed most of these phenotypes. We further demonstrated that overexpression of mutant-RUNX1 in WT-iPSCs did not recapitulate the phenotype of FPD-iPSCs, showing that the mutations were of loss-of-function type. Taken together, this study demonstrated that haploinsufficient RUNX1 allele imposed cell-intrinsic defects on hematopoietic differentiation in human experimental settings and revealed differential impacts of RUNX1 dosage on human and murine megakaryopoiesis.

Recently, a few reports have suggested that a novel class of small non-coding RNAs, called Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), may be involved in the epigenetic regulation of cancer. In this study, for the first time we provided evidence that the expression of piRNA-823 was upregulated in multiple myeloma (MM) patients and cell lines, and positively correlated with clinical stage. Silencing piRNA-823 in MM cells induced deregulation of cell cycle regulators and apoptosis-related proteins expression, accompanied by inhibition of tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, piRNA-823 was directly relevant to de novo DNA methyltransferases, DNMT3A and 3B, in primary CD138(+) MM cells. The inhibited expression of piRNA-823 in MM cells resulted in marked reduction of DNMT3A and 3B at both mRNA and protein levels, which in turn led to decrease in global DNA methylation and reexpression of methylation-silenced tumor suppressor, p16(INK4A). In addition, piRNA-823 abrogation in MM cells induced reduction of vascular endothelial growth factor secretion, with consequent decreased proangiogenic activity. Altogether, these data support an oncogenic role of piRNA-823 in the biology of MM, providing a rational for the development of piRNA-targeted therapeutic strategies in MM.",,"['Yan, H', 'Wu, Q-L', 'Sun, C-Y', 'Ai, L-S', 'Deng, J', 'Zhang, L', 'Chen, L', 'Chu, Z-B', 'Tang, B', 'Wang, K', 'Wu, X-F', 'Xu, J', 'Hu, Y']","['Yan H', 'Wu QL', 'Sun CY', 'Ai LS', 'Deng J', 'Zhang L', 'Chen L', 'Chu ZB', 'Tang B', 'Wang K', 'Wu XF', 'Xu J', 'Hu Y']","['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140415,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['*Carcinogenesis', '*DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood supply/*genetics', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics']",,,2014/04/16 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2014/04/16 06:00'],"['2013/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014135 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.135 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jan;29(1):196-206. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.135.

The miR-15a/16-1 locus is located at 13q14, the most frequently deleted region in CLL. Starting from functional investigations of a rare SNP upstream the miR cluster, we identified a novel allele-specific mechanism that exploits a cryptic activator region to recruit the RNA polymerase III for miR-15a/16-1 transcription. This regulation of the miR-15a/16- locus is independent of the DLEU2 host gene, which is often transcribed monoallellically by RPII. We found that normally one allele of miR-15a/16-1 is transcribed by RNAPII, the other one by RNAPIII. In our subset of CLL patients harboring 13q14 deletions, exclusive RNA polymerase III (RPIII)-driven transcription of the miR-15a/16-1 was the consequence of loss of the RPII-regulated allele and correlated with high expression of the poor prognostic marker ZAP70 (P=0.019). Thus, our findings point to a novel biological process, characterized by double allele-specific transcriptional regulation of the miR-15a/16-1 locus by alternative mechanisms. Differential usage of these mechanisms may distinguish at onset aggressive from indolent forms of CLL. This provides a basis for the clinical heterogeneity of the CLL patients carrying 13q14 deletions.",,"['Veronese, A', 'Pepe, F', 'Chiacchia, J', 'Pagotto, S', 'Lanuti, P', 'Veschi, S', 'Di Marco, M', ""D'Argenio, A"", 'Innocenti, I', 'Vannata, B', 'Autore, F', 'Marchisio, M', 'Wernicke, D', 'Verginelli, F', 'Leone, G', 'Rassenti, L Z', 'Kipps, T J', 'Mariani-Costantini, R', 'Laurenti, L', 'Croce, C M', 'Visone, R']","['Veronese A', 'Pepe F', 'Chiacchia J', 'Pagotto S', 'Lanuti P', 'Veschi S', 'Di Marco M', ""D'Argenio A"", 'Innocenti I', 'Vannata B', 'Autore F', 'Marchisio M', 'Wernicke D', 'Verginelli F', 'Leone G', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Kipps TJ', 'Mariani-Costantini R', 'Laurenti L', 'Croce CM', 'Visone R']","[""1] Unit of General Pathology, Aging Research Center (Ce.S.I.), G. d'Annunzio University Foundation, Chieti, Italy [2] Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences, G. d'Annunzio University, Chieti, Italy."", ""1] Unit of General Pathology, Aging Research Center (Ce.S.I.), G. d'Annunzio University Foundation, Chieti, Italy [2] Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences, G. d'Annunzio University, Chieti, Italy."", ""Unit of General Pathology, Aging Research Center (Ce.S.I.), G. d'Annunzio University Foundation, Chieti, Italy."", ""1] Unit of General Pathology, Aging Research Center (Ce.S.I.), G. d'Annunzio University Foundation, Chieti, Italy [2] Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences, G. d'Annunzio University, Chieti, Italy."", ""Department of Medicine and Aging Science, University G. d'Annunzio Chieti-Pescara, Chieti, Italy."", ""1] Unit of General Pathology, Aging Research Center (Ce.S.I.), G. d'Annunzio University Foundation, Chieti, Italy [2] Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences, G. d'Annunzio University, Chieti, Italy."", ""Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences, G. d'Annunzio University, Chieti, Italy."", ""Unit of General Pathology, Aging Research Center (Ce.S.I.), G. d'Annunzio University Foundation, Chieti, Italy."", 'Department of Hematology, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Rome, Italy.', ""Department of Medicine and Aging Science, University G. d'Annunzio Chieti-Pescara, Chieti, Italy."", 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', ""Unit of General Pathology, Aging Research Center (Ce.S.I.), G. d'Annunzio University Foundation, Chieti, Italy."", 'Department of Hematology, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Rome, Italy.', '1] Department of Medicine, Moores Cancer Center, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA [2] Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research Consortium, San Diego, CA, USA.', '1] Department of Medicine, Moores Cancer Center, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA [2] Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research Consortium, San Diego, CA, USA.', ""1] Unit of General Pathology, Aging Research Center (Ce.S.I.), G. d'Annunzio University Foundation, Chieti, Italy [2] Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences, G. d'Annunzio University, Chieti, Italy."", 'Department of Hematology, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Rome, Italy.', '1] Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA [2] Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research Consortium, San Diego, CA, USA.', ""1] Unit of General Pathology, Aging Research Center (Ce.S.I.), G. d'Annunzio University Foundation, Chieti, Italy [2] Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences, G. d'Annunzio University, Chieti, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140415,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['*Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,,2014/04/16 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2014/04/16 06:00'],"['2013/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014139 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.139 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jan;29(1):86-95. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.139.

The median follow-up was 41.4 months. A cutoff of 1.52 ng/ml of PD-L1 level was determined and related to overall survival (OS). Patients with elevated sPD-L1 experienced a poorer prognosis with a 3-year OS of 76% versus 89% (P<0.001). Considering clinical characteristics, the multivariate analysis retained this biomarker besides bone marrow involvement and abnormal lymphocyte-monocyte score as independently related to poor outcome. sPD-L1 was detectable in the plasma and not in the serum, found elevated in patients at diagnosis compared with healthy subjects and its level dropped back to normal value after CR. The intention-to-treat analysis showed that elevated sPD-L1 was associated with a poorer prognosis for patients randomized within the R-CHOP arm (P<0.001). Plasma PD-L1 protein is a potent predicting biomarker in DLBCL and may indicate usefulness of alternative therapeutic strategies using PD-1 axis inhibitors.",,"['Rossille, D', 'Gressier, M', 'Damotte, D', 'Maucort-Boulch, D', 'Pangault, C', 'Semana, G', 'Le Gouill, S', 'Haioun, C', 'Tarte, K', 'Lamy, T', 'Milpied, N', 'Fest, T']","['Rossille D', 'Gressier M', 'Damotte D', 'Maucort-Boulch D', 'Pangault C', 'Semana G', 'Le Gouill S', 'Haioun C', 'Tarte K', 'Lamy T', 'Milpied N', 'Fest T']","['INSERM U917, Universite de Rennes 1, Hopital Universitaire de Rennes, Rennes, France.', 'INSERM U917, Universite de Rennes 1, Hopital Universitaire de Rennes, Rennes, France.', 'Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, INSERM U872, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie and Universite Paris-Descartes, Paris, France.', '1] Hospices Civils de Lyon, Service de Biostatistiques, Lyon, France [2] CNRS UMR 5558, Equipe Biostatistique Sante, Pierre-Benite, France [3] Universite Lyon I, Villeurbanne, France.', 'INSERM U917, Universite de Rennes 1, Hopital Universitaire de Rennes, Rennes, France.', 'INSERM U917, EFS de Bretagne, Rennes, France.', 'Hopital Universitaire de Nantes, Nantes, France.', ""Service d'hematologie, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, Paris, France."", '1] INSERM U917, Universite de Rennes 1, Hopital Universitaire de Rennes, Rennes, France [2] INSERM U917, EFS de Bretagne, Rennes, France.', 'INSERM U917, Universite de Rennes 1, Hopital Universitaire de Rennes, Rennes, France.', 'Universite de Bordeaux 2, Hopital Universitaire de Bordeaux-Pessac, Bordeaux, France.', 'INSERM U917, Universite de Rennes 1, Hopital Universitaire de Rennes, Rennes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140415,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'B7-H1 Antigen/*blood', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'France', 'Humans', 'Intention to Treat Analysis', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*blood/drug therapy/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/04/16 06:00,2015/03/12 06:00,['2014/04/16 06:00'],"['2013/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/24 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014137 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.137 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Dec;28(12):2367-75. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.137.

B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) facilitates ubiquitination of NEMO in the cytosol, activating NFkappaB signaling. Translocation and/or point mutations of BCL10 associate with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas and other malignancies. However, the mechanisms by which the resulting aberrant expression of BCL10 leads to cellular oncogenesis are poorly understood. In this report, we found that BCL10 in the nucleus is enriched at the DNA damage sites in an ATM- and RNF8-dependent manner. ATM-dependent phosphorylation of BCL10 promotes its interaction with and presentation of UBC13 to RNF8, and RNF8-mediated ubiquitination of BCL10 enhances binding of BCL10 and UBC13 to RNF168. This allows mono-ubiquitination on H2AX by RNF168 and further poly-ubiquitination by the RNF8/RNF168-containing complex. Depletion of BCL10 compromised homology recombination-mediated DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair because of insufficient recruitment of BRCA1, RAD51, and the ubiquitinated DNA damage response factors. Taken together, our results demonstrate a novel function of BCL10 in delivering UBC13 to RNF8/RNF168 to regulate ubiquitination-mediated DSB signaling and repair.",,"['Zhao, Hongchang', 'Zhu, Min', 'Dou, Gelin', 'Zhao, Hongli', 'Zhu, Bingtao', 'Li, Jing', 'Liao, Ji', 'Xu, Xingzhi']","['Zhao H', 'Zhu M', 'Dou G', 'Zhao H', 'Zhu B', 'Li J', 'Liao J', 'Xu X']","['Beijing Key Laboratory of DNA Damage Response and College of Life Science; Capital Normal University; Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory of DNA Damage Response and College of Life Science; Capital Normal University; Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory of DNA Damage Response and College of Life Science; Capital Normal University; Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory of DNA Damage Response and College of Life Science; Capital Normal University; Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory of DNA Damage Response and College of Life Science; Capital Normal University; Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory of DNA Damage Response and College of Life Science; Capital Normal University; Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory of DNA Damage Response and College of Life Science; Capital Normal University; Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory of DNA Damage Response and College of Life Science; Capital Normal University; Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140414,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein', '*DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Repair/*physiology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/*metabolism', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism', 'Ubiquitination']",['NOTNLM'],"['BCL10', 'DNA damage', 'RNF168', 'RNF8', 'ubiquitination']",2014/04/16 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/04/16 06:00'],"['2014/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['28707 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.28707 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2014;13(11):1777-87. doi: 10.4161/cc.28707.

Of the more than 100 human carcinogens identified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, approximately 25% induce leukemias or lymphomas. The objective of this review is to provide an introduction into the origins and mechanisms underlying lymphohematopoietic cancers induced by xenobiotics in humans with an emphasis on acute myeloid leukemia, and discuss the implications of this information for risk assessment. Among the agents causing lymphohematopoietic cancers, a number of patterns were observed. Most physical and chemical leukemia-inducing agents such as the therapeutic alkylating agents, topoisomerase II inhibitors, and ionizing radiation induce mainly acute myeloid leukemia through DNA-damaging mechanisms that result in either gene or chromosomal mutations. In contrast, biological agents and a few immunosuppressive chemicals induce primarily lymphoid neoplasms through mechanisms that involve alterations in immune response. Among the environmental agents examined, benzene was clearly associated with acute myeloid leukemia in humans, with increasing but still limited evidence for an association with lymphoid neoplasms. Ethylene oxide and 1,3-butadiene were linked primarily to lymphoid cancers. Although the association between formaldehyde and leukemia remains controversial, several recent evaluations have indicated a potential link between formaldehyde and acute myeloid leukemia. The four environmental agents examined in detail were all genotoxic, inducing gene mutations, chromosomal alterations, and/or micronuclei in vivo. Although it is clear that rapid progress has been made in recent years in our understanding of leukemogenesis, many questions remain for future research regarding chemically induced leukemias and lymphomas, including the mechanisms by which the environmental agents reviewed here induce these diseases and the risks associated with exposures to such agents.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: A total of 35 LGL patients were retrospectively analyzed from March 2004 to May 2013 at our department. RESULTS: Their median age of diagnosis was 51 years. The anemia-related symptoms included splenomegaly (n = 11, 31.4%). And one patient (2.8%) with a history of rheumatoid arthritis. Anemia was the most frequent hematological abnormality (n = 27, 77.1%). The range of LGL count in peripheral blood was (0.82-23.7) x10(9)/L. Among them, 19 patients (54.2%) showed the CD3(+)CD57(+) CD56(-)indolent LGL phenotype. Two patients showed complex karyotype. T cell receptor beta chain variable region (TCRVbeta) analysis was positive in 8 patients. The median overall survival of aggressive LGL patients was significant shorter than that of indolent patient(16 months vs not reached, P = 0.000). Univariate analysis showed the median overall survival of patients with B symptom was significant shorter than that without B symptom (19 vs 45 months, P = 0.039); the median overall survival of patients with thrombocytopenia was significant shorter than that with platelet normal (16 vs 42 months, P = 0.000). Multivariate analysis showed B symptom (P = 0.736) and thrombocytopenia (P = 0.977) at diagnosis were not prognostic factors.

METHODS: A discrete event simulation of the disease course of CLL was developed to evaluate the economic implications of single-agent treatment with bendamustine, alemtuzumab, or chlorambucil, which are indicated for a treatment-naive patient population with Binet stage B or C CLL. Data from clinical trials were used to create a simulated patient population, risk equations for progression-free survival and survival post disease progression, response rates, and rates of adverse events. Costs from a US health care payer perspective in 2012 US dollars, survival (life years), and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated over a patient's lifetime; all were discounted at 3% per year. RESULTS: Compared with alemtuzumab, bendamustine was considered to be a dominant treatment providing greater benefit (6.10 versus 5.37 life years and 4.02 versus 3.45 QALYs) at lower cost ($78,776 versus $121,441). Compared with chlorambucil, bendamustine was associated with higher costs ($78,776 versus $42,337) but with improved health outcomes (6.10 versus 5.21 life years and 4.02 versus 3.30 QALYs), resulting in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $40,971 per life year gained and $50,619 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Bendamustine is expected to provide cost savings and greater health benefit than alemtuzumab in treatment-naive patients with CLL. Furthermore, it can be considered as a cost-effective treatment providing health benefits at an acceptable cost versus chlorambucil in the US.",,"['Kongnakorn, Thitima', 'Sterchele, James A', 'Salvador, Christopher G', 'Getsios, Denis', 'Mwamburi, Mkaya']","['Kongnakorn T', 'Sterchele JA', 'Salvador CG', 'Getsios D', 'Mwamburi M']","['Evidera, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'formerly of Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Inc, Frazer, PA.', 'Oncology Market Research, Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Inc, Frazer, PA.', 'Evidera, Lexington, MA.', 'Tufts University School of Medicine, Public Health and Community Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140401,New Zealand,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,ClinicoEconomics and outcomes research : CEOR,101560564,,,['NOTNLM'],"['alemtuzumab', 'bendamustine', 'chlorambucil', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'cost-effectiveness', 'discrete event simulation model']",2014/04/15 06:00,2014/04/15 06:01,['2014/04/15 06:00'],"['2014/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CEOR.S55095 [doi]', 'ceor-6-141 [pii]']",epublish,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res. 2014 Apr 1;6:141-9. doi: 10.2147/CEOR.S55095. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC3979694,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At presentation, her best-corrected visual acuity on the right was 20/63 and on the left was 20/320. In the right eye, retinoscopy showed blurring of the optic margins surrounded by retinal and preretinal hemorrhages, preretinal fibrosis of the optic disc along the vascular arcades, and perivascular retinal infiltrates. In the left eye, the optic disc was surrounded by retinal and preretinal hemorrhages, and massive fibrosis with hard exudates and severe preretinal hemorrhage were observed at the posterior pole. Roth spots and many circular hemorrhages were noted at the periphery of the retina. A-scan and B-scan ultrasonography did not show intraocular leukemic infiltration.

To further characterize this aberration, we studied 81 cases with del(14q): 54 of CLL and 27 of small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), the largest reported series to date. Using karyotype and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), the most frequent additional abnormality was trisomy 12 (tri12), observed in 28/79 (35%) cases, followed by del13q14 (12/79, 15%), delTP53 (11/80, 14%) delATM (5/79, 6%), and del6q21 (3/76, 4%). IGHV genes were unmutated in 41/53 (77%) patients, with a high frequency of IGHV1-69 (21/52, 40%). NOTCH1 gene was mutated in 14/45 (31%) patients. There was no significant difference in cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities between CLL and SLL. Investigations using FISH and SNP-array demonstrated the heterogeneous size of the 14q deletions. However, a group with the same del(14)(q24.1q32.33) was identified in 48% of cases. In this group, tri12 (P = 0.004) and NOTCH1 mutations (P = 0.02) were significantly more frequent than in the other patients. In CLL patients with del(14q), median treatment-free survival (TFS) was 27 months. In conclusion, del(14q) is associated with tri12 and with pejorative prognostic factors: unmutated IGHV genes (with over-representation of the IGHV1-69 repertoire), NOTCH1 mutations, and a short TFS.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Cosson, Adrien', 'Chapiro, Elise', 'Belhouachi, Nabila', 'Cung, Hong-Anh', 'Keren, Boris', 'Damm, Frederik', 'Algrin, Caroline', 'Lefebvre, Christine', 'Fert-Ferrer, Sandra', 'Luquet, Isabelle', 'Gachard, Nathalie', 'Mugneret, Francine', 'Terre, Christine', 'Collonge-Rame, Marie-Agnes', 'Michaux, Lucienne', 'Rafdord-Weiss, Isabelle', 'Talmant, Pascaline', 'Veronese, Lauren', 'Nadal, Nathalie', 'Struski, Stephanie', 'Barin, Carole', 'Helias, Catherine', 'Lafage, Marina', 'Lippert, Eric', 'Auger, Nathalie', 'Eclache, Virginie', 'Roos-Weil, Damien', 'Leblond, Veronique', 'Settegrana, Catherine', 'Maloum, Karim', 'Davi, Frederic', 'Merle-Beral, Helene', 'Lesty, Claude', 'Nguyen-Khac, Florence']","['Cosson A', 'Chapiro E', 'Belhouachi N', 'Cung HA', 'Keren B', 'Damm F', 'Algrin C', 'Lefebvre C', 'Fert-Ferrer S', 'Luquet I', 'Gachard N', 'Mugneret F', 'Terre C', 'Collonge-Rame MA', 'Michaux L', 'Rafdord-Weiss I', 'Talmant P', 'Veronese L', 'Nadal N', 'Struski S', 'Barin C', 'Helias C', 'Lafage M', 'Lippert E', 'Auger N', 'Eclache V', 'Roos-Weil D', 'Leblond V', 'Settegrana C', 'Maloum K', 'Davi F', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Lesty C', 'Nguyen-Khac F']","['INSERM U872, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris 6, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140412,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Trisomy/*genetics']",,,2014/04/15 06:00,2014/12/20 06:00,['2014/04/15 06:00'],"['2013/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22176 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2014 Aug;53(8):657-66. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22176.

DIAGNOSIS: CML is characterized by a balanced genetic translocation, t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), involving a fusion of the Abelson oncogene (ABL) from chromosome 9q34 with the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene on chromosome 22q11.2. This rearrangement is known as the Philadelphia chromosome. The molecular consequence of this translocation is the generation of a BCR-ABL fusion oncogene, which in turn translates into a Bcr-Abl oncoprotein. FRONTLINE THERAPY: Three tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the first-line treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase (CML-CP). Clinical trials with second generation TKIs reported significantly deeper and faster responses; their impact on long-term survival remains to be determined. SALVAGE THERAPY: For patients who fail frontline therapy, second-line options include second and third generation TKIs. Although second and third generation TKIs are potent and specific BCR-ABL TKIs, they exhibit unique pharmacological profiles and response patterns relative to different patient characteristics, such as patients comorbidities, disease stage, and BCR-ABL mutational status. Patients who develop the T315I ""gatekeeper"" mutation display resistance to all currently available TKIs except ponatinib. Allogeneic transplantation remains an important therapeutic option for CML-CP who have failed at least 2 TKIs, and for all patients in advanced phase disease.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Jabbour, Elias', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Jabbour E', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Following a highly complicated hospital course, the patient achieved cytogenetic remission by consolidated chemotherapy and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib. He subsequently presented with relapsed pre-B ALL after 3 years in remission. In consideration of his challenging clinical history, he was started on concurrent ponatinib (45 mg daily) and bortezomib (1.3 mg/m(2) intravenous weekly). The major molecular response was achieved (<0.0893% BCR-ABL1 transcripts) after 3 months. Bone marrow now demonstrates a BCR-ABL1-negative, complete cytogenetic response.

After termination of the original signal, new expression patterns are maintained by epigenetic DNA and histone modifications. This represents a powerful mechanism that enables long-term phenotypic adaptation to transient signals. Adaptation of epigenetic landscapes is important for mediating cellular differentiation during development and allows adjustment to altered environmental conditions throughout life. Work over the last decade has begun to elucidate the way that extra- and intra-cellular signals lead to changes in gene expression patterns by directly modulating the function of chromatin-associated proteins. Here, we review key signaling-to-chromatin pathways that are specifically thought to target Polycomb and Trithorax group complexes, a classic example of epigenetically acting gene silencers and activators important in development, stem cell differentiation and cancer. We discuss the influence that signals triggered by kinase cascades, metabolic fluctuations and cell-cycle dynamics have on the function of these protein complexes.

Flow cytometry assay suggested that the compounds induced inhibition of K562 cell proliferation associated with G1 phase arrest. In addition, the compounds inhibited Akt1 recruiting to membrane in CHO cells which express Akt1-EGFP constitutively and down-regulated the expression of pAkt1 in K562 cell.

Furthermore, a significant proportion of AML patients in CR will relapse during or after consolidation treatment. There is no evidence for a standard salvage regimen and most centers use a combination of an anthracycline and cytarabine (AraC). The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of two age-adjusted regimens containing AraC and cyclophosphamide applied for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 60 patients (24 male, 36 female; median age 56 years) with relapsed or refractory AML who were treated with a combination of AraC and cyclophosphamide monocentrically between October 2000 and January 2013. Two different protocols containing either high-dose (hAC) or intermediate-dose cytarabin (iAC) have been applied dependent on age and performance status. RESULTS: We demonstrate an overall response rate (CR + PR) induced by hAC and iAC of 56.7 %. Importantly, a complete remission rate (CR + CRp) of 52.2 % was found in patients who received the hAC regimen while only 8.8 % of patients achieved a CR following the iAC protocol (p < 0.001). The rate of refractory disease was 26.1 and 47.1 %, respectively. High-risk cytogenetics, i.e., a complex aberrant or monosomal karyotype had no effect on achievement of CR after hAC. In addition, there was no impact of activating FLT3 mutations on response to treatment according to the hAC regimen. In the cohort of patients treated with the iAC protocol, treatment-related mortality of 11.8 % within 60 days was observed but none of the patients who received the hAC regimen died within the first 2 months following chemotherapy. The toxicity profile was acceptable at both cytarabine dose levels. Importantly, 19 patients (82.6 %) of the hAC cohort underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as consecutive treatment. CONCLUSION: The hAC regimen represents a promising therapeutic approach to induce a second CR in younger patients with relapsed or refractory AML prior to HSCT without using anthracyclines.",,"['Schnetzke, Ulf', 'Fix, Peter', 'Spies-Weisshart, Baerbel', 'Schrenk, Karin', 'Glaser, Anita', 'Fricke, Hans-Joerg', 'La Rosee, Paul', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Scholl, Sebastian']","['Schnetzke U', 'Fix P', 'Spies-Weisshart B', 'Schrenk K', 'Glaser A', 'Fricke HJ', 'La Rosee P', 'Hochhaus A', 'Scholl S']","['Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Erlanger Allee 101, 07747, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140412,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,,2014/04/15 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2014/04/15 06:00'],"['2014/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-014-1666-7 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2014 Aug;140(8):1391-7. doi: 10.1007/s00432-014-1666-7.

Specifically, Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay demonstrated that induced expression of PML significantly diminishes the amount of Sp1 binding to its target gene promoter, immunofluorescence staining showed dramatic increase in the co-localization between PML and Sp1 upon induction of PML expression, moreover, PML and Sp1 co-fractionated in the core nuclear matrix. Our study further showed that PML promotes SUMOylation of Sp1 in a RING-motif-dependent manner, SUMOylation of Sp1 facilitates physical interaction between Sp1 and PML and recruitment of Sp1 into the PML NBs, the SUMO binding motif of PML was also important for its interaction with Sp1.

The patient was treated with surgical thyroidectomy with regional and cervical lymph node excision and radioiodine therapy (I-131). The protocolar control scintigraphy 4 days after the radioactive dose showed I-131 uptake in both axillae and even in the inguinal regions. PET/CT showed faint FDG-F-18 uptake in one lymph node of the left axilla. An ultrasound guided fine needle biopsy of this lymph node identified by I-131 SPECT/CT and FDG-F-18 PET/CT revealed lymphoma cells and was negative for thyroid tissue and thyroglobulin content. The sequential blood counts done routinely after radiation treatment showed a marked fall until return to normal values of leucocytes and lymphocytes (absolute and relative), which were still normal in the last control 19 months after the radioiodine administration. Chest computed tomography showed a decrease in size of axillary and para-aortic lymph nodes. By immunohistochemistry, cells of the lymphoid B lineage decreased from 52% before radioiodine therapy to 5% after the procedure. The authors speculate about a possible sodium iodide symporter expression by the cells of this lymphoma, similar to some other non-thyroid tumors, such as breast cancer cells.",,"['Thom, Anneliese Rosmarie Gertrud Fischer', 'Hamerschlak, Nelson', 'Teles, Veronica Goes', 'Osawa, Akemi', 'Santos, Fabio Pires de Souza', 'Pasqualin, Denise da Cunha', 'Wagner, Jairo', 'Yamaga, Lilian Yuri Itaya', 'Cunha, Marcelo Livorsi da', 'Campos Neto, Guilherme de Carvalho', 'Funari, Marcelo Buarque de Gusmao']","['Thom AR', 'Hamerschlak N', 'Teles VG', 'Osawa A', 'Santos FP', 'Pasqualin Dda C', 'Wagner J', 'Yamaga LY', 'Cunha ML', 'Campos Neto Gde C', 'Funari MB']","['Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Sociedade Brasileira de Diabetes, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Brazil,Einstein (Sao Paulo),"Einstein (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",101281800,IM,"['Aged', 'Biopsy, Fine-Needle', 'Carcinoma/diagnostic imaging/*radiotherapy/*secondary/surgery', 'Carcinoma, Papillary', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/therapeutic use', 'Laser Therapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*radiotherapy', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Thyroid Cancer, Papillary', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/*radiotherapy/*secondary/surgery', 'Thyroidectomy/methods', 'Time Factors', 'Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/04/15 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/04/15 06:00'],"['2012/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S1679-45082014000100019 [pii]', '10.1590/s1679-45082014rc2657 [doi]']",ppublish,Einstein (Sao Paulo). 2014 Jan-Mar;12(1):100-5. doi: 10.1590/s1679-45082014rc2657.,['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)'],,PMC4898247,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite initial improvements in survival of infants with ALL since establishment of the first pediatric cooperative group ALL trials, the poor outcome has plateaued in recent years. Historically, infants were treated on risk-adapted childhood ALL protocols. These studies were pivotal in identifying the need for infant-specific protocols, delineating prognostic categories and the requirement for a more unified approach between study groups to overcome limitations in accrual because of low incidence. This subsequently led to the development of collaborative infant-specific studies. Landmark outcomes have included the elimination of cranial radiotherapy following the discovery of intrathecal and high-dose systemic therapy as a superior and effective treatment strategy for central nervous system disease prophylaxis, with improved neurodevelopmental outcome. Universal prospective identification of independent adverse prognostic factors, including presence of a mixed lineage leukemia rearrangement and young age, has established the basis for risk stratification within current trials. The infant-specific trials have defined limits to which conventional chemotherapeutic agents can be intensified to optimize the balance between treatment efficacy and toxicity. Despite variations in therapeutic intensity, there has been no recent improvement in survival due to the equilibrium between relapse and toxicity. Ultimately, to improve the outcome for infants with ALL, key areas still to be addressed include identification and adaptation of novel prognostic markers and innovative therapies, establishing the role of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in first complete remission, treatment strategies for relapsed/refractory disease and monitoring and timely intervention of late effects in survivors.

The majority of cases of aplastic anemia remain idiopathic, although hematopoietic stem cell deficiency and impaired immune responses are hallmarks underlying the bone marrow failure in this condition. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells constitute an essential component of the bone marrow hematopoietic microenvironment because of their immunomodulatory properties and their ability to support hematopoiesis, and they have been involved in the pathogenesis of several hematologic malignancies. We investigated whether bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells contribute, directly or indirectly, to the pathogenesis of aplastic anemia. We found that mesenchymal stem cell cultures can be established from the bone marrow of aplastic anemia patients and display the same phenotype and differentiation potential as their counterparts from normal bone marrow. Mesenchymal stem cells from aplastic anemia patients support the in vitro homeostasis and the in vivo repopulating function of CD34(+) cells, and maintain their immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties.

It results in a transcript encoding for the fusion protein AML1-ETO (AE) with transcription factor activity. AE is considered to be an attractive target for treating t(8;21) leukemia. However, AE expression alone is insufficient to cause transformation, and thus the potential of such therapy remains unclear. Several genes are deregulated in AML cells, including KIT that encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor. Here, we show that AML cells transduced with short hairpin RNA vector targeting AE mRNAs have a dramatic decrease in growth rate that is caused by induction of apoptosis and deregulation of the cell cycle. A reduction in KIT mRNA levels was also observed in AE-silenced cells, but silencing KIT expression reduced cell growth but did not induce apoptosis. Transcription profiling of cells that escape cell death revealed activation of a number of signaling pathways involved in cell survival and proliferation.

Deregulated microRNA (miRNA) expression is also associated with several cancers, including leukemias. However, the transcriptional regulators of miRNAs, as well as the relationships between Notch signaling and miRNA deregulation, are poorly understood. To identify miRNAs regulated by Notch pathway, we performed microarray-based miRNA profiling of several Notch-expressing T-ALL models. Among seven miRNAs, consistently regulated by overexpressing or silencing Notch3, we focused our attention on miR-223, whose putative promoter analysis revealed a conserved RBPjk binding site, which was nested to an NF-kB consensus. Luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays on the promoter region of miR-223 show that both Notch and NF-kB are novel coregulatory signals of miR-223 expression, being able to activate cooperatively the transcriptional activity of miR-223 promoter. Notably, the Notch-mediated activation of miR-223 represses the tumor suppressor FBXW7 in T-ALL cell lines. Moreover, we observed the inverse correlation of miR-223 and FBXW7 expression in a panel of T-ALL patient-derived xenografts. Finally, we show that miR-223 inhibition prevents T-ALL resistance to gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) treatment, suggesting that miR-223 could be involved in GSI sensitivity and its inhibition may be exploited in target therapy protocols.",,"['Kumar, V', 'Palermo, R', 'Talora, C', 'Campese, A F', 'Checquolo, S', 'Bellavia, D', 'Tottone, L', 'Testa, G', 'Miele, E', 'Indraccolo, S', 'Amadori, A', 'Ferretti, E', 'Gulino, A', 'Vacca, A', 'Screpanti, I']","['Kumar V', 'Palermo R', 'Talora C', 'Campese AF', 'Checquolo S', 'Bellavia D', 'Tottone L', 'Testa G', 'Miele E', 'Indraccolo S', 'Amadori A', 'Ferretti E', 'Gulino A', 'Vacca A', 'Screpanti I']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Center for Life Nano Science@Sapienza, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Medico-Surgical Sciences and Biotechnology, Sapienza University, Latina, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Center for Life Nano Science@Sapienza, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, Italy.', 'Istituto Oncologico Veneto-IRCCS-Padova, Padua, Italy.', '1] Istituto Oncologico Veneto-IRCCS-Padova, Padua, Italy [2] Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', '1] Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy [2] Center for Life Nano Science@Sapienza, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, Italy [3] Neuromed Institute, Pozzilli, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', '1] Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy [2] Center for Life Nano Science@Sapienza, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, Italy [3] Institute Pasteur-Foundation Cenci Bolognetti, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140414,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Dipeptides/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'F-Box Proteins/*genetics', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, Notch/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics']",,,2014/04/15 06:00,2015/03/12 06:00,['2014/04/15 06:00'],"['2013/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014133 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.133 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Dec;28(12):2324-35. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.133.

We consider four myths underlying this recommendation: (1) only individuals achieving second remission benefit from a transplant; (2) there is no effective therapy for relapse other than an allotransplant; (3) we can accurately predict which individuals with AML in first remission need a transplant; and (4) detection of minimal residual disease in first remission will resolve this controversy.

However, little is known about risks for hematologic malignancies of myeloid origin. We linked the US Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients with 15 population-based cancer registries to ascertain cancer occurrence among 207 859 solid organ transplants (1987-2009). Solid organ transplant recipients had a significantly elevated risk for myeloid neoplasms, with standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of 4.6 (95% confidence interval 3.8-5.6; N=101) for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), 2.7 (2.2-3.2; N=125) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 2.3 (1.6-3.2; N=36) for chronic myeloid leukemia and 7.2 (5.4-9.3; N=57) for polycythemia vera. SIRs were highest among younger individuals and varied by time since transplantation and organ type (Poisson regression P<0.05 for all comparisons). Azathioprine for initial maintenance immunosuppression increased risk for MDS (P=0.0002) and AML (2-5 years after transplantation, P=0.0163). Overall survival following AML/MDS among transplant recipients was inferior to that of similar patients reported to US cancer registries (log-rank P<0.0001). Our novel finding of increased risks for specific myeloid neoplasms after solid organ transplantation supports a role for immune dysfunction in myeloid neoplasm etiology. The increased risks and inferior survival should heighten clinician awareness of myeloid neoplasms during follow-up of transplant recipients.",,"['Morton, L M', 'Gibson, T M', 'Clarke, C A', 'Lynch, C F', 'Anderson, L A', 'Pfeiffer, R', 'Landgren, O', 'Weisenburger, D D', 'Engels, E A']","['Morton LM', 'Gibson TM', 'Clarke CA', 'Lynch CF', 'Anderson LA', 'Pfeiffer R', 'Landgren O', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Engels EA']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, DHHS, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, DHHS, Bethesda, MD, USA.', '1] Cancer Prevention Institute of California, Fremont, CA, USA [2] Department of Health Research and Policy, Stanford Cancer Institute, Palo Alto, CA, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA.', ""Cancer Epidemiology and Health Services Research Group, Center for Public Health, School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences, Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK."", 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, DHHS, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Multiple Myeloma Section, Metabolism Branch, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, DHHS, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20140414,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality', 'Organ Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/04/15 06:00,2015/03/12 06:00,['2014/04/15 06:00'],"['2014/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014132 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.132 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Dec;28(12):2317-23. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.132.

A total of 117 CNAs with size ranging from 0.004 to 146.263 Mb was recognized in 12 of 24 cases, involving all chromosomes other than chromosome 1, 4, X and Y. Cryptic CNAs with size less than 5 Mb accounted for 59.8% of all the CNAs. 12 recurrent chromosomal alterations were mapped. Seven out of them were described in the previous AML studies and five were new candidate AML-M5 associated CNAs, including gains of 3q26.2-qter and 13q31.3 as well as losses of 2q24.2, 8p12 and 14q32. Amplication of 3q26.2-qter was the sole large recurrent chromosomal anomaly and the pathogenic mechanism in AML-M5 was possibly different from the classical recurrent 3q21q26 abnormality in AML. As a tumor suppressor gene, FOXN3, was singled out from the small recurrent CNA of 14q32, however, it is proved that deletion of FOXN3 is a common marker of myeloid leukemia rather than a specific marker for AML-M5 subtype. Moreover, the concurrent amplication of MLL and deletion of CDKN2A were noted and it might be associated with AML-M5. The number of CNA did not show a significant association with clinico-biological parameters and CR number of the 22 patients received chemotherapy. This study provided the evidence that array CGH served as a complementary platform for routine cytogenetic analysis to identify those cryptic alterations in the patients with AML-M5. As a subtype of AML, AML-M5 carries both common recurrent CNAs and unique CNAs, which may harbor novel oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Clarifying the role of these genes will contribute to the understanding of leukemogenic network of AML-M5.",,"['Zhang, Rui', 'Lee, Ji-Yun', 'Wang, Xianfu', 'Xu, Weihong', 'Hu, Xiaoxia', 'Lu, Xianglan', 'Niu, Yimeng', 'Tang, Rurong', 'Li, Shibo', 'Li, Yan']","['Zhang R', 'Lee JY', 'Wang X', 'Xu W', 'Hu X', 'Lu X', 'Niu Y', 'Tang R', 'Li S', 'Li Y']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, P.R.

Because chimerism is observed at 1 or more times after allo-SCT and not at baseline, if chimerism is in fact associated with OS or DFS, then the occurrence of either disease progression or death informatively censors (terminates) the observed chimerism process. This violates the assumptions underlying standard statistical regression methods for survival analysis, which may lead to biased conclusions. To assess the association between the longitudinal post-allo-SCT donor chimerism process and OS or DFS, we analyzed data from 195 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 157) or myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 38) who achieved complete remission after allo-SCT following a reduced-toxicity conditioning regimen of fludarabine/intravenous busulfan. Median follow-up was 31 months (range, 1.1 to 105 months). Fitted joint longitudinal-survival time models showed that a binary indicator of complete (100%) donor chimerism and increasing percent of donor T cells were significantly associated with longer OS, whereas decreasing percent of donor T cells was highly significantly associated with shorter OS. Our analyses illustrate the usefulness of modeling repeated post-allo-SCT chimerism measurements as individual longitudinal processes jointly with OS and DFS to estimate their relationships.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

We incorporated CADM1 into flow-cytometric analysis to reveal oncogenic mechanisms in human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type I (HTLV-I) infection by purifying cells from the intermediate stages of ATL development. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We isolated CADM1- and CD7-expressing peripheral blood mononuclear cells of asymptomatic carriers and ATLs using multicolor flow cytometry. Fluorescence-activated cell sorted (FACS) subpopulations were subjected to clonal expansion and gene expression analysis. RESULTS: HTLV-I-infected cells were efficiently enriched in CADM1(+) subpopulations (D, CADM1(pos)CD7(dim) and N, CADM1(pos)CD7(neg)). Clonally expanding cells were detected exclusively in these subpopulations in asymptomatic carriers with high proviral load, suggesting that the appearance of D and N could be a surrogate marker of progression from asymptomatic carrier to early ATL. Further disease progression was accompanied by an increase in N with a reciprocal decrease in D, indicating clonal evolution from D to N. The gene expression profiles of D and N in asymptomatic carriers showed similarities to those of indolent ATLs, suggesting that these subpopulations represent premalignant cells. This is further supported by the molecular hallmarks of ATL, that is, drastic downregulation of miR-31 and upregulation of abnormal Helios transcripts. CONCLUSION: The CADM1 versus CD7 plot accurately reflects disease progression in HTLV-I infection, and CADM1(+) cells with downregulated CD7 in asymptomatic carriers have common properties with those in indolent ATLs.",['(c)2014 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Kobayashi, Seiichiro', 'Nakano, Kazumi', 'Watanabe, Eri', 'Ishigaki, Tomohiro', 'Ohno, Nobuhiro', 'Yuji, Koichiro', 'Oyaizu, Naoki', 'Asanuma, Satomi', 'Yamagishi, Makoto', 'Yamochi, Tadanori', 'Watanabe, Nobukazu', 'Tojo, Arinobu', 'Watanabe, Toshiki', 'Uchimaru, Kaoru']","['Kobayashi S', 'Nakano K', 'Watanabe E', 'Ishigaki T', 'Ohno N', 'Yuji K', 'Oyaizu N', 'Asanuma S', 'Yamagishi M', 'Yamochi T', 'Watanabe N', 'Tojo A', 'Watanabe T', 'Uchimaru K']","[""Authors' affiliations: Division of Molecular Therapy;

Ets variant 2 (Etv2), a member of the E26 transforming-specific family of transcription factors, is essential to initiate a transcriptional program leading to vascular morphogenesis in early mouse embryos. However, endothelial expression of the Etv2 gene ceases at midgestation; therefore, vascular development past this stage must continue independent of Etv2. OBJECTIVE: To identify molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation of vascular morphogenesis and homeostasis in the absence of Etv2. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using loss- and gain-of-function strategies and a series of molecular techniques, we identify Friend leukemia integration 1 (Fli1), another E26 transforming-specific family transcription factor, as a downstream target of Etv2. We demonstrate that Etv2 binds to conserved Ets-binding sites within the promoter region of the Fli1 gene and governs Fli1 expression. Importantly, in the absence of Etv2 at midgestation, binding of Etv2 at Ets-binding sites in the Fli1 promoter is replaced by Fli1 protein itself, sustaining expression of Fli1 as well as selective Etv2-regulated endothelial genes to promote endothelial cell survival and vascular integrity. Consistent with this, we report that Fli1 binds to the conserved Ets-binding sites within promoter and enhancer regions of other Etv2-regulated endothelial genes, including Tie2, to control their expression at and beyond midgestation. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a novel positive feed-forward regulatory loop in which Etv2 activates expression of genes involved in vasculogenesis, including Fli1. Once the program is activated in early embryos, Fli1 then takes over to sustain the process in the absence of Etv2.","['(c) 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.']","['Abedin, Md J', 'Nguyen, Annie', 'Jiang, Nan', 'Perry, Cameron E', 'Shelton, John M', 'Watson, Dennis K', 'Ferdous, Anwarul']","['Abedin MJ', 'Nguyen A', 'Jiang N', 'Perry CE', 'Shelton JM', 'Watson DK', 'Ferdous A']","['From the Department of Internal Medicine (Cardiology) (M.J.A., A.N., N.J., C.E.P., J.M.S., A.F.), University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston (D.K.W.); and Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis (M.J.A.).', 'From the Department of Internal Medicine (Cardiology) (M.J.A., A.N., N.J., C.E.P., J.M.S., A.F.), University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston (D.K.W.); and Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis (M.J.A.).', 'From the Department of Internal Medicine (Cardiology) (M.J.A., A.N., N.J., C.E.P., J.M.S., A.F.), University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston (D.K.W.); and Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis (M.J.A.).', 'From the Department of Internal Medicine (Cardiology) (M.J.A., A.N., N.J., C.E.P., J.M.S., A.F.), University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston (D.K.W.); and Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis (M.J.A.).', 'From the Department of Internal Medicine (Cardiology) (M.J.A., A.N., N.J., C.E.P., J.M.S., A.F.), University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston (D.K.W.); and Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis (M.J.A.).', 'From the Department of Internal Medicine (Cardiology) (M.J.A., A.N., N.J., C.E.P., J.M.S., A.F.), University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston (D.K.W.); and Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis (M.J.A.).', 'From the Department of Internal Medicine (Cardiology) (M.J.A., A.N., N.J., C.E.P., J.M.S., A.F.), University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston (D.K.W.); and Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis (M.J.A.). anwarul.ferdous@utsouthwestern.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140411,United States,Circ Res,Circulation research,0047103,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Embryonic Development/physiology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology/physiology', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/etiology/physiopathology', 'Homeostasis/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Animal', 'Morphogenesis/physiology', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'developmental biology', 'embryonic development', 'gene expression', 'homeostasis', 'transcription factors']",2014/04/15 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2014/04/15 06:00'],"['2014/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['CIRCRESAHA.1134303145 [pii]', '10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.1134303145 [doi]']",ppublish,Circ Res. 2014 May 23;114(11):1690-9. doi: 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.1134303145.

Although it is a complex disease driven by numerous genetic and epigenetic abnormalities, nearly 50% of patients exhibit a normal karyotype (CN-AML) with an intermediate cytogenetic risk. However, a widespread genomic analysis has recently shown the recurrence of genomic aberrations in this category (mutations of FLT3, CEBPA, NPM1, RUNX1, TET2, IDH1/2, DNMT3A, ASXL1, MLL and WT1) thus revealing its marked genomic heterogeneity. In this perspective, a global gene expression analysis of AML patients provides an independent prognostic marker to categorize each patient into clinic-pathologic subgroups based on its molecular genetic defects. Consistently such classification, taking into account the uniqueness of each AML patient, furnishes an individualized treatment approach leading a step closer to personalized medicine. Overall the genome-wide analysis of AML patients, by providing novel insights into biology of this tumor, furnishes accurate prognostic markers as well as useful tools for selecting the most appropriate treatment option. Moreover it provides novel therapeutic targets useful to enhance efficacy of the current anti-AML therapeutics.

However, the functions of Notch1 for human T cell development and leukemogenesis are not well understood. To examine the role of Notch1, human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which had been transduced with a constitutively active form of Notch1 (ICN1), were transplanted into severely immunodeficient NOD/Shi-scid-IL2rgamma(null) (NOG) mice. We found that the great majority of the ICN1-expressing hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow expressed surface markers for T cells, such as CD3, CD4, and CD8, and that this T cell development was independent of the thymus. Accordingly, phenotypically mature CD8(+) single positive (SP) T cells were observed in the spleen. Furthermore, T-ALL developed in one NOG recipient mouse out of 26 that had been secondary transferred with the T cells developed in the first NOG mice. These results indicate that Notch1 signaling in HSCs promotes CD8(+) SP T cell development, and that T cell leukemogenesis may require additional oncogenic factors other than Notch1 activation.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we investigated whether IM disrupts the heme-dependent Cytochrome c Oxidase (COX) Biosynthesis and Assembly Pathway (HDCBAP) in Bcr-Abl(+) and Bcr-Abl(-) cells by affecting the expression of key-genes. Cells were exposed to IM and evaluated at time intervals for cell growth, cell death, expression of various genes by RT-PCR analysis as well as Sco2 mature protein levels by western blot analysis and COX enzymatic activity. IM at 1 muM induced extensive cell growth inhibition and cell death as well as marked suppression of the expression of SCO2 and FRATAXIN (FXN) genes in human K-562 and KU-812 Bcr-Abl(+) CML cells. IM also reduced the protein level of mature Sco2 mitochondrial protein as well as COX activity in these cell lines. However, treatment of human MOLT-4 Bcr-Abl(-) cells with 1muM and even with higher concentrations (4x10(-5)M) of IM neither reduced the expression of SCO2 and FXN genes nor suppressed the protein level of mature Sco2 protein and COX activity.

METHODS: Electronic searches of Medline, PubMed, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews since inception to September 2013 were conducted to identify all relevant studies. Search terms included sleep, a second term including adolescent, juvenile, youth, child, or childhood, and a third term including cancer, leukaemia, or brain tumour. A total of 41 articles met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Of these, 32 included patients with leukaemia and 21 included patients with brain tumours. Sleep-related disturbances included difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, disordered breathing, parasomnias, napping, daytime sleepiness/fatigue, and unspecified disturbances. Adolescents with cancer experience many problems related to sleep.

In order to determine whether automated analysis could also be used to identify haemopoietic abnormalities, EDTA-anticoagulated BM aspirates from 43 dogs were analysed using the Advia 2120 instrument. Corresponding Wright-stained BM smears were evaluated microscopically to determine smear quality, cell composition and 500-cell differential counts, and correlation to automated analysis parameters was computed. Leucocyte cytograms generated by the automated analyzer were scrutinized and compared with those of 'normal' BM. Twenty-three neoplastic and 20 non-neoplastic samples were analysed, including samples from 10 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia, four cases of acute lymphocytic leukaemia, four cases of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, one case of chronic neutrophilic leukaemia, three cases of multiple myeloma, one case of myelodysplastic syndrome, five cases of non-regenerative immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia, one case of immune-mediated neutropenia, three cases of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, six cases of inflammatory disease, three samples with myelotoxicity and two samples analysed for staging of neoplasia. Automated white blood cell (WBC) counts correlated significantly with smear cellularity, particle cellularity and particle number. There was a significant difference in WBC counts of samples with insufficient versus sufficient particles. Significant correlations between Advia percent neutrophils and microscopical determination of marrow segmented neutrophils/neutrophilic granulocyte reserve, Advia percent lymphocytes and microscopical determination of lymphocytes/rubricytes, Advia percent large unstained cells and microscopical determination of myeloblasts/promyelocytes and between Advia percent eosinophils and manual determination of eosinophils were identified. This suggested that Advia WBC counts may be used to approximate BM sample quality and that Advia differential counts may predict marrow granulocyte reserve and lymphocyte/rubricyte stores. Distinct and consistent alterations in cytogram patterns were observed in cases of acute leukaemia, but were less obvious in chronic leukaemia. Complete automated BM analysis was performed in approximately 2 min, while staining and coverslipping of BM slides required approximately 30 min. Hence, although automated analysis should not supplant microscopical evaluation of BM, it can provide useful ancillary information in a short time and flag potentially inadequate or abnormal samples.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Although increased expression of the EVI1 gene is mainly caused by chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome band 3q26, where EVI1 is located, it can also be identified in cases without these rearrangements. The mechanisms that cause increased EVI1 expression in the absence of 3q26 rearrangements remain unclear. Here, we present four cases with increased EVI1 expression due to EVI1 amplification on cytogenetically cryptic double minutes (dmin). The dmin are small acentric chromosome structures and were observed in about 1% of AML and MDS. We investigated the four cases by conventional cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and array comparative genomic hybridization. Furthermore, EVI1 expression was measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. By conventional chromosome analysis, the EVI1 dmin cannot be detected, due to the small size of the amplicons of 0.49-0.78 Mbp. Median % EVI1/ABL expression was 88.9% and therefore comparable to the median % EVI1/ABL expression of patients with EVI1 rearrangements. In conclusion, EVI1 amplification on cytogenetically cryptic dmin causes increased expression of EVI1 and is a new mechanism that causes increased EVI1 expression without a 3q26 rearrangement.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Although previous studies have shown that DS-ALL differs clinically and genetically from non-DS-ALL, much remains to be elucidated as regards genetic and prognostic factors in DS-ALL. METHODS: To address clinical and genetic differences between DS-ALL and non-DS-ALL and to identify prognostic factors in DS-ALL, we ascertained and reviewed all 128 pediatric DS-ALL diagnosed in the Nordic countries between 1981 and 2010. Their clinical and genetic features were compared with those of the 4,647 B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL cases diagnosed during the same time period. RESULTS: All 128 DS-ALL were BCP ALL, comprising 2.7% of all such cases. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly (P = 0.026 and P = 0.003, respectively) worse for DS-ALL patients with white blood cell counts >/=50 x 109/l. The age distributions varied between the DS and non-DS cases, with age peaks at 2 and 3 years, respectively; none of the DS patients had infant ALL (P = 0.029). The platelet counts were lower in the DS-ALL group (P = 0.005). Abnormal karyotypes were more common in non-DS-ALL (P < 0.0001), and there was a significant difference in the modal number distribution, with only 2% high hyperdiploid DS-ALL cases (P < 0.0001).

However, the characteristics of Ig rearrangements in the population from the South of France have not yet been established. Here, we studied CLL B-cell repertoire and mutational pattern in a Southern French cohort of patients using an in-house protocol for whole sequencing of the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes. Described biased usage of variable, diversity and joining genes between the mutated and unmutated groups was found in our population. However, variable gene frequencies are more in accordance with those observed in the Mediterranean patients. We found that the third complementary-determining region (CDR) length was higher in unmutated sequences, because of bias in the diversity and joining genes usage and not due to the N diversity. Mutations found in CLL followed the features of canonical somatic hypermutation mechanism: preference of targeting for activation-induced cytidine deaminase and polymerase motifs, base change bias for transitions and more replacement mutations occurring in CDRs than in framework regions. Surprisingly, localization of activation-induced cytidine deaminase motifs onto the variable gene showed a preference for framework regions. The study of the characteristics at the age of diagnosis showed no difference in clinical outcome, but suggested a tendency of increased replacement and transition-over-transversion mutations and a longer third CDR length in older patients.","['(c) 2014 The Authors.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Three hundred young adult female FVB/N mice, 152 test and 148 control, were entered into the experiment. Mice were placed in an annular cassette around a cylindrical phantom, which was positioned lateral to the mid-SOBP of a 165-MeV, clinical proton beam. The average distance from the edge of the mid-SOBP to the conscious active mice was 21.5 cm. The phantom was irradiated with once-daily fractions of 25 Gy, 4 days per week, for 6 weeks. The age at death and cause of death (ie, cancer and type vs noncancer causes) were assessed over the life span of the mice. RESULTS: Exposure of mice to a dose of 600 Gy of proton beam-generated neutrons, reduced the median life span of the mice by 4.2% (Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival, P=.053). The relative risk of death from cancer in neutron exposed versus control mice was 1.40 for cancer of all types (P=.0006) and 1.22 for solid cancers (P=.09). For a typical 60 Gy dose of clinical protons, the observed 22% increased risk of solid cancer would be expected to decrease by a factor of 10. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure of mice to neutrons generated by a proton dose that exceeds a typical course of radiation therapy by a factor of 10, resulted in a statistically significant increase in the background incidence of leukemia and a marginally significant increase in solid cancer. The results indicate that the risk of out-of-field second solid cancers from SOBP proton-generated neutrons and typical treatment schedules, is 6 to 10 times less than is suggested by current neutron risk estimates.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Whereas total marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) provides a more conformally targeted radiation therapy for patients, organ sparing has the potential to place the patient at a higher risk for EM relapse than TBI. This study evaluated EM relapse in patients treated with TMLI at our institution. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients eligible for analysis had been enrolled in 1 of 3 prospective TMLI trials between 2006 and 2012. The TMLI targeted bones, major lymph node chains, liver, spleen, testes, and brain, using image-guided tomotherapy with total dose ranging from 12 to 15 Gy. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients with a median age of 47 years were studied. The median follow-up was 12.8 months. Incidence of EM relapse and bone marrow (BM) relapse were 12.9% and 25.7%, respectively. Of the 13 patients who had EM relapse, 4 also had BM relapse, and 7 had EM disease prior to HCT. There were a total of 19 EM relapse sites as the site of initial recurrence: 11 soft tissue, 6 lymph node, 2 skin. Nine of these sites were within the target region and received >/=12 Gy. Ten initial EM relapse sites were outside of the target region: 5 sites received 10.1 to 11.4 Gy while 5 sites received <10 Gy. Pretransplantation EM was the only significant predictor of subsequent EM relapse. The cumulative incidence of EM relapse was 4% at 1 year and 11.4% at 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: EM relapse incidence was as frequent in regions receiving >/=10 Gy as those receiving <10 Gy. EM relapse rates following TMLI that included HCT regimens were comparable to published results with regimens including TBI and suggest that TMLI is not associated with an increased EM relapse risk.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty-one pediatric ALL patients underwent SCT with TBI and received additional cranial irradiation or CSI because of CNS leukemic involvement. Prospective neurocognitive testing was performed before and after SCT in a subset of patients. Cox regression models were used to determine associations of patient and disease characteristics and treatment methods with outcomes. RESULTS: All patients received a cranial radiation boost; median total cranial dose was 24 Gy. Eighteen patients (44%) received a spinal boost; median total spinal dose for these patients was 18 Gy. Five-year disease-free survival (DFS) for all patients was 67%. Those receiving CSI had a trend toward superior DFS compared with those receiving a cranial boost alone (hazard ratio 3.23, P=.14). Patients with isolated CNS disease before SCT had a trend toward superior DFS (hazard ratio 3.64, P=.11, 5-year DFS 74%) compared with those with combined CNS and bone marrow disease (5-year DFS 59%). Neurocognitive testing revealed a mean post-SCT overall intelligence quotient of 103.7 at 4.4 years. Relative deficiencies in processing speed and/or working memory were noted in 6 of 16 tested patients (38%). Pre- and post-SCT neurocognitive testing revealed no significant change in intelligence quotient (mean increase +4.7 points). At a mean of 12.5 years after transplant, 11 of 13 long-term survivors (85%) had completed at least some coursework at a 2- or 4-year college. CONCLUSION: The addition of CSI to TBI before SCT in pediatric ALL with CNS involvement is effective and well-tolerated.

In the present study, we hypothesised that the different cellular uptake and/or metabolism of CUR and THC might be a possible explanation for the previously observed differences in their effects on lipid accumulation in THP-1 monocytes/macrophages. Chromatography with tandem MS revealed that CUR was readily taken up by THP-1 monocytes/macrophages and slowly metabolised to hexahydrocurcumin sulphate. By contrast, the uptake of THC was low. In parallel with CUR uptake, increased lipid uptake was observed in THP-1 macrophages but not with the uptake of THC or another CUR metabolite and structurally related compounds. From these results, it is possible to deduce that CUR and THC are taken up and metabolised differently in THP-1 cells, which determine their biological activity. The remarkable differential cellular uptake of CUR, relative to THC and other similar molecules, may imply that the CUR uptake into cells may occur via a transporter.",,"['Nakagawa, Kiyotaka', 'Zingg, Jean-Marc', 'Kim, Sharon H', 'Thomas, Michael J', 'Dolnikowski, Gregory G', 'Azzi, Angelo', 'Miyazawa, Teruo', 'Meydani, Mohsen']","['Nakagawa K', 'Zingg JM', 'Kim SH', 'Thomas MJ', 'Dolnikowski GG', 'Azzi A', 'Miyazawa T', 'Meydani M']","['Vascular Biology Laboratory, Jean Mayer USDA-Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, Tufts University,Boston,MA02111,USA.', 'Vascular Biology Laboratory, Jean Mayer USDA-Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, Tufts University,Boston,MA02111,USA.', 'Vascular Biology Laboratory, Jean Mayer USDA-Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, Tufts University,Boston,MA02111,USA.', 'Vascular Biology Laboratory, Jean Mayer USDA-Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, Tufts University,Boston,MA02111,USA.', 'Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, Jean Mayer USDA-Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, Tufts University,Boston,MA,02111,USA.', 'Vascular Biology Laboratory, Jean Mayer USDA-Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, Tufts University,Boston,MA02111,USA.', 'Food and Biodynamic Chemistry Laboratory, Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University,Sendai981-8555,Japan.', 'Vascular Biology Laboratory, Jean Mayer USDA-Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, Tufts University,Boston,MA02111,USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20140411,England,Br J Nutr,The British journal of nutrition,0372547,IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Curcumin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Diarylheptanoids', 'Glucuronides/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', '*Lipid Metabolism', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Sulfates/chemistry/metabolism', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,,2014/04/15 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2014/04/15 06:00'],"['2014/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0007114514000567 [pii]', '10.1017/S0007114514000567 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Nutr. 2014 Jul 14;112(1):8-14. doi: 10.1017/S0007114514000567.

Impact of lymphocyte recovery on post-transplant outcomes has been suggested but reports are conflicting. We evaluated the impact of lymphocyte recovery at 28 d post-HCT in 191 AML patients using peripheral blood stem cells as graft. Patients were divided into those with absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) >/= 0.5 x 10(9) /L (n = 111, 58%; high ALC group) and those with ALC < 0.5 x 10(9) /L (n = 80, 42%; low ALC group), at day 28 post-transplant. With a median follow-up of 49 months, overall survival (OS) was significantly improved in the high ALC group (59% at 3 yr) vs. patients with low ALC (40% at 3 yr, P = 0.03). Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was significantly lower in the high ALC group (16% at 3 yr) vs. low ALC group (36% at 3 yr, P = 0.001). Multivariable analysis for CIR demonstrated high ALC group as an independent factor decreasing relapse risk (P = 0.03, HR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.26-0.92). Multivariable analysis for OS and non-relapse mortality did not demonstrate ALC >/= 0.5 x 10(9) /L at 28 d post-transplant to be predictive. We conclude that lymphocyte recovery with ALC >/= 0.5 x 10(9) /L at day 28 post-transplant is associated with less relapse in AML patients undergoing allogeneic peripheral blood HCT, but without survival benefit.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Here, we review the relationship between Notch signaling and different fates of stem cells and other BM niche cells. METHODS: Relevant English-language literature were searched and retrieved from PubMed (2000-2013) using the terms Notch signaling, BM niche, and microRNAs (miRNAs). DISCUSSION: Notch signaling pathway is a signaling system involved in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The notch signaling pathway components are associated with interaction between leukemic, metastatic, and normal cells and their microenvironment. miRNAs play an important role in expression and regulation of signaling molecules. It is necessary to evaluate the relationship between aberrant miRNA expression and notch signaling such as miR-128 and miR-30 in glioma and angiogenesis with notch signaling, respectively.

Subsequently, PCR products of positive samples were confirmed by sequencing analyses. RESULTS: ITD mutations occurred in 10% of all pediatric acute leukemia, including AML and ALL. 25.9% of AML patients harbor a mutation in the ITD in various subtypes. The frequency of ITD mutations was 4% in ALL. Various insertions of nucleotides in ITD were observed, similar to those described in the literature previously.

This paper reports the purification and biochemical characterization of three new phospholipases A2 (PLA2s), one of which is presumably an enzymatically active Asp49 and two are very likely enzymatically inactive Lys49 PLA2 homologues. The purification was obtained after two chromatographic steps on ion exchange and reverse phase column. The 2D SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the proteins have pI values around 10, are each made of a single chain, and have molecular masses near 13 kDa, which was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The N-terminal similarity analysis of the sequences showed that the proteins are highly homologous with other Lys49 and Asp49 PLA2s from Bothrops species. The PLA2s isolated were named BmatTX-I (Lys49 PLA2-like), BmatTX-II (Lys49 PLA2-like), and BmatTX-III (Asp49 PLA2). The PLA2s induced cytokine release from mouse neutrophils and showed cytotoxicity towards JURKAT (leukemia T) and SK-BR-3 (breast adenocarcinoma) cell lines and promastigote forms of Leishmania amazonensis.

METHODS: Between January 2001 and December 2010, 104 children with previously untreated ALL were enrolled at the Pusan National University Hospital. All of them were initially stratified based on the National Cancer Institute (NCI) risk; 48 (46.2%) were diagnosed with high-risk ALL. The medical charts of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Twenty (19.2%) of the 104 children with ALL had initial leukocyte counts of >100x10(9)/L, and 11 patients had a leukocyte count of >200x10(9)/L. Male gender, T-cell phenotype, and massive splenomegaly were positively associated with hyperleukocytosis. Common early complications during induction therapy included renal dysfunction, and central nervous system hemorrhage. The complete remission (CR) rate for the pediatric ALL patients with hyperleukocytosis (94.1%) was similar to the overall CR rate (95.6%). The estimated 3-year event free survival (EFS) and overall survival of ALL children with hyperleukocytosis were 75.0% and 81.2%, respectively. However, patients with initial leukocyte counts >200x10(9)/L had a lower EFS than those with initial leukocyte counts 100-200x10(9)/L (63.6% vs. 100%; P=0.046). CONCLUSION: The outcome of pediatric ALL cases with an initial leukocyte count >200x10(9)/L was very poor, probably due to early toxicity-related death during induction therapy.",,"['Kong, Seom Gim', 'Seo, Jung Ho', 'Jun, So Eun', 'Lee, Byung Ki', 'Lim, Young Tak']","['Kong SG', 'Seo JH', 'Jun SE', 'Lee BK', 'Lim YT']","['Department of Pediatrics, Pusan National University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pusan National University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pusan National University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pusan National University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pusan National University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140324,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Central nervous system hemorrhage', 'Hyperleukocytosis', 'Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",2014/04/12 06:00,2014/04/12 06:01,['2014/04/12 06:00'],"['2013/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2014/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2014.49.1.29 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2014 Mar;49(1):29-35. doi: 10.5045/br.2014.49.1.29.

Here, we characterized 7 cases of hematologic malignancy exhibiting t(9;22) and inv(16) coexistence. METHODS: We reviewed the cytogenetic data for hematologic malignancies treated at the Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center between January 2004 and June 2013. We identified 7 cases exhibiting t(9;22) and inv(16) coexistence. In addition, we analyzed mutations in the IKZF1, NPM1, FLT3, N-RAS, K-RAS, c-KIT, and TP53 genes. RESULTS: Four cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML; 1 chronic phase, 2 accelerated phase, and 1 blast phase) and 3 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 1 de novo and 2 therapy-related) were identified. The percentages of circulating blasts and bone marrow eosinophils were higher in AML cases than in CML cases (53% vs. 5% and 30% vs. 5.5%, respectively). The proportions of each chromosomal abnormality were used along with follow-up karyotyping results to identify secondary changes. In BCR/ABL, a p210 fusion transcript was associated with CML, whereas a p190 fusion transcript was associated with AML. One patient with AML harbored 2 mutations: c-KIT D816V and TP53 E11Q. All patients except 1 with CML blast phase sustained clinical remission after treatment, which included an imatinib mesylate regimen.

It is present in 3-4% of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph(+) ALL), and about 25% of adult ALL cases. Prior to the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), Ph(+) ALL was associated with a very poor prognosis despite the use of intensive chemotherapy and frequently hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) in first remission. The development of TKIs revolutionized the therapy of Ph(+) ALL. Addition of the first generation ABL1 class TKI imatinib to intensive chemotherapy dramatically increased the survival for children with Ph(+) ALL and established that many patients can be cured without HSCT. In parallel, the mechanistic understanding of Ph(+) ALL expanded exponentially through careful mapping of pathways downstream of BCR-ABL1, the discovery of mutations in master regulators of B-cell development such as IKZF1 (Ikaros), PAX5, and early B-cell factor (EBF), the recognition of the complex clonal architecture of Ph(+) ALL, and the delineation of genomic, epigenetic, and signaling abnormalities contributing to relapse and resistance. Still, many important basic and clinical questions remain unanswered. Current clinical trials are testing second generation TKIs in patients with newly diagnosed Ph(+) ALL. Neither the optimal duration of therapy nor the optimal chemotherapy backbone are currently defined. The role of HSCT in first remission and post-transplant TKI therapy also require further study. In addition, it will be crucial to continue to dig deeper into understanding Ph(+) ALL at a mechanistic level, and translate findings into complementary targeted approaches. Expanding targeted therapies hold great promise to decrease toxicity and improve survival in this high-risk disease, which provides a paradigm for how targeted therapies can be incorporated into treatment of other high-risk leukemias.",,"['Bernt, Kathrin M', 'Hunger, Stephen P']","['Bernt KM', 'Hunger SP']","[""Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Colorado , Aurora, CO , USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Colorado , Aurora, CO , USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140325,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation', 'tyrosine kinase inhibition']",2014/04/12 06:00,2014/04/12 06:01,['2014/04/12 06:00'],"['2014/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2014.00054 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2014 Mar 25;4:54. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2014.00054. eCollection 2014.,,,PMC3971203,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, WT1 is a currently undruggable, intracellular protein. ESKM is a human IgG1 T-cell receptor mimic monoclonal antibody directed to a 9-amino acid sequence of WT1 in the context of cell surface HLA-A*02. ESKM was therapeutically effective, alone and in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), against Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute leukemia in murine models, including a leukemia with the most common, pan-TKI, gatekeeper resistance mutation, T315I.

Alemtuzumab-containing chemoimmunotherapy regimens can be effective but frequently cause serious infections. We report a Phase II trial testing the efficacy and tolerability of a short-duration regimen combining pentostatin, alemtuzumab, and low-dose high-frequency rituximab designed to decrease the risk of treatment-associated infections and to limit the loss of CD20 expression by CLL cells. The study enrolled 39 patients with progressive CLL that was either relapsed/refractory (n = 36) or previously untreated with 17p13 deletion (17p13-) (n = 3). Thirteen (33%) patients had both 17p13- and TP53 mutations predicted to be dysfunctional, and eight patients had purine analog refractory CLL without TP53 dysfunction. Twenty-six (67%) patients completed therapy, with only five (13%) patients having treatment-limiting toxicity and no treatment-related deaths. Twenty-two (56%) patients responded to treatment, with 11 (28%) complete responses (four with incomplete bone marrow recovery). Median progression-free survival was 7.2 months, time to next treatment was 9.1 months, and overall survival was 34.1 months. The majority of deaths (82%) were caused by progressive disease, including transformed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 6). Correlative studies showed that low-dose rituximab activates complement and natural killer cells without a profound and sustained decrease in expression of CD20 by circulating CLL cells. We conclude that pentostatin, alemtuzumab, and low-dose high-frequency rituximab is a tolerable and effective therapy for CLL and that low-dose rituximab therapy can activate innate immune cytotoxic mechanisms without substantially decreasing CD20 expression.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Zent, Clive S', 'Taylor, Ronald P', 'Lindorfer, Margaret A', 'Beum, Paul V', 'LaPlant, Betsy', 'Wu, Wenting', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Bowen, Deborah A', 'Conte, Michael J', 'Frederick, Lori A', 'Link, Brian K', 'Blackwell, Sue E', 'Veeramani, Suresh', 'Baig, Nisar A', 'Viswanatha, David S', 'Weiner, George J', 'Witzig, Thomas E']","['Zent CS', 'Taylor RP', 'Lindorfer MA', 'Beum PV', 'LaPlant B', 'Wu W', 'Call TG', 'Bowen DA', 'Conte MJ', 'Frederick LA', 'Link BK', 'Blackwell SE', 'Veeramani S', 'Baig NA', 'Viswanatha DS', 'Weiner GJ', 'Witzig TE']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140426,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Aged', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antigens, CD20/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/immunology', 'Pentostatin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Rituximab']",,,2014/04/12 06:00,2014/10/10 06:00,['2014/04/12 06:00'],"['2014/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23737 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2014 Jul;89(7):757-65. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23737.

A DEP approach utilizing a microarray device now allows rapid isolation of ccf-DNA directly from a small volume of unprocessed blood. In this study, the DEP device is used to compare the ccf-DNA isolated directly from whole blood and plasma from 11 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients and one normal individual. Ccf-DNA from both blood and plasma samples was separated into DEP high-field regions, after which cells (blood), proteins, and other biomolecules were removed by a fluidic wash. The concentrated ccf-DNA was detected on-chip by fluorescence, and then eluted for PCR and DNA sequencing. The complete process from blood to PCR required less than 10 min; an additional 15 min was required to obtain plasma from whole blood. Ccf-DNA from the equivalent of 5 muL of CLL blood and 5 muL of plasma was amplified by PCR using Ig heavy-chain variable (IGHV) specific primers to identify the unique IGHV gene expressed by the leukemic B-cell clone. The PCR and DNA sequencing results obtained by DEP from all 11 CLL blood samples and from 8 of the 11 CLL plasma samples were exactly comparable to the DNA sequencing results obtained from genomic DNA isolated from CLL patient leukemic B cells (gold standard).","['(c) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Although certain T-cell subsets have been reported to be of prognostic significance in this disease, their interplay is complex and it remains incompletely understood which of these subsets significantly drive CLL progression. Here, we determined immunological profiles of 24 circulating T-cell subsets from 79 untreated individuals by multiparametric flow cytometry. This screening cohort included healthy donors, patients with monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), Rai 0 CLL and advanced CLL. We applied multidimensional scaling analysis as rigorous and unbiased statistical tool to globally assess the composition of the circulating T-cell environment and to generate T-cell scores reflecting its integrity. These scores allowed clear distinction between advanced CLL and healthy controls, whereas both MBL and Rai 0 CLL showed intermediate scores mirroring the biological continuum of CLL and its precursor stages. T-cell stimulation and suppression assays as well as longitudinal T-cell profiling showed an increasingly suppressive regulatory function initiating at the MBL stage. Effector function was impaired only after transition to CLL and partially recovered after chemoimmunotherapy. In an independent validation cohort of 52 untreated CLL cases, aberrant T-cell profiles were significantly associated with shorter time to treatment independently of other prognostic parameters. Random forest modeling predicted regulatory T-cell, gamma/delta and NKT-cells, as well as exhaustion of the CD8+ subset as potential drivers of progression.

Clinical and histopathologic evidence suggests that retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) can harbor M tuberculosis. However, the mechanism of M tuberculosis phagocytosis and its growth in RPE is not clear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate M tuberculosis phagocytosis, replication, and cytopathic effects in RPE cells compared with macrophages. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Human fetal RPE and monocytic leukemia macrophage (THP-1) cell lines were cultured, and RPE and THP-1 cells were exposed to avirulent M tuberculosis H37Ra. Mycobacteria were added to RPE and THP-1 cells with a 5:1 multiplicity of infection. Nonphagocytized M tuberculosis was removed after 12 hours of exposure (day 0). Cells were harvested at days 0, 1, and 5 to count live and dead cells and intracellular mycobacteria. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry; intracellular bacillary load, following TLR2 and TLR4 blockade. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Number of intracellular M tuberculosis, cell survival, and TLR2 and TLR4 expression in RPE and THP-1 cells following exposure to M tuberculosis. RESULTS: At day 0, an equal number of intracellular M tuberculosis was observed per THP-1 and RPE cells (0.45 and 0.35 M tuberculosis per RPE and THP-1 cells, respectively). Mean (SD) number of intracellular M tuberculosis at day 5 was 1.9 (0.03) and 3.3 (0.01) per RPE and THP-1 cells, respectively (P < .001). Viability of infected RPE was significantly greater than that of THP-1 cells at day 5 (viable cells: 17 [8%] THP-1 vs 73% [4%] RPE; P < .05). Expression of TLR2 and TLR4 was detected in both cell types after 12 hours of exposure. Inhibition of TLR2 and TLR4 reduced intracellular M tuberculosis counts in RPE but not in THP-1 cells. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Mycobacterium tuberculosis is phagocytized by RPE to a similar extent as in macrophages. However, RPE cells are better able to control bacillary growth and RPE cell survival is greater than that of THP-1 cells following mycobacterial infection, suggesting that RPE can serve as a reservoir for intraocular M tuberculosis infection.",,"['Nazari, Hossein', 'Karakousis, Petros C', 'Rao, Narsing A']","['Nazari H', 'Karakousis PC', 'Rao NA']","['University of Southern California Eye Institute, Department of Ophthalmology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles.', 'Department of Medicine, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland3Department of International Health, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'University of Southern California Eye Institute, Department of Ophthalmology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,JAMA Ophthalmol,JAMA ophthalmology,101589539,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Eye Infections, Bacterial/microbiology/pathology', 'Fetus', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Macrophages/cytology/microbiology', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*growth & development/*pathogenicity', 'Phagocytosis/physiology', 'Retinal Pigment Epithelium/cytology/*microbiology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/metabolism', 'Uveitis/microbiology/physiopathology']",,,2014/04/12 06:00,2014/08/19 06:00,['2014/04/12 06:00'],"['2014/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1859729 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2014.270 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Ophthalmol. 2014 Jun;132(6):724-9. doi: 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2014.270.,"['0 (TLR2 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)']",,,"['019506/PHS HHS/United States', 'EY03040/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The calculated specificity for myeloid involvement was 100 % for CD117 and CD33, and 98 % for CD13 and CD15 (p < 0.001). The calculated sensitivity for myeloid involvement was 83, 76, 64, and 41 % for CD13, CD117, CD33, and CD15, respectively (p < 0.001). We concluded that CD117 expression is a specific and rather sensitive marker for differential diagnosis between AML and ALL, and except for M5 subtypes, it fails to determine FAB subtypes; lack of expression in M5 can identify M5b.

We previously found that the integration of cAMP/PKA pathway with nuclear receptor-mediated signaling was required during all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced maturation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells. Here we showed that AC9 could affect intracellular cAMP level and enhance the trans-activity of retinoic acid receptor. Knockdown of AC9 in APL cell line NB4 could obviously inhibit ATRA-induced differentiation. We also demonstrated that miR-181a could decrease AC9 expression by targeting 3'UTR of AC9 mRNA, finally controlling the production of intracellular cAMP. The expression of miR-181a itself could be inhibited by CEBPalpha, probably accounting for the differential expression of miR-181a in NB4 and ATRA-resistant NB4-R1 cells. Moreover, we found that AC9 expression was relatively lower in newly diagnosed or relapsed APL patients than in both complete remission and non-leukemia cases, closely correlating with the leukemogenesis of APL. Taken together, our studies revealed for the first time the importance of miR-181a-mediated AC9 downregulation in APL. We also suggested the potential value of AC9 as a biomarker in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of leukemia.",,"['Zhuang, L K', 'Xu, G P', 'Pan, X R', 'Lou, Y J', 'Zou, Q P', 'Xia, D', 'Yan, W W', 'Zhang, Y T', 'Jia, P M', 'Tong, J H']","['Zhuang LK', 'Xu GP', 'Pan XR', 'Lou YJ', 'Zou QP', 'Xia D', 'Yan WW', 'Zhang YT', 'Jia PM', 'Tong JH']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Science and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Science and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Science and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Science and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Science and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Science and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Science and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Science and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Science and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Science and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140410,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Adenylyl Cyclases/*genetics/metabolism', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects/genetics', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,,2014/04/12 06:00,2015/05/20 06:00,['2014/04/12 06:00'],"['2013/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2014/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014130 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.130 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2014 Apr 10;5:e1161. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.130.,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (MIrn181 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (adenylate cyclase 9)']",,PMC5424108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor progression and metastasis are affected by dynamic changes in the specific phenotypes of macrophage subpopulations; however, the mechanisms by which tumor cells modulate macrophage polarization remain incompletely understood. Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) is a central adaptor protein of innate immune responses to extracellular pathogens. We report that increased CARD9 expression is primarily localized in infiltrated macrophages and significantly associated with advanced histopathologic stage and the presence of metastasis. Using CARD9-deficient (CARD9(-/-)) mice, we show that bone marrow-derived CARD9 promotes liver metastasis of colon carcinoma cells. Mechanistic studies reveal that CARD9 contributes to tumor metastasis by promoting metastasis-associated macrophage polarization through activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathway. We further demonstrate that tumor cell-secreted vascular endothelial growth factor facilitates spleen tyrosine kinase activation in macrophages, which is necessary for formation of the CARD9-B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10-mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 complex. Taken together, our results indicating that CARD9 is a regulator of metastasis-associated macrophages will lead to new insights into evolution of the microenvironments supporting tumor metastasis, thereby providing targets for anticancer therapies.",,"['Yang, M', 'Shao, J-H', 'Miao, Y-J', 'Cui, W', 'Qi, Y-F', 'Han, J-H', 'Lin, X', 'Du, J']","['Yang M', 'Shao JH', 'Miao YJ', 'Cui W', 'Qi YF', 'Han JH', 'Lin X', 'Du J']","['1] Department of Cardiac and Vascular Biology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China [2] The Key Laboratory of Remodeling-Related Cardiovascular Diseases, Capital Medical University, Ministry of Education, Beijing Institute of Heart Lung and Blood Vessel Diseases, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital to Nanchang University, Jiangxi, China.', '1] Department of Cardiac and Vascular Biology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China [2] The Key Laboratory of Remodeling-Related Cardiovascular Diseases, Capital Medical University, Ministry of Education, Beijing Institute of Heart Lung and Blood Vessel Diseases, Beijing, China.', '1] Department of Cardiac and Vascular Biology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China [2] The Key Laboratory of Remodeling-Related Cardiovascular Diseases, Capital Medical University, Ministry of Education, Beijing Institute of Heart Lung and Blood Vessel Diseases, Beijing, China.', '1] Department of Cardiac and Vascular Biology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China [2] The Key Laboratory of Remodeling-Related Cardiovascular Diseases, Capital Medical University, Ministry of Education, Beijing Institute of Heart Lung and Blood Vessel Diseases, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology and School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', '1] Department of Cardiac and Vascular Biology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China [2] The Key Laboratory of Remodeling-Related Cardiovascular Diseases, Capital Medical University, Ministry of Education, Beijing Institute of Heart Lung and Blood Vessel Diseases, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140411,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,IM,"['Animals', 'CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Communication', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",,,2014/04/12 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2014/04/12 06:00'],"['2013/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2014/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd201445 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2014.45 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2014 Aug;21(8):1290-302. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2014.45.

However, these systems have biases that may strongly affect research outcomes. To address this issue, we generated very large datasets consisting of ~ 120,000 to ~ 180,000 unselected integrations in the mouse genome for the Sleeping Beauty (SB) and piggyBac (PB) transposons, and the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV). We analyzed ~ 80 (epi)genomic features to generate bias maps at both local and genome-wide scales. MMTV showed a remarkably uniform distribution of integrations across the genome. More distinct preferences were observed for the two transposons, with PB showing remarkable resemblance to bias profiles of the Murine Leukemia Virus. Furthermore, we present a model where target site selection is directed at multiple scales. At a large scale, target site selection is similar across systems, and defined by domain-oriented features, namely expression of proximal genes, proximity to CpG islands and to genic features, chromatin compaction and replication timing. Notable differences between the systems are mainly observed at smaller scales, and are directed by a diverse range of features. To study the effect of these biases on integration sites occupied under selective pressure, we turned to insertional mutagenesis (IM) screens. In IM screens, putative cancer genes are identified by finding frequently targeted genomic regions, or Common Integration Sites (CISs). Within three recently completed IM screens, we identified 7%-33% putative false positive CISs, which are likely not the result of the oncogenic selection process.

In order to find new drugs with anticancer activities, we report here the synthesis and the structural analysis of new coumarin derivatives which combine the coumarin core and five member heterocycles in hydrazinylidene-chroman-2,4-diones. The derivatives were prepared by derivatization of the appropriate heterocyclic amines which were used as electrophiles to attack the coumarin ring. The structures were characterized by spectroscopic techniques including IR, NMR, 2D-NMR and MS. These derivatives were further characterized especially in terms of a potential cytotoxic and apoptogenic effect in several cancer cell lines including the breast and prostate cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, PC-3, LNCaP, and the monocytic leukemia cell line U937. Cell viability was determined after 48 h and 72 h of treatment with the novel compounds by MTT assay and the 50% inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values) were determined. Out of the 8 novel compounds screened for reduced cell viability, 4c, 4d and 4e were found to be the most promising and effective ones having EC50 values that were several fold reduced when compared to the reference substance 4-hydroxycoumarin. However, the effects were cancer cell line dependent. The breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, the prostate cancer LNCaP cells, and U937 cells were most sensitive, MCF-7 cells were less sensitive, and PC-3 cells were more resistant. Reduced cell viability was accompanied by increased apoptosis as shown by PARP-1 cleavage and reduced activity of the survival protein kinase Akt. In summary, this study has identified three novel coumarin derivatives that in comparison to 4-hydroxycoumarin have a higher efficiency to reduce cancer cell viability and trigger apoptosis and therefore may represent interesting novel drug candidates.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We developed a co-culture method integrating hypoxia, aryl hydrocarbon receptor inhibition and micro-environmental support via human endothelial cells to isolate these cells. X-chromosome inactivation studies of the least mature precursors derived following prolonged culture of CD34(+)/CD33(-) cells revealed polyclonal growth in highly curable AMLs, suggesting that mutations necessary for clonal expansion were acquired in more mature progenitors. Consistently, in core-binding factor (CBF) leukemias with known complementing mutations, immature precursors derived following prolonged culture of CD34(+)/CD33(-) cells harbored neither mutation or the CBF mutation alone, whereas more mature precursors often carried both mutations.

To unravel the factors involved in the acquisition of bortezomib resistance in vivo, immunodeficient mice were engrafted with a set of MCL cell lines with different levels of sensitivity to the drug, followed by gene expression profiling of the tumors and functional validation of the identified gene signatures. We observed an increased tumorigenicity of bortezomib-resistant MCL cells in vivo, which was associated with plasmacytic differentiation features, like interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) and Blimp-1 upregulation. Lenalidomide was particularly active in this subgroup of tumors, targeting IRF4 expression and plasmacytic differentiation program, thus overcoming bortezomib resistance. Moreover, repression of the IRF4 target gene MYC in bortezomib-resistant cells by gene knockdown or treatment with CPI203, a BET (bromodomain and extra terminal) bromodomain inhibitor, synergistically induced cell death when combined with lenalidomide. In mice, addition of CPI203 to lenalidomide therapy further decreased tumor burden, involving simultaneous MYC and IRF4 downregulation and apoptosis induction. Together, these results suggest that exacerbated IRF4/MYC signaling is associated to bortezomib resistance in MCL in vivo and warrant clinical evaluation of lenalidomide plus BET inhibitor combination in MCL cases refractory to proteasome inhibition.",,"['Moros, A', 'Rodriguez, V', 'Saborit-Villarroya, I', 'Montraveta, A', 'Balsas, P', 'Sandy, P', 'Martinez, A', 'Wiestner, A', 'Normant, E', 'Campo, E', 'Perez-Galan, P', 'Colomer, D', 'Roue, G']","['Moros A', 'Rodriguez V', 'Saborit-Villarroya I', 'Montraveta A', 'Balsas P', 'Sandy P', 'Martinez A', 'Wiestner A', 'Normant E', 'Campo E', 'Perez-Galan P', 'Colomer D', 'Roue G']","[""Hemato-Oncology Department, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Hemato-Oncology Department, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Hemato-Oncology Department, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Hemato-Oncology Department, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Hemato-Oncology Department, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Department of Pharmacology, Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', ""1] Hemato-Oncology Department, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain [2] Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Hemato-Oncology Department, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""1] Hemato-Oncology Department, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain [2] Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Hemato-Oncology Department, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140318,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/metabolism', 'Lenalidomide', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,,2014/04/12 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/04/12 06:00'],"['2014/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/26 00:00 [revised]', '2014/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014106 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.106 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Oct;28(10):2049-59. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.106.

A major complication associated with CLL is severe recurrent infections, which are often fatal. Vulnerability to infection is due to a wide variety of immunological defects, yet the initiating events of immunodeficiency in CLL are unclear. Using CLL patient samples and a mouse model of CLL, we have discovered that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which underpin the activity of effector immune cells critical for anti-viral immunity and anti-tumor responses, are reduced in number and functionally impaired in progressive CLL. As a result, the levels of interferon alpha (IFNalpha) production, a cytokine critical for immunity, are markedly reduced. Lower pDC numbers with impaired IFNalpha production was due to the decreased expression of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor (Flt3) and Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), respectively. Reduced Flt3 expression was reversed using inhibitors of TGF-beta and TNF, an effect correlating with a reduction in tumor load. Defects in pDC numbers and function offer new insight into mechanisms underpinning the profound immunodeficiency affecting CLL patients and provide a potentially novel avenue for restoring immunocompetency in CLL.",,"['Saulep-Easton, D', 'Vincent, F B', 'Le Page, M', 'Wei, A', 'Ting, S B', 'Croce, C M', 'Tam, C', 'Mackay, F']","['Saulep-Easton D', 'Vincent FB', 'Le Page M', 'Wei A', 'Ting SB', 'Croce CM', 'Tam C', 'Mackay F']","['Department of Immunology, Monash University Central Clinical School, Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct (AMREP), 89 Commercial Road, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Immunology, Monash University Central Clinical School, Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct (AMREP), 89 Commercial Road, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Immunology, Monash University Central Clinical School, Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct (AMREP), 89 Commercial Road, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', '1] Department of Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, 55 Commercial Road, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia [2] Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Division of Blood Cancers, Monash University Central Clinical School, Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct (AMREP), 89 Commercial Road, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', '1] Department of Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, 55 Commercial Road, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia [2] Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Division of Blood Cancers, Monash University Central Clinical School, Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct (AMREP), 89 Commercial Road, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University, 460 West 12th Avenue, Columbus, OH, USA.', ""Department of Haematology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, St. Andrews's Place, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", 'Department of Immunology, Monash University Central Clinical School, Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct (AMREP), 89 Commercial Road, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140318,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry', 'CpG Islands', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology', 'Disease Progression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Mice', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/metabolism']",,,2014/04/12 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/04/12 06:00'],"['2013/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/10 00:00 [revised]', '2014/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014105 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.105 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Oct;28(10):2005-15. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.105.

Unfortunately, during cancer progression, mammary tumors can escape from estrogen control, resulting in resistance to treatment. In this study, we demonstrate that activation of the actin/megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1) signaling pathway promotes the hormonal escape of estrogen-sensitive breast cancer cell lines. The actin/MKL1 signaling pathway is silenced in differentiated ERalpha-positive breast cancer MCF-7 and T47D cell lines and active in ERalpha-negative HMT-3522 T4-2 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, which have undergone epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We showed that MKL1 activation in MCF-7 cells, either by modulating actin dynamics or using MKL1 mutants, down-regulates ERalpha expression and abolishes E2-dependent cell growth. Interestingly, the constitutively active form of MKL1 represses PR and HER2 expression in these cells and increases the expression of HB-EGF, TGFbeta, and amphiregulin growth factors in an E2-independent manner. The resulting expression profile (ER-, PR-, HER2-) typically corresponds to the triple-negative breast cancer expression profile.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, the understanding of neonatal/adult differences in environmental signals that influence differentiation pathway stability is still incomplete. Our recent findings suggest that Toll-like receptors provide a mechanism for producing cells of the innate immune system from early stages of lymphoid development in mice. We now show that both human early multilymphoid progenitors and more differentiated lymphoid progenitors from normal adult bone marrow express TLR9. Furthermore, they respond to its ligation by upregulating the expression of IL-15Rbeta (CD122) and accelerating the production of functional natural killer (NK)-like cells. Proliferation of the presumed equivalent progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood was stimulated by CpG-containing oligonucleotides or herpes simplex virus, but the already robust NK-cell formation was unchanged. This new information adds to other known differences between neonatal and adult lymphoid progenitors and suggests only the latter replenish innate NK-like cells in response to Toll-like receptor agonists.","['Copyright (c) 2014 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.

However, the therapeutic potential of EcA is impaired by the limited stability of the enzyme in vivo and by the induction of antibodies in the patients. In an attempt to modify the properties of EcA, several variants with amino acid replacements at subunit interfaces were constructed and characterized. Chemical and thermal denaturation analysis monitored by activity, fluorescence, circular dichroism, and differential scanning calorimetry showed that certain variants with exchanges that weaken dimer-dimer interactions exhibited complex denaturation profiles with active dimeric and/or inactive monomeric intermediates appearing at low denaturant concentrations. By contrast, other EcA variants showed considerably enhanced activity and stability as compared to the wild-type enzyme. Thus, even small changes at a subunit interface may markedly affect EcA stability without impairing its catalytic properties.

An analysis of murine leukemia virus (MLV) infection in various human cell lines revealed that prostate cancer cell lines are preferentially infected by XMRV, and this suggested that XMRV infection may confer some sort of growth advantage to prostate cancer cell lines. To examine this hypothesis, androgen-dependent LNCaP cells were infected with XMRV and tested for changes in certain cell growth properties. We found that XMRV-infected LNCaP cells can proliferate in the absence of the androgen dihydrotestosterone. Moreover, androgen receptor expression is significantly reduced in XMRV-infected LNCaP cells. Such alterations were not observed in uninfected and amphotropic MLV-infected LNCaP cells.

METHODS: The expression of LIF protein in 53 paired paraffin-embedded PDAC specimens and adjacent non-cancerous pancreatic tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between their expressions and clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed.Western bolt was used to examine the expression of LIF level in 14 paired fresh PDAC specimens and adjacent non-cancerous pancreatic tissues.Furthermore, Western blot and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to detect the LIF-R mRNA and protein level of LIF in 6 pancreatic cancer cell lines (AsPC-1, BxPC-3, PANC-1, SW-1990, Capan-2 and Miapaca-2). And the assays of MTT, invasion and migration were used to detect the effects of LIF in regulating cell proliferation, invasion and migration in pancreatic cancer cell lines. RESULTS: The expression of LIF increased in 53 cases of PDAC versus paired normal tissues (66.0% vs 35.8%; t = 3.031, P = 0.004). And its positive association with tumor TNM stage (chi(2) = 3.635, P = 0.057) and invasion depth (chi(2) = 3.726, P = 0.054) had no statistical significance.Univariate analysis revealed that LIF may be a correlative adverse prognostic indicator for patients with PDAC (chi(2) = 3.233, P = 0.072). The expression of LIF was much higher in 14 cases of PDAC than that in adjacent normal pancreatic tissues (t = 5.283, P < 0.01). The protein level of LIF was lower in Capan-2 cells than that in other 5 pancreatic cancer cell lines while mRNA level of LIF receptor was higher than that in other 5 cell lines. Also LIF could promote the proliferation, migration and invasion of Capan-2 cell (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: An over-expression of LIF may contribute to the development and progression of PDAC.LIF can promote the proliferation, migration and invasion in some pancreatic cancer cells.",,"['Peng, Fei', 'Zhou, Jianping', 'Sheng, Weiwei', 'Zhang, Danhua', 'Dong, Ming']","['Peng F', 'Zhou J', 'Sheng W', 'Zhang D', 'Dong M']","['Department of General Surgery, First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110001, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110001, China.

Interesting, our results indicated that the ectopic IDO increases the expression of M2 markers such as IL-10 and CXCR4 while decreases the M1 markers such as CCR7 and IL-12p35. In contrast, the knockdown of IDO expression in THP-1 cells resulted in increased M1 markers and lower M2 markers.

In the current study, using real-time qRT-PCR to detect miR-210 expression in bone marrow samples from 114 children at initial diagnosis of ALL, we investigated the prognostic significance of miR-210 and determined its associations with common clinical characteristics and treatment outcome. We further examined its effect on the response to chemotherapeutic drugs in the Reh and RS4;11 cell lines. Results showed that miR-210 expression was significantly lower in patients suffering from relapse and induction failure than in other patients (P < 0.001). Using the receiver operating characteristic curve, 3.8243 was selected as the cut-off value of miR-210 expression in our test cohort (38 cases). A significantly poorer treatment outcome (P < 0.05) was found in the low-expression group and verified in the validation cohort (76 cases, P < 0.05). Patients with low expression of miR-210 and positive minimal residual disease at the end of induction had a much higher rate of relapse or induction failure (P = 0.001). Increasing/decreasing miR-210 expression using agomir/antagomir could enhance or reduce the response of Reh cells and RS4;11 cells to daunorubicin/dexamethasone/L-asparaginase and daunorubicin/dexamethasone/vincristine, respectively. In conclusion, miR-210 may be a good prognostic factor and a useful predictor of drug sensitivity, and is a potential therapeutic target for pediatric ALL.","['(c) 2014 The Authors.

At present, eight other genes fusing with RARA have been identified. The resulting fusion proteins retain domains of the RARA protein allowing binding to retinoic acid response elements (RARE) and dimerization with the retinoid X receptor protein (RXRA). They participate in protein-protein interactions, associating with RXRA to form hetero-oligomeric complexes that can bind to RARE. They have a dominant-negative effect on wild-type RARA/RXRA transcriptional activity. Moreover, RARA fusion proteins can homodimerize, conferring the ability to regulate an expanded repertoire of genes normally not affected by RARA. RARA fusion proteins behave as potent transcriptional repressors of retinoic acid signalling, inducing a differentiation blockage at the promyelocyte stage which can be overcome with therapeutic doses of ATRA or arsenic trioxide. However, resistance to these two drugs is a major problem, which necessitates development of new therapies.",,"['De Braekeleer, Etienne', 'Douet-Guilbert, Nathalie', 'De Braekeleer, Marc']","['De Braekeleer E', 'Douet-Guilbert N', 'De Braekeleer M']","[""Laboratoire d'Histologie, Embryologie et Cytogenetique, Faculte de Medecine et des Sciences de la Sante, Universite de Brest, Brest, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140410,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Gene Fusion', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Response Elements', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha']",['NOTNLM'],"['RARA', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'chromosomal aberrations', 'fusion genes', 'treatment']",2014/04/12 06:00,2015/01/01 06:00,['2014/04/12 06:00'],"['2014/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/17474086.2014.903794 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2014 Jun;7(3):347-57. doi: 10.1586/17474086.2014.903794.

METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 129 cases of histiocytic, dendritic cell and other related lesions were reviewed from the archives of 10 hospitals in Korea. The cases consisted of histiocytic sarcoma, follicular dendritic cell (FDC) sarcoma, interdigitating cell sarcoma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), Langerhans cell sarcoma, blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, acute monocytic leukaemia M5, giant cell tumour, xanthogranuloma, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour and Rosai-Dorfman disease. BRAF mutation analysis was performed by Sanger sequencing and PNAcqPCR. All the detected mutations of BRAF were V600E. Histiocytic sarcoma exhibited the highest rate of BRAF(V600E) (62.5%, five of eight), followed by Langerhans cell tumours (25%, seven of 28), FDC sarcoma (18.5%, five of 27) and giant cell tumour (6.7%, two of 30). The other tumours did not harbour BRAF mutations. In histiocytic sarcoma, FDC sarcoma and LCH, there were no significant differences in clinical features between tumours containing BRAF(V600E) and those with BRAF(wt) . CONCLUSIONS: BRAF(V600E) was not limited to LCH and was detected more frequently in histiocytic sarcoma. Our findings suggest that the BRAF pathway may contribute to the pathogenesis or malignant transformation of histiocytic and dendritic cell neoplasms.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Go, Heounjeong', 'Jeon, Yoon Kyung', 'Huh, Jooryung', 'Choi, Suk Jin', 'Choi, Yoo-Duk', 'Cha, Hee Jeong', 'Kim, Hyun-Jung', 'Park, Gyeongsin', 'Min, Sookee', 'Kim, Ji Eun']","['Go H', 'Jeon YK', 'Huh J', 'Choi SJ', 'Choi YD', 'Cha HJ', 'Kim HJ', 'Park G', 'Min S', 'Kim JE']","['Department of Pathology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140512,England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dendritic Cells/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['BRAF V600E', 'follicular dendritic cell sarcoma', 'frequency', 'histiocytic and dendritic cell neoplasms', 'histiocytic sarcoma']",2014/04/12 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2014/04/12 06:00'],"['2014/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/his.12416 [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 2014 Aug;65(2):261-72. doi: 10.1111/his.12416.

DOX was loaded in micelles by the direct dissolution method. Physical properties of micelles, including particle size, zeta potential, drug loading efficiency, and drug release profiles, were examined. The orientation of the folate ligand on the surface of the micelles was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique. The cytotoxicity of micelles loaded with DOX at different concentrations was studied in KG1 cells using MTT assay and their cellular uptake by flow cytometry technique. FTIR and (1)H NMR spectra confirmed successful production of the targeted micelles and XPS spectra showed the surface orientation of folate. R15D10F7 copolymer produced micelles with particle size of 82.86 nm, polydispersity index of 0.3, zeta potential of -4.68 mV, drug loading efficiency of 96%, and release efficiency of 63%.

ROS sources, such as NAD(P)H oxidase (Nox) complexes, are frequently activated in AML (acute myeloid leukemia) blasts and strongly contribute to their proliferation, survival, and drug resistance. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, with an increased propensity to develop AML. The molecular basis for MDS progression is unknown, but a key element in MDS disease progression is the genomic instability. NADPH oxidases are now recognized to have specific subcellular localizations, this targeting to specific compartments for localized ROS production. Local Nox-dependent ROS production in the nucleus may contribute to the regulation of redox-dependent cell growth, differentiation, senescence, DNA damage, and apoptosis. We observed that Nox1, 2, and 4 isoforms and p22phox and Rac1 subunits are expressed in MDS/AML cell lines and MDS samples, also in the nuclear fractions. Interestingly, Nox4 interacts with ERK and Akt1 within nuclear speckle domain, suggesting that Nox4 could be involved in regulating gene expression and splicing factor activity. These data contribute to the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms used by nuclear ROS to drive MDS evolution to AML.",,"['Guida, Marianna', 'Maraldi, Tullia', 'Beretti, Francesca', 'Follo, Matilde Y', 'Manzoli, Lucia', 'De Pol, Anto']","['Guida M', 'Maraldi T', 'Beretti F', 'Follo MY', 'Manzoli L', 'De Pol A']","['Department of Surgical, Medical, Dental and Morphological Sciences with interest in Transplant, Oncology and Regenerative Medicine, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Via Del Pozzo 71, 41124 Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Surgical, Medical, Dental and Morphological Sciences with interest in Transplant, Oncology and Regenerative Medicine, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Via Del Pozzo 71, 41124 Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Surgical, Medical, Dental and Morphological Sciences with interest in Transplant, Oncology and Regenerative Medicine, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Via Del Pozzo 71, 41124 Modena, Italy.', 'Department of Human Anatomic Sciences, University of Bologna, Via Irnerio 48, 40100 Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Human Anatomic Sciences, University of Bologna, Via Irnerio 48, 40100 Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Surgical, Medical, Dental and Morphological Sciences with interest in Transplant, Oncology and Regenerative Medicine, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Via Del Pozzo 71, 41124 Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140226,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'NADPH Oxidase 4', 'NADPH Oxidases/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism/toxicity']",,,2014/04/11 06:00,2014/12/31 06:00,['2014/04/11 06:00'],"['2013/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/456937 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2014;2014:456937. doi: 10.1155/2014/456937.

In this study, to explore whether specific types of BCR/TLR collaboration exist in CLL, we studied the effect of single versus concomitant BCR and/or TLR stimulation on CLL cells from mutated (M-CLL) and unmutated CLL (U-CLL) cases. We stimulated negatively isolated CLL cells by using anti-IgM, imiquimod, and CpG oligodeoxynucleotide for BCR, TLR7, and TLR9, respectively, alone or in combination for different time points. After in vitro culture in the absence of stimulation, differences in p-ERK were identified at any time point, with higher p-ERK levels in U-CLL versus M-CLL. Pronounced p-ERK induction was seen by single stimulation in U-CLL, whereas BCR/TLR synergism was required in M-CLL, in which the effect was overall limited in scale. An opposite pattern was observed regarding induction of apoptosis, as studied by Western blotting for the cleaved fragment of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and the active isoform of caspase-8, with M-CLL responding even to single stimulation, contrasting with U-CLL that showed minimal response. Our findings suggest that concomitant engagement of BCR and TLR leads to differential responses in CLL depending on the mutational status of the BCR.

We treated 57 refractory AML patients with lymphodepleting cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by NK cell infusion and interleukin (IL)-2 administration. In 42 patients, donor NK cell expansion was detected in 10%, whereas in 15 patients receiving host Treg depletion with the IL-2-diphtheria fusion protein (IL2DT), the rate was 27%, with a median absolute count of 1000 NK cells/muL blood. IL2DT was associated with improved complete remission rates at day 28 (53% vs 21%; P = .02) and disease-free survival at 6 months (33% vs 5%; P < .01). In the IL2DT cohort, NK cell expansion correlated with higher postchemotherapy serum IL-15 levels (P = .002), effective peripheral blood Treg depletion (<5%) at day 7 (P < .01), and decreased IL-35 levels at day 14 (P = .02). In vitro assays demonstrated that Tregs cocultured with NK cells inhibit their proliferation by competition for IL-2 but not for IL-15. Together with our clinical observations, this supports the need to optimize the in vivo cytokine milieu where adoptively transferred NK cells compete with other lymphocytes to improve clinical efficacy in patients with refractory AML.

Among the membrane efflux transporters of MTX, the human breast cancer resistant protein is the second member of the G subfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux pump (ABCG2). A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in ABCG2, the exchange of C to A at position 421, represents 13 % in the Middle Eastern population. We studied the effect of this SNP on the plasma levels of HD-MTX in Egyptian pediatric ALL. METHODS: Two hundred ALL patients were recruited from Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt-57357, and all were treated according to the St Jude Total XV protocol. Determination of plasma MTX levels was done at 23, 42 and 68 h. Genotyping of C421A of ABCG2 was done by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: We found 14.5 % of the variant allele of the ABCG2 C421A SNP. The statistical association between ABCG2 421C>A SNP and the cutoff toxic plasma level of 24 h HD-MTX infusion at different time points tested was not statistically significant. There was no statistical significance between steady-state plasma concentration in patients with and without with this SNP. CONCLUSION: To date, this is the largest study on Egyptian ALL patients for this SNP. This study shows that there is no effect of ABCG2 421C>A on plasma concentrations of HD-MTX.

Despite comparable transplantation protocols and most centers participating in both studies, the post-transplant survival probabilities for patients transplanted in first chronic phase were significantly higher in study IIIA (144 patients) than in study III (113 patients). Prior to the decision on a combined analysis of both studies, reasons for this discrepancy had to be investigated. METHODS: The Cox proportional hazard cure model was used to identify prognostic factors for post-transplant survival. RESULTS: Donor-recipient matching for human leukocyte antigen, patient age, time between diagnosis and transplantation, and calendar time showed a significant influence on survival and/or the incidence of cure. Added as a further factor, affiliation to study IIIA had no significant impact any longer. CONCLUSIONS: Discrepancies in influential prognostic factors explained the different post-transplant survival probabilities between the studies. The significance of calendar time suggests a lack of consistency of transplantation practice over time. Accordingly, the prerequisite for a common assessment of overall survival in the two randomized transplantation arms was not met. Moreover, our analyses provide an independent validation of established prognostic factors and their cutoffs.

These mutations, which occur in the RING finger and linker domains, abolish the ability of c-Cbl to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and downregulate activated protein tyrosine kinases. Here we analyzed the effects of dasatinib in a c-Cbl RING finger mutant mouse that develops an MPD with a phenotype similar to the human MPDs. The mice are characterized by enhanced tyrosine kinase signaling resulting in an expansion of hematopoietic stem cells, multipotent progenitors and cells within the myeloid lineage. Since c-Cbl is a negative regulator of c-Kit and Src signaling we reasoned that dasatinib, which targets these kinases, would be an effective therapy. Furthermore, two recent studies showed dasatinib to be effective in inhibiting the in vitro growth of cells from leukemia patients with c-Cbl RING finger and linker domain mutations. Surprisingly we found that dasatinib did not provide an effective therapy for c-Cbl RING finger mutant mice since it did not suppress any of the hematopoietic lineages that promote MPD development. Thus we conclude that dasatinib may not be an appropriate therapy for leukemia patients with c-Cbl mutations. We did however find that dasatinib caused a marked reduction of pre-B cells and immature B cells which correlated with a loss of Src activity. This study is therefore the first to provide a detailed characterization of in vivo effects of dasatinib in a hematopoietic disorder that is driven by protein tyrosine kinases other than BCR-ABL.",,"['Duyvestyn, Johanna M', 'Taylor, Samuel J', 'Dagger, Samantha A', 'Orandle, Marlene', 'Morse, Herbert C 3rd', 'Thien, Christine B F', 'Langdon, Wallace Y']","['Duyvestyn JM', 'Taylor SJ', 'Dagger SA', 'Orandle M', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'Thien CB', 'Langdon WY']","['School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia.', 'School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia.', 'School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia.', 'Infectious Disease Pathogenesis Section, Comparative Medicine Branch, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Virology and Cellular Immunology Section, Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland, United States of America.', 'School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia.', 'School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140409,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Lineage/*drug effects', 'Dasatinib', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Germinal Center/drug effects/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/drug effects/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/chemistry/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'RING Finger Domains/*genetics', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",,,2014/04/11 06:00,2015/06/30 06:00,['2014/04/11 06:00'],"['2014/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0094717 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-03206 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Apr 9;9(4):e94717. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0094717. eCollection 2014.,"['0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,PMC3981816,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results revealed that there was no significant association between the polymorphism and cancer risk overall.

METHOD OF STUDY: Matrigel matrix-based invasion assay; Western blot; cDNA microarray; quantitative RT-PCR; gene silencing by siRNA. RESULTS: Leukaemia inhibitory factor treatment led to the activation of STAT3 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways which was followed by changes in the expression of several invasion-associated molecules such as mucin1 (MUC1), Fos, Jun, etc. Abrogation of either STAT3 or ERK1/2 signaling reduced (P < 0.05) the LIF-mediated invasion of JEG-3 cells. It was associated with a significant reduction in the expression of both MUC1 and Fos, suggesting a common denominator in LIF-STAT3-ERK1/2 signaling. To this effect, we observed a decrease in LIF-mediated p-STAT3 (Ser727) upon blocking STAT3 or ERK1/2 signaling.

This widespread upward trend remains controversial, as it may be attributable either to progressive improvements in diagnosis and certification or to increasing exposures to little-known but relevant risk factors. METHODS: To assess the relative contribution of these factors, we analysed the independent effects of age, death period, and birth cohort on haematological cancer mortality rates in Spain across the period 1952-2006. Weighted joinpoint regression analyses were performed to detect and estimate changes in period and cohort curvatures. RESULTS: Although mortality rates were consistently higher among men, trends across periods and cohorts were virtually identical in both sexes. There was an early period trend reversal in the 1960s for Hodgkin's disease and leukaemia, which was delayed to the 1980s for multiple myeloma and the 1990s for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Birth cohort patterns showed a first downturn for generations born in the 1900s and 1910s for all haematological cancers, and a second trend reversal for more recent cohorts born in the 1950s and 1960s for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: The sustained decline in Hodgkin's disease mortality and the levelling off in leukaemia seem to be driven by an early period effect linked to improvements in disease treatment, whereas the steep upward trends in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma mortality in Spain are more likely explained by a cohort effect linked to better diagnosis and death certification in the elderly. The consistent male excess mortality across all calendar periods and age groups points to the importance of possible sex-related genetic markers of susceptibility in haematological cancers.",,"['Pastor-Barriuso, Roberto', 'Lopez-Abente, Gonzalo']","['Pastor-Barriuso R', 'Lopez-Abente G']","['National Center for Epidemiology, Carlos III Institute of Health, Monforte de Lemos 5, 28029, Madrid, Spain. rpastor@isciii.es.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140410,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*mortality/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Spain/epidemiology']",,,2014/04/11 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/04/11 06:00'],"['2013/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-14-250 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-14-250 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2014 Apr 10;14:250. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-250.,,,PMC4021557,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MDS have significant clinical consequences, including cytopenias leading to infection, bleeding, and death; and approximately one-third of cases progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Only one potentially curative therapy exists-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)-but this therapy is not widely used due to associated morbidity and mortality in elderly patients. Recent research suggests MDS occurs more frequently than previously thought and may be responsible for a substantial proportion of unexplained anemias in elderly persons. Incidence of MDS is expected to increase with increases in life expectancy. Therefore, we offer this comprehensive narrative update of MDS to inform the medical community treating the population at risk for MDS, with a focus on MDS epidemiology and clinical management in the United States. This review includes a brief historical background of MDS, provides an overview of the population burden of disease, discusses the molecular pathology of MDS, describes the clinical features and management of MDS, and discusses future directions in MDS research.

There were significant differences in several relevant characteristics at presentation between patients receiving (n = 86) or not receiving lenalidomide (n = 129).

CD66a is a major subtype of the CD66 family which plays a dual role in different cancers, and the contradictory effect may depend on the isoform ratio of CD66a-4L to CD66a-4S. Although the abnormal expression of CD66a on leukemic B-cells has been reported widely, little is known about the biological function of this aberrant expression. In this study, we showed that inhibition of CD66a in human B-ALL cell lines reduced the cellular proliferative rate and increased the percentage of cellular apoptosis, and the ratio of CD66a-4L to CD66a-4S in leukemic B cells is much higher than that in granulocytes. In addition, alteration of the L:S ratio by silencing and overexpressing the L isoform in B-ALL cell lines confirmed that a high L:S ratio of CD66a in leukemic B cells promotes proliferation and inhibits FasL-induced apoptosis.",,"['Zhao, Wenjin', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Liu, Dandan', 'Zhong, Liansheng', 'He, Qun', 'Zhao, Yujie']","['Zhao W', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu D', 'Zhong L', 'He Q', 'Zhao Y']","['Center of Laboratory Technology, China Medical University , Shenyang, Liaoning , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140606,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*genetics/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Fas Ligand Protein/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['CD66a', 'acute leukemic B cells', 'apoptosis', 'proliferation']",2014/04/11 06:00,2015/10/08 06:00,['2014/04/11 06:00'],"['2014/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2014.913287 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2015 Jan;56(1):202-10. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2014.913287.

Cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay, cell apoptosis bodies were observed using a light microscope, cell apoptosis rate was evaluated by flow cytometry, and the expression alterations of growth-sinaling proteins were detected by Western blotting. RESULTS: Curcumin inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in time- and dose- dependent manner in THP-1 cells. Curcumin significantly inhibited the activations of AKT/mTOR and RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathways simultaneously.

Here, we report a case of IgD PCL with a very unusual CD138-/CD19+/CD4+ phenotype. METHODS: Peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from a 37-year-old patient afflicted by an aggressive plasma cell dyscrasia were examined and analyzed by conventional morphology, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Analysis of peripheral blood fulfilled criteria for PCL (more than 20% and more than 2 x 10e9 cells/L). However, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry phenotyping revealed that the cells were CD138-/CD38+/CD19+/CD4+/CD56-/CD117-. CONCLUSIONS: PCL is diagnosed on peripheral blood smear. Immunophenotyping is a tool that can be helpful in diagnosing difficult cases but its atypical findings should not prevent the appropriate PCL diagnosis in clinically and morphologically unquestionable cases.

To provide further information on this question, we extended follow-up of a cohort of 14,008 chemical workers at 6 factories in England and Wales, covering the period 1941-2012. Mortality was compared with national death rates for England and Wales, and associations with incident upper airway cancer and leukemia were explored in nested case-control analyses. We observed excess deaths from cancers of the esophagus (100 observed vs. 93.1 expected), stomach (182 vs. 141.4), rectum (107 vs. 86.8), liver (35 vs. 26.9), and lung (813 vs. 645.8), but none of these tumors exhibited a clear exposure-response relationship. Nested case-control analyses of 115 men with upper airway cancer (including 1 nasopharyngeal cancer), 92 men with leukemia, and 45 men with myeloid leukemia indicated no elevations of risk in the highest exposure category (high exposure for >/=1 year). When the 2 highest exposure categories were combined, the odds ratio for myeloid leukemia was 1.26 (95% confidence interval: 0.39, 4.08). Our results provide no support for an increased hazard of myeloid leukemia, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or other upper airway tumors from formaldehyde exposure. These results indicate that any excess risk of these cancers, even from relatively high exposures, is at most small.","['(c) The Author 2014.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 110 adult patients with ALL were immunophenotyped by CD45/SSC double parameters and 4 colour flow cytometry. Seventy-three cases were also subjected to karyotype analysis by R-banding technology. The clinical and laboratory data of 110 ALL patients were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: Of all the patients, 21.8% were identified as T-ALL, 78.2% as B-ALL. Abnormal karyotypes were detected in 37 out of 73 (50.7%) cases and the most common cytogenetic abnormality was the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, which was found in 23.3% (17/73) of the cases. Myeloid antigen (MyAg) expression was documented in 47.3% of the 110 adult ALL cases analysed and CD13 was the most commonly expressed MyAg in ALL patients (32.1 %). No difference was observed in the expression of MyAg between the groups of patients with T-ALL (45.8%) and B-ALL (47.7%). Our data showed that older age, higher CD34 positivity and lower proportion of patients with splenomegaly were found to be correlated with MyAg+ ALL, and that patients with Ph+ B-ALL were older, presented with higher haemoglobin level and higher CD34 expression. No statistical difference was noted in complete remission (CR) rate, relapse rate, induction mortality or total death rate among My+ and My-, Ph+ and Ph-, or B-ALL and T-ALL patients. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the distribution of ALL in Chinese adult patients was similar with the general distribution pattern in the other countries, and the expression of MyAg in patients with T-ALL and B-ALL was comparable. Both the expression of MyAg and the presence of Ph chromosome in adult ALL were significantly associated with median age and CD34 expression while not with the response to induction treatment.",,"['Tong, Haixia', 'Wang, Huihan', 'Wang, Qiushi', 'Liu, Zhuogang', 'Lu, Chunwei']","['Tong H', 'Wang H', 'Wang Q', 'Liu Z', 'Lu C']","[""Department of Blood Transfusion, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Singapore,Ann Acad Med Singap,"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",7503289,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Asians', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/04/10 06:00,2016/06/02 06:00,['2014/04/10 06:00'],"['2014/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ann Acad Med Singap. 2014 Mar;43(3):152-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The induction of autophagy was confirmed by acridine orange staining of intracellular acidic vesicles, electron microscopy visualization of autophagic vacuoles, as well as by the increase in autophagic proteolysis and autophagic flux, demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of p62 downregulation and LC3-I conversion to autophagosome-associated LC3-II in the presence of proteolysis inhibitors, respectively. Moreover, the expression of autophagy-related genes Atg4, Atg5 and Atg7 was stimulated by cytarabine in REH cells. Cytarabine reduced the phosphorylation of the major negative regulator of autophagy, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and its downstream target p70S6 kinase in REH cells, which was associated with downregulation of mTOR activator Akt and activation of extracellular signal- regulated kinase. Cytarabine had no effect on the activation of mTOR inhibitor AMP-activated protein kinase. Leucine, an mTOR activator, reduced both cytarabine-induced autophagy and cytotoxicity.

In oncology, the approach is aimed at more accurate diagnosis of cancer, optimization of patient selection to identify those most likely to benefit from a specific therapy and to generate effective therapeutics that enhance patient survival. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are master regulators of the human genome that orchestrate myriad cellular pathways to control growth during physiologic and pathologic conditions. Compelling evidence shows that miRNA deregulation promotes events linked to tumor initiation, metastasis and drug resistance as seen in multiple myeloma (MM), an invariably fatal hematologic malignancy. miRNAs are readily detected in body fluids, for example, serum, plasma, urine, as well as circulating tumor cells to demonstrate their potential as readily accessible, non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutics. Specific miRNAs are aberrantly expressed early in myelomagenesis and may more readily detect high-risk disease than current methods.

However, the underlying mechanism is still poorly understood. According to previous reports, neutrophil aggregation and excessive ROS production might play pivotal pathogenetic roles. In the present study, we found that PQ could prolong neutrophil lifespan and induce ROS generation in a concentration-independent manner. Activated nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), p38 mitogen-activated kinase (p38 MAPK), and myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) but not Akt signaling pathways were involved in this process, as well as increasing levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and IL-1beta. Furthermore, the proinflammatory mediators IL-6 and TNF-alpha could in turn promote ROS generation, creating a vicious cycle. The existence of such a feedback loop is supported by our finding that neutrophil apoptosis is attenuated by PQ in a concentration-independent manner and could partially explain the clinical dilemma why oxygen therapy will exacerbate PQ induced tissue injury.",,"['Wang, Xiaolong', 'Luo, Fuling', 'Zhao, Hengguang']","['Wang X', 'Luo F', 'Zhao H']","['Emergency department, the 2nd affiliated hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140408,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Herbicides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1beta/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Paraquat/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",,,2014/04/10 06:00,2015/01/07 06:00,['2014/04/10 06:00'],"['2014/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0093837 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-00378 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Apr 8;9(4):e93837. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0093837. eCollection 2014.,"['0 (Herbicides)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'PLG39H7695 (Paraquat)']",,PMC3979731,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A MCT line HMC1.2 harboring the KIT mutation was reported to express CD72, which could suppress the cell proliferation. Here, we examined the ability of CD72 to modify the growth of AMLs harboring gain-of-function KIT mutations. CD72 was expressed on the surface of the AML cell line, Kasumi-1. CD72 ligation by an agonistic antibody BU40 or by a natural ligand CD100, suppressed the proliferation of the Kasumi-1 cells and enhanced cell death, as monitored by caspase-3 cleavage. These responses were associated with the phosphorylation of CD72, the formation of the CD72 - SHP-1 complex and dephosphorylation of src family kinases and JNK.

METHODS: We analyzed 105 cases of AML and MDS to evaluate the specificity of E-cadherin. RESULTS: Of 84 cases of AML, including cases with megakaryocytic, erythroid, monocytic, and granulocytic differentiation, all five acute erythroleukemia cases were positive, as well as one case of megakaryoblastic leukemia that showed coexpression of glycophorin A. In addition, we demonstrate that a panel of three markers, E-cadherin, CD117, and CD34, is effective in identifying lineage-specific myeloblasts in cases of MDS where left-shifted erythroid hyperplasia may complicate morphologic assessment of myeloblasts.

The temporal series of events that culminates in inactive X-specific gene silencing by DNA methylation has revealed a 'patchwork' of gene inactivation along the chromosome, with approximately 15% of genes escaping. Such genes are therefore potentially subject to sex-specific imbalance between males and females. Aside from XIST, the non-coding RNA on the X chromosome destined to be inactivated, very little is known about the extent of loci that may be selectively silenced on the active X chromosome (Xa). Using longitudinal array-based DNA methylation profiling of two human tissues, we have identified specific and widespread active X-specific DNA methylation showing stability over time and across tissues of disparate origin. Our panel of X-chromosome loci subject to methylation on Xa reflects a potentially novel mechanism for controlling female-specific X inactivation and sex-specific dimorphisms in humans.

In this study, we assessed attitudes of parents with children who have phenylketonuria (PKU) and leukemia towards NBS and storage and use of residual bloodspots for research. METHODS: A total of 49 individuals were recruited and responded to a validated 41-item survey regarding NBS and the retention and use of residual bloodspots. Of these participants, 22 had a child with PKU and 27 had a child with leukemia. We compared their responses to those of 1,927 individuals from the general public obtained in a previous study using the same survey instrument. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: We found that parents of children with a serious health condition had higher levels of support than the general public towards the use of residual NBS samples for research but similar attitudes regarding choice and privacy protections.

The zinc-finger protein A20, a negative regulator of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway, was found to play a crucial role in controlling the maturation and function of human monocyte-derived DCs. However, the effects of A20 in AML derived DCs (AML-DCs) have not yet been evaluated. In this study, A20 expression was up-regulated in AML-DCs activated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Then, A20 attenuation with siRNA in AML-DC enhanced the expression of several co-stimulatory molecules and proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, after A20 attenuation in AML-DCs, the autologous cytolytic T cells (CTLs) induced by AML-DCs had higher killing capability and specificity for primary AML cells. Additionally, receptor-interacting protein (RIP) and the NF-kappaBp65 pathway were elevated in AML-DCs when A20 was reduced. Hence, this study identified A20 as a negative regulator for controlling AML-DC maturation and immunostimulatory potency, as A20 down-regulation resulted in AML-DCs with enhanced autologous CTLs immune capacity through the NF-kappaB pathway.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A multi-state model was used to quantify cumulative incidences of complete molecular response (CMR) and death following alloBMT. The primary analysis was comparison of three treatment interventions (tyrosine kinase inhibitor: TKI, donor lymphocyte infusion: DLI, and TKI + DLI) for relapsed disease post-alloBMT. Forty-five (63%) patients relapsed post-alloBMT (molecular relapse: n = 16, cytogenetic relapse: n = 20, hematologic relapse: n = 2, advanced phase relapse: n = 7) and 40 patients underwent one of three treatments: TKI-only (n = 13), DLI-only (n = 11) or TKI + DLI (n = 16). Although not statistically significant, the TKI-only group had the highest cumulative incidence of CMR and lowest cumulative incidence of death compared to DLI and TKI + DLI.

Adherence to treatment may substantially influence plasma levels and has been recognized as the most important determinant of treatment failure in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). A better understanding of the various factors contributing to the efficacy of treatment is essential for the development of interventions to optimize the treatment of chronic phase CML (CP-CML) with a protein kinase inhibitor like nilotinib. METHODS/DESIGN: In this multicenter prospective observational cohort study 70 adult patients with CP-CML starting treatment with nilotinib will be followed up for at least 12 months. Response to treatment is evaluated after 3, 6 and 12 months. Adherence is primarily assessed by counting the daily intake of nilotinib capsules by means of a medication event monitoring system (MEMS). Before the start of nilotinib treatment and after 3, 6 and 12 months, patients are asked to fill in a comprehensive questionnaire including topics on quality of life, side effects, attitude towards disease and medication, the patients' appreciation of information received about the medication, and discontinuation, and trough plasma levels of nilotinib are measured. DISCUSSION: The present study aims to get more insight into the efficacy of treatment with nilotinib and the various aspects that govern optimal response, of which adherence is a primary endpoint. We hypothesize that patients who experience inadequate response levels to nilotinib are less adherent. In addition, their plasma levels of nilotinib may be lower. We expect that our findings will be useful for health care professionals to support patients with the use of nilotinib in order to derive optimal benefit from their medication.

We analyzed outcomes in 3687 children worldwide who received cyclophosphamide-based BMT regimens for leukemias between 1990 and 2007.

Median age and race were similar in all groups. Sixty-one percent of OB children were from the United States/Canada. Three-year relapse-free and overall survival ranged from 48% to 52% (P = .54) and 55% to 58% (P = .81) across BMI groups. Three-year leukemia relapses were 33%, 33%, 29%, 25%, and 21% in the UW, RUW, normal, OW, and OB groups, respectively (P < .001).

We demonstrate that plasma cells formed in response to the same immunogen engage distinct survival programs depending on the adjuvant. After alum-adjuvanted immunization, antigen-specific bone marrow plasma cells deficient in the transcription factor ZBTB20 failed to accumulate over time, leading to a progressive loss of antibody production relative to wild-type controls. Fetal liver reconstitution experiments demonstrated that the requirement for ZBTB20 was B cell intrinsic. No defects were observed in germinal center numbers, affinity maturation, or plasma cell formation or proliferation in ZBTB20-deficient chimeras. However, ZBTB20-deficient plasma cells expressed reduced levels of MCL1 relative to wild-type controls, and transgenic expression of BCL2 increased serum antibody titers. These data indicate a role for ZBTB20 in promoting survival in plasma cells. Strikingly, adjuvants that activate TLR2 and TLR4 restored long-term antibody production in ZBTB20-deficient chimeras through the induction of compensatory survival programs in plasma cells. Thus, distinct lifespans are imprinted in plasma cells as they are formed, depending on the primary activation conditions.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cohort comprised 3,269 patients treated on either the UKALL2003 trial for children and adolescents (1 to 24 years old) or the UKALLXII trial for adolescents and adults (15 to 59 years old). High-throughput fluorescent in situ hybridization was used to detect IGH@ translocations. RESULTS: We identified IGH@ translocations in 5% of patients with ALL (159 of 3,269 patients), in patients with both B-cell (148 of 2,863 patients) and T-cell (11 of 408 patients) disease. Multiple partner genes were identified including CRLF2 (n = 35), five members of the CEPB gene family (n = 17), and ID4 (n = 11). The level of the IGH@-positive clone varied and indicated that some IGH@ translocations were primary events, whereas others were secondary aberrations often associated with other established aberrations. The age profile of patients with IGH@ translocations was distinctive, with a median age of 16 years and peak incidence of 11% among 20- to 24-year-old patients. Among patients with B-cell precursor ALL who were Philadelphia chromosome negative, those with an IGH@ translocation had an inferior overall survival compared with other patients (UKALL2003: hazard ratio, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.34 to 4.18; P = .003; UKALLXII: hazard ratio, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.22 to 2.47; P = .002). However, this adverse effect was not independent of age or minimal residual disease status and did not seem to be driven by an increased risk of relapse. CONCLUSION: IGH@ translocations define a genetic feature that is frequent among adolescents and young adults with ALL. Although associated with an adverse outcome in adults, it is not an independent prognostic factor in children and adolescents.",,"['Russell, Lisa J', 'Enshaei, Amir', 'Jones, Lisa', 'Erhorn, Amy', 'Masic, Dino', 'Bentley, Helen', 'Laczko, Karl S', 'Fielding, Adele K', 'Goldstone, Anthony H', 'Goulden, Nicholas', 'Mitchell, Christopher D', 'Wade, Rachel', 'Vora, Ajay', 'Moorman, Anthony V', 'Harrison, Christine J']","['Russell LJ', 'Enshaei A', 'Jones L', 'Erhorn A', 'Masic D', 'Bentley H', 'Laczko KS', 'Fielding AK', 'Goldstone AH', 'Goulden N', 'Mitchell CD', 'Wade R', 'Vora A', 'Moorman AV', 'Harrison CJ']","[""Lisa J.

For the practicing clinician, it is difficult to summarize the prognostic information of the growing number of clinical and molecular markers. Our purpose was to develop a widely applicable prognostic model by combining well-established pretreatment patient and disease characteristics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two prognostic indices for CN-AML (PINA), one regarding overall survival (OS; PINAOS) and the other regarding relapse-free survival (RFS; PINARFS), were derived from data of 572 patients with CN-AML treated within the AML Cooperative Group 99 study (www.aml-score.org). RESULTS: On the basis of age (median, 60 years; range, 17 to 85 years), performance status, WBC count, and mutation status of NPM1, CEBPA, and FLT3-internal tandem duplication, patients were classified into the following three risk groups according to PINAOS and PINARFS: 29% of all patients and 32% of 381 responding patients had low-risk disease (5-year OS, 74%; 5-year RFS, 55%); 56% of all patients and 39% of responding patients had intermediate-risk disease (5-year OS, 28%; 5-year RFS, 27%), and 15% of all patients and 29% of responding patients had high-risk disease (5-year OS, 3%; 5-year RFS, 5%), respectively. PINAOS and PINARFS stratified outcome within European LeukemiaNet genetic groups. Both indices were confirmed on independent data from Cancer and Leukemia Group B/Alliance trials. CONCLUSION: We have developed and validated, to our knowledge, the first prognostic indices specifically designed for adult patients of all ages with CN-AML that combine well-established molecular and clinical variables and that are easily applicable in routine clinical care. The integration of both clinical and molecular markers could provide a basis for individualized patient care through risk-adapted therapy of CN-AML.",['(c) 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Pastore, Friederike', 'Dufour, Annika', 'Benthaus, Tobias', 'Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Maharry, Kati S', 'Schneider, Stephanie', 'Ksienzyk, Bianka', 'Mellert, Gudrun', 'Zellmeier, Evelyn', 'Kakadia, Purvi M', 'Unterhalt, Michael', 'Feuring-Buske, Michaela', 'Buske, Christian', 'Braess, Jan', 'Sauerland, Maria Cristina', 'Heinecke, Achim', 'Krug, Utz', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Buechner, Thomas', 'Woermann, Bernhard', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Bohlander, Stefan K', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Hoster, Eva']","['Pastore F', 'Dufour A', 'Benthaus T', 'Metzeler KH', 'Maharry KS', 'Schneider S', 'Ksienzyk B', 'Mellert G', 'Zellmeier E', 'Kakadia PM', 'Unterhalt M', 'Feuring-Buske M', 'Buske C', 'Braess J', 'Sauerland MC', 'Heinecke A', 'Krug U', 'Berdel WE', 'Buechner T', 'Woermann B', 'Hiddemann W', 'Bohlander SK', 'Marcucci G', 'Spiekermann K', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Hoster E']","['Friederike Pastore, Annika Dufour, Tobias Benthaus, Klaus H.

Although acting primarily as a transcriptional repressor, PML-RARalpha can also exert functions of transcriptional co-activation. Here, we find that PML-RARalpha stimulates transcription driven by HIF factors, which are critical regulators of adaptive responses to hypoxia and stem cell maintenance. Consistently, HIF-related gene signatures are upregulated in leukemic promyelocytes from APL patients compared to normal promyelocytes. Through in vitro and in vivo studies, we find that PML-RARalpha exploits a number of HIF-1alpha-regulated pro-leukemogenic functions that include cell migration, bone marrow (BM) neo-angiogenesis and self-renewal of APL blasts. Furthermore, HIF-1alpha levels increase upon treatment of APL cells with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). As a consequence, inhibiting HIF-1alpha in APL mouse models delays leukemia progression and exquisitely synergizes with ATRA to eliminate leukemia-initiating cells (LICs).",,"['Coltella, Nadia', 'Percio, Stefano', 'Valsecchi, Roberta', 'Cuttano, Roberto', 'Guarnerio, Jlenia', 'Ponzoni, Maurilio', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Melillo, Giovanni', 'Pattini, Linda', 'Bernardi, Rosa']","['Coltella N', 'Percio S', 'Valsecchi R', 'Cuttano R', 'Guarnerio J', 'Ponzoni M', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Melillo G', 'Pattini L', 'Bernardi R']","['Division of Molecular Oncology, Leukemia Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,EMBO Mol Med,EMBO molecular medicine,101487380,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Physiological Phenomena', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2014/04/09 06:00,2014/12/23 06:00,['2014/04/09 06:00'],"['2014/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['emmm.201303065 [pii]', '10.1002/emmm.201303065 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO Mol Med. 2014 May;6(5):640-50. doi: 10.1002/emmm.201303065.,"['0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,PMC4023886,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To precisely define the role of specific hematopoietic cells in TPO-dependent hematopoiesis, we generated mice that express the Mpl receptor normally on stem/progenitor cells but lack expression on megakaryocytes and platelets (Mpl(PF4cre/PF4cre)). Mpl(PF4cre/PF4cre) mice displayed profound megakaryocytosis and thrombocytosis with a remarkable expansion of megakaryocyte-committed and multipotential progenitor cells, the latter displaying biological responses and a gene expression signature indicative of chronic TPO overstimulation as the underlying causative mechanism, despite a normal circulating TPO level. Thus, TPO signaling in megakaryocytes is dispensable for platelet production; its key role in control of platelet number is via generation and stimulation of the bipotential megakaryocyte precursors. Nevertheless, Mpl expression on megakaryocytes and platelets is essential to prevent megakaryocytosis and myeloproliferation by restricting the amount of TPO available to stimulate the production of megakaryocytes from the progenitor cell pool.",,"['Ng, Ashley P', 'Kauppi, Maria', 'Metcalf, Donald', 'Hyland, Craig D', 'Josefsson, Emma C', 'Lebois, Marion', 'Zhang, Jian-Guo', 'Baldwin, Tracey M', 'Di Rago, Ladina', 'Hilton, Douglas J', 'Alexander, Warren S']","['Ng AP', 'Kauppi M', 'Metcalf D', 'Hyland CD', 'Josefsson EC', 'Lebois M', 'Zhang JG', 'Baldwin TM', 'Di Rago L', 'Hilton DJ', 'Alexander WS']","['Divisions of Cancer and Haematology, and Molecular Medicine, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140407,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Blood Platelets/cytology/*metabolism', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Clone Cells', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Loci/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Integrases/metabolism', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/*metabolism', 'Thrombocytosis', '*Thrombopoiesis', 'Thrombopoietin/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",['NOTNLM'],"['bone marrow', 'essential thrombocythemia']",2014/04/09 06:00,2014/06/18 06:00,['2014/04/09 06:00'],"['2014/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1404354111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1404354111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Apr 22;111(16):5884-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1404354111.

First, furin cleaves the Env precursor into the surface (SU) and transmembrane (TM) subunits in the cell and then the viral protease cleaves the R-peptide from TM in new virus. Here we analyzed the structure of the furin precursor, by cryoelectron microscopy. We transfected 293T cells with a furin cleavage site provirus mutant, R466G/K468G, and produced the virus in the presence of amprenavir to also inhibit the R-peptide cleavage. Although Env incorporation into particles was inhibited, enough precursor could be isolated and analyzed by cryoelectron microscopy to yield a 3D structure at 22 A resolution. This showed an open cage-like structure like that of the R-peptide precursor and the mature Env described before. However, the middle protrusion of the protomeric unit, so prominently pointing out from the side of the more mature forms of the Env, was absent. Instead, there was extra density in the top protrusion. This suggested that the C-terminal SU domain was associated alongside the receptor binding N-terminal SU domain in the furin precursor. This was supported by mapping with a SU C-terminal domain-specific antigen binding fragment. We concluded that furin cleavage not only separates the subunits and liberates the fusion peptide at the end of TM but also allows the C-terminal domain to relocate into a peripheral position. This conformational change might explain how the C-terminal domain of SU gains the potential to undergo disulfide isomerization, an event that facilitates membrane fusion.",,"['Sjoberg, Mathilda', 'Wu, Shang-Rung', 'Loving, Robin', 'Rantalainen, Kimmo', 'Lindqvist, Birgitta', 'Garoff, Henrik']","['Sjoberg M', 'Wu SR', 'Loving R', 'Rantalainen K', 'Lindqvist B', 'Garoff H']","['Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institute, S-141 57 Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140407,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Furin/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, env/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*metabolism', 'Mutant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Trypsin/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Env maturation', 'cryo-EM', 'retrovirus']",2014/04/09 06:00,2014/06/18 06:00,['2014/04/09 06:00'],"['2014/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1317972111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1317972111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Apr 22;111(16):6034-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1317972111.

Here we perform a score validation analysis in a prospective and independent cohort of patients. Biological markers (CD38, ZAP-70, and IGHV mutational status) and gene expression profiles (GEP) of leukemic cells from CLL patients included in a prospective multicenter observational study (O-CLL1-GISL protocol, clinicaltrial.gov ID:NCT00917549) were used to assess the value and reproducibility of this score. To date, 468 Binet A patients were classified as low- (0 positive marker), intermediate- (1 positive marker), or high-risk (2 or 3 positive markers) using the progression risk score. The 3-year PFS probability was 91.7%, 82.9%, and 57.4% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk (P < 0.0001) cases, respectively. These values were similar to those found in the original cohort. At Cox multivariate analysis, Rai stage, absolute lymphocyte count, progression risk score, and beta-2 microglobulin maintained an independent prognostic impact on PFS. This score remained a predictor of progression when analysis was limited to 371 Rai 0 cases (P < 0.0001). Finally, the cells from the different CLL risk groups showed differences in their gene expression patterns. These results confirm the ability of this progression risk score to predict PFS among Binet A patients. The utility of the score was also extended by demonstrating that it retains prognostic value when applied exclusively to Rai 0 patients. Specific transcriptional patterns were significantly associated with risk groups.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Gentile, Massimo', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Mosca, Laura', 'Matis, Serena', 'Fabris, Sonia', 'Lionetti, Marta', 'Ilariucci, Fiorella', 'Zupo, Simona', 'Musolino, Caterina', 'Levato, Luciano', 'Molica, Stefano', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Vincelli, Iolanda', 'Di Rienzo, Nicola', 'Pesce, Emanuela Anna', 'Angrilli, Francesco', 'Federico, Massimo', 'Neri, Antonino', 'Ferrarini, Manlio', 'Morabito, Fortunato']","['Gentile M', 'Cutrona G', 'Mosca L', 'Matis S', 'Fabris S', 'Lionetti M', 'Ilariucci F', 'Zupo S', 'Musolino C', 'Levato L', 'Molica S', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Vincelli I', 'Di Rienzo N', 'Pesce EA', 'Angrilli F', 'Federico M', 'Neri A', 'Ferrarini M', 'Morabito F']","['Hematology Unit, Department of Onco-hematology, A.O. of Cosenza, Cosenza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20140418,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Assessment']",['NOTNLM'],"['biological markers', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'early stage', 'gene expression profiles', 'prognosis']",2014/04/09 06:00,2014/10/10 06:00,['2014/04/09 06:00'],"['2014/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23729 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2014 Jul;89(7):743-50. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23729.
