Whether the rare gammadelta variant should be included in the same diagnostic category is currently unclear. Two well-characterized cases of gammadelta T-LGL leukemia were identified by our laboratory in 2007. These two cases and other reports of gammadelta T-LGL leukemia were compared with the common alphabeta variant. Other than more often being negative for both CD4 and CD8 (in about 35% to 40% of cases), the gammadelta variant of T-LGL leukemia is similar to the common alphabeta type in virtually all respects and should be included in the general category of T-LGL leukemia. However, it is important to exclude other more aggressive gammadelta T cell lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Shaw, Gene R', 'Naik, Vinay S']","['Shaw GR', 'Naik VS']","['Department of Pathology, Marshfield Clinic, 1000 North Oak Avenue, Marshfield, WI, 54449, USA, shaw.gene@marshfieldclinic.org.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080823,Germany,J Hematop,Journal of hematopathology,101491976,PMC2713487,2009/08/12 09:00,2009/08/12 09:01,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2008/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/12 09:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12308-008-0016-6 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematop. 2008 Sep;1(2):139-43. doi: 10.1007/s12308-008-0016-6.

New proposed entities, such as splenic B cell lymphoma/leukemia, unclassifiable, splenic diffuse red pulp small B cell lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia variant, pediatric follicular lymphoma, and pediatric marginal zone lymphoma have been coined, and some definitions of established diseases, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia have been revised. One aspect of major importance is the recent description of small clonal B cell populations, in part with a CLL phenotype, and their relationship to B-CLL. Some new subtypes or variants of follicular lymphoma with distinct clinicopathologic and/or molecular genetic characteristics have been described, including primary follicular lymphomas of the duodenum and pediatric follicular lymphomas. Furthermore, the impact of some probably early, or precursor lesions, such as follicular lymphoma in situ is discussed.

Most of these studies have been conducted in US hospitals prior to the advent of newer VREF-active antimicrobials, and the reported poor outcomes have been explained by the limited choices for effective antimicrobial therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 25 cases of invasive VREF infection were seen during an outbreak in a tertiary care hospital. Patient characteristics and outcomes were evaluated by a structured retrospective chart review and descriptive analysis. RESULTS: Severe underlying diseases such as leukemia not in remission (86%) were highly prevalent among patients with invasive VREF infection. Fifty-two percent of underlying diseases and/or comorbidities were considered according to the McCabe classification as rapidly fatal. Most patients had received high-dose cytotoxic chemotherapy, and many were neutropenic at the onset of VREF infection. Concomitant infection due to other organisms was found in 48% of the patients. All patients had received extensive antibiotic treatment prior to the onset of VREF infection. Resistance to linezolid was observed in four cases. Overall survival at day 30 was 48%. Four deaths were considered to be directly related to VREF infection. CONCLUSION: Invasive VREF infection during this outbreak was confined to patients with severe underlying comorbidity. The mortality of VREF infection remained high, despite treatment with newer VREF-active antibiotics such as linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin.","['Theilacker, C', 'Jonas, D', 'Huebner, J', 'Bertz, H', 'Kern, W V']","['Theilacker C', 'Jonas D', 'Huebner J', 'Bertz H', 'Kern WV']","['Center for Infectious Diseases and Travel Medicine, Dept. of Medicine, University Hospital, Freiburg, Germany. christian.theilacker@uniklinik-freiburg.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Infection,Infection,0365307,,2009/08/12 09:00,2010/03/18 06:00,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2009/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s15010-009-9023-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Infection. 2009 Dec;37(6):540-3. doi: 10.1007/s15010-009-9023-5.,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Oxazolidinones)', '11006-76-1 (Virginiamycin)', '126602-89-9 (quinupristin-dalfopristin)', 'ISQ9I6J12J (Linezolid)']",IM,"['Acetamides/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Comorbidity', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Enterococcus faecium/*drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/*epidemiology/*microbiology/mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Linezolid', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxazolidinones/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States', 'Vancomycin Resistance', 'Virginiamycin/therapeutic use']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Observational case report. CASE REPORT: An 11-year-old boy with myelocytic leukemia underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. He developed symptoms of the skin, eyes, and mouth, and lip biopsy indicated chronic GVHD. Persistent keratitis with corneal filaments and neovascularization was noted in both eyes. Sodium hyaluronate, autoserum, and 0.1% fluorometholone eyedrops were instilled for approximately 2 years to treat this keratitis, and there were no other ocular changes. Bilateral herpes simplex keratitis developed with geographic ulcers after topical betamethasone therapy, but responded to acyclovir ointment. CONCLUSIONS: Herpes keratitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of bilateral keratitis in patients with reduced immunocompetence. During the course of chronic GVHD, corneal herpes may occur, so ocular treatment with topical corticosteroids should be managed by an ophthalmologist to monitor sight-threatening conditions such as corneal herpes.","['Hayashi, Takahiko', 'Ishioka, Misaki', 'Ito, Norihiko', 'Kato, Yoko', 'Nakagawa, Hisashi', 'Hatano, Hiroshi', 'Mizuki, Nobuhisa']","['Hayashi T', 'Ishioka M', 'Ito N', 'Kato Y', 'Nakagawa H', 'Hatano H', 'Mizuki N']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan. amg-igf@goo.jp']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],,New Zealand,Clin Ophthalmol,"Clinical ophthalmology (Auckland, N.Z.)",101321512,PMC2693989,2008/06/01 00:00,2008/06/01 00:01,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.2147/opth.s1858 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Ophthalmol. 2008 Jun;2(2):457-9. doi: 10.2147/opth.s1858.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['bilateral herpes simplex keratitis', 'bone marrow transplant', 'chronic graft-versus-host disease', 'corneal herpes', 'dry eyes']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lacking enzymatic activity, TCL1A's transforming action was linked to its capacity to co-activate the protein kinase AKT via binding to its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. However, perturbation of AKT signalling alone was recently shown insufficient to explain TCL1A oncogenesis, suggesting that TCL1A has additional cellular partners. Searching for such additional targets, we found that TCL1A binds specifically and directly to the ankyrin domain of IkappaB, the inhibitor of the NF-kappaB transcription factors. Through binding assays and a structural analysis by small angle X-ray scattering, we show that TCL1A and IkappaB interact in yeast-two-hybrid systems, when transiently overexpressed in 293 cells, and as recombinant proteins in vitro. We further establish that the association between TCL1A and IkappaB is compatible with AKT binding to TCL1A, but incompatible with IkappaB binding to NF-kappaB. By interfering with the inhibition of NF-kappaB by IkappaB, TCL1A may increase the concentration of free NF-kappaB molecules sufficiently to trigger expression of anti-apoptotic genes. Thus our data suggest an additional route by which TCL1A might cause cancer.","['Ropars, Virginie', 'Despouy, Gilles', 'Stern, Marc-Henri', 'Benichou, Serge', 'Roumestand, Christian', 'Arold, Stefan T']","['Ropars V', 'Despouy G', 'Stern MH', 'Benichou S', 'Roumestand C', 'Arold ST']","['CNRS, UMR5048, Centre de Biochimie Structurale, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090810,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC2718698,2009/08/12 09:00,2010/01/20 06:00,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2009/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0006567 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Aug 10;4(8):e6567. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0006567.,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,"['Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Scattering, Radiation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, t(8;14) is detectable in only about 70% of patients, thus preventing MRD studies by this approach in the remaining patients. At present, no molecular assays have been reported for MRD and MDD analysis in t(8;14)-negative patients. The aim of our study was to evaluate the characteristics of patient-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangements as RQ-PCR targets for MRD analysis, in order to extend MRD studies to those patients who are not eligible for the LD-PCR assay. The study was performed according to the guidelines of the European Study Group on MRD detection in ALL (ESG-MRD-ALL). Overall, 36 B-ALL and 19 BL cases were analyzed. Multiple PCR reactions were performed for each sample to identify heavy and kappa light-chain rearrangements. A total of 97 RQ-PCR targets (62 for B-ALL, 35 for BL) were analyzed for sensitivity. The rearrangement pattern identified was similar to that reported for normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. In 88% of the targets, a sensitivity of at least 10(-4) was achieved. In 87% of patients (84% of B-ALLs, 95% of BLs) at least one sensitive target was available. All PCR targets identified at diagnosis were preserved at relapse. Our results suggest that MDD and MRD can be successfully studied using a single sensitive Ig target in the great majority of B-ALL and BL cases. The combination of LD-PCR and Ig-based assays will allow MRD analysis in virtually all of the patients.","['Lovisa, Federica', 'Mussolin, Lara', 'Corral, Lilia', 'Pillon, Marta', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Rosolen, Angelo']","['Lovisa F', 'Mussolin L', 'Corral L', 'Pillon M', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Biondi A', 'Rosolen A']","['Clinica di Oncoematologia Pediatrica, Azienda Ospedaliera-Universita di Padova, Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090810,United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,,2009/08/12 09:00,2009/10/29 06:00,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['labinvest200981 [pii]', '10.1038/labinvest.2009.81 [doi]']",ppublish,Lab Invest. 2009 Oct;89(10):1182-6. doi: 10.1038/labinvest.2009.81.

However, the molecular mechanism of how acinus mediates cyclin A1 expression remains elusive. Here we show that transcription corepressor CtBP2 directly binds acinus, which is regulated by nerve growth factor (NGF), inhibiting its stimulatory effect on cyclin A1, but not cyclin A2, expression in leukemia. NGF, a cognate ligand for the neurotrophic receptor TrkA, promotes the interaction between CtBP2 and acinus through triggering acinus phosphorylation by Akt. Overexpression of CtBP2 diminishes cyclin A1 transcription, whereas depletion of CtBP2 abolishes NGF's suppressive effect on cyclin A1 expression. Strikingly, gambogic amide, a newly identified TrkA agonist, potently represses cyclin A1 expression, thus blocking K562 cell proliferation. Moreover, gambogic amide ameliorates the leukemia progression in K562 cells inoculated nude mice. Hence, NGF downregulates cyclin A1 expression through escalating CtBP2/acinus complex formation, and gambogic amide might be useful for human leukemia treatment.","['Chan, C B', 'Liu, X', 'Jang, S-W', 'Hsu, S I-H', 'Williams, I', 'Kang, S', 'Chen, J', 'Ye, K']","['Chan CB', 'Liu X', 'Jang SW', 'Hsu SI', 'Williams I', 'Kang S', 'Chen J', 'Ye K']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090810,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,PMC3481846,2009/08/12 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2009236 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.236 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2009 Oct 29;28(43):3825-36. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.236.

The most popular methods to investigate MRD are multiparametric flow cytometry (MPFC) and polymerase chain reaction, since these techniques have proven sensitive and specific enough to allow MRD to be studied serially. In the present review we will focus on the use of MPFC for monitoring of MRD, addressing the main technical and clinical issues. RECENT FINDINGS: Lack of standardization among different laboratories, immunophenotypic stability, identifications of thresholds and time-points during follow-up represent the major subjects of confrontation whose definitive solution might rely on the application of new technologies and dedicated statistical approaches. SUMMARY: Studies of MRD should provide us the opportunity to generate comprehensive prognostic algorithms which take into account conventional parameters, such as cytogenetic and genetic profile, and those strictly inherent to the quality of response, such as determination of residual leukemia. This will greatly enhance development of personalized therapeutic approaches, avoiding the situation of under or over drug exposure.","['Buccisano, Francesco', 'Maurillo, Luca', 'Spagnoli, Alessandra', 'Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Ceresoli, Eleonora', 'Lo Coco, Francesco', 'Arcese, William', 'Amadori, Sergio', 'Venditti, Adriano']","['Buccisano F', 'Maurillo L', 'Spagnoli A', 'Del Principe MI', 'Ceresoli E', 'Lo Coco F', 'Arcese W', 'Amadori S', 'Venditti A']","['Department of Biopatologia e Diagnostica per Immagini, Fondazione Policlinico Tor Vergata and Ospedale S.Eugenio, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,,2009/08/12 09:00,2010/01/16 06:00,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCO.0b013e3283311856 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2009 Nov;21(6):582-8. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0b013e3283311856.,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Survival Analysis']",,,,,48,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report that LVs incorporating measles virus (MV) glycoproteins, H and F, on their surface allowed transduction of 50% of quiescent B cells, which are not permissive to VSVG-LV transduction. This high transduction level correlated with B-cell SLAM expression and was not at cost of cell-cycle entry or B-cell activation. Moreover, the naive and memory phenotypes of transduced resting B cells were maintained. Importantly, H/F-LVs represent the first tool permitting stable transduction of leukemic cancer cells, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, blocked in G(0)/G(1) early phase of the cell cycle. Thus, H/F-LV transduction overcomes the limitations of current LVs by making B cell-based gene therapy and immunotherapy applications feasible. These new LVs will facilitate antibody production and the study of gene functions in these healthy and cancer immune cells.","['Frecha, Cecilia', 'Costa, Caroline', 'Levy, Camille', 'Negre, Didier', 'Russell, Stephen J', 'Maisner, Andrea', 'Salles, Gilles', 'Peng, Kah-Whye', 'Cosset, Francois-Loic', 'Verhoeyen, Els']","['Frecha C', 'Costa C', 'Levy C', 'Negre D', 'Russell SJ', 'Maisner A', 'Salles G', 'Peng KW', 'Cosset FL', 'Verhoeyen E']","['Inserm U758, Human Virology Department, Universite de Lyon, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090810,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/08/12 09:00,2009/10/29 06:00,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36792-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-05-220798 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Oct 8;114(15):3173-80. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-05-220798.

Here, we show that post-alloHSCT antibody repertoires can be mined for the discovery of fully human monoclonal antibodies to B-CLL cell-surface antigens. Sera collected from B-CLL patients at defined times after alloHSCT showed selective binding to primary B-CLL cells. Pre-alloHSCT sera, donor sera, and control sera were negative. To identify post-alloHSCT serum antibodies and subsequently B-CLL cell-surface antigens they recognize, we generated a human antibody-binding fragment (Fab) library from post-alloHSCT peripheral blood mononuclear cells and selected it on primary B-CLL cells by phage display. A panel of Fab with B-CLL cell-surface reactivity was strongly enriched. Selection was dominated by highly homologous Fab predicted to bind the same antigen. One Fab was converted to immunoglobulin G1 and analyzed for reactivity with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from B-CLL patients and healthy volunteers. Cell-surface antigen expression was restricted to primary B cells and up-regulated in primary B-CLL cells. Mining post-alloHSCT antibody repertoires offers a novel route to discover fully human monoclonal antibodies and identify antigens of potential therapeutic relevance to B-CLL and possibly other cancers.

We hypothesized that the proportion of leukemia stem cells would vary as a function of the number of dysregulated pathways. Constitutive expression of MN1 served as a 1-oncogene model, and coexpression of MN1 and a HOX gene served as a 2-oncogene model. Leukemia-initiating cell (LIC) number and in vitro expansion potential of LICs were functionally assessed by limiting dilution analyses. LIC expansion potential was 132-fold increased in the 2- compared with the 1-oncogene model, although phenotypically, both leukemias were similar. The 2-oncogene model was characterized by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) hypersensitivity and activated STAT/ERK signaling. GM-CSF hypersensitivity of the 2-oncogene model (MN1/HOXA9) was lost in Stat5b(-/-) cells, and the LIC expansion potential was reduced by 86- and 28-fold in Stat5b(-/-) and Stat1(-/-) cells, respectively. Interestingly, in 201 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, coexpression of MN1 and HOXA9 was restricted to patients with the poorest prognosis and was associated with highly active STAT signaling.

We assessed the characteristics of iNKT cells from persons infected with human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Whereas most infected persons remain asymptomatic carriers (ACs) throughout their lives, a small proportion, usually with high equilibrium proviral loads,develop 2 diseases: HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). We demonstrated that the frequency of iNKT, NK, and dendritic cells in the peripheral blood of HAM/TSP and ATL patients is decreased. We also observed an inverse correlation between the iNKT cell frequency and the HTLV-1 proviral load in the peripheral blood of infected persons. Notably, in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood cells with alpha-galactosylceramide led to an increase in the iNKT cell number and a subsequent decrease in the HTLV-1-infected T-cell number in samples from ACs but not HAM/TSP or ATL patients. Our results suggest that iNKT cells contribute to the immune defense against HTLV-1, and iNKT-cell depletion plays an important role in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP and ATL. Therefore, iNKT cell-based immunotherapy may be an effective strategy for preventing these HTLV-1-associated disorders.","['Azakami, Kazuko', 'Sato, Tomoo', 'Araya, Natsumi', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Kubota, Ryuji', 'Suzuki, Kenshi', 'Hasegawa, Daisuke', 'Izumi, Toshihiko', 'Fujita, Hidetoshi', 'Aratani, Satoko', 'Fujii, Ryoji', 'Yagishita, Naoko', 'Kamijuku, Hajime', 'Kanekura, Takuro', 'Seino, Ken-ichiro', 'Nishioka, Kusuki', 'Nakajima, Toshihiro', 'Yamano, Yoshihisa']","['Azakami K', 'Sato T', 'Araya N', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Kubota R', 'Suzuki K', 'Hasegawa D', 'Izumi T', 'Fujita H', 'Aratani S', 'Fujii R', 'Yagishita N', 'Kamijuku H', 'Kanekura T', 'Seino K', 'Nishioka K', 'Nakajima T', 'Yamano Y']","['Department of Molecular Medical Science, Institute of Medical Science, St Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090807,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC2759648,2009/08/12 09:00,2009/10/29 06:00,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36796-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-02-203042 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Oct 8;114(15):3208-15. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-02-203042.

In the present work, we evaluated the prognostic impact of TET2 mutations in MDS. Frameshift, nonsense, missense mutations, or defects in gene structure were identified in 22 (22.9%) of 96 patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.5-31.3 patients). Mutated and unmutated patients did not significantly differ in initial clinical or hematologic parameters. The 5-year OS was 76.9% (95% CI, 49.2%-91.3%) in mutated versus 18.3% (95% CI, 4.2%-41.1%) in unmutated patients (P = .005).

In univariate analysis (Cox proportional hazard model), the absence of TET2 mutation was associated with a 4.1-fold (95% CI, 1.4-12.0-fold) increased risk of death (P = .009). In multivariate analysis adjusted for age, International Prognostic Scoring System, and transfusion requirement, the presence of TET2 mutation remained an independent factor of favorable prognosis (hazard ratio, 5.2; 95% CI, 1.6-16.3; P = .005). These results indicate that TET2 mutations observed in approximately 20% of patients, irrespective of the World Health Organization or French-American-British subtype, represent a molecular marker for good prognosis in MDS.","['Kosmider, Olivier', 'Gelsi-Boyer, Veronique', 'Cheok, Meyling', 'Grabar, Sophie', 'Della-Valle, Veronique', 'Picard, Francoise', 'Viguie, Franck', 'Quesnel, Bruno', 'Beyne-Rauzy, Odile', 'Solary, Eric', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Hunault-Berger, Mathilde', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Mansat-De Mas, Veronique', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Guardiola, Philippe', 'Lacombe, Catherine', 'Vainchenker, William', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Dreyfus, Francois', 'Bernard, Olivier A', 'Birnbaum, Daniel', 'Fontenay, Michaela']","['Kosmider O', 'Gelsi-Boyer V', 'Cheok M', 'Grabar S', 'Della-Valle V', 'Picard F', 'Viguie F', 'Quesnel B', 'Beyne-Rauzy O', 'Solary E', 'Vey N', 'Hunault-Berger M', 'Fenaux P', 'Mansat-De Mas V', 'Delabesse E', 'Guardiola P', 'Lacombe C', 'Vainchenker W', 'Preudhomme C', 'Dreyfus F', 'Bernard OA', 'Birnbaum D', 'Fontenay M']","[""Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Hopital Cochin-Hotel-Dieu, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090807,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/08/12 09:00,2009/10/29 06:00,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36804-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-04-215814 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Oct 8;114(15):3285-91. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-04-215814.

The median CD34+ cell counts on day 5 were 67.5/microL in male and 51/microL in female donors. Bone pain and headache were the most common side effects of recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor. Central venous access was required for 23 donations (0.6%).

Only the incidence of Hodgkin lymphoma differed significantly from an age-adjusted population.

By gene expression profiling (GEP) and subsequent unsupervised analysis of 35 AML-M0 samples and 253 previously reported AML cases, we demonstrate that AML-M0 cases express a unique signature that is largely separated from other molecular subtypes. Hematologic transcription regulators such as CEBPA, CEBPD, and ETV6, and the differentiation associated gene MPO appeared strongly down-regulated, in line with the primitive state of this leukemia. AML-M0 frequently carries loss-of-function RUNX1 mutation. Unsupervised analyses revealed a subdivision between AML-M0 cases with and without RUNX1 mutations. RUNX1 mutant AML-M0 samples showed a distinct up-regulation of B cell-related genes such as members of the B-cell receptor complex, transcription regulators RUNX3, ETS2, IRF8, or PRDM1, and major histocompatibility complex class II genes. Importantly, prediction with high accuracy of the AML-M0 subtype and prediction of patients carrying RUNX1 mutation within this subtype were possible based on the expression level of only a few transcripts. We propose that RUNX1 mutations in this AML subgroup cause lineage infidelity, leading to aberrant coexpression of myeloid and B-lymphoid genes. Furthermore, our results imply that AML-M0, although originally determined by morphology, constitutes a leukemia subgroup.","['Silva, Fernando P G', 'Swagemakers, Sigrid M A', 'Erpelinck-Verschueren, Claudia', 'Wouters, Bas J', 'Delwel, Ruud', 'Vrieling, Harry', 'van der Spek, Peter', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Giphart-Gassler, Micheline']","['Silva FP', 'Swagemakers SM', 'Erpelinck-Verschueren C', 'Wouters BJ', 'Delwel R', 'Vrieling H', 'van der Spek P', 'Valk PJ', 'Giphart-Gassler M']","['Department of Toxicogenetics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090807,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/08/12 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36838-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-03-211334 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Oct 1;114(14):3001-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-03-211334.

It induces cell cycle arrest in human lung cancer (A549) cells and apoptosis in human leukemia (Jurkat) cells. These two pathways may explain how HOA induces regression of a variety of cancers. We showed that HOA repressed the expression of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), the enzyme responsible for tetrahydrofolate (THF) synthesis. Folinic acid, which readily produces THF without the participation of DHFR, reverses the antitumor effects of HOA in A549 and Jurkat cells, as well as the inhibitory influence on cyclin D and cdk2 in A549 cells, and on DNA and PARP degradation in Jurkat cells. This effect was very specific, because either elaidic acid (an analog of HOA) or other lipids, failed to alter A549 or Jurkat cell growth. THF is a cofactor necessary for DNA synthesis. Thus, impairment of DNA synthesis appears to be a common mechanism involved in the different responses elicited by cancer cells following treatment with HOA, namely cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Compared with other antifolates, such as methotrexate, HOA did not directly inhibit DHFR but rather, it repressed its expression, a mode of action that offers certain therapeutic advantages. These results not only demonstrate the effect of a fatty acid on the expression of DHFR, but also emphasize the potential of HOA to be used as a wide-spectrum drug against cancer.","['Llado, Victoria', 'Teres, Silvia', 'Higuera, Monica', 'Alvarez, Rafael', 'Noguera-Salva, Maria Antonia', 'Halver, John E', 'Escriba, Pablo V', 'Busquets, Xavier']","['Llado V', 'Teres S', 'Higuera M', 'Alvarez R', 'Noguera-Salva MA', 'Halver JE', 'Escriba PV', 'Busquets X']","[""Laboratory of Cell Biology and Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biomedicine, Department of Biology, Institut Universitari d'Investigacions en Ciencies de la Salut, University of the Balearic Islands, E-07122 Palma de Mallorca, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090803,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC2720411,2009/08/12 09:00,2009/10/09 06:00,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [medline]']","['0907300106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0907300106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Aug 18;106(33):13754-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0907300106.

Changes in DNA methylation can impact expression of cancer-related genes including apoptosis regulators and tumor suppressors. Because such epigenetic changes are reversible, they are being aggressively investigated as potential therapeutic targets. Here we use the Emu-TCL1 transgenic mouse model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) to determine the timing and patterns of aberrant DNA methylation, and to investigate the mechanisms that lead to aberrant DNA methylation. We show that CLL cells from Emu-TCL1 mice at various stages recapitulate epigenetic alterations seen in human CLL. Aberrant methylation of promoter sequences is observed as early as 3 months of age in these animals, well before disease onset. Abnormally methylated promoter regions include binding sites for the transcription factor FOXD3. We show that loss of Foxd3 expression due to an NF-kappaB p50/p50:HDAC1 repressor complex occurs in TCL1-positive B cells before methylation.

Both genes are translocated in human cancers, including Ewing's sarcoma, leukemia, and in the case of Erg, more than half of all prostate cancers. Although evidence from mice and humans suggests that Fli-1 is required for megakaryopoiesis, and that Erg is required for normal adult hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) regulation, their precise physiological roles remain to be defined. To elucidate the relationship between Fli-1 and Erg in hematopoiesis, we conducted an analysis of mice carrying mutations in both genes. Our results demonstrate that there is a profound genetic interaction between Fli-1 and Erg. Double heterozygotes displayed phenotypes more dramatic than single heterozygotes: severe thrombocytopenia, with a significant deficit in megakaryocyte numbers and evidence of megakaryocyte dysmorphogenesis, and loss of HSCs accompanied by a reduction in the number of committed hematopoietic progenitor cells. These results illustrate an indispensable requirement for both Fli-1 and Erg in normal HSC and megakaryocyte homeostasis, and suggest these transcription factors may coregulate common target genes.","['Kruse, Elizabeth A', 'Loughran, Stephen J', 'Baldwin, Tracey M', 'Josefsson, Emma C', 'Ellis, Sarah', 'Watson, Dennis K', 'Nurden, Paquita', 'Metcalf, Donald', 'Hilton, Douglas J', 'Alexander, Warren S', 'Kile, Benjamin T']","['Kruse EA', 'Loughran SJ', 'Baldwin TM', 'Josefsson EC', 'Ellis S', 'Watson DK', 'Nurden P', 'Metcalf D', 'Hilton DJ', 'Alexander WS', 'Kile BT']","['Divisions of Molecular Medicine and Cancer and Haematology, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville 3052, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090731,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC2728977,2009/08/12 09:00,2009/10/09 06:00,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [medline]']","['0906556106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0906556106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Aug 18;106(33):13814-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0906556106.

In most cellular systems Celecoxib induces apoptosis via an intrinsic, mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. We recently showed that in Bax-negative Jurkat cells expression of pro-apoptotic Bak is essential for Celecoxib-induced mitochondrial damage and apoptosis induction. Aim of the present study was to identify specific pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family involved in the regulation of Bak activation, and subsequent apoptosis upon treatment with Celecoxib in the Jurkat cell model. Our results show that apoptosis in response to Celecoxib required the presence of Noxa and downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. Celecoxib-induced Bak activation and subsequent apoptosis could be inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-xL but not by the very similar Bcl-2. In Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells neutralization of both, Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL, was prerequisite for an efficient induction of apoptosis. Our data reveal an important role of the Mcl-1/Noxa axis for Celecoxib-induced apoptosis and suggest that Celecoxib may be of value for treatment of tumors addicted to Mcl-1 and for combined treatment approaches targeting anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members.","['Rudner, Justine', 'Elsaesser, Simon Johannes', 'Muller, Arndt-Christian', 'Belka, Claus', 'Jendrossek, Verena']","['Rudner J', 'Elsaesser SJ', 'Muller AC', 'Belka C', 'Jendrossek V']","['University of Tubingen, Department of Radiation Oncology, Hoppe-Seyler-Str. 3, 72076 Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090807,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,,2009/08/12 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2009/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/23 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(09)00665-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2009.07.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2010 Jan 1;79(1):10-20. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2009.07.021.

We defined the patterns of OB-R isoform expression in AML cells and leukemic cell lines in comparison to control cells by RT-PCR. rLeptin upregulated the expression of OB-R and endogenous leptin in AML blasts and certain cell lines but not in control cells. Cytometric Bead Array analysis of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines showed that rleptin upregulates IL-6 secretion by AML cells, various cytokines by the leukemic cell lines tested and IL-10 secretion by control PBMC, contributed by monocytes. Western immunoblotting revealed that the effect of rleptin was independent of JAK-2/phospho-JAK-2 protein levels. Finally, MM biopsies stained positive for leptin and, to a lesser extend, OB-R. Immunoreactivity was confined mostly to the nucleus of the myeloma cells. Normal myelocytes, promyelocytes and megakaryocytes stained weakly positive, and erythroid cells were constantly negative.

Some probiotics inhibit monocytes' expansion, although mechanisms remain unknown. Supernatants of Lactobacillus strains were investigated for inducing apoptosis of monocytes. METHODS: Secreted factors produced by Lactobacillus strains were tested on human lymphocytes, monocytes and a human monocytic leukemia-cell line (THP-1). Cell death mechanisms were investigated by a variety of methods. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha) and anti-inflammatory TGF-beta1 were determined. RESULTS: Soluble factor(s) from Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus strain supernatants (LcrS) effectively induced apoptosis of immune cells. These were mainly soluble proteins (MW 5-30 kDa; LcrS(5-30)). For immune cells, but not human colonic epithelial carcinoma cells (HT-29), pretreatment with LcrS(5-30) significantly promoted apoptosis via a mitochondrial pathway. LcrS(5-30) suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines and induced anti-inflammatory TGF-beta1. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic Lcr produced heat-stable molecules (MW range 5-30 kDa) that promoted immune cell apoptosis without affecting intestinal epithelial cells. LcrS(5-30) triggered apoptosis by a mitochondrial pathway, but not via TGF-beta signaling pathway. LcrS(5-30) also inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines by immune cells. Thus, LcrS(5-30) promotes apoptosis of immune cells, and suggests probiotics-based regimens for prevention of IBD.","['Chiu, Yi-Han', 'Hsieh, Yi-Jen', 'Liao, Kuang-Wen', 'Peng, Kou-Cheng']","['Chiu YH', 'Hsieh YJ', 'Liao KW', 'Peng KC']","['Department of Biological Science and Technology, National Chiao Tung University, Hsin Chu 30068, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090807,England,Clin Nutr,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",8309603,,2009/08/12 09:00,2010/05/13 06:00,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2009/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0261-5614(09)00156-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clnu.2009.07.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Nutr. 2010 Feb;29(1):131-40. doi: 10.1016/j.clnu.2009.07.004.

Knockdown of Gab1 by the introduction of the Gab1 siRNA expression vector into F-36P human erythroleukemia (F-36P-Gab1-siRNA) cells resulted in a reduction of cell proliferation and survival in response to EPO. EPO-induced activation of Erk1/2 but not of Akt was significantly suppressed in F-36P-Gab1-siRNA cells compared with mock-transfected F-36P cells. The co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed an EPO-enhanced association of Gab1 with the Grb2-SOS1 complex and SHP-2 in F-36P cells. A selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) LY294002 and short interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes targeting the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (p85-siRNA) independently suppressed tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1; its association with Grb2, SHP-2 and p85; and the activation of Erk in EPO-treated F-36P cells. LY294002 inhibited EPO-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 and its association with Grb2 in human primary EPO-sensitive erythroid cells. The co-immunoprecipitation experiments using the Jak inhibitor AG490 or siRNA duplexes targeting Jak2 and in vitro binding experiments demonstrated that Jak2 regulated Gab1-mediated Erk activation through tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1. Taken together, these results suggest that Gab1 couples PI3K-mediated EPO signals with the Ras/Erk pathway and that Gab1 plays an important role in EPOR-mediated signal transduction involved in the proliferation and survival of erythroid cells.","['Fukumoto, Tetsuya', 'Kubota, Yoshitsugu', 'Kitanaka, Akira', 'Yamaoka, Genji', 'Ohara-Waki, Fusako', 'Imataki, Osamu', 'Ohnishi, Hiroaki', 'Ishida, Toshihiko', 'Tanaka, Terukazu']","['Fukumoto T', 'Kubota Y', 'Kitanaka A', 'Yamaoka G', 'Ohara-Waki F', 'Imataki O', 'Ohnishi H', 'Ishida T', 'Tanaka T']","['Division of Hematology, Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, 1750-1 Ikenobe, Miki, Kita-gun, Kagawa 761-0793, Japan. tf1163id@jt3.so-net.ne.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090806,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,,2009/08/12 09:00,2010/02/19 06:00,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2009/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/28 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(09)00220-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2009.07.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2009 Dec;21(12):1775-83. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2009.07.013.

The importance of FIP1-like-1-platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (FIP1L1-PDGFRA) in the pathogenesis and classification of HES has been recently reported. In this study, we investigated the contribution of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)/CCL2 to chemotactic activity and protein kinase C delta (PKC delta in the human eosinophilic leukemia cell line EoL-1. These cells express CCR2 protein among the CC chemokine receptors (CCR1-5). MCP-1 induces strong migration of EoL-1 cells and the chemotaxis signal in response to MCP-1 involves a G(i)/G(o) protein, phospholipase C (PLC), PKC delta, p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB. MCP-1 activates p38 MAPK via G(i)/G(o) protein, PLC and PKC delta cascade. MCP-1 also induces NF-kappaB translocation and the activation is inhibited by PKC delta activation. The increase in the basal expression and activity of PKC delta in EoL-1 cells, compared to normal eosinophils, inhibits apoptosis in EoL-1 cells. Anti-apoptotic mechanism of PKC delta is related to inhibition of caspase 3 and caspase 9, but not to FIP1L1-PDGFRA. PKC delta functions as an anti-apoptotic molecule, and is involved in EoL-1 cell movement stimulated by MCP-1. This study contributes to an understanding of MCP-1 in eosinophil biology and pathogenic mechanism of eosinophilic disorders.","['Lee, Ji-Sook', 'Yang, Eun Ju', 'Kim, In Sik']","['Lee JS', 'Yang EJ', 'Kim IS']","['Department of Biomedical Laboratory Science, School of Medicine, Eulji University, Daejeon 301-746, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090806,England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,,2009/08/12 09:00,2010/03/05 06:00,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2009/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/09 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1043-4666(09)00187-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cyto.2009.07.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2009 Dec;48(3):186-95. doi: 10.1016/j.cyto.2009.07.008.

However, such suppression, which may explain the long latency in the development of ATL, is readily reversible, and viral expression resumes quickly with ex vivo culture of infected T -cells. To investigate the mechanism of in vivo -specific transcriptional suppression, we established a mouse model in which mice were intraperitoneally administered syngeneic EL4 T -lymphoma cells transduced with a recombinant retrovirus expressing a GFP-Tax fusion protein, Gax, under the control of the HTLV-1 enhancer (EL4-Gax). RESULTS: Gax gene transcription was silenced in vivo but quickly up-regulated in ex vivo culture. Analysis of integrated Gax reporter gene demonstrated that neither CpG methylation of the promoter DNA nor histone modification was associated with the reversible suppression. ChIP-analysis of LTR under suppression revealed reduced promoter binding of TFIIB and Pol-II, but no change in the binding of CREB or CBP/p300 to the viral enhancer sequence. However, the expression of TORC2, a co-activator of CREB, decreased substantially in the EL4-Gax cells in vivo, and this returned to normal levels in ex vivo culture. The reduced expression of TORC2 was associated with translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. A knock-down experiment with siRNA confirmed that TORC2 was the major functional protein of the three TORC-family proteins (TORC1, 2, 3) in EL4-Gax cells. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the TORC2 may play an important role in the in vivo -specific transcriptional control of HTLV-1. This study provides a new model for the reversible mechanism that suppresses HTLV-1 expression in vivo without the DNA methylation or hypoacetylated histones that is observed in the primary cells of most HTLV-1 -infected carriers and a substantial number of ATL cases.","['Jiang, Shiwen', 'Inada, Takefumi', 'Tanaka, Masakazu', 'Furuta, Rika A', 'Shingu, Koh', 'Fujisawa, Jun-ichi']","['Jiang S', 'Inada T', 'Tanaka M', 'Furuta RA', 'Shingu K', 'Fujisawa J']","['Department of Microbiology Kansai Medical University, Moriguchi, Osaka, Japan. jiangs@takii.kmu.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090811,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,PMC2734550,2009/08/12 09:00,2009/10/17 06:00,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2009/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/17 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-6-73 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-6-73 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2009 Aug 11;6:73. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-6-73.,"['0 (Crtc2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical data from haploidentical haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) revealed that NK cells were responsible for remarkably favourable effects in both adult and paediatric high-risk leukaemias. NK receptors specific for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, including killer immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptors (KIR) and CD94/NKG2A, play a major role in the anti-leukaemia effect (mediating either inhibitory or activating signals). Haplo- HSCT requires a heavy conditioning regimen for the patient and the use of large numbers of T cell-depleted HSC to be grafted. After transplantation, natural killer cells develop from HSC shortly after engraftment and may include 'alloreactive' NK cells that kill leukaemic cells and prevent graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Alloreactive NK cells are characterized by the expression of KIR that are not engaged by any of the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles expressed by the patient. Their generation is dependent upon the existence of a KIR/HLA class I mismatch between donor and recipient. Novel important information on the function and specificity of different KIR has been obtained recently by the analysis of donor-derived alloreactive NK cells in a cohort of paediatric patients given haplo-HSCT to cure acute, high-risk leukaemias.","['Moretta, A', 'Pende, D', 'Locatelli, F', 'Moretta, L']","['Moretta A', 'Pende D', 'Locatelli F', 'Moretta L']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Center of Excellence for Biomedical Research, University of Genova, 16132 Genova-Quarto, Italy. alemoret@unige.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,PMC2745025,2009/08/12 09:00,2009/10/10 06:00,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['CEI3983 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.03983.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2009 Sep;157(3):325-31. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.03983.x.,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Haplotypes', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/immunology/*surgery', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Receptors, KIR/*metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,74,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to distinguish metabolic markers of cell resistance to imatinib. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Two human imatinib-sensitive CML cell lines: LAMA84-s and K562-s, and their resistant counterparts: LAMA84-r and K562-r (both resistant to 1 microM imatinib), and K562-R (5 microM) were analysed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to assess global metabolic profiling, including energy state, glucose and phospholipid metabolism. KEY RESULTS: We found, by Western blotting and flow cytometry, that the levels of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase and multi-drug resistance p-glycoprotein were inconsistent among resistant clones. On the other hand, phospholipid metabolism and lactate production were highly predictive for cell response to imatinib. As previously reported, sensitive cells showed significantly decreased glycolytic activity (lactate) and phospholipid synthesis (phosphocholine) as well as increased phospholipid catabolism (glycerophosphocholine) after 24 h of 1 microM imatinib treatment, which correlated with inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. In contrast to their sensitive counterparts, the K562-r, K562-R and LAMA84-r maintained increased phospholipid synthesis and glycolytic lactate production in the presence of 1 microM (K562-r and LAMA84-r) and 5 microM (K562-R) imatinib. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Specific metabolic markers for early detection of imatinib resistance, including increased glycolytic activity and phospholipid turnover, can be identified in resistant clones. Once validated in human isolated leukocytes, they may be used to monitor the responsiveness of CML patients to treatment.","['Klawitter, Jelena', 'Kominsky, Douglas J', 'Brown, Jaimi L', 'Klawitter, Jost', 'Christians, Uwe', 'Leibfritz, Dieter', 'Melo, Junia V', 'Eckhardt, S Gail', 'Serkova, Natalie J']","['Klawitter J', 'Kominsky DJ', 'Brown JL', 'Klawitter J', 'Christians U', 'Leibfritz D', 'Melo JV', 'Eckhardt SG', 'Serkova NJ']","['Department of Anesthesiology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO 80045, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090806,England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,PMC2757699,2009/08/12 09:00,2010/01/06 06:00,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['BPH345 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00345.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2009 Sep;158(2):588-600. doi: 10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00345.x.

CML represents approximately 15-20% of all adult leukemia and the disease development is clearly linked to the constitutively active tyrosine kinase of the chimeric protein BCR-ABL. It is encoded by the Bcr-Abl fusion gene sequence as the result of chromosome 9/22 translocation (Philadelphia chromosome) or other aberrant cytogenetic events. The development of targeted agents that specifically inhibit the tyrosine kinase (TK) activity of BCR-ABL has revolutionized the treatment of CML. Imatinib is now the first-line treatment for chronic phase CML, and several newer tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as dasatinib and nilotinib have been added to the pharmacologic compendium. Despite the proven efficacy of TKIs to induce hematological and cytogenetic remission, the large majority of patients still have molecularly detectable disease. Therefore, new options are needed to improve therapeutic success in the treatment of leukemia. Pyrrolo[1,2-b][1,2,5]benzothiadiazepine 5,5-dioxides (PBTDs) induced apoptosis in human BCR-ABL expressing leukemia cells. The apoptotic activity was also observed in primary leukemic blasts, obtained from CML patients at onset or from patients in blast crisis and who were imatinib- dasatinib- and nilotinib resistant. These results suggests that these compounds are promising agent for the treatment of leukemia. Due to the fact that the phenomenon of resistance to TKIs remains a major issue in the treatment of patients with CML, the identification of new drugs may be of clinical relevance. This review summarises patents and papers dealing with the present understanding of mechanism of action and the most relevant data concerning TKs inhibition.","['Marfe, Gabriella', 'Di Stefano, Carla']","['Marfe G', 'Di Stefano C']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Via Montpellier 1, 00133 Rome, Italy. gabriellamarfe@libero.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Recent Pat Anticancer Drug Discov,Recent patents on anti-cancer drug discovery,101266081,,2009/08/12 09:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2009/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['PRA-ABS-Marfe-14 [pii]', '10.2174/157489210789702163 [doi]']",ppublish,Recent Pat Anticancer Drug Discov. 2010 Jan;5(1):58-68. doi: 10.2174/157489210789702163.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Thiazepines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Molecular Structure', 'Piperazines/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Pyrroles/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Thiazepines/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology']",,,,,114,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Statistical tests for differential expression, in particular, rely upon the assumption that the sample groups being compared are relatively homogeneous. Such assumption rarely holds in clinical materials, which leads to detection of secondary findings (false positives) or loss of significant targets (false negatives). Here, we introduce a resampling-based procedure, named ReScore, which aggregates individual changes across all the samples while preserving their clinical classes, and thereby provides multiple sets of markers that can effectively characterize distinct sample subsets. When applied to a public leukemia microarray study, the procedure could accurately reveal hidden subgroup structures associated with underlying genotypic abnormalities. The procedure improved both the sensitivity and specificity of the findings, as well as helped us to identify several disease subtype-specific genes that have remained undetected in the conventional analyses. In our endometriosis study, we were able to accurately distinguish between various sources of systematic variation, linked, for example, to tissue-specificity and disease-related factors, many of which would have been missed with standard approaches. The generic procedure should benefit also other global profiling experiments such as those based on mass spectrometry-based proteomic assays.","['Hiissa, Jukka', 'Elo, Laura L', 'Huhtinen, Kaisa', 'Perheentupa, Antti', 'Poutanen, Matti', 'Aittokallio, Tero']","['Hiissa J', 'Elo LL', 'Huhtinen K', 'Perheentupa A', 'Poutanen M', 'Aittokallio T']","['Biomathematics Research Group, Department of Mathematics, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,OMICS,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,101131135,,2009/08/12 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/omi.2009.0027 [doi]'],ppublish,OMICS. 2009 Oct;13(5):381-96. doi: 10.1089/omi.2009.0027.,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Endometriosis/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genome', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Humans', 'Models, Statistical', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Low TPMT activity has been associated with severe toxicity of 6-mercaptopurine. Determination of mutations in the TPMT gene before starting 6-mercaptopurine therapy constitutes a quick, simple and cost-effective strategy to individualize thiopurine dosing. However, TPMT phenotype-to-genotype correlation is not complete, indicating a need for identification of novel biomarkers.

Hematological malignancies, as leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma, typically do not result in hepatic dysfunction and rarely manifest as fulminant liver failure. CASE PRESENTATION: A 43 year-old male was referred with 2-week diarrhea, nausea and vague abdominal discomfort. He was treated with oral antibiotics. However, symptoms progressed and he was admitted with advanced liver failure. On admission the patient was jaundiced, agitated, with tachycardia and hypotension. There were echymosis around the eyes and chest, active bleeding at sites of vein punctures and macroscopic hematuria. The abdomen was tender with an enlarged liver. Admission laboratory findings were consistent with acute hepato-renal failure. Viral hepatitis serology was negative, antinuclear antibody screen was negative, and iron panel was normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed liver and spleen enlargement. He developed refrac- tory hypoglycemia, further increase in serum lactate and died 5 days after admission. CONCLUSIONS: Acute liver failure is uncommon as the presenting feature of lymphoma. This fact may delay diagnosis, contributing to the reported poor prognosis. Establishing a diagnosis of malignancy as the cause of acute liver failure is difficult and requires a high index of suspicion. Given the poor prognosis associated with late or missed diagnosis and the potential benefits of early chemotherapy, lymphoma should be considered in any patient presenting with acute liver failure without an obvious etiology and associated with lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly.","['Padilla, Guillermo Flores', 'Garibay, Marco Antonio Alba', 'Hummel, Haiko Nellen', 'Avila, Renata', 'Mendez, Alejandra', 'Ramirez, Rocio']","['Padilla GF', 'Garibay MA', 'Hummel HN', 'Avila R', 'Mendez A', 'Ramirez R']","['Departamento de Medicina Interna, Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI.

Concentration of 110 microM ubiquinone-9 caused 50% growth inhibition of human leukaemia U937 cells, but not that of normal fibroblast NIH3T3 and 3Y1 cells. Ubiquinone-9-induced cell death was characterised with the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and pro-caspase 3. Furthermore, ubiquinone-9 induced the fragmentation of DNA into an apoptotic DNA ladder, indicating that the inhibitor triggered apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis by ubiquinone-9 was also confirmed using flow cytometry analysis.

Despite discontinuation of imatinib, hepatotoxicity can be progressive. Steroid may be useful in these patients and should be started early. We report a 53-year-old woman with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors who developed hepatotoxicity while receiving imatinib and subsequently acute liver failure. Ten weeks after commencing imatinib treatment, hepatotoxicity was determined. Imatinib was immediately ceased. Subsequently, a week later hepatic encephalopathy, jaundice, and coagulopathy occurred. Prednisolone was commenced. Liver biopsy was performed five weeks after the determining of hepatotoxicity. Biopsy showed sinusoidal congestion, necrosis of hepatocytes, inflammation, and hepatocyte drop out around the hepatic venule consistent with drug toxicity. Her liver function tests normalized with a nine-week prednisolone treatment. The patient was discharged. Her liver enzymes remained in normal range following visits. In cases of imatinib-induced acute hepatitis, the administration of prednisolone may be useful in the resolution of the acute episode and allow the reintroduction of a drug without risking recurrence of hepatitis.","['Tonyali, Onder', 'Coskun, Ugur', 'Yildiz, Ramazan', 'Karakan, Tarkan', 'Demirci, Umut', 'Akyurek, Nalan', 'Benekli, Mustafa', 'Buyukberber, Suleyman']","['Tonyali O', 'Coskun U', 'Yildiz R', 'Karakan T', 'Demirci U', 'Akyurek N', 'Benekli M', 'Buyukberber S']","['Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Oncology, Gazi University, 06500, Besevler Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20090807,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,,2009/08/08 09:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2009/08/08 09:00'],"['2009/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-009-9284-y [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2010 Sep;27(3):768-73. doi: 10.1007/s12032-009-9284-y.

K562 cells were treated with wortmannin of various concentrations (3.125-100 nmol/L) for 0-72 h. MTT assay was used to evaluate the inhibitory effect of wortmannin on the growth of K562 cells. Cell apoptosis was detected by both Annexin-V FITC/PI double-labeled cytometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The expression of p-Akt, T-p-Akt, NF-kappaBp65 and IKK-kappaB was determined by Western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Our results showed that wortmannin obviously inhibited growth and induced apoptosis of K562 cells in vitro in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The IC(50) value of wortmannin for 24 h was 25+/-0.14 nmol/L. Moreover, wortmannin induced K562 cells apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. TEM revealed typical morphological changes of apoptosis in wortmannin-treated K562 cells, such as chromatin condensation, karyopyknosis, karyorhexis and apoptotic bodies. Additionally, several important intracellular protein kinases such as p-Akt, NF-kappaBp65 and IKK-kappaB experienced degradation of various degrees in a dose-dependent manner both at protein level and transcription level when cultured with wortmannin, but the expression of total Akt showed no change. It is concluded that wortmannin can inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of K562 leukemia cells possibly by down-regulating the survival signaling pathways (PI3K/Akt and NF-kappaB channels).","['Wu, Qing', 'Chen, Yan', 'Cui, Guohui', 'Cheng, Yiquan']","['Wu Q', 'Chen Y', 'Cui G', 'Cheng Y']","['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China. wuqing1221@21cn.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090807,China,J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

The histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA) was shown to induce apoptosis in many cancer cells. However, the mechanism of TSA on induction of cancer cells apoptosis is poorly understood. This study was designed to characterize the global gene expression profiles before and after treatment of human leukemia cell line Molt-4 with TSA. Flow cytometry, MTT and DNA ladder were used to observe the effect of TSA on the apoptosis of MOLT-4 cells and normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Microarray, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to detect the difference of gene and protein expressions of Molt-4 cells after incubation of the cells with TSA. The results showed that TSA could induce Molt-4 apoptosis in dose- and time-dependent manners but spared PBMCs. Microarray analysis showed that after incubation with TSA for 9 h, 310 genes were upregulated and 313 genes were deregulated. These genes regulate the growth, differentiation and survival of cells. Among these genes, STAT5A was down-regulated by 80.4% and MYC was down-regulated by 77.3%. It was concluded that TSA has definite growth-inhibiting and apoptosis-inducing effects on Molt-4 cells in time- and dose-dependent manners, with weak cytotoxic effects on PBMCs at the same time. The mechanism of TSA selectively inducing apoptosis and inhibiting growth may be ascribed to the changes of pro-proliferation genes and anti-apoptosis genes.","['Hong, Zhenya', 'Han, Zhiqiang', 'Xiao, Min', 'Yang, Yang', 'Xia, Xi', 'Zhou, Jianfeng']","['Hong Z', 'Han Z', 'Xiao M', 'Yang Y', 'Xia X', 'Zhou J']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China. hongzhenya@eyou.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090807,China,J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

Thus, the identification of specific of biomarkers for specific medical problems, including malignant diseases may be valuable in medical practice. In the study, we have used the Wilms' tumor gene (WT1) as a biomarker to evaluate its expression in local adult patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia, including both acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemias (AML and ALL). AIM: To investigate WT1 gene expression in adult patients with acute leukemia at diagnosis. METHODS: Eighteen patients with acute leukemia diagnosed at Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, between September, 2004 and July, 2005 were included in this study. There were fifteen AML and three ALL cases aged from 18 to 71 years old. Total RNA and DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Expression of WT1 was detected by nested reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (Nested RT-PCR). K562, and 3T3 cells were used as positive- and negative-controls. The results were revalidated using real-time PCR. HLA-A genotyping was performed using sequence specific oligonucleotide polymorphism (SSOP) analysis. RESULTS: WT1 gene was exclusively expressed in all eighteen, including three ALL and fifteen AML, patients. In contrast with WT1 gene, the HLA-A genotyping was remarkably heterogeneous in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: WT1 gene expression was observed in local patients with acute leukemia at diagnosis. It may be used as a potential molecular marker for diagnosis, clinical progression of the diseases or monitoring the response to treatment, as well as a target for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.","['Lim, Che Kang', 'Goh, Yeow Tee', 'Hwang, William Y K', 'Ho, Liam Pock', 'Sun, Li']","['Lim CK', 'Goh YT', 'Hwang WY', 'Ho LP', 'Sun L']",['Department of Clinical Research.'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20070808,United States,Biomark Insights,Biomarker insights,101288638,PMC2717842,2007/01/01 00:00,2007/01/01 00:01,['2009/08/08 09:00'],"['2009/08/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2007/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Biomark Insights. 2007 Aug 8;2:293-8.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['HLA-A', 'WT1', 'adulthood acute leukemia', 'gene expression']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are attractive targets for today's drug discovery and development, and many pharmaceutical companies are intensively developing various kinds of protein kinase inhibitors. A good example is the recent success with the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Though imatinib has dramatically improved the treatment of Bcr-Abl-positive chronic myeloid leukemia, resistance is often found in patients with advanced-stage disease. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this resistance, including point mutations within the Abl kinase domain, amplification of the bcr-abl gene, overexpression of the corresponding mRNA, increased drug efflux mediated by P-glycoprotein, and activation of the Src-family kinase (SFK) Lyn. We set out to develop a novel drug whose affinity for Abl is higher than that of imatinib and whose specificity in inhibiting Lyn is higher than that of SFK/Abl inhibitors such as dasatinib (Sprycel) or bosutinib (SKI-606). Our work has led to the development of NS-187 (INNO-406), a novel Abl/Lyn dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor with clinical prospects. To provide an overview of how a selective kinase inhibitor has been developed, this review presents chemical-modification studies carried out with the guidance of molecular modeling, the structural basis for the high potency and selectivity of NS-187 based on the X-ray structure of the NS-187/Abl complex, and the biological profiling of NS-187, including site-directed mutagenesis experiments.","['Niwa, Tomoko', 'Asaki, Tetsuo', 'Kimura, Shinya']","['Niwa T', 'Asaki T', 'Kimura S']","['Discovery Research Laboratories, Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd. 14, Nishinosho-Monguchi-Cho, Kisshoin, Minami-ku, Kyoto 601-8550, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071114,United States,Anal Chem Insights,Analytical chemistry insights,101463741,PMC2716809,2007/01/01 00:00,2007/01/01 00:01,['2009/08/08 09:00'],"['2009/08/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2007/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Anal Chem Insights. 2007 Nov 14;2:93-106.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcr-Abl', 'INNO-406', 'Lyn', 'NS-187', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'imatinib']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) has been implicated as a key regulator of differentiation and proliferation in various cell types. Here we investigated the potential dynamic change and role of C/EBPalpha protein during apoptosis induction. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Upon onset of apoptosis induced by various kinds of inducers such as NSC606985, etoposide and others, C/EBPalpha expression presented a profound down-regulation in leukemic cell lines and primary cells via induction of protein degradation and inhibition of transcription, as assessed respectively by cycloheximide inhibition test, real-time quantitative RT-PCR and luciferase reporter assay. Applying chemical inhibition, forced expression of dominant negative mutant and catalytic fragment (CF) of protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta), which was proteolytically activated during apoptosis induction tested, we showed that the active PKCdelta protein contributed to the increased degradation of C/EBPalpha protein. Three specific proteasome inhibitors antagonized C/EBPalpha degradation during apoptosis induction. More importantly, ectopic expression of PKCdelta-CF stimulated the ubiquitination of C/EBPalpha protein, while the chemical inhibition of PKCdelta action significantly inhibited the enhanced ubiquitination of C/EBPalpha protein under NSC606985 treatment. Additionally, silencing of C/EBPalpha expression by small interfering RNAs enhanced, while inducible expression of C/EBPalpha inhibited NSC606985/etoposide-induced apoptosis in leukemic cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These observations indicate that the activation of PKCdelta upon apoptosis results in the increased proteasome-dependent degradation of C/EBPalpha, which partially contributes to PKCdelta-mediated apoptosis.","['Zhao, Meng', 'Duan, Xu-Fang', 'Zhao, Xu-Yun', 'Zhang, Bo', 'Lu, Ying', 'Liu, Wei', 'Cheng, Jin-Ke', 'Chen, Guo-Qiang']","['Zhao M', 'Duan XF', 'Zhao XY', 'Zhang B', 'Lu Y', 'Liu W', 'Cheng JK', 'Chen GQ']","['Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090807,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC2719015,2009/08/08 09:00,2010/01/20 06:00,['2009/08/08 09:00'],"['2009/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0006552 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Aug 7;4(8):e6552. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0006552.,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/genetics/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Down-Regulation', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-delta/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Ubiquitination']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In patients with postprandial dyslipidemia, metabolic pathways for exogenous lipoproteins are generally disturbed, resulting in accumulation of chylomicron remnants. Although it has been difficult to make a specific antibody against apolipoprotein B48 (apoB48) , a constituent of exogenous lipoproteins, we succeeded in creating a specific monoclonal antibody against apoB48. In this study, we isolated apoB48-containing lipoproteins from lipoproteins with a density less than 1.019 g/mL using this anti-apoB48 monoclonal antibody (4C8). METHODS: Apolipoproteins and lipids were analyzed to confirm whether apoB48-containing lipoproteins are isolated from other lipoproteins. The characteristics of apoB48-containing lipoproteins in the plasma of patients were compared with type 2 diabetes mellitus and non-diabetic patients. Furthermore, the uptake of apoB48-containing lipoproteins by THP-1 cells (a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) , HepG2 cells (a human hepatoma cell line) , and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was investigated. Also, the expression of apoB48 receptors in these cells was tested with RT-PCR. RESULTS: Apolipoprotein analysis of 4C8-bound lipoproteins indicated the isolation of apoB48-containing lipoproteins, because the content of apoB100 was quite low (less than 5%) . Compared with lipoproteins that were not bound to the antibody, apoB48-containing lipoproteins had a higher content of triglycerides. There was no significant difference in the composition of apoB48-containing lipo-proteins between patients with and without type 2 diabetes. Uptake of fluorescence-labeled apoB48-containing lipoproteins by THP-1-derived macrophages and HepG2 cells, but not by HUVEC, was observed. The specificity of this uptake was confirmed because the fluorescent signal was competed out by an excess amount of the same unlabeled lipoproteins. RT-PCR revealed the expression of apoB48 receptors in THP-1 and HepG2 cells but not in HUVEC. These results suggest that specific uptake of apoB48-containing lipoproteins may occur via apoB48 receptors. CONCLUSION: ApoB48-containing lipoproteins have a higher triglyceride content and are taken up into THP-1-derived macrophages and HepG2 cells by a specific pathway.","['Yoshimura, Nakayuki', 'Kinoshita, Makoto', 'Teramoto, Tamio']","['Yoshimura N', 'Kinoshita M', 'Teramoto T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Teikyo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090806,Japan,J Atheroscler Thromb,Journal of atherosclerosis and thrombosis,9506298,,2009/08/08 09:00,2010/04/03 06:00,['2009/08/08 09:00'],"['2009/08/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/03 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jat/No976 [pii]', '10.5551/jat.no976 [doi]']",ppublish,J Atheroscler Thromb. 2009;16(6):740-7. doi: 10.5551/jat.no976.

The aim of the study was to determine radiation dose-response relationships for these late effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of articles reporting incidences for cataract induction and late renal dysfunction was performed, using PubMed. The radiation regimens identified were normalized using the linear-quadratic model; biologically effective doses (BEDs) were calculated. RESULTS: For cataract induction, 17 articles were identified allowing a dose-effect relationship to be derived. A threshold BED of approximately 40 Gy was indicated below which severe cataract seldom occurs. For late renal toxicity, 14 articles were found. The resulting dose-effect relationship indicates a threshold BED of approximately 16 Gy. CONCLUSION: To prevent severe cataract, fractionated TBI should be applied to keep the BED <40 Gy. Only when single-dose TBI cannot be avoided should eye shielding be applied. To prevent late renal toxicity, fractionated TBI is recommended, but kidney shielding remains necessary for almost all myeloablative TBI regimens.","['Kal, Henk B', 'VAN Kempen-Harteveld, M Loes']","['Kal HB', 'VAN Kempen-Harteveld ML']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Q00.118, University Medical Center Utrecht, Heidelberglaan 100, 3584 CX Utrecht, the Netherlands.

Our previous studies in clinical settings have suggested that certain subpopulations of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) had poor response to chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of staurosporine on apoptosis and cell cycle distribution in human leukemic cell line U-937 cells was determined. U-937 cells were treated with staurosporine at 0.5 microM for 18 hours or 1 microM for 24 hours. Analyses of cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were performed using flow cytometric analysis. The effects of staurosporine on the targeted proteins were assessed by immunoblot analysis. RESULTS: A blockade of the cell cycle at the G(2)/M phase was observed in U-937 cells treated with staurosporine. A concomitant induction of apoptosis and activation of caspase-3 in U-937 cells was also achieved. Treatment of U-937 cells with staurosporine at 1 microM for 24 hours, compared with 0.5 microM for 18 hours, appeared to kill the leukemic more efficiently cells and this dose and duration may specifically target p27, Erk and Akt pathways that are important for cancer cell survival and resistance to treatment. We also show that the effects of stauroporine on cell cycle progression and apoptosis in U-937 cells are closely linked. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that induction of apoptosis and inhibitory proliferation and survival pathways are important events induced by staurosporine. Understanding the conditions under which staurosporine shows high specificity and low toxicity in treatment of leukemic cells is of great importance for improving the efficacy of targeted therapeutics and overcoming resistance to chemotherapeutic agents.","['Antonsson, Andreas', 'Persson, Jenny L']","['Antonsson A', 'Persson JL']","['Division of Experimental Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Clinical Research Center, 20502 Malmo, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,,2009/08/08 09:00,2009/10/01 06:00,['2009/08/08 09:00'],"['2009/08/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['29/8/2893 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2009 Aug;29(8):2893-8.,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Staurosporine/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past few years several groups have reported that jasmonates exhibit anti-cancer activity in vitro and in vivo and induce growth inhibition in cancer cells, while leaving the non-transformed cells intact. Recently, jasmonates were also discovered to have cytotoxic effects towards metastatic melanoma both in vitro and in vivo. Three mechanisms of action have been proposed to explain this anti-cancer activity. The bio-energetic mechanism - jasmonates induce severe ATP depletion in cancer cells via mitochondrial perturbation. Furthermore, methyl jasmonate (MJ) has the ability to detach hexokinase from the mitochondria. Second, jasmonates induce re-differentiation in human myeloid leukemia cells via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity and were found to act similar to the cytokinin isopentenyladenine (IPA). Third, jasmonates induce apoptosis in lung carcinoma cells via the generation of hydrogen peroxide, and pro-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family. Combination of MJ with the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) and with four conventional chemotherapeutic drugs resulted in super-additive cytotoxic effects on several types of cancer cells. Finally, jasmonates have the ability to induce death in spite of drug-resistance conferred by either p53 mutation or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) over-expression. In summary, the jasmonates are anti-cancer agents that exhibit selective cytotoxicity towards cancer cells, and thus present hope for the development of cancer therapeutics.","['Cohen, Sharon', 'Flescher, Eliezer']","['Cohen S', 'Flescher E']","['Department of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology, Sacker Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090805,England,Phytochemistry,Phytochemistry,0151434,,2009/08/08 09:00,2010/01/14 06:00,['2009/08/08 09:00'],"['2009/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0031-9422(09)00241-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.phytochem.2009.06.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Phytochemistry. 2009 Sep;70(13-14):1600-9. doi: 10.1016/j.phytochem.2009.06.007.

Numerous studies confirm the presence of a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect following CBT, and preliminary data suggests that double-unit CBT may be associated with a decreased risk of relapse. We have observed a low relapse rate following CBT among patients with acute leukemias in morphologic complete remission (CR) at the time of myeloablative (MA) transplant. To further assess this observation, we conducted a matched cohort analysis comparing relapse rates and outcomes for patients receiving CBTs versus patients receiving matched unrelated donor (MURD) and mismatched unrelated donor (MMURD) transplants at our center. Thirty-one consecutive CBT patients (aged 0.6-42 years, median 22 years), transplanted between April 2006 and June 2008, were compared to matched subjects selected on the basis of disease type and remission number, cytogenetic risk status, minimal residual disease status (MRD), time from diagnosis to first relapse (for patients beyond CR1), use of imatinib for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, age, and date of transplant. With a median follow-up among surviving CBT patients of 21.1 months (range: 6.6-32.6 months), there has been 1 relapse among cord patients versus 8 relapses among MURD patients (P=.018) and 7 relapses among MMURD patients (P=.019).

In many cases, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is considered only if a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched sibling donor (MSD) is available. The role of unrelated donor (URD) HCT in this patient population is not well established. As advances in supportive care and donor selection have improved, the use of URD HCT in such patients should be reevaluated. We analyzed the outcomes of 87 consecutive children with ALL in CR2 who underwent allogeneic HCT at the University of Minnesota between 1990 and 2007. Donor sources included MSD bone marrow (n = 32), well and partially matched (M, n = 18) and mismatched (MM, n = 16) URD bone marrow and URD umbilical cord blood (UCB, n = 21). Although the incidence of neutrophil recovery was similar in all groups, the overall incidence of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was 37% and 9%, respectively, with a higher incidence of aGVHD in recipients of URD grafts. Leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 5 years was lower in recipients of MM-URD grafts, but was comparable in all other groups. Although relapse at 5 years was highest in recipients of MSD (50%), results were not significantly different compared to recipients of M-URD (17%), MM-URD (6%), and UCB (33%) (P = .17). The development of grades II-IV aGVHD and a first remission >3 years were associated with a lower risk of relapse (relative risk [RR] 0.2, P = .03; RR 0.2. P = .01 respectively). Together, these results support the continued investigation of URD HCT for ALL in CR2, and suggest the timing of HCT in these children should be based primarily on the risk of relapse with conventional chemotherapy and not on the type of donor available.","['Smith, Angela R', 'Baker, K Scott', 'Defor, Todd E', 'Verneris, Michael R', 'Wagner, John E', 'Macmillan, Margaret L']","['Smith AR', 'Baker KS', 'Defor TE', 'Verneris MR', 'Wagner JE', 'Macmillan ML']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. smith719@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,PMC5225985,2009/08/08 09:00,2009/11/03 06:00,['2009/08/08 09:00'],"['2009/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(09)00235-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.05.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2009 Sep;15(9):1086-93. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.05.005.,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft Survival/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Tissue Donors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,"['P01 CA065493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA65493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS837949'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There exists substantial evidence of the importance of early donor acceptance in HSCT outcome. In cases when the donor cannot be perfectly matched, it often is unclear which mismatch is less harmful and thus has a greater likelihood of acceptance. We modeled and analyzed interactions between the protein products of different HLA alleles of the transplant recipient and natural killer and T lymphocyte cell receptors of the donor's immune system. Reactions between these 2 systems often lead to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Sequence polymorphisms that define HLA I and II alleles predict not only GVHD, but also host-versus-graft and graft-versus-leukemia effects, all of which influence the overall transplantation outcome. Although complete high-resolution HLA matching of the donor-recipient pair seems to be associated with optimal post-HSCT survival, recent reports suggest that not every HLA disparity is functionally relevant. We performed interaction energy calculations for selected pairs of donor-recipient HLA alleles. Based on the results, we conclude that the energy of contact between the T lymphocyte cell receptor (TCR) and HLA residues can help predict the future development of an immune reaction and, consequently, the outcome of allogeneic HSCT.","['Dudkiewicz, Malgorzata', 'Malanowski, Piotr', 'Czerwin Ski, Jaroslaw', 'Pawlowski, Krzysztof']","['Dudkiewicz M', 'Malanowski P', 'Czerwin Ski J', 'Pawlowski K']","['Department of Experimental Design and Bioinformatics, Warsaw University of Life Sciences Warsaw, Poland. malgorzata.dudkiewicz@omega.sggw.waw.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,2009/08/08 09:00,2009/11/03 06:00,['2009/08/08 09:00'],"['2009/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(09)00248-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.05.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2009 Sep;15(9):1014-25. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.05.011.,"['0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics/immunology', 'HLA-B Antigens/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/chemistry/immunology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Thermodynamics', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,['Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2010 Jun;16(6):865-6.

Clinical suspicion of neoplastic meningitis (NM) may be raised by the appearance of multivariate neurological symptoms; however, a definitive diagnosis is often difficult to obtain. Improved treatments for primary malignancies and advances in diagnostic imaging technology have led to an apparent increase in the number of patients diagnosed with NM. Unfortunately, therapeutic options remain limited, particularly for patients with chemoresistant tumors. Optimized treatment remains controversial and may rely upon a combination of chemotherapy (intrathecal and/or intravenous) and concurrent focal radiotherapy. This review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of intra-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) versus systemic strategies for treating NM. Clinical trial evidence is presented for the different treatment modalities. In addition, the therapeutic potential of intra-CSF therapy for cancer prophylaxis is discussed. Earlier diagnosis and more aggressive preventive treatment regimens may provide substantial increases in survival and favorably affect quality of life.

Clinical manifestations are often subtle or may be ascribed to other cancer complications, eg, treatment-related disorders or brain parenchymal metastases. CSF cytology has a high specificity (>95%), but its sensitivity is generally less than 50%. MRI sensitivity and specificity vary with the type of primary cancer; overall, MRI findings consistent with leptomeningeal disease are detected in fewer than 50% of NM patients. While most clinicians evaluate CSF cytology along with MRI and the clinical examination, underdiagnosis is a major problem, since many patients are both cytologically and radiographically negative. Failure to consider NM in the differential diagnosis magnifies the problem of underdiagnosis. CSF flow cytometry is particularly promising for evaluating NM from hematologic cancers, with a diagnostic sensitivity many fold greater than conventional cytology. Research has focused on identifying biochemical markers of tumor cells in the CSF. For example, molecules involved in CNS penetration (eg, matrix metalloproteinases and cathepsins), tumor cell tropism (eg, chemokines CXCL8 and CCL18), and angiogenesis (eg, vascular endothelial growth factor) are elevated in the CSF of patients with NM. Evidence that some tumor types are more likely to infiltrate the CNS also has stimulated research into primary tumor markers predictive of CNS metastases. At present, there is no tumor marker or patient characteristic that reliably predicts the development of NM, and diagnosis still relies on suggestive signs and symptoms, positive CSF cytology, or a consistent MRI-all late manifestations of NM. Until techniques capable of detecting NM early are developed, increased awareness of the disease and standardized evaluation are likely to have the greatest impact on improving diagnosis and implementing earlier treatment.","['Chamberlain, Marc C', 'Glantz, Michael', 'Groves, Morris D', 'Wilson, Wyndham H']","['Chamberlain MC', 'Glantz M', 'Groves MD', 'Wilson WH']","['Department of Neurology and Neurological Surgery, Division of Neuro-Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98109-1023. chambemc@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,,2009/09/17 06:00,2009/10/09 06:00,['2009/08/08 09:00'],"['2009/08/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0093-7754(09)00095-5 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminoncol.2009.05.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2009 Aug;36(4 Suppl 2):S35-45. doi: 10.1053/j.seminoncol.2009.05.005.,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Biomarkers/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/cerebrospinal fluid/diagnosis/*secondary', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/cerebrospinal fluid/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*cerebrospinal fluid/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/cerebrospinal fluid/*pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Meninges/*pathology']",,,,,56,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current efforts focus not only on further improving cure rate but also on patient quality of life. Hence, all protocols decrease or limit the use of cranial irradiation as central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy, even in patients with high-risk presenting features, such as the presence of leukemia cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (even resulting from traumatic lumbar puncture), adverse genetic features, T-cell immunophenotype, and a large leukemia cell burden. Current strategies for CNS-directed therapy involve effective systemic chemotherapy (eg, dexamethasone, high-dose methotrexate, intensive asparaginase) and early intensification and optimization of intrathecal therapy. Options under investigation for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CNS leukemia in ALL patients include thiotepa and intrathecal liposomal cytarabine. CNS involvement in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is associated with young age, advanced stage, number of extranodal sites, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and International Prognostic Index score. Refractory CNS lymphoma in patients with NHL carries a poor prognosis, with a median survival of 2 to 6 months; the most promising treatment, autologous stem cell transplant, can extend median survival from 10 to 26 months. CNS prophylaxis is required during the initial treatment of NHL subtypes that carry a high risk of CNS relapse, such as B-cell ALL, Burkitt lymphoma, and lymphoblastic lymphoma. The use of CNS prophylaxis in the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is controversial because of the low risk of CNS relapse ( approximately 5%) in this population. In this article, we review current and past practice of intrathecal therapy in ALL and NHL and the risk models that aim to identify predictors of CNS relapse in NHL.","['Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Thiel, Eckhard']","['Pui CH', 'Thiel E']","[""St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. ching-hon.pui@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,PMC2805279,2009/09/17 06:00,2009/10/09 06:00,['2009/08/08 09:00'],"['2009/08/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0093-7754(09)00092-X [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminoncol.2009.05.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2009 Aug;36(4 Suppl 2):S2-S16. doi: 10.1053/j.seminoncol.2009.05.002.,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*prevention & control/*secondary', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",,,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765-31/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS162447'],107,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, azathiopurine and its metabolites can also cause adverse reactions such as myelosuppression. These manifestations may be attributed to polymorphisms or mutations in the thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) gene that might result in low TPMT enzyme activity. Our aim was to investigate if azathioprine-related myelosuppression is associated with TPMT polymorphism, which in turn affects its enzyme activity. METHODS: A 61-year-old Chinese man with severe atopic eczema developed moderate myelosuppression with standard doses of azathioprine. His TPMT activity was measured using radiochemical assay. Genotyping of TPMT *3C, *3A and *6 were screened using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Novel mutation was detected by sequencing. Family studies of his three other siblings were performed. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of azathioprine treatment, the patient's white blood cells and absolute neutrophil count dropped by 40-45%. He was then taken off azathioprine, and blood counts returned to normal. TPMT activity test showed intermediate levels of 9.1 nmol h(-1) ml(-1) peripheral red blood cells (pRBC). Resequencing of the TPMT gene revealed a missense mutation Phe-->Leu at 208 aa position in exon 9 (ss105107120). Two of his three siblings were heterozygous for 208F-->L, which accounts for the decreased enzyme activity (brother 8.9 nmol h(-1) ml(-1) pRBC, sister 8.8 nmol h(-1) ml(-1) pRBC). The remaining sibling had wild-type allele with normal enzyme activity. Screening of 100 normal healthy Chinese subjects did not reveal any individual with this mutation. CONCLUSION: We report a novel mutation TPMT*26 (208F-->L) associated with a decrease in TPMT enzyme activity.","['Kham, Shirley Kow Yin', 'Soh, Chin Kok', 'Aw, Derrick Chen Wee', 'Yeoh, Allen Eng Juh']","['Kham SK', 'Soh CK', 'Aw DC', 'Yeoh AE']","['Department of Paediatrics, Division of Haematology and Oncology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University Health System, National University Hospital, 5 Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,PMC2732947,2009/08/08 09:00,2010/04/17 06:00,['2009/08/08 09:00'],"['2009/08/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['BCP3405 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2125.2009.03405.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2009 Jul;68(1):120-3. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2125.2009.03405.x.,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)']",IM,"['Asians/ethnology/genetics', 'Azathioprine/*adverse effects', 'Dermatitis, Atopic/*drug therapy', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Genetic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these are superoxide anion radical (*O2(-)), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radical (*OH). In this study, we investigated the role of H2O2 in the pro-apoptotic response to PDT in murine leukemia P388 cells. A primary route for detoxification of cellular H2O2 involves the peroxisomal enzyme catalase. Inhibition of catalase activity by 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole led to an increased apoptotic response. PDT-induced apoptosis was impaired by addition of an exogenous recombinant catalase analog (CAT-skl) that was specifically designed to enter cells and more efficiently localize in peroxisomes. A similar effect was observed upon addition of 2,2'-bipyridine, a reagent that can chelate Fe+2, a co-factor in the Fenton reaction that results in the conversion of H2O2 to *OH. These results provide evidence that formation of H2O2 during irradiation of photosensitized cells contributes to PDT efficacy.","['Price, Michael', 'Terlecky, Stanley R', 'Kessel, David']","['Price M', 'Terlecky SR', 'Kessel D']","['Cancer Biology Program, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,PMC2783742,2009/08/08 09:00,2010/01/30 06:00,['2009/08/08 09:00'],"['2009/08/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['PHP589 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-1097.2009.00589.x [doi]']",ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 2009 Nov-Dec;85(6):1491-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-1097.2009.00589.x.,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oxidants)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'ZF80H5GXUF (Amitrole)']",IM,"['Amitrole/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oxidants/*pharmacology', 'Peroxidases/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Photochemotherapy']",,,"['CA 23378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA023378-28/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 GM058905/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA023378-29/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA023378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM058905-11/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS141205'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Emerging treatments may prolong life; however, these result in additional monetary costs. Accurate estimation of their economic impact requires reliable estimates on preferences for health states. The purpose was to estimate preference weights from the general population in four developed countries for standardized health states experienced by persons with CML. METHODS: Time trade-off preferences with a 10-year time horizon were elicited for CML-related health states using an interviewer-administered survey from convenience samples in Canada (n=103), the United States (n=74), the UK (n=97), and Australia (n=79). Standardized descriptions of seven CML-related health states (characterizing chronic, accelerated and blast phases, each with responding and nonresponding state, and adverse events of treatment) were derived in consultation with oncologists. Generalized linear models were used to estimate whether utilities, adjusted for age and sex, differed by country. RESULTS: The mean age of the sample (n=357) was 45 years and 46% were male. Mean unadjusted preference values of CML-related health states ranged from 0.84 for ""Chronic phase responding to treatment"" to 0.21 for ""Blast phase, not responding to treatment."" For each phase, preferences were lower for the nonresponding state. After adjustment for age and sex, considerable variability was observed in mean preference values between countries. CONCLUSION: These data quantify the deteriorating impact of CML disease progression and the impact of nonresponse to treatment. The study results add to evidence from other disease areas that systematic differences exist in preference values between countries.","['Szabo, Shelagh M', 'Levy, Adrian R', 'Davis, Catherine', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Szabo SM', 'Levy AR', 'Davis C', 'Holyoake TL', 'Cortes J']","['Oxford Outcomes Ltd, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090729,United States,Value Health,Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research,100883818,,2009/08/08 09:00,2010/09/09 06:00,['2009/08/08 09:00'],"['2009/08/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S1098-3015(10)60401-9 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00573.x [doi]']",ppublish,Value Health. 2010 Jan-Feb;13(1):103-11. doi: 10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00573.x.

METHODS: A retrospective review of medical records of 64 patients who underwent orchiectomy between January 1982 and December 2005 was carried out. All of them were managed by surveillance for stage I seminoma. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 123.8 months. Of the 64 patients, seven developed relapse. Four relapses occurred within the first year after orchiectomy, but three occurred over 4 years after orchiectomy. The actuarial relapse-free rates at 5, 10, and 15 years were 92.1%, 90.0%, and 86.0%, respectively. All patients received salvage chemotherapy at relapse. Four of these seven patients were alive without evidence of disease. One patient died of seminoma and one was alive with this disease. The remaining one patient died of leukemia without secondary relapse of seminoma. T classification was a statistically significant (P = 0.028) risk factor for relapse on univariate analysis. In T1 patients, relapse-free rates at 5, 10, and 15 years were all 97.1%, whereas in T2/T3 patients the corresponding relapse-free rates were 86.4%, 82.1%, and 71.8%, respectively.

Late relapse should be considered during surveillance.","['Yoshida, Takahiro', 'Kakimoto, Ken-ichi', 'Takezawa, Kentaro', 'Arai, Yasuyuki', 'Ono, Yutaka', 'Meguro, Norio', 'Kinouchi, Toshiaki', 'Nishimura, Kazuo', 'Usami, Michiyuki']","['Yoshida T', 'Kakimoto K', 'Takezawa K', 'Arai Y', 'Ono Y', 'Meguro N', 'Kinouchi T', 'Nishimura K', 'Usami M']","['Department of Urology, Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular diseases, Osaka City, Osaka, Japan. takahiro-y@sannet.ne.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090729,Australia,Int J Urol,International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association,9440237,,2009/08/08 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/08 09:00'],"['2009/08/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['IJU2355 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1442-2042.2009.02355.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Urol. 2009 Sep;16(9):756-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1442-2042.2009.02355.x.

The role of the UPR during leukemogenesis is unknown so far. Here, we studied the induction of mediators of the UPR in leukaemic cells of AML patients. Increased expression of the spliced variant of the X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1s) was detected in 17.4% (16 of 92) of AML patients. Consistent with activated UPR, this group also had increased expression of ER-resident chaperones such as the 78 kD glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) and of calreticulin. Conditional expression of calreticulin in leukaemic U937 cells was found to increase calreticulin binding to the CEBPA mRNA thereby efficiently blocking translation of the myeloid key transcription factor CEBPA and ultimately affecting myeloid differentiation. Consequently, leukaemic cells from AML patients with activated UPR and thus increased calreticulin levels showed in fact suppressed CEBPA protein expression. We identified two functional ER stress response elements (ERSE) in the calreticulin promoter. The presence of NFY and ATF6, as well as an intact binding site for YY1 within these ERSE motifs were essential for mediating sensitivity to ER stress and activation of calreticulin. Thus, we propose a model of the UPR being activated in a considerable subset of AML patients through induction of calreticulin along the ATF6 pathway, thereby ultimately suppressing CEBPA translation and contributing to the block in myeloid differentiation.","['Schardt, Julian A', 'Eyholzer, Marianne', 'Timchenko, Nikolai A', 'Mueller, Beatrice U', 'Pabst, Thomas']","['Schardt JA', 'Eyholzer M', 'Timchenko NA', 'Mueller BU', 'Pabst T']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital Bern and University of Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090731,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,PMC3829017,2009/08/08 09:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2009/08/08 09:00'],"['2009/08/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['JCMM870 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00870.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2010 Jun;14(6B):1509-19. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00870.x.

Other than known targets of the FGFR1 kinase itself, few specific targets of ZNF198-FGFR1 have been identified. Using a genetically engineered HEK 293 cell system, we have identified proteins that are specifically phosphorylated in the presence of the fusion kinase using anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation and MS. Compared with 293 cells expressing exongenous wild type FGFR1, ZNF198-FGFR1 is associated with phosphorylation of several proteins including SSBP2, ABL, FLJ14235, CALM and TRIM4 proteins. The specificity of the phosphorylation events in the SSBP2 and ABL proteins, which have previously been implicated in leukemogenesis, was further confirmed independently using immunoprecipitation with protein-specific antibodies and Western blotting. The MS analysis also identified the phosphorylation events in the ZNF198 moiety in the chimeric protein that might be related to its function.

A potential approach would be interrupting the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis using the selective CXCR4 antagonist Plerixafor (previously AMD3100), as this axis has been reported to provide survival-enhancing effects to myeloid progenitor cells. By efficient CXCR4 blocking in the CXCR4(+)/BCR-ABL(+) cell line BV-173, plerixafor (1-100 muM) significantly inhibits SDF-1alpha-mediated chemotaxis and cell migration toward the murine stroma cell line FBMD-1. Furthermore, plerixafor also significantly (10-100 muM) increased the detachment rate of SDF-1-mediated/VCAM-1-associated cell adherence under shear stress. Using a stroma-dependent coculture assay, plerixafor sensitized BCR-ABL(+) cells toward tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Because the level of cell killing nearly reached that of samples cultured without stroma, a cell-cell interaction disruption seems to improve the efficacy of BCR-ABL-targeting drugs. In addition, we could show that exposure of BCR-ABL(+) cells to Imatinib or Nilotinib induced an increase in surface CXCR4 expression. Our data suggest that for BCR-ABL(+) leukemia, the selective blocking of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis by plerixafor is a potential mechanism to overcome the protective effect of the bone marrow environment, thereby increasing the therapeutic potency of anti-BCR-ABL drugs and the therapeutic window.","['Dillmann, Falk', 'Veldwijk, Marlon R', 'Laufs, Stephanie', 'Sperandio, Markus', 'Calandra, Gary', 'Wenz, Frederik', 'Zeller, Jens', 'Fruehauf, Stephan']","['Dillmann F', 'Veldwijk MR', 'Laufs S', 'Sperandio M', 'Calandra G', 'Wenz F', 'Zeller J', 'Fruehauf S']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2009/08/07 09:00,2010/03/30 06:00,['2009/08/07 09:00'],"['2009/08/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['913562434 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190903150847 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Oct;50(10):1676-86. doi: 10.1080/10428190903150847.,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Cyclams)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'S915P5499N (plerixafor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Benzylamines', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cyclams', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics', 'Stromal Cells/cytology']",,,,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Oct;50(10):1564-5.

SKP2 and P27kip1 affect the proceeding and prognosis of leukemia through regulating the proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation of leukemia cells. In this study, we explored the mechanism of reversing of HL-60/A drug resistance through SKP2 down-regulation. HL-60/A cells were nucleofected by Amaxa Nucleofector System with SKP2 siRNA. The gene and protein expression levels of Skp2, P27kip1, and multi-drug resistance associated protein (MRP) were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. The cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. The 50% inhibitory concentration value was calculated using cytotoxic analysis according to the death rate of these two kinds of cells under different concentrations of chemotherapeutics to compare the sensitivity of the cells. HL-60/A cells showed multi-drug resistance phenotype characteristic by cross-resistance to adriamycin, daunorubicin, and arabinosylcytosine, due to the expression of MRP. We found that the expression of SKP2 was higher in HL-60/A cells than in HL-60 cells, but the expression of P27kip1 was lower. The expression of SKP2 in HL-60/A cells nucleofected by SKP2 siRNA was down-regulated whereas the protein level of P27kip1 was up-regulated. Compared with the MRP expression level in the control group (nucleofected by control siRNA), the mRNA and protein expression levels of MRP in HL-60/A cells nucleofected by SKP2 siRNA were lower, and the latter cells were more sensitive to adriamycin, daunorubicin, and arabinosylcytosine.

To explain this, we postulated that activation/cleavage of CC releases C3a and C5a anaphylatoxins that differently regulate mobilization. Accordingly, C3a, by enhancing responsiveness of HSPCs to decreasing concentrations of stromal-derived growth factor-1 (SDF-1) in BM, prevents mobilization and promotes their BM retention. Therefore, in this study, we focused on the mobilization-enhancing role of C5a. We found that C5a receptor (C5aR) is not expressed on the surface of HSPCs, and that C5a-mediated promobilization effects are mediated by stimulation of granulocytes. Overall, our data support the following model. First C5aR(+) granulocytes are chemoattracted by plasma C5 cleavage fragments, being the first wave of cells leaving BM. This facilitates a subsequent egress of HSPCs. In the next step, after leaving BM, granulocytes undergo degranulation in response to plasma C5a and secrete some cationic peptides (cathelicidin, beta-defensin) that, as shown here for the first time, highly enhance the responsiveness of HSPCs to plasma SDF-1 gradient. In conclusion, our data reveal the underappreciated central role of innate immunity in mobilization, in which C5 cleavage fragments through granulocytes orchestrate this process.","['Lee, H M', 'Wu, W', 'Wysoczynski, M', 'Liu, R', 'Zuba-Surma, E K', 'Kucia, M', 'Ratajczak, J', 'Ratajczak, M Z']","['Lee HM', 'Wu W', 'Wysoczynski M', 'Liu R', 'Zuba-Surma EK', 'Kucia M', 'Ratajczak J', 'Ratajczak MZ']","['Stem Cell Biology Program at the James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090806,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC2777742,2009/08/07 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/07 09:00'],"['2009/08/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009158 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.158 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Nov;23(11):2052-62. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.158.

The accumulation of CLL-cells is primarily caused by defective apoptosis; however, a higher proliferative capacity has also been found to correlate with poorer prognostic factors. Proliferating CLL-cells are confined to specialized structures called pseudofollicles, which contain CLL-cells, T-lymphocytes, and stromal cells. We established an in vitro model for pseudofollicles to characterize the behavior of CLL-cells in relation to clinical courses with different outcomes. Only CLL-cells from progressive clinical cases were inducible to proliferate by a combination of soluble CD40L/IL-2/IL-10 in co-culture with stromal cells. Proliferating CLL-cells showed a higher and more extensive expression of antigens, which are important in T-B-cell interactions such as CD40, MHC II, and adhesion molecules. IL-4 increased interferon regulatory factor-4 expression and induced a specific immunophenotype, which may imply plasmacytic differentiation. Furthermore, it was shown that co-cultured stromal cells protected CLL-cells from apoptosis. CLL-cells from clinically indolent cases had a far worse survival rate in medium than the cells from poor prognostic cases. Thus, we can assume that not only a different resistance to apoptosis, but also proliferation contributes to the progression of CLL resulting in bone marrow failure with thrombocytopenia and anemia.","['Plander, M', 'Seegers, S', 'Ugocsai, P', 'Diermeier-Daucher, S', 'Ivanyi, J', 'Schmitz, G', 'Hofstadter, F', 'Schwarz, S', 'Orso, E', 'Knuchel, R', 'Brockhoff, G']","['Plander M', 'Seegers S', 'Ugocsai P', 'Diermeier-Daucher S', 'Ivanyi J', 'Schmitz G', 'Hofstadter F', 'Schwarz S', 'Orso E', 'Knuchel R', 'Brockhoff G']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090806,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2009/08/07 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/07 09:00'],"['2009/08/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009145 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.145 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Nov;23(11):2118-28. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.145.

Little is known about their pathogenesis and their cellular origin, and morphological and immunophenotypical overlap exists between ALK(-) ALCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). We conducted gene expression profiling of microdissected lymphoma cells of five ALK(+) and four ALK(-) systemic ALCL, seven cALCL and sixteen cHL, and of eight subsets of normal T and NK cells. The analysis supports a derivation of ALCL from activated T cells, but the lymphoma cells acquired a gene expression pattern hampering an assignment to a CD4(+), CD8(+) or CD30(+) T-cell origin. Indeed, ALCL display a down-modulation of many T-cell characteristic molecules. All ALCL types show significant expression of NFkappaB target genes and upregulation of genes involved in oncogenesis (e.g. EZH2). Surprisingly, few genes are differentially expressed between systemic and cALCL despite their different clinical behaviour, and between ALK(-) ALCL and cHL despite their different cellular origin. ALK(+) ALCL are characterized by expression of genes regulated by pathways constitutively activated by ALK.

Microarray-based gene-expression profiling (GEP) is a powerful tool to globally analyze these changes to study cancer biology and clinical behavior. Despite overwhelming genomic chaos in multiple myeloma (MM), expression patterns within tumor samples are remarkably stable and reproducible. Unique expression patterns associated with recurrent chromosomal translocations and ploidy changes defined molecular classes with differing clinical features and outcomes. Combined molecular techniques also dissected two distinct, reproducible forms of hyperdiploid disease and have molecularly defined MM with high risk for poor clinical outcome. GEP is now used to risk-stratify patients with newly diagnosed MM. Groups with high-risk features are evident in all GEP-defined MM classes, and GEP studies of serial samples showed that risk increases over time, with relapsed disease showing dramatic GEP shifts toward a signature of poor outcomes. This suggests a common mechanism of disease evolution and potentially reflects preferential expansion of therapy-resistant cells. Correlating GEP-defined disease class and risk with outcomes of therapeutic regimens reveals class-specific benefits for individual agents, as well as mechanistic insights into drug sensitivity and resistance.

The molecular mechanisms associated with leukemic cell infiltration are poorly understood. We have used mouse models of ATL to investigate the role of chemokines in this process. Transfer of splenic lymphomatous cells from transgenic to SCID mice reproduces a leukemia and lymphoma that is histologically identical to human disease. It could be shown that lymphomatous cells exhibit specific chemotactic activity in response to stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha). Lymphomatous cells exhibited surface expression of CXCR4, the specific receptor of SDF-1alpha. AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist, was found to inhibit both SDF-1alpha-induced migration and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2. Investigation of cultured cells from human ATL patients revealed identical findings. Using the SCID mouse model, it could be demonstrated that AMD3100 inhibited infiltration of lymphomatous cells into liver and lung tissues in vivo. These results demonstrate the involvement of the SDF-1alpha/CXCR4 interaction as one mechanism of leukemic cell migration and this may provide a novel target as part of combination therapy for ATL.","['Kawaguchi, Akira', 'Orba, Yasuko', 'Kimura, Takashi', 'Iha, Hidekatsu', 'Ogata, Masao', 'Tsuji, Takahiro', 'Ainai, Akira', 'Sata, Tetsutaro', 'Okamoto, Takashi', 'Hall, William W', 'Sawa, Hirofumi', 'Hasegawa, Hideki']","['Kawaguchi A', 'Orba Y', 'Kimura T', 'Iha H', 'Ogata M', 'Tsuji T', 'Ainai A', 'Sata T', 'Okamoto T', 'Hall WW', 'Sawa H', 'Hasegawa H']","['Department of Molecular Pathobiology, Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090805,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/08/07 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/07 09:00'],"['2009/08/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36834-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-11-189308 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Oct 1;114(14):2961-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-11-189308.

Congenital ALL was characterized by a higher white blood cell count and a strong trend for higher incidence of MLL rearrangements and CD10-negative B-lineage ALL compared with older infants. Induction failure rate was 13% and not significantly different from that in older infants (7%, P = .14), but relapse rate was significantly higher in congenital ALL patients (2-year cumulative incidence [SE] was 60.0 [9.3] vs 34.2 [2.3], P < .001). Two-year event-free survival and survival of congenital ALL patients treated with this protocol was 20% (SE 9.1%). Early death in complete remission and treatment delays resulting from toxicity were not different. The survival of 17% after last follow-up, combined with a toxicity profile comparable with that in older infants, justifies treating congenital ALL with curative intent. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as no. NCT 00015873, and at www.controlled-trials.com as no.

METHODS: We used massively parallel DNA sequencing to obtain a very high level of coverage (approximately 98%) of a primary, cytogenetically normal, de novo genome for AML with minimal maturation (AML-M1) and a matched normal skin genome. RESULTS: We identified 12 acquired (somatic) mutations within the coding sequences of genes and 52 somatic point mutations in conserved or regulatory portions of the genome. All mutations appeared to be heterozygous and present in nearly all cells in the tumor sample. Four of the 64 mutations occurred in at least 1 additional AML sample in 188 samples that were tested. Mutations in NRAS and NPM1 had been identified previously in patients with AML, but two other mutations had not been identified. One of these mutations, in the IDH1 gene, was present in 15 of 187 additional AML genomes tested and was strongly associated with normal cytogenetic status; it was present in 13 of 80 cytogenetically normal samples (16%). The other was a nongenic mutation in a genomic region with regulatory potential and conservation in higher mammals; we detected it in one additional AML tumor. The AML genome that we sequenced contains approximately 750 point mutations, of which only a small fraction are likely to be relevant to pathogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: By comparing the sequences of tumor and skin genomes of a patient with AML-M1, we have identified recurring mutations that may be relevant for pathogenesis.","['Mardis, Elaine R', 'Ding, Li', 'Dooling, David J', 'Larson, David E', 'McLellan, Michael D', 'Chen, Ken', 'Koboldt, Daniel C', 'Fulton, Robert S', 'Delehaunty, Kim D', 'McGrath, Sean D', 'Fulton, Lucinda A', 'Locke, Devin P', 'Magrini, Vincent J', 'Abbott, Rachel M', 'Vickery, Tammi L', 'Reed, Jerry S', 'Robinson, Jody S', 'Wylie, Todd', 'Smith, Scott M', 'Carmichael, Lynn', 'Eldred, James M', 'Harris, Christopher C', 'Walker, Jason', 'Peck, Joshua B', 'Du, Feiyu', 'Dukes, Adam F', 'Sanderson, Gabriel E', 'Brummett, Anthony M', 'Clark, Eric', 'McMichael, Joshua F', 'Meyer, Rick J', 'Schindler, Jonathan K', 'Pohl, Craig S', 'Wallis, John W', 'Shi, Xiaoqi', 'Lin, Ling', 'Schmidt, Heather', 'Tang, Yuzhu', 'Haipek, Carrie', 'Wiechert, Madeline E', 'Ivy, Jolynda V', 'Kalicki, Joelle', 'Elliott, Glendoria', 'Ries, Rhonda E', 'Payton, Jacqueline E', 'Westervelt, Peter', 'Tomasson, Michael H', 'Watson, Mark A', 'Baty, Jack', 'Heath, Sharon', 'Shannon, William D', 'Nagarajan, Rakesh', 'Link, Daniel C', 'Walter, Matthew J', 'Graubert, Timothy A', 'DiPersio, John F', 'Wilson, Richard K', 'Ley, Timothy J']","['Mardis ER', 'Ding L', 'Dooling DJ', 'Larson DE', 'McLellan MD', 'Chen K', 'Koboldt DC', 'Fulton RS', 'Delehaunty KD', 'McGrath SD', 'Fulton LA', 'Locke DP', 'Magrini VJ', 'Abbott RM', 'Vickery TL', 'Reed JS', 'Robinson JS', 'Wylie T', 'Smith SM', 'Carmichael L', 'Eldred JM', 'Harris CC', 'Walker J', 'Peck JB', 'Du F', 'Dukes AF', 'Sanderson GE', 'Brummett AM', 'Clark E', 'McMichael JF', 'Meyer RJ', 'Schindler JK', 'Pohl CS', 'Wallis JW', 'Shi X', 'Lin L', 'Schmidt H', 'Tang Y', 'Haipek C', 'Wiechert ME', 'Ivy JV', 'Kalicki J', 'Elliott G', 'Ries RE', 'Payton JE', 'Westervelt P', 'Tomasson MH', 'Watson MA', 'Baty J', 'Heath S', 'Shannon WD', 'Nagarajan R', 'Link DC', 'Walter MJ', 'Graubert TA', 'DiPersio JF', 'Wilson RK', 'Ley TJ']","['Department of Genetics, Washington University, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090805,United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,PMC3201812,2009/08/07 09:00,2009/09/22 06:00,['2009/08/07 09:00'],"['2009/08/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['NEJMoa0903840 [pii]', '10.1056/NEJMoa0903840 [doi]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2009 Sep 10;361(11):1058-66. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa0903840.

AS1411 binds to nucleolin, a protein that is overexpressed in the cytoplasm and on the plasma membrane of some tumor cells compared with normal cells. Studies were performed to determine whether cell surface nucleolin is a receptor for AS1411 in the acute myeloid leukemia cell line MV4-11. Biotinylation of MV4-11 cell surface proteins followed by immunoblotting of the biotinylated proteins showed that full-length (106 kDa) and truncated forms of nucleolin were present on the cell surface. In contrast, K-562 cells, which are 4-fold less sensitive than MV4-11 cells to AS1411, showed no full-length nucleolin and lesser amounts of the truncated forms of nucleolin on the cell surface. Incubation of MV4-11 cells with [(32)P]AS1411 and immunoprecipitation of the plasma membrane fraction with anti-nucleolin antibody demonstrated the presence of [(32)P]AS1411-nucleolin complexes. Anti-nucleolin antibody inhibited binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-AS1411 to plasma membrane nucleolin 56 +/- 10% SE (P < 0.01) compared with cells incubated with FITC-AS1411 only. Cellular uptake of [(32)P]AS1411 into MV4-11 cells was blocked by a 20-fold excess of unlabeled AS1411 but not by a 20-fold excess of the biologically inactive oligonucleotide CRO-26. Uptake was approximately 3-fold faster into MV4-11 cells than into K-562 cells. Partial knockdown of plasma membrane and cytosolic nucleolin in MCF-7 cells resulted in a 3-fold decrease in AS1411 uptake. These results provide evidence that plasma membrane nucleolin is a functional receptor for AS1411 in MV4-11 cells.","['Soundararajan, Sridharan', 'Wang, Li', 'Sridharan, Vijayalakshmi', 'Chen, Weiwei', 'Courtenay-Luck, Nigel', 'Jones, David', 'Spicer, Eleanor K', 'Fernandes, Daniel J']","['Soundararajan S', 'Wang L', 'Sridharan V', 'Chen W', 'Courtenay-Luck N', 'Jones D', 'Spicer EK', 'Fernandes DJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090805,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,PMC2774992,2009/08/07 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/07 09:00'],"['2009/08/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.109.055947 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.109.055947 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2009 Nov;76(5):984-91. doi: 10.1124/mol.109.055947.

This disease features a robust immune response including the oligoclonal expansion of CD8+ CTLs specific for the viral oncoprotein Tax. The key pathogenic process resulting in the proliferation of CTLs and the presentation of Tax peptide remains uncharacterized. We have investigated the role of APCs, particularly DCs, in priming of the anti-Tax CTL response under in vitro and in vivo conditions. We investigated two routes (direct vs. indirect) of Tax presentation using live virus, infected primary CD4+/CD25+ T cells, and the CD4+ T cell line (C8166, a HTLV-1-mutated line that only expresses Tax). Our results indicated that DCs are capable of priming a pronounced Tax-specific CTL response in cell cultures consisting of naive PBLs as well as in HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice (line HHD II). DCs were able to direct the presentation of Tax successfully through infected T cells, live virus, and cell-free Tax. These observations were comparable with those made with a known stimulant of DC maturation, a combination of CD40L and IFN-gamma. Our studies clearly establish a role for this important immune cell component in HTLV-1 immuno/neuropathogenesis and suggest that modulation of DC functions could be an important tool for therapeutic interventions.","['Manuel, Sharron L', 'Schell, Todd D', 'Acheampong, Edward', 'Rahman, Saifur', 'Khan, Zafar K', 'Jain, Pooja']","['Manuel SL', 'Schell TD', 'Acheampong E', 'Rahman S', 'Khan ZK', 'Jain P']","['Institute for Molecular Medicine and Infectious Disease, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19102, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090805,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,PMC2774881,2009/08/07 09:00,2010/01/07 06:00,['2009/08/07 09:00'],"['2009/08/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['jlb.0309172 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0309172 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2009 Nov;86(5):1205-16. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0309172.

While varicella-zoster virus is also insensitive to interferon, ORF61p, its ICP0 ortholog, failed to degrade PML. A recombinant virus with each coding region of the gene for ICP0 replaced with sequences encoding ORF61p was constructed. This virus was compared to an ICP0 deletion mutant and wild-type HSV. The recombinant degraded only Sp100 and not PML and grew to higher titers than its ICP0 null parental virus, but it was sensitive to interferon, like the virus from which it was derived.

In the presence of other underlying medical conditions, this localized infection may spread systemically, serving as a source of fever and bacteremia in neutropenic males. Two rare cases of balanoposthitis caused by a clonally related Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate co-producing the SPM-1 metallo-beta-lactamase and the novel 16S rRNA methylase RmtD are described. Four multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa isolates were successively recovered from glans/foreskin swabs and urine cultures from two uncircumcised pediatric patients, one with Burkitt's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and one with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Clinically, preputial colonization by MDR P. aeruginosa evolved to severe balanoposthitis with glans/foreskin lesions as a source of fever. Combination therapy of ciprofloxacin and/or aztreonam (systemic) plus polymyxin B (topical) was effective once reversion of the neutropenic condition was achieved. Although P. aeruginosa remains an unusual cause of balanoposthitis, these cases should alert the physician to the potential pathogenicity of this bacterium.

We studied the efficiency of PpIX synthetized from ALA on ROS generation, in the Vincristine resistant (LBR-V160), Doxorubicin resistant (LBR-D160) and sensitive (LBR-) murine leukemia cell lines. Cells were incubated 4 hr with 1 mM ALA and then irradiated during different times with fluorescent light. One hour later, production of ROS was analyzed by flow cytometry using different fluorescent probes: Hydroethidine (HE) for superoxide anion, 2',7' Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) for hydrogen peroxide; mitochondrial damage was examined with 3,3' Dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6). We found that superoxide anion production in the three cell lines increased with irradiation time whereas no peroxide hydrogen was detected. Mitochondrial damage also increased in an irradiation time dependent manner, being higher in the Vincristine resistant line. Previous studies have demonstrated that apoptotic cell death increased with irradiation time, which is consistent with these results, indicating that ROS are critical in ALA-PDT efficiency to kill malignant cells.","['Diez, B', 'Cordo Russo, R', 'Teijo, M J', 'Hajos, S', 'Batlle, A', 'Fukuda, H']","['Diez B', 'Cordo Russo R', 'Teijo MJ', 'Hajos S', 'Batlle A', 'Fukuda H']","['Centro de Investigaciones sobre Porfirinas y Porfirias (CIPYP), CONICET, Hospital de Clinicas, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090701,France,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand),"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",9216789,,2009/08/07 09:00,2013/12/25 06:00,['2009/08/07 09:00'],"['2009/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [medline]']",['15 [pii]'],epublish,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand). 2009 Jul 1;55(2):15-9.,"['0 (Protoporphyrins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)', 'C2K325S808 (protoporphyrin IX)']",IM,"['Aminolevulinic Acid/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Photochemotherapy', 'Protoporphyrins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated 5,10,15,20-tetrakis (N-methyl-4-pyridyl)-21H,23H-porphyrin (TMPyP) as a potential cancer treatment. Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that TMPyP was localized in the nuclei, whereas 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-derived protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) was localized diffusely in the cytoplasm of human leukemia (HL-60) cells. In HL-60 cells under UVA irradiation, TMPyP effectively induced apoptosis. Moreover, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine, an oxidative product of 2'-deoxyguanosine, was accumulated in the DNA of cells treated with photoirradiated TMPyP, whereas only small amounts were observed in ALA-treated cells in the presence of UVA light. TMPyP and UVA caused extensive damage at every guanine residue in DNA fragments obtained from the human p53 tumor suppressor gene and the c-Ha-ras-1 proto-oncogene, whereas PPIX induced little DNA damage under these conditions. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy using a singlet oxygen (1O2) probe and D2O showed that photoexcited TMPyP generated 1O2. These results suggest that photoexcited TMPyP reacts with oxygen to generate 1O2, which in turn, oxidizes guanine residues. Taken together, the results demonstrated that TMPyP was localized in the nucleus where it was photosensitized to induce DNA damage, suggesting that TMPyP may have clinical utility as a nucleus-targeted PDT.","['Tada-Oikawa, Saeko', 'Oikawa, Shinji', 'Hirayama, Junya', 'Hirakawa, Kazutaka', 'Kawanishi, Shosuke']","['Tada-Oikawa S', 'Oikawa S', 'Hirayama J', 'Hirakawa K', 'Kawanishi S']","['Department of Environmental and Molecular Medicine, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,,2009/08/07 09:00,2010/01/30 06:00,['2009/08/07 09:00'],"['2009/08/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['PHP600 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-1097.2009.00600.x [doi]']",ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 2009 Nov-Dec;85(6):1391-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-1097.2009.00600.x.,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Porphyrins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '17778-80-2 (Singlet Oxygen)', '38673-65-3 (tetra(4-N-methylpyridyl)porphine)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Damage/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Molecular Structure', 'Photosensitizing Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Porphyrins/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Singlet Oxygen/*metabolism', '*Ultraviolet Rays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Total saponins of Panax ginseng (TSPG) is one of the main effective components of ginseng. Our previous studies have shown that TSPG could promote the production of normal blood cells and inhibition of the leukemia cell proliferation. However, whether ginseng can induce the differentiation of leukemia cells is still unclear. This study was to examine the effect of TSPG or the combination of erythropoietin (EPO) and TSPG on the erythroid differentiation of K562 cells, and their corresponding mechanisms regarding erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) expression. Under light and electron microscopes, the TSPG- or TSPG + EPO-treated K562 cells showed a tendency to undergo erythroid differentiation; early and intermediate erythroblast-like cells were observed. Hemoglobin and HIR2 expressions were significantly increased. As determined by Western blotting analysis, the EPOR protein level in the K562 cytoplasmic membrane was significantly decreased after TSPG treatment, while its cytoplasm level increased in a dose-dependent manner. However, the total cellular EPOR level was unchanged. These results indicate that TSPG-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells may be accompanied by the internalization of EPOR. Thus, our study suggests that treatment with a combination of TSPG and EPO may induce erythroid differentiation of K562 cells at least in part through induction of EPOR internalization.","['Zuo, Guowei', 'Guan, Tao', 'Chen, Dilong', 'Li, Chunli', 'Jiang, Rong', 'Luo, Chunyan', 'Hu, Xiaoshu', 'Wang, Yaping', 'Wang, Jianwei']","['Zuo G', 'Guan T', 'Chen D', 'Li C', 'Jiang R', 'Luo C', 'Hu X', 'Wang Y', 'Wang J']","['Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Singapore,Am J Chin Med,The American journal of Chinese medicine,7901431,,2009/08/06 09:00,2009/11/17 06:00,['2009/08/06 09:00'],"['2009/08/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0192415X09007211 [pii]', '10.1142/S0192415X09007211 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Chin Med. 2009;37(4):747-57. doi: 10.1142/S0192415X09007211.,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Saponins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endocytosis/*drug effects', 'Erythroblasts/drug effects/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'K562 Cells', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Panax/*chemistry', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*metabolism', 'Saponins/*pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We infected C8166 cells with a recombinant adenovirus carrying both vpr and GFP genes (rAd-vpr), as well as the vector control virus (rAd-vector). G(2)/M phase cell cycle arrest was observed in the rAd-vpr infected cells. Typical characteristics of apoptosis were detected in rAd-vpr infected cells, including sub-diploid peak exhibition in DNA content assay, the Hoechst 33342 accumulation, apoptotic body formation, mitochondrial membrane potential and plasma membrane integrity loss. The proteomic assay revealed apoptosis related protein changes, exhibiting the regulation of caspase-3 activity indicator proteins (vimentin and Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 2), mitochondrial protein (prohibitin) and other regulatory proteins. In addition, the up-regulation of anti-inflammatory redox protein, thioredoxin, was identified in the rAd-vpr infected group. Further supporting these findings, the increase of caspase 3&7 activity in the rAd-vpr infected group was observed.

These results suggest an important role of extracellular NM23-H1 in the malignant progression of leukemia and a potential therapeutic target for these malignancies.","['Okabe-Kado, Junko', 'Kasukabe, Takashi', 'Honma, Yoshio', 'Kobayashi, Hirofumi', 'Maseki, Nobuo', 'Kaneko, Yasuhiko']","['Okabe-Kado J', 'Kasukabe T', 'Honma Y', 'Kobayashi H', 'Maseki N', 'Kaneko Y']","['Research Institute for Clinical Oncology, Saitama Cancer Center, Komuro 818, Ina-machi, Kita-adachi-gun, Saitama, 362-0806, Japan. jkado@cancer-c.pref.saitama.jp.', 'Research Institute for Clinical Oncology, Saitama Cancer Center, Komuro 818, Ina-machi, Kita-adachi-gun, Saitama, 362-0806, Japan.', 'Department of Life Science, Shimane University Faculty of Medicine, Shimane, Japan.', 'Hematology Clinic, Saitama Cancer Center Hospital, Saitama, Japan.', 'Hematology Clinic, Saitama Cancer Center Hospital, Saitama, Japan.', 'Research Institute for Clinical Oncology, Saitama Cancer Center, Komuro 818, Ina-machi, Kita-adachi-gun, Saitama, 362-0806, Japan.', 'Hematology Clinic, Saitama Cancer Center Hospital, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090805,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,2009/08/06 09:00,2009/11/13 06:00,['2009/08/06 09:00'],"['2009/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/14 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-009-0384-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-009-0384-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2009 Sep;90(2):143-152. doi: 10.1007/s12185-009-0384-4.

Thus, a prospective, longitudinal study was undertaken to characterize clinical features, associated risk factors, and behavior of OM in a cohort of AL patients starting CT. METHODS: Prospective and longitudinal study. A cohort of patients, older than 15 years of age with AL, scheduled to receive CT, was followed from March 2006 to October 2007. At baseline and three times per week, for 21 days, patients had an oral examination performed using the Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale (OMAS); also, oral pain and difficulty to swallow were recorded using a visual analog scale. Weekly, salivary flow measurements (Schirmer's test modified version) were done. RESULTS: A cohort of 29 AL patients was followed for a median time of 21 (range, 14-53) days; 12 (41.4%) developed OM, with a mean OMAS score of 0.181 (SD +/- 0.56) and a mean peak OMAS score of 1.8 (SD +/- 0.56). The OM onset mean time was 9.8 (range, 2-20, SD +/- 6.09) days, with a mean duration of 7 (range, 3-14, SD +/- 4.15) days. OM was significantly correlated with salivary flow [rs = 0.420 (P = 0.0051)], oral pain [rs = 0.47 (P < 0.0001)], ability to swallow [rs = 0.36 (P = 0.0001)], and type of food intake [rs = 0.38 (P < 0.0001)]. CONCLUSIONS: OM is a frequent and early side effect of CT closely correlated with oral pain, difficulty to swallow, and impairment in food intake.","['Ramirez-Amador, Velia', 'Anaya-Saavedra, Gabriela', 'Crespo-Solis, Erick', 'Camacho, Esther Irigoyen', 'Gonzalez-Ramirez, Imelda', 'Ponce-de-Leon, Sergio']","['Ramirez-Amador V', 'Anaya-Saavedra G', 'Crespo-Solis E', 'Camacho EI', 'Gonzalez-Ramirez I', 'Ponce-de-Leon S']","['Health Care Department, Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana-Xochimilco, 04960 Mexico City, Mexico. rava1863@correo.xoc.uam.mx']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090806,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,2009/08/06 09:00,2010/07/09 06:00,['2009/08/06 09:00'],"['2009/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-009-0708-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2010 May;18(5):639-46. doi: 10.1007/s00520-009-0708-1.

Phosphorylation of STAT6 occurred immediately after the entry of T. gondii and only by live tachyzoites, not by killed or soluble extract. It was impeded by Janus kinase (JAK) 3 inhibitor and small interfering RNA (siRNA) of STAT6. It induced expression of IL-4 responsive genes such as IL-4R, CD40, and CD23. It also mediated expression of two large clusters of C-C chemokine ligands (CCLs) and serine protease inhibitors (SERPINs) in microarray of T. gondii-infected macrophages. CCL1, 2, 8, 13, and 22 and SPINT2, SERPINB3, B4, and B13 were increased by the infection and inhibited by the treatment of JAK3 inhibitor and siRNA-mediated STAT6 silencing, which suggested the expression was governed by STAT6 activation. Secreting those CCLs, T. gondii-infected macrophages may attract more monocytes and Th2 cells of CCR3 and CCR4 to enrich the Th2 environment nearby the infected macrophages, and induced SERPINs may participate in protection from intracellular damages produced by activated lysosomal enzymes and in the inhibition of caspase activity to block the apoptosis. This suggests that T. gondii exploits cytokine cross-regulation through STAT6 activation to obviate various toxoplasmacidal reactions by interferon-gamma.","['Ahn, Hye-Jin', 'Kim, Ji Yeon', 'Ryu, Kyung-Ju', 'Nam, Ho-Woo']","['Ahn HJ', 'Kim JY', 'Ryu KJ', 'Nam HW']","['Department of Parasitology and the Catholic Institute of Parasitic Diseases, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 137-701, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090805,Germany,Parasitol Res,Parasitology research,8703571,,2009/08/06 09:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/08/06 09:00'],"['2009/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00436-009-1577-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Parasitol Res. 2009 Oct;105(5):1445-53. doi: 10.1007/s00436-009-1577-8.

In 53 children with de novo AML, the level of XIAP expression was determined by using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and was analyzed with respect to the clinical characteristics at diagnosis and treatment outcomes. As a result, the XIAP expression was found to be higher in patients with extramedullary disease than in those without (P=0.014). In addition, XIAP overexpression (>or=median expression) was associated with an unfavorable day 7 response to induction chemotherapy and also associated with a worse 3-yr relapsefree survival rate (52.7+/-20.9% vs. 85.9+/-14.8%, P=0.014). Multivariate analyses revealed that XIAP overexpression was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for relapse-free survival (hazard ratio, 6.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.48-25.74; P=0.013).

An elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level has been reported to be an adverse predictor of outcome in stem cell transplantation (SCT) for acute myeloid leukemia. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the records of 24 patients who received allogeneic SCT from an HLA-matched sibling donor for acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia. Univariate analysis showed that two factors (the serum CsA level at the third week after SCT and the LDH level at the third week after SCT) were significantly associated with the incidence of aGVHD among several variables (age, sex, stem cell source, cell dose, C-reactive protein, absolute lymphocyte count, conditioning regimens, and time to engraftment). A higher serum level of CsA and lower serum LDH level at the third week after SCT were associated with a lower incidence of aGVHD (P=0.015, 0.030). In multivariate analysis, the serum CsA level (hazard ratio [HR], 0.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.022-0.652, P=0.0014) and serum LDH level (HR, 6.59; 95% CI, 1.197-36.316, P=0.030) at the third week after SCT were found to be independent factors that were significantly associated with the development of aGVHD.

The pathogenesis of HAM/TSP is known to be as follows: HTLV-1-infected T cells trigger a hyperimmune response leading to neuroinflammation. However, the HTLV-1-infected T cell subset that plays a major role in the accelerated immune response has not yet been identified. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we demonstrate that CD4(+)CD25(+)CCR4(+) T cells are the predominant viral reservoir, and their levels are increased in HAM/TSP patients. While CCR4 is known to be selectively expressed on T helper type 2 (Th2), Th17, and regulatory T (Treg) cells in healthy individuals, we demonstrate that IFN-gamma production is extraordinarily increased and IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, and Foxp3 expression is decreased in the CD4(+)CD25(+)CCR4(+) T cells of HAM/TSP patients as compared to those in healthy individuals, and the alteration in function is specific to this cell subtype. Notably, the frequency of IFN-gamma-producing CD4(+)CD25(+)CCR4(+)Foxp3(-) T cells is dramatically increased in HAM/TSP patients, and this was found to be correlated with disease activity and severity. CONCLUSIONS: We have defined a unique T cell subset--IFN-gamma(+)CCR4(+)CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells--that is abnormally increased and functionally altered in this retrovirus-associated inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system.","['Yamano, Yoshihisa', 'Araya, Natsumi', 'Sato, Tomoo', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Azakami, Kazuko', 'Hasegawa, Daisuke', 'Izumi, Toshihiko', 'Fujita, Hidetoshi', 'Aratani, Satoko', 'Yagishita, Naoko', 'Fujii, Ryoji', 'Nishioka, Kusuki', 'Jacobson, Steven', 'Nakajima, Toshihiro']","['Yamano Y', 'Araya N', 'Sato T', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Azakami K', 'Hasegawa D', 'Izumi T', 'Fujita H', 'Aratani S', 'Yagishita N', 'Fujii R', 'Nishioka K', 'Jacobson S', 'Nakajima T']","['Department of Molecular Medical Science, Institute of Medical Science, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Japan. yyamano@marianna-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090805,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC2715877,2009/08/06 09:00,2010/01/20 06:00,['2009/08/06 09:00'],"['2009/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0006517 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Aug 5;4(8):e6517. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0006517.,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['CD4 Antigens/*analysis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-10/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*analysis', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis', 'Nervous System Diseases/immunology/*virology', 'Receptors, CCR4/*analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/*virology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because disease aggressiveness is correlated with CD26 expression in several T-cell malignancies, we decided to investigate the invasiveness of cells expressing different levels of CD26. METHODS: To assess CD26 involvement in cell invasion, we performed in vitro invasion assays with human T cell lines expressing different levels of CD26. These included the parental CD26-positive T-lymphoblast cell line HSB-2 and clones infected with a retrovirus expressing siRNA vectors that either targeted CD26 or encoded a missense siRNA, and the parental CD26-negative T-leukaemia cell line Jurkat and clones expressing CD26. CD26 expression in these cell lines was evaluated by flow cytometry and western immunoblotting. CXCR4 expression, phosphorylation of signalling kinases, and MMP-9 secretion were also evaluated by western immunoblotting, whereas MMP-9 activity and the effect of kinase and CD45 inhibitors on activity were measured by zymography of conditioned media. RESULTS: The presence of CD26 enhanced stromal-cell-derived factor-1-alpha (SDF-1-alpha)-mediated invasion of T cell lines. This process was regulated in part by the PI-3K and MEK1 pathways, as indicated by increased phosphorylation of p44/42 MAP kinase and Akt in the presence of SDF-1-alpha and the effect of their respective inhibitors on MMP-9 secretion and in vitro invasion. In addition, CD26-associated enhancement of SDF-1-alpha-induced invasion was decreased when CD45 was inhibited. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the expression of CD26 in T cell lines leads to increased SDF-1-alpha-mediated invasion in an in vitro system and that this is controlled in part by the PI-3K and MEK1 pathways. The data also suggest that CD26 enhancement of invasion may be mediated by CD45, however, more studies are required to confirm this involvement.","['Havre, P A', 'Abe, M', 'Urasaki, Y', 'Ohnuma, K', 'Morimoto, C', 'Dang, N H']","['Havre PA', 'Abe M', 'Urasaki Y', 'Ohnuma K', 'Morimoto C', 'Dang NH']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090804,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,PMC2743358,2009/08/06 09:00,2009/09/24 06:00,['2009/08/06 09:00'],"['2009/08/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['6605236 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6605236 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2009 Sep 15;101(6):983-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605236.

We conclude that preleukemic myeloid neoplasia can be associated with an interstitial pneumonitis with histopathologic features that are distinguishable from both leukemic infiltration and ""usual"" nonspecific interstitial pneumonia.","['Farris, Alton B 3rd', 'Hasserjian, Robert P', 'Zukerberg, Lawrence R', 'Amrein, Philip C', 'Greene, Reginald E', 'Mark, Eugene J', 'Kradin, Richard L']","['Farris AB 3rd', 'Hasserjian RP', 'Zukerberg LR', 'Amrein PC', 'Greene RE', 'Mark EJ', 'Kradin RL']","['Pathology Service, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,,2009/08/06 09:00,2010/03/03 06:00,['2009/08/06 09:00'],"['2009/08/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAS.0b013e3181adbaf9 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2009 Oct;33(10):1485-93. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0b013e3181adbaf9.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lung Diseases, Interstitial/*etiology/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*complications/immunology/*pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MICA expression is limited to gut epithelium and may play a role in triggering acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). A total of 236 recipients of unrelated donor transplantation were studied. Donor-recipient human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match was 10/10 human leukocyte antigen (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1) in 73% and MICA mismatch in 8.4%. Because of physical vicinity of the loci, MICA mismatch was significantly associated with mismatch at HLA-B and HLA-C.

Gene expression profiles can predict disease and prognosis, but most widely used microarray analytical methods yield lengthy gene candidate lists that are difficult to apply clinically. Consequently, we applied a probabilistic method called Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to a large CML microarray dataset. BMA, a supervised method, considers multiple genes simultaneously and identifies small gene sets. BMA identified 6 genes (NOB1, DDX47, IGSF2, LTB4R, SCARB1, and SLC25A3) that discriminated chronic phase (CP) from blast crisis (BC) CML. In CML, phase labels divide disease progression into discrete states. BMA, however, produces posterior probabilities between 0 and 1 and predicts patients in ""intermediate"" stages. In validation studies of 88 patients, the 6-gene signature discriminated early CP from late CP, accelerated phase, and BC. This distinction between early and late CP is not possible with current classifications, which are based on known duration of disease. BMA is a powerful tool for developing diagnostic tests from microarray data. Because therapeutic outcomes are so closely tied to disease phase, these probabilities can be used to determine a risk-based treatment strategy at diagnosis.","['Oehler, Vivian G', 'Yeung, Ka Yee', 'Choi, Yongjae E', 'Bumgarner, Roger E', 'Raftery, Adrian E', 'Radich, Jerald P']","['Oehler VG', 'Yeung KY', 'Choi YE', 'Bumgarner RE', 'Raftery AE', 'Radich JP']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. voehler@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090804,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC2759651,2009/08/06 09:00,2009/10/29 06:00,['2009/08/06 09:00'],"['2009/08/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36805-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-03-212969 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Oct 8;114(15):3292-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-03-212969.

We investigated on CLL cells from 30 untreated patients the consequence of B-cell receptor (BCR) triggering on the membrane expression of CXCR4 and CD62L, two surface molecules involved in trafficking and exit of B-lymphocytes from lymph nodes. BCR stimulation promoted a strictly simultaneous down-regulation of CXCR4 and CD62L membrane expression to a variable extent. The variable BCR-dependent decrease of the two proteins was strikingly representative of the heterogeneous capacity of the CLL cells to respond to BCR engagement in a given patient. Functionally, cells down-regulating CXCR4 and CD62L in response to BCR engagement displayed a reduction in both migration toward CXCL12 and adhesion to lymphatic endothelial cells. Remarkably, the ability of CLL cells to respond to BCR ligation was correlated with unfavorable prognostic markers and short progression-free survival. In conclusion, BCR signaling promotes decrease of CXCR4 and CD62L membrane expression in progressive cases only. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that BCR-mediated signaling pathways favor accumulation of a proliferative pool within the lymph nodes of progressive CLL cases.","['Vlad, Amalia', 'Deglesne, Pierre-Antoine', 'Letestu, Remi', 'Saint-Georges, Stephane', 'Chevallier, Nathalie', 'Baran-Marszak, Fanny', 'Varin-Blank, Nadine', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista, Florence', 'Ledoux, Dominique']","['Vlad A', 'Deglesne PA', 'Letestu R', 'Saint-Georges S', 'Chevallier N', 'Baran-Marszak F', 'Varin-Blank N', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista F', 'Ledoux D']","[""UMR U978 Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale-Universite Paris 13, UFR SMBH and AP-HP, Service d'hematologie biologique, Hopital Avicenne, Bobigny, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090804,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,2009/08/06 09:00,2009/09/16 06:00,['2009/08/06 09:00'],"['2009/08/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-4750 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4750 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Aug 15;69(16):6387-95. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4750.

Although ABL kinase inhibitors have shown great promise in the treatment of CML, the persistence of residual disease and the occurrence of resistance have prompted investigations into the molecular effectors of BCR-ABL. Here, we show that BCR-ABL stimulates the proteasome-dependent degradation of members of the forkhead family of tumor suppressors in vitro, in an in vivo animal model, and in samples from patients with BCR-ABL-positive CML or ALL. As several downstream mediators of BCR-ABL are regulated by the proteasome degradation pathway, we also show that inhibition of this pathway, using bortezomib, causes regression of CML-like disease. Bortezomib treatment led to inhibition of BCR-ABL-induced suppression of FoxO proteins and their proapoptotic targets, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and BIM, thereby providing novel insights into the molecular effects of proteasome inhibitor therapy. We additionally show sensitivity of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL T315I cells to bortezomib. Our data delineate the involvement of FoxO proteins in BCR-ABL-induced evasion of apoptosis and provide evidence that bortezomib is a candidate therapeutic in the treatment of BCR-ABL-induced leukemia.","['Jagani, Zainab', 'Song, Keli', 'Kutok, Jeffery L', 'Dewar, M Rajan', 'Melet, Armelle', 'Santos, Tanya', 'Grassian, Alexandra', 'Ghaffari, Saghi', 'Wu, Catherine', 'Yeckes-Rodin, Heather', 'Ren, Ruibao', 'Miller, Kenneth', 'Khosravi-Far, Roya']","['Jagani Z', 'Song K', 'Kutok JL', 'Dewar MR', 'Melet A', 'Santos T', 'Grassian A', 'Ghaffari S', 'Wu C', 'Yeckes-Rodin H', 'Ren R', 'Miller K', 'Khosravi-Far R']","['Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090804,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,PMC2763358,2009/08/06 09:00,2009/09/16 06:00,['2009/08/06 09:00'],"['2009/08/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-0605 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0605 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Aug 15;69(16):6546-55. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0605.

This review addresses putative factors determining MEN1-associated tissue-selective tumorigenesis. Menin's interaction with mixed-lineage leukemia protein-containing histone methyl transferase (MLL-HMT) complex mediates tissue-selective tumor-suppressing and tumor-promoting effects of menin, and as such could be decisive for the predisposition of individual tissues to MEN1-associated tumorigenesis. In tissues in which menin acts as a tumor suppressor, tumorigenesis could depend on the inability of such tissues to adequately compensate for MEN1 gene loss, whereas the variable clinical presentation of MEN1 in individual patients could be a reflection of additional epigenetic factors and/or modifier genes. Further research on this topic may facilitate development of novel therapeutic strategies that could prevent or delay the onset of MEN1-associated tumorigenesis.","['Gracanin, Ana', 'Dreijerink, Koen M A', 'van der Luijt, Rob B', 'Lips, Cornelis J M', 'Hoppener, Jo W M']","['Gracanin A', 'Dreijerink KM', 'van der Luijt RB', 'Lips CJ', 'Hoppener JW']","['Department of Clinical Sciences of Companion Animals, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090804,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,2009/08/06 09:00,2009/09/16 06:00,['2009/08/06 09:00'],"['2009/08/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-0678 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0678 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Aug 15;69(16):6371-4. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0678.

T-cell immune suppression is also associated with HTLV-I infection. Mechanisms of diverse immune dysregulation in HTLV-I infection are obscure. Here, we investigated a potential link between autoimmunity and immune suppression in HTLV-I infection. G14, an IL-2-dependent HTLV-I-negative CD4(+)CD8(+) T-cell line previously established from an HTLV-I-infected rat, constantly proliferated and produced IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma production by G14 cells was dependent on interactions between CD4 and MHC-II, suggesting that G14 cells recognized self-antigens presented by MHC-II on themselves. To examine immune response to G14 cells, we inoculated G14 cells into syngeneic naive rats. Interestingly, T-cells isolated from these rats vigorously proliferated when stimulated with G14-Tax cells that stably expressed HTLV-I Tax, but not with G14 cells. G14-Tax-mediated T-cell proliferation was abrogated by antibodies to CD80 and CD86 that were up-regulated in G14-Tax cells. T-cells propagated by repetitive G14-Tax cell stimulations in culture with IL-2 expressed CD4, CD25 and cytolytic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), produced abundant amounts of IL-10 and IFN-gamma in response to G14 cells and suppressed growth of G14 cells mainly through supernatant-mediated mechanisms. Similar IL-10- and IFN-gamma-producing CD4(+)CD25(+)CTLA-4(+) T-cells were predominantly induced in culture of splenocytes from HTLV-I-infected rats following stimulation with G14-Tax cells. These results implied that expression of Tax in the otherwise low immunogenic autoreactive T-cells induced IL-10- and IFN-gamma-producing T-cell responses with regulatory effects against the autoreactive cells. Our findings provide new insights into the complex immune conditions underlying HTLV-I-associated diseases.","['Takatsuka, Natsuko', 'Hasegawa, Atsuhiko', 'Takamori, Ayako', 'Shimizu, Yukiko', 'Kato, Hirotomo', 'Ohashi, Takashi', 'Amagasa, Teruo', 'Masuda, Takao', 'Kannagi, Mari']","['Takatsuka N', 'Hasegawa A', 'Takamori A', 'Shimizu Y', 'Kato H', 'Ohashi T', 'Amagasa T', 'Masuda T', 'Kannagi M']","['Department of Immunotherapeutics, Graduate School, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090804,England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,,2009/08/06 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/06 09:00'],"['2009/08/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['dxp074 [pii]', '10.1093/intimm/dxp074 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 2009 Sep;21(9):1089-100. doi: 10.1093/intimm/dxp074.

The inhibitory role of HLA-G1 on NK cell cytotoxicity is well characterized; however, that of the HLA-G5 isoform secreted by tumor is poorly understood. Our results indicate that the HLA-G5 isoform secreted by M8 melanoma cells is able to protect them from natural killer leukemia cell line (NKL) cytotoxicity. Analysis of NKL/M8-HLA-G5 conjugates by confocal microscopy demonstrates that the inhibition of NKL cytotoxic activity resulted from an impairment of NKL actin reorganization and perforin granules polarization toward M8-HLA-G5 target cell. This study also indicates that HLA-G5 soluble isoform remains evenly distributed in the cytoplasm of M8-HLA-G5 conjugated to NKL cells, suggesting that HLA-G5 does not require to polarize toward effector cell to induce efficient inhibition.

However, current studies that focus on individual GO terms have limited analytical power, because the complex structure of GO introduces strong dependencies among the terms, and some genes that are annotated to a GO term cannot be found by statistically significant enrichment. RESULTS: We proposed a method for enriching clustered GO terms based on semantic similarity, namely cluster enrichment analysis based on GO (CeaGO), to extend the individual term analysis method. Using an Affymetrix HGU95aV2 chip dataset with simulated gene sets, we illustrated that CeaGO was sensitive enough to detect moderate expression changes. When compared to parent-based individual term analysis methods, the results showed that CeaGO may provide more accurate differentiation of gene expression results.

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK) may up-regulate the transcriptional activity of some oncogenes in cancerous cells. The aim of this study was to verify the expression pattern of hnRNPK in patients with CML, to explore its association with BCR-ABL and some abnormal signaling pathways, and to discover how hnRNPK contributes to the progression of CML. In this study, 15 patients with CML (9 in chronic phase and 6 in blast crisis) were enrolled in this study. The expression of hnRNPK in mononuclear cells (MNCs) from these patients was detected by Western blotting and fluorimeter-based quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. hnRNPK expression levels in K562 cell line and imatinib-resistant leukemic cell line K562R, following the treatments with the inhibitors of Ras-MAPK (PD98059), PI3K/AKT (LY294002), JAK/STAT (AG490) signaling pathways, and BCR-ABL [imatinib mesylate (IM)], were also determined. As the results, the overexpression of hnRNPK in protein and gene patterns was detected in MNCs from patients with CML comparing with normal donors. Especially, its level in MNCs from patients with CML-blast crisis was significantly higher than in CML-chronic phase cells (P < 0.01). After the treatment with PD98059 (at 4, 8, 24, and 48 h) and IM (at 48 h), the expression levels of hnRNPK in leukemic cell lines were decreased, comparing with DMSO control group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the results suggest that the overexpression of hnRNPK, which is regulated by BCR-ABL and Ras-MAPK signaling pathways, may promote the progression of CML. hnRNPK would be a potential marker and therapeutic target of CML evolution.","['Du, Qingfeng', 'Wang, Li', 'Zhu, Hongqian', 'Zhang, Song', 'Xu, Lulu', 'Zheng, Weiyang', 'Liu, Xiaoli']","['Du Q', 'Wang L', 'Zhu H', 'Zhang S', 'Xu L', 'Zheng W', 'Liu X']","[""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, 510515, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090804,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,,2009/08/05 09:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2009/08/05 09:00'],"['2009/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-009-9267-z [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2010 Sep;27(3):673-9. doi: 10.1007/s12032-009-9267-z.

Achieving an early response with imatinib is protective against treatment failure; second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs; for example, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib), however, have proven to be efficacious at restoring cytogenetic responses in patients who require subsequent therapy. Response duration, however, is yet to be established and a considerable proportion of patients fail to achieve a clinically meaningful response. A third generation of TKIs is currently undergoing clinical testing for use in patients who fail imatinib and a second-generation TKI. Most of these agents are multikinase inhibitors with activity against a wide variety of BCR-ABL1 mutations, including the highly resistant T315I. The use of second-generation TKIs in the frontline setting seems to provide higher rates of early response compared with imatinib. If these results are confirmed in randomized studies, nilotinib and dasatinib could replace imatinib as standard frontline therapy in CML. Despite the activity of all of the above mentioned agents, curing CML will ultimately depend on the development of agents capable of vanquishing BCR-ABL1-positive CML stem cells. Efforts aimed at achieving this goal are ongoing.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Kantarjian H', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090804,England,Nat Rev Clin Oncol,Nature reviews.

The primary objective of this analysis was to dichotomize patients into prognostic groups using factors predictive of survival and to investigate whether induction chemotherapy was beneficial in either prognostic group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess the impact on survival of the following factors: (>or=70 versus <70 years), gender, race, stage (IIIB versus IIIA), hemoglobin (hgb) (<13 versus >or=13 g/dl), performance status (PS) (1 versus 0), weight loss (>or=5% versus <5%), treatment arm, and the interaction between weight loss and hgb. RESULTS: Factors predictive of decreased survival were weight loss >or=5%, age >or=70 years, PS of 1, and hgb <13 g/dl (p < 0.05). Patients were classified as having >or=2 poor prognostic factors (n = 165) or <or=1 factor (n = 166). The hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival for the patients with >or=2 versus patients with <or=1 was 1.88 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.49-2.37; p = <0.0001]; median survival times observed were 9 (95% CI, 8-11) and 18 (95% CI, 16-24) months, respectively. There was no significant difference in survival between treatment arms in patients with >or=2 factors (HR = 0.86, 95% CI, 0.63-1.17; p = 0.34) or <or=1 factor (HR = 0.97, 95% CI, 0.70-1.35; p = 0.87).

In patients with primary refractory leukaemia the indication is controversially discussed. Similarly patients with relapse and advanced disease have a poor prognosis with chemotherapy, but also with transplantation. Finally more elderly patients with comorbidities seek help from transplantation, most of them in advanced and otherwise refractory disease. The results are reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS: The role of alloimmunity in the control of leukaemia has been defined and pretransplant conditioning treatment could be reduced to less intensive protocols. Graft-versus-leukaemia reactions have been demonstrated with the transfusion of donor lymphocytes. Using nonmyeloablative regimens allogeneic stem cell transplantation could be offered to elderly patients, the majority of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. The use of antibodies and radio-immuno-therapy has improved the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. Cord blood transplants have shown improved results with double transplants. The superiority of maternal donors indicates a role of the donor's immune repertoire.

These observations raise several important issues regarding the pathobiology of adult leukemic stem cells, the ability of adults to tolerate intensive treatment and the best postremission approach. RECENT FINDINGS: Progress has been made in understanding the biology of adult ALL and its prognostic significance. The follow-up of minimal residual disease status, adopting protocols from childhood ALL to young adults and use of targeted therapy may improve long-term survival. Transplantation for standard-risk ALL in first remission proved to be beneficial in a large cooperative group study. Limited data on the use of alternative donor transplantation as well as reduced intensity protocols are now available for consideration in specific groups of patients. SUMMARY: Data suggest that the best antileukemic treatment should be applied in first remission and type of treatment should be based on individualized risk stratification, while incorporating recent information on alternative donors and reduced intensity approaches to transplantation.","['Zuckerman, Tsila', 'Rowe, Jacob M']","['Zuckerman T', 'Rowe JM']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Medical Center & Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel. t_zuckerman@rambam.health.gov.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,2009/08/05 09:00,2010/01/07 06:00,['2009/08/05 09:00'],"['2009/08/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283309a40 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2009 Nov;16(6):453-9. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283309a40.,,IM,"['Adult', 'Drug Delivery Systems', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Risk Factors']",,,,,59,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Untangling the role of either the protein or its domain in cell fate has been a decade long task which has just received new impetus from developmental biologists. PML appears to play a central role in regulating stem and progenitor cell fate in tissues as diverse as blood, brain and breast. Our studies have uncovered an inverse relationship between the activity of certain Stat transcription factors and PML in controlling normal mammary gland development and the regulation of lineage commitment. Genetic loss of Pml delays differentiation of the milk-producing alveolar cells and disrupts ductal development, defects which may result from a skewing of the progenitor population to favor estrogen receptor positive cells (ERalpha). This is of considerable interest as ERalpha cells are non-cycling in normal breast while promiscuous cell cycle entry is a feature of these cells in breast cancer. These data begin to show the cell types and tissues that are most sensitive to PML dose and provide new perspectives for the regulation of mammary gland development and tumorigenesis.","['Li, Wenjing', 'Rich, Tina', 'Watson, Christine J']","['Li W', 'Rich T', 'Watson CJ']","['University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090908,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,,2009/08/05 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/05 09:00'],"['2009/08/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['9462 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.8.17.9462 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2009 Sep 1;8(17):2711-7. doi: 10.4161/cc.8.17.9462.

The MDS and secondary AML patients displayed more extensive aberrant DNA methylation involving thousands of genes than did the normal CD34(+) bone marrow cells or de novo AML blasts. Aberrant methylation in MDS and secondary AML tended to affect particular chromosomal regions, occurred more frequently in Alu-poor genes, and included prominent involvement of genes involved in the WNT and MAPK signaling pathways.

However, the impact of a cancer environment on normal tissue stem and progenitor cells has not been thoroughly investigated. We began to address this important issue by studying the kinetics and functions of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in mice with Notch1-induced leukemia. Although hematopoiesis was progressively suppressed during leukemia development, the leukemic environment imposed distinct effects on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, thereby resulting in different outcomes. The normal hematopoietic stem cells in leukemic mice were kept in a more quiescent state but remained highly functional on transplantation to nonleukemic recipients. In contrast, the normal hematopoietic progenitor cells in leukemic mice demonstrated accelerated proliferation and exhaustion. Subsequent analyses on multiple cell-cycle parameters and known regulators (such as p21, p27, and p18) further support this paradigm. Therefore, our current study provides definitive evidence and plausible underlying mechanisms for hematopoietic disruption but reversible inhibition of normal hematopoietic stem cells in a leukemic environment. It may also have important implications for cancer prevention and treatment in general.","['Hu, Xiaoxia', 'Shen, Hongmei', 'Tian, Chen', 'Yu, Hui', 'Zheng, Guoguang', 'XuFeng, Richard', 'Ju, Zhenyu', 'Xu, Jing', 'Wang, Jianmin', 'Cheng, Tao']","['Hu X', 'Shen H', 'Tian C', 'Yu H', 'Zheng G', 'XuFeng R', 'Ju Z', 'Xu J', 'Wang J', 'Cheng T']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090803,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC2773494,2009/08/05 09:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/08/05 09:00'],"['2009/08/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39014-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-06-227843 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Oct 29;114(18):3783-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-06-227843.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase II, open-label, multicenter study was conducted with single-agent clofarabine in pediatric patients with refractory or relapsed AML. Clofarabine was administered intravenously over 2 hours at the pediatric maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of 52 mg/m(2) daily for 5 consecutive days. Cycles were repeated every 2 to 6 weeks. Responses determined by an independent response review panel. RESULTS: The 42 patients treated on the study had a median age of 13 years (range, 2 to 22 years) and had received a median number of two (range, one to five) prior regimens. The response rate was 26% and included one complete response without platelet recovery and 10 partial responses. The median duration of response was 20 weeks (range, 2 to >or= 156 weeks). Six of 28 patients who were refractory to the immediately preceding therapy achieved response. Thirteen patients (31%), including seven responders, proceeded to hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) after treatment with clofarabine and survived between 24 to >or= 160 weeks. Five patients (12%) remain alive post-transplantation at >or= 63, >or= 71, >or= 86, >or= 114, and >or= 130 weeks. The most common grade 3 or greater adverse events without regard to causality were febrile neutropenia, catheter-related infection, epistaxis, hypotension, nausea, and fever. Transient elevation of liver enzymes and hypokalemia occurred frequently. Five patients died within 30 days of clofarabine administration secondary to progressive disease, and another five died as a result of an adverse event. CONCLUSION: Clofarabine is active in pediatric patients with multiply relapsed or refractory AML. Responses allowed several refractory patients to proceed to HSCT.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (<or= 75 years of age) were randomly assigned to receive bendamustine 100 mg/m(2)/d intravenously on days 1 to 2, or chlorambucil 0.8 mg/kg (Broca's normal weight) orally on days 1 and 15; treatment cycles were repeated every 4 weeks for a maximum of six cycles. The response to treatment was assessed according to National Cancer Institute Working Group criteria, and the final determination of response was made by a blinded independent review committee. RESULTS: A total of 319 patients were randomly assigned (162 bendamustine, 157 chlorambucil). Complete or partial responses were achieved in 110 (68%) of 162 bendamustine-treated and 48 (31%) of 157 chlorambucil-treated patients (P < .0001). More patients showed complete responses with bendamustine than with chlorambucil (31% v 2%). Median progression-free survival was 21.6 months with bendamustine and 8.3 months with chlorambucil (P < .0001). Bendamustine was also associated with an improvement in duration of remission, compared with chlorambucil (median, 21.8 v 8.0 months). Hematologic National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria grade 3 to 4 adverse events were more common with bendamustine than with chlorambucil (occurring in 40% v 19% of patients).

Unrelated donor (UD) transplants have more complications. We wanted to examine if RIC is a valid treatment option using UD in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1999 and 2005, 401 patients with AML were treated with RIC and 1,154 received myeloablative conditioning (MAC), using UD and reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Registry. Patients < and > or = 50 years of age were analyzed separately. RESULTS: Patients receiving RIC were older, received transplants more recently, received peripheral blood stem cells more frequently, and were treated with total-body irradiation less often. In multivariable analysis, in patients younger than 50 years of age, nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was similar using RIC (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; P = .41), relapse was increased (HR, 1.46; P = .02) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) was the same (HR, 0.88; P = .28), as compared with MAC. In patients > or = 50 years of age, NRM was decreased in the RIC group (HR, 0.64; P = .04), relapse probability was not significantly different (HR, 1.34; P = .16) and LFS was similar (HR, 1.04; P = .79) compared with MAC. CONCLUSION RIC-UD transplants are associated with higher relapse in AML patients younger than 50 years of age and decreased NRM in those > or = 50 years compared with MAC-UD. LFS was similar after both conditioning regimens, regardless of age. Therefore, RIC-UD extend the use of allotransplants for elderly patients and strategies that decrease relapse should be considered mainly in younger patients with AML.","['Ringden, Olle', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Olsson, Richard', 'Basara, Nadezda', 'Finke, Juergen', 'Schwerdtfeger, Rainer', 'Eder, Matthias', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Gorin, Norbert-Claude', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Rocha, Vanderson']","['Ringden O', 'Labopin M', 'Ehninger G', 'Niederwieser D', 'Olsson R', 'Basara N', 'Finke J', 'Schwerdtfeger R', 'Eder M', 'Bunjes D', 'Gorin NC', 'Mohty M', 'Rocha V']","['Karolinska University Hospital, Centre for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, SE-141 86 Stockholm, Sweden. olle.ringden@labmed.ki.se']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090803,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,2009/08/05 09:00,2009/11/05 06:00,['2009/08/05 09:00'],"['2009/08/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.20.9692 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.20.9692 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Sep 20;27(27):4570-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.20.9692.

We report on a phase I/II trial of the XIAP antisense oligonucleotide AEG35156 in combination with reinduction chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients with rapidly relapsed or refractory AML were treated with escalating doses of AEG35156 (12 to 250 mg/m(2)) as an intravenous solution over 2 hours and 32 patients were treated with the highest planned dose of 350 mg/m(2) in combination with idarubicin and high-dose cytarabine reinduction chemotherapy. Correlative studies were conducted to determine the effects of AEG35156 on levels of XIAP mRNA. RESULTS: Knockdown of XIAP mRNA during treatment increased with the dose of the antisense. All patients who received 350 mg/m(2) of AEG35156 had higher than 30% target knockdown with a median maximal knockdown of 90% (range, 48% to 100%). The overall response rate was higher among the patients receiving the highest dose of AEG35156. In this group, 15 (47%) of 32 patients achieved complete response (CR)/CR with incomplete platelet count recovery (CRp) compared with only one (4%) of 24 receiving 12 to 250 mg/m(2) AEG35156. Among the patients receiving 350 mg/m(2) of AEG35156 in combination with chemotherapy, 10 (91%) of 11 who were refractory to a single induction chemotherapy regimen achieved CR/CRp after reinduction with AEG35156 and chemotherapy. AEG35156 was well tolerated save for two cases of peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving multiple doses of AEG35156. CONCLUSION: At the highest dose tested, AEG35156 knocks down its target and appears very effective when combined with chemotherapy in patients with AML refractory to a single induction regimen.","['Schimmer, Aaron D', 'Estey, Elihu H', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Carter, Bing Z', 'Schiller, Gary J', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Altman, Jessica K', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Kassis, Jeannine', 'Hedley, David W', 'Brandwein, Joseph', 'Xu, Wei', 'Mak, Duncan H', 'LaCasse, Eric', 'Jacob, Christine', 'Morris, Stephen J', 'Jolivet, Jacques', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Schimmer AD', 'Estey EH', 'Borthakur G', 'Carter BZ', 'Schiller GJ', 'Tallman MS', 'Altman JK', 'Karp JE', 'Kassis J', 'Hedley DW', 'Brandwein J', 'Xu W', 'Mak DH', 'LaCasse E', 'Jacob C', 'Morris SJ', 'Jolivet J', 'Andreeff M']","['Princess Margaret Hospital, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5G 2M9. aaron.schimmer@utoronto.ca']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090803,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,PMC5073380,2009/08/05 09:00,2009/10/27 06:00,['2009/08/05 09:00'],"['2009/08/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.21.8172 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.21.8172 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Oct 1;27(28):4741-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.21.8172.

In this subanalysis of a phase II study of nilotinib in patients with imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant CML-CP, the occurrence and impact of baseline and newly detectable BCR-ABL mutations were assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Baseline mutation data were assessed in 281 (88%) of 321 patients with CML-CP in the phase II nilotinib registration trial. RESULTS: Among imatinib-resistant patients, the frequency of mutations at baseline was 55%. After 12 months of therapy, major cytogenetic response (MCyR) was achieved in 60%, complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) in 40%, and major molecular response (MMR) in 29% of patients without baseline mutations versus 49% (P = .145), 32% (P = .285), and 22% (P = .366), respectively, of patients with mutations. Responses in patients who harbored mutations with high in vitro sensitivity to nilotinib (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] <or= 150 nM) or mutations with unknown nilotinib sensitivity were equivalent to those responses for patients without mutations (not significant). Patients with mutations that were less sensitive to nilotinib in vitro (IC(50) > 150 nM; Y253H, E255V/K, F359V/C) had less favorable responses, as 13%, 43%, and 9% of patients with each of these mutations, respectively, achieved MCyR; none achieved CCyR. CONCLUSION: For most patients with imatinib resistance and with mutations, nilotinib offers a substantial probability of response. However, mutational status at baseline may influence response. Less sensitive mutations that occurred at three residues defined in this study, as well as the T315I mutation, may be associated with less favorable responses to nilotinib.","['Hughes, Timothy', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Branford, Susan', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Muller, Martin C', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Beppu, Lan', 'Gottardi, Enrico', 'Kim, Dongho', 'Erben, Philipp', 'Shou, Yaping', 'Haque, Ariful', 'Gallagher, Neil', 'Radich, Jerald', 'Hochhaus, Andreas']","['Hughes T', 'Saglio G', 'Branford S', 'Soverini S', 'Kim DW', 'Muller MC', 'Martinelli G', 'Cortes J', 'Beppu L', 'Gottardi E', 'Kim D', 'Erben P', 'Shou Y', 'Haque A', 'Gallagher N', 'Radich J', 'Hochhaus A']","['Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Hanson Center for Cancer Research, Department of Hematology, Adelaide, 5000, Australia.

Most kinase inhibitors target the conserved ATP-binding pocket; therefore specificity is a major concern. Proteomics has previously been used to identify the direct targets of kinase inhibitors upon affinity purification from cellular extracts. Here we introduce a complementary approach to evaluate the effects of kinase inhibitors on the entire cell signaling network. We used triple labeling SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture) to compare cellular phosphorylation levels for control, epidermal growth factor stimulus, and growth factor combined with kinase inhibitors. Of thousands of phosphopeptides, less than 10% had a response pattern indicative of targets of U0126 and SB202190, two widely used MAPK inhibitors. Interestingly, 83% of the growth factor-induced phosphorylation events were affected by either or both inhibitors, showing quantitatively that early signaling processes are predominantly transmitted through the MAPK cascades. In contrast to MAPK inhibitors, dasatinib, a clinical drug directed against BCR-ABL, which is the cause of chronic myelogenous leukemia, affected nearly 1,000 phosphopeptides. In addition to the proximal effects on ABL and its immediate targets, dasatinib broadly affected the downstream MAPK pathways. Pathway mapping of regulated sites implicated a variety of cellular functions, such as chromosome remodeling, RNA splicing, and cytoskeletal organization, some of which have been described in the literature before. Our assay is streamlined and generic and could become a useful tool in kinase drug development.","['Pan, Cuiping', 'Olsen, Jesper V', 'Daub, Henrik', 'Mann, Matthias']","['Pan C', 'Olsen JV', 'Daub H', 'Mann M']","['Department of Proteomics and Signal Transduction, Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry, Am Klopferspitz 18, D-82152 Martinsried near Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090803,United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,PMC2816010,2009/08/05 09:00,2010/02/23 06:00,['2009/08/05 09:00'],"['2009/08/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-9476(20)33923-2 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M900285-MCP200 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2009 Dec;8(12):2796-808. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M900285-MCP200.

To better understand the cause of the marked heterogeneity in therapeutic response and to identify new prognostic markers and therapeutic targets a comprehensive list of the genetic mutations that underlie the pathogenesis of AML is needed. To approach this goal, we examined diagnostic leukemic samples from a cohort of 111 children with de novo AML using single-nucleotide-polymorphism microarrays and candidate gene resequencing. Our data demonstrate that, in contrast to pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), de novo AML is characterized by a very low burden of genomic alterations, with a mean of only 2.38 somatic copy-number alterations per leukemia, and less than 1 nonsynonymous point mutation per leukemia in the 25 genes analyzed. Even more surprising was the observation that 34% of the leukemias lacked any identifiable copy-number alterations, and 28% of the leukemias with recurrent translocations lacked any identifiable sequence or numerical abnormalities. The only exception to the presence of few mutations was acute megakaryocytic leukemias, with the majority of these leukemias being characterized by a high number of copy-number alterations but rare point mutations. Despite the low overall number of lesions across the patient cohort, novel recurring regions of genetic alteration were identified that harbor known, and potential new cancer genes. These data reflect a remarkably low burden of genomic alterations within pediatric de novo AML, which is in stark contrast to most other human malignancies.","['Radtke, Ina', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Ishii, Masami', 'Su, Xiaoping', 'Cheng, Jinjun', 'Ma, Jing', 'Ganti, Ramapriya', 'Cai, Zhongling', 'Goorha, Salil', 'Pounds, Stanley B', 'Cao, Xueyuan', 'Obert, Caroline', 'Armstrong, Jianling', 'Zhang, Jinghui', 'Song, Guangchun', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Shurtleff, Sheila A', 'Downing, James R']","['Radtke I', 'Mullighan CG', 'Ishii M', 'Su X', 'Cheng J', 'Ma J', 'Ganti R', 'Cai Z', 'Goorha S', 'Pounds SB', 'Cao X', 'Obert C', 'Armstrong J', 'Zhang J', 'Song G', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Raimondi SC', 'Shurtleff SA', 'Downing JR']","[""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090727,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC2716382,2009/08/05 09:00,2009/08/27 09:00,['2009/08/05 09:00'],"['2009/08/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/27 09:00 [medline]']","['0903142106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0903142106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Aug 4;106(31):12944-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0903142106.

To complement cytogenetic studies and to identify genes altered in AML genomes, we performed genome-wide copy number analysis with paired normal and tumor DNA obtained from 86 adult patients with de novo AML using 1.85 million feature SNP arrays. Acquired copy number alterations (CNAs) were confirmed using an ultra-dense array comparative genomic hybridization platform. A total of 201 somatic CNAs were found in the 86 AML genomes (mean, 2.34 CNAs per genome), with French-American-British system M6 and M7 genomes containing the most changes (10-29 CNAs per genome). Twenty-four percent of AML patients with normal cytogenetics had CNA, whereas 40% of patients with an abnormal karyotype had additional CNA detected by SNP array, and several CNA regions were recurrent. The mRNA expression levels of 57 genes were significantly altered in 27 of 50 recurrent CNA regions <5 megabases in size. A total of 8 uniparental disomy (UPD) segments were identified in the 86 genomes; 6 of 8 UPD calls occurred in samples with a normal karyotype. Collectively, 34 of 86 AML genomes (40%) contained alterations not found with cytogenetics, and 98% of these regions contained genes. Of 86 genomes, 43 (50%) had no CNA or UPD at this level of resolution. In this study of 86 adult AML genomes, the use of an unbiased high-resolution genomic screen identified many genes not previously implicated in AML that may be relevant for pathogenesis, along with many known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.","['Walter, Matthew J', 'Payton, Jacqueline E', 'Ries, Rhonda E', 'Shannon, William D', 'Deshmukh, Hrishikesh', 'Zhao, Yu', 'Baty, Jack', 'Heath, Sharon', 'Westervelt, Peter', 'Watson, Mark A', 'Tomasson, Michael H', 'Nagarajan, Rakesh', ""O'Gara, Brian P"", 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Selzer, Rebecca R', 'Richmond, Todd A', 'Kitzman, Jacob', 'Geoghegan, Joel', 'Eis, Peggy S', 'Maupin, Rachel', 'Fulton, Robert S', 'McLellan, Michael', 'Wilson, Richard K', 'Mardis, Elaine R', 'Link, Daniel C', 'Graubert, Timothy A', 'DiPersio, John F', 'Ley, Timothy J']","['Walter MJ', 'Payton JE', 'Ries RE', 'Shannon WD', 'Deshmukh H', 'Zhao Y', 'Baty J', 'Heath S', 'Westervelt P', 'Watson MA', 'Tomasson MH', 'Nagarajan R', ""O'Gara BP"", 'Bloomfield CD', 'Mrozek K', 'Selzer RR', 'Richmond TA', 'Kitzman J', 'Geoghegan J', 'Eis PS', 'Maupin R', 'Fulton RS', 'McLellan M', 'Wilson RK', 'Mardis ER', 'Link DC', 'Graubert TA', 'DiPersio JF', 'Ley TJ']","['Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090727,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC2716381,2009/08/05 09:00,2009/08/27 09:00,['2009/08/05 09:00'],"['2009/08/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/27 09:00 [medline]']","['0903091106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0903091106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Aug 4;106(31):12950-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0903091106.

We have used national audit data to understand the differences between theory and practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a web-based tool to collect data on all National Health Service patients in England starting a course of radiotherapy in the week commencing 24 September 2007. We also collected information on cancer site, so that patients could be triaged into the 22 categories used by the National Radiotherapy Advisory Group (NRAG). RESULTS: In England, excluding skin cancer other than melanoma, 2114 patients were prescribed 27,420 fractions during that week. Comparison of the audit data with the NRAG model showed that the shortfall in provision was a mixture of a lack of access (67%) and reduced fractionation (33%). The largest contributions to the overall gap were seen in the treatment of cancers of the breast (6%) (modelled at 15 fractions), head and neck (10%), lung (28%) and prostate (14%), together accounting for 58% of the difference. Others (including sarcoma and unknown primary) accounted for 19% of the difference. Limited access to radiotherapy for patients with stomach and pancreatic cancer contributed 10% and reduced fractionation for oesophageal cancer accounted for 6% of the overall gap. Fewer patients than expected were treated for rectal cancer, but they received 25 fraction regimens rather than short-course preoperative treatment. Patients with leukaemia and cancers of the brain, colon, corpus uteri and ovary received radiotherapy more often than expected, but because they are relatively rare none of these had an overall impact exceeding 1.2% of the gap in provision. CONCLUSIONS: This audit confirms the underprovision of radiotherapy in England and shows that it is largely accounted for by low access rates of 37% rather than the 50% accepted in the literature. In consequence we estimate that 33 881 patients (13.9%) of the 243 748 patients diagnosed with cancer in England during 2006/2007 did not receive the radiotherapy we would have expected. Some of this gap in provision may be accounted for by differences in stage and performance status, which limit treatment options, for example in lung cancer. The NRAG model should be updated to take account of new data from this and other national audits, to ensure that it describes the stage and performance status of English patients and is sensitive to the range of professional opinion about treatment options. This will be essential for long-term planning as cancer incidence increases over the next decade, but it does not weaken the conclusion that there is a substantial current shortfall to be addressed immediately to improve timely access to treatment and thus the outcomes of therapy. As more resource becomes available, it should be possible to consider changing dose fractionation to comply with evidence-based practice and national guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and other bodies without disadvantaging patients by increasing waiting times.","['Williams, M V', 'Drinkwater, K J']","['Williams MV', 'Drinkwater KJ']","[""Oncology Centre, Box 193, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospital NHS Trust, Cambridge, UK. michael.williams@addenbrookes.nhs.uk""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20090803,England,Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol),Clinical oncology (Royal College of Radiologists (Great Britain)),9002902,,2009/08/05 09:00,2010/01/12 06:00,['2009/08/05 09:00'],"['2009/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/16 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0936-6555(09)00196-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clon.2009.07.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol). 2009 Oct;21(8):575-90. doi: 10.1016/j.clon.2009.07.003.

However, the efficiency of those reactions is largely dependent on the molecular properties of currently used reverse transcriptases (RTs). Engineered and natural RT variants with improved thermostability and fidelity of DNA synthesis should be of great utility in the amplification of RNA targets. In this study, we demonstrate that the wild-type (WT) HIV-1 group O (O_WT) RT shows increased thermostability in comparison with Moloney murine leukemia virus RT and a prototypic HIV-1 group M:subtype B (BH10_WT) RT, while rendering higher yields in reverse transcription PCRs that included a cDNA synthesis step performed at a high temperature range (57-69 degrees C). In addition, the O_WT RT showed 2.5-fold increased accuracy in M13 lacZalpha forward mutation assays in comparison with the BH10_WT RT. Unlike the BH10_WT enzyme, O_WT RT showed a very low error rate for frameshifts. Mutational hot spots induced by O_WT RT occurred at nucleotide runs, suggesting a dislocation-mediated mechanism for the generation of base substitutions. In HIV-1 group O RT, substituting Ile75 for Val rendered an enzyme that was 1.9 and 4.7 times more faithful than O_WT RT and BH10_WT RTs, respectively, in forward mutation assays. The mutant RT also showed increased misinsertion and mispair extension fidelity in kinetic assays. However, its mutational spectrum was similar to that obtained with the WT group O polymerase. V75I caused a loss of efficiency of reverse transcription PCR amplifications at 65 and 68 degrees C in comparison with O_WT RT. However, a double mutant devoid of RNase H activity (V75I/E478Q) was found to reverse-transcribe at temperatures as high as 68 degrees C, while maintaining the increased accuracy of the V75I mutant.","['Alvarez, Mar', 'Matamoros, Tania', 'Menendez-Arias, Luis']","['Alvarez M', 'Matamoros T', 'Menendez-Arias L']","['Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas & Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, c/ Nicolas Cabrera 1, Campus de Cantoblanco, 28049 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090803,England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,,2009/08/05 09:00,2009/10/21 06:00,['2009/08/05 09:00'],"['2009/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-2836(09)00971-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2009.07.081 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2009 Oct 2;392(4):872-84. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2009.07.081.

RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the 3% and 5% oxygen treatment groups significantly increased the adhesion, migration and invasion abilities of K562 cells (p<0.05 or <0.01), and up-regulated the protein level of HIF-1alpha and the mRNA levels of HIF-1alpha,VEGF, MMP-9 and MMP-2 (p<0.05 or 0.01). However, there were no significant differences in the above indexes between the 1% oxygen treatment and the control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate hypoxia can enhance the abilities of invasion and metastasis of K562 cells, probably by an up-regulation of HIF-1alpha level and VEGF, MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA expression.","['Nie, Ying-Ming', 'Dai, Bi-Tao']","['Nie YM', 'Dai BT']","[""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,,2009/08/05 09:00,2009/10/07 06:00,['2009/08/05 09:00'],"['2009/08/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/07 06:00 [medline]']",['1008-8830(2009)07-0566-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2009 Jul;11(7):566-70.,"['0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', '*Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Movement', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/genetics', 'K562 Cells', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/genetics', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/genetics', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', '*Neoplasm Invasiveness', '*Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So far the studies on CYP3A5 gene has only been focused on the leukemia cell lines. This study examined the polymorphism of CYP3A5 and tried to find the possible relationship between CYP3A5 gene expression and treatment outcome or prognosis in children with acute leukemia. METHODS: The genotype distribution of CYP3A5-6986A/G gene polymorphism was detected with the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method in 66 children with newly diagnosed acute leukemia (AL) and 22 control individuals. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to examine wt-CYP3A5 and SV1-CYP3A5 mRNA levels in the bone marrow. RESULTS: Three genotypes of CYP3A5-6986A/G polymorphisms were found: CYP3A5*1/*1, CYP3A5*1/*3 and CYP3A5*3/*3. There were significant differences in the wt-CYP3A5 mRNA expression among the AL patients with different genotypes (p<0.05). In patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL), the complete remission (CR) rate in the group with a low expression of wt-CYP3A5 mRNA was significantly higher than that in the group with a high expression (p<0.05). A dynamic monitoring for wt-CYP3A5 mRNA expression was performed in two cases of ALL. The expression increased before ALL relapse compared with that in CR in a patient, while in the other patient, the expression was kept in a low level and the patient remained in CR CONCLUSIONS: wt-CYP3A5 mRNA expression was associated with the treatment outcome and prognosis in children with AL. Dynamic monitoring for wt-CYP3A5 mRNA expression in the bone marrow may be useful in the evaluation of the disease severity in childhood acute leukemia.","['Huang, Zhen', 'Chai, Yi-Huan', 'Cen, Jian-Nong', 'He, Hai-Long', 'Li, Jie']","['Huang Z', 'Chai YH', 'Cen JN', 'He HL', 'Li J']","[""Department of Hematology, Yuying Children's Hospital, Wenzhou Medical College, Wenzhou, Zhejiang 325027, China. icecream2019@sina.com""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,,2009/08/05 09:00,2009/10/07 06:00,['2009/08/05 09:00'],"['2009/08/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/07 06:00 [medline]']",['1008-8830(2009)07-0549-06 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2009 Jul;11(7):549-54.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A5 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its utility in paediatric haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has not been studied. We studied the prognostic value of WT1 expression in peripheral blood prior to HSCT in 36 children with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Samples were obtained 2 weeks pre-transplant to determine the level of WT1 expression. WT1 expression was normalized using K562 cells as a control and a relative value of 0.5 was chosen as the cut-off point between high and low WT1 expression. The median level of pre-transplant WT1 expression in the 36 patients was 0.09 (range 0.0001-11.0), with 11 patients having WT1 >or= 0.5 and 25, WT1 < 0.5. After HSCT, 76% of patients with high pre-transplant WT1 expression relapsed, in contrast to 0% of the patients with low WT1 expression. Those with high WT1 expression had significantly lower 5-year event-free survival (EFS) (18%, 95% CI 0-40%) as compared to those with low WT1 expression (68%, 95% CI 50-86%, P = 0.007). Multivariate analysis showed that pre-transplant WT1 level is the only significant prognostic factor for the difference in EFS. Our finding suggests that elevated WT1 gene expression before HSCT in paediatric AML predicts relapse and poor long-term EFS. A larger prospective study is warranted to compare the value of high WT1 expression and other markers of minimal residue disease in predicting clinical outcomes after HSCT.","['Jacobsohn, David A', 'Tse, William T', 'Chaleff, Stanley', 'Rademaker, Alfred', 'Duerst, Reggie', 'Olszewski, Marie', 'Huang, Wei', 'Chou, Pauline M', 'Kletzel, Morris']","['Jacobsohn DA', 'Tse WT', 'Chaleff S', 'Rademaker A', 'Duerst R', 'Olszewski M', 'Huang W', 'Chou PM', 'Kletzel M']","[""Children's Memorial Hospital, Robert H.

Mammalian cells exposed to CDTs undergo cell type-dependent cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis; however, the cell fate responses to such intoxication are mechanistically incompletely understood. Here we show that both normal and cancer cells (BJ, IMR-90 and WI-38 fibroblasts, HeLa and U2-OS cell lines) that survive the acute phase of intoxication by Haemophilus ducreyi CDT possess the hallmarks of cellular senescence. This characteristic phenotype included persistently activated DNA damage signalling (detected as 53BP1/gammaH2AX(+) foci), enhanced senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity, expansion of promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear compartments and induced expression of several cytokines (especially interleukins IL-6, IL-8 and IL-24), overall features shared by cells undergoing replicative or premature cellular senescence. We conclude that analogous to oncogenic, oxidative and replicative stresses, bacterial intoxication represents another pathophysiological stimulus that induces premature senescence, an intrinsic cellular response that may mechanistically underlie the 'distended' morphology evoked by CDTs. Finally, the activation of the two anticancer barriers, apoptosis and cellular senescence, together with evidence of chromosomal aberrations (micronucleation) reported here, support the emerging genotoxic and potentially oncogenic effects of this group of bacterial toxins, and warrant further investigation of their role(s) in human disease.","['Blazkova, Hana', 'Krejcikova, Katerina', 'Moudry, Pavel', 'Frisan, Teresa', 'Hodny, Zdenek', 'Bartek, Jiri']","['Blazkova H', 'Krejcikova K', 'Moudry P', 'Frisan T', 'Hodny Z', 'Bartek J']","['Department of Genome Integrity, Institute of Molecular Genetics, v.v.i., Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090724,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,PMC3837606,2009/08/05 09:00,2011/07/02 06:00,['2009/08/05 09:00'],"['2009/08/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [medline]']","['JCMM862 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00862.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2010 Jan;14(1-2):357-67. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00862.x.

Complete mutation screening of the CEBPA gene is therefore beneficial and requires fast, precise, and sensitive diagnostic tools. Thus, for routine diagnostics, we developed a screening method using high-resolution melt curve analysis prior to direct sequencing, where only positive samples (according to reference) are further sequenced.

METHODS: We describe the clinical features and course of three Mennonite children who were diagnosed with A-T following the completion of therapy for lymphoid malignancies. RESULTS: Prior to cancer therapy, all had non-progressive atypical neurological abnormalities, with onset by age 30 months, including dysarthria, dyskinesia, hypotonia and/or dystonia, without telangiectasias. Cerebellar ataxia was noted in only one of the children and was mild until his death at age eight years. None had severe infections. All three children were ""cured"" of their lymphoid malignancies, but experienced severe adverse effects from the treatments administered. The two children who received cranial irradiation developed supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the brain, an association not previously described, with fatal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The range of neurological presentations of A-T is broad. Ataxia and telangiectasias may be minimal or absent and the course seemingly non-progressive. The diagnosis of A-T should be considered in all children with neuromotor dysfunction or peripheral neuropathy, particularly those who develop lymphoid malignancies. The consequences of missing the diagnosis may be dire. Radiation therapy and radiomimetic drugs should be avoided in individuals with A-T.","['Yanofsky, Rochelle A', 'Seshia, Sashi S', 'Dawson, Angelika J', 'Stobart, Kent', 'Greenberg, Cheryl R', 'Booth, Frances A', 'Prasad, Chitra', 'Del Bigio, Marc R', 'Wrogemann, Jens J', 'Fike, Francesca', 'Gatti, Richard A']","['Yanofsky RA', 'Seshia SS', 'Dawson AJ', 'Stobart K', 'Greenberg CR', 'Booth FA', 'Prasad C', 'Del Bigio MR', 'Wrogemann JJ', 'Fike F', 'Gatti RA']","['Section of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics & Child Health, University of Manitoba & Health Sciences Centre, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Can J Neurol Sci,The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

One potential mechanism of defective apoptosis could be irregular oxidative stress. The goal of our investigation was to determine in vitro production of oxidative stress markers by lymphocytes of B-CLL patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 30 untreated stage A B-CLL patients, as well as 20 stage B and C patients and 30 healthy volunteers as a control group were examined. Nitric oxide (NO), superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured by spectrophotometry in supernatants of lymphocytes cultures of all 3 investigational groups. The method applied for detecting apoptosis was fluorescence microscopic analysis using acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) double staining. RESULTS: In vitro lymphocyte production of superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and MDA was increased in B-CLL patients, while there were no statistical significantly differences of NO production among the tested groups. Compared with the spontaneous apoptosis observed in control subjects lymphocytes, B-CLL lymphocytes showed increased percentages of apoptotic cells after incubation for 24 h. Disease progression was not followed with significant differences in spontaneous apoptosis of B-CLL lymphocytes. CONCLUSION: This intensive oxidative stress markers production in cultures of B-CLL lymphocytes could be one of the potential mechanisms in the pathogenesis of abnormal apoptosis.","['Djurdjevic, P', 'Zelen, I', 'Ristic, P', 'Jovanovic, I', 'Jakovljevic, V', 'Baskic, D', 'Popovic, S', 'Arsenijevic, N']","['Djurdjevic P', 'Zelen I', 'Ristic P', 'Jovanovic I', 'Jakovljevic V', 'Baskic D', 'Popovic S', 'Arsenijevic N']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kragujevac, Kragujevac, Serbia. zekapeka@ptt.yu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,,2009/08/04 09:00,2009/09/18 06:00,['2009/08/04 09:00'],"['2009/08/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2009 Apr-Jun;14(2):281-7.,"['11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Apoptosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Malondialdehyde/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Superoxides/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twelve patients with AML, who had received a median of three prior regimens (range 1-6), were treated with decitabine 20 mg/m(2) on days 1 through 5 followed by gemtuzumab ozogamicin 3 mg/m(2) on days 6, 9, and 12. Five patients achieved a complete response (42%) and subsequently underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Three patients are in complete remission and four are still alive 7 to 16 months after treatment. The regimen was well tolerated with the primary nonhematologic toxicity of Grade 1 or 2 transaminitis observed in four patients. These results indicate that decitabine in combination with gemtuzumab is a regimen of promising efficacy worthy of further investigation in controlled trials.","['Chowdhury, Saeeda', 'Seropian, Stuart', 'Marks, Peter W']","['Chowdhury S', 'Seropian S', 'Marks PW']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Letter']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,2009/08/04 09:00,2009/10/09 06:00,['2009/08/04 09:00'],"['2009/08/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.21478 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2009 Sep;84(9):599-600. doi: 10.1002/ajh.21478.,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aminoglycosides/*administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Decitabine', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the prognosis for pediatric patients is significantly better than for adult patients with ALL, the prognosis for patients with relapsed or refractory disease is poor in all cases. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) from a related donor offers a significant therapeutic benefit for pediatric patients, although the benefit of this therapy to adults with ALL is less established. Because most patients lack a suitable related donor, alternative approaches to allo-HSCT, including umbilical cord blood, and unrelated and haploidentical allo-HSCT, have been investigated in the clinical setting. Although treatment with donor-derived T-cells, so-called 'donor lymphocyte infusion', has demonstrated poor outcomes in patients with relapsed ALL following HSCT, modified adoptive T-cell regimens, including the infusion of enriched tumor-targeted donor T-cells and genetically targeted T-cells, are currently under clinical investigation. In addition, the resistance of ALL tumor cell lines to NK-cell-mediated lysis may be overcome by the genetic modification of NK cells to target ALL tumor cell antigens, and this approach will be evaluated in an upcoming clinical trial. Whether these novel adoptive cell therapies will ultimately result in improved clinical outcomes remains to be determined.","['Brentjens, Renier J']",['Brentjens RJ'],"['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service, New York, NY 10065, USA. brentjer@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Curr Opin Mol Ther,Current opinion in molecular therapeutics,100891485,PMC4694559,2009/08/04 09:00,2009/11/06 06:00,['2009/08/04 09:00'],"['2009/08/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Curr Opin Mol Ther. 2009 Aug;11(4):375-82.,,IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Tissue Donors']",,,"['K08 CA095152/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA138738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95152/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA059350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA138738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS746468'],65,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LYRIC/AEG-1 function remains unclear, although LYRIC/AEG-1 is activated by oncogenic HA-RAS, through binding of c-myc to its promoter, which in turn regulates the key components of the PI3-kinase and nuclear factor-kappaB pathways. We have identified the transcriptional repressor PLZF as an interacting protein of LYRIC/AEG through a yeast two-hybrid screen. PLZF regulates the expression of genes involved in cell growth and apoptosis including c-myc. Coexpression of LYRIC/AEG-1 with PLZF leads to a reduction in PLZF-mediated repression by reducing PLZF binding to promoters. We have confirmed that nuclear LYRIC/AEG-1 and PLZF interact in mammalian cells via the N- and C termini of LYRIC/AEG-1 and a region C terminal to the RD2 domain of PLZF. Both proteins colocalize to nuclear bodies containing histone deacetylases, which are known to promote PLZF-mediated repression.

PROCEDURE: The majority of the patients was male (63/88, 72%), with a median age of 8.9 years (range, 2.5 to 20 y). Ethnic origin was Jewish in 73% (64/88), and Arabic in 27%. Fifty (57%) patients were classified as Burkitt lymphoma, 5 (5.7%) as Burkitt-like lymphoma, 22 (25%) as diffuse large B cell (DLBC), and 9 (10.2%) as Burkitt leukemia with over 25% of their bone marrow (BM) involved. Initial disease sites included the abdomen in 43%, head and neck in 45%, and mediastinum in 7%. Stage I: 9.1%; stage II: 28.4%; stage III: 45.5%, stage IV: 17%. Two patients had BM involvement alone, 5 patients had central nervous system (CNS) involvement alone, and 4 had both CNS and BM. The children were divided into 3 groups according to risk factors, with 5 in group A, 69 in group B, and 14 in group C. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 3 years (12 mo to 7.6 y), the Kaplan-Meier for event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) according to whole group treatment was 88.6% and 90.9%, group A was 100% and 100%; group B was 89.9% and 92.8%; and group C was 78.6% and 78.6%. There were no untoward events or deaths in group A, whereas 6 patients relapsed in group B, 4 of whom died (all relapsed during the first year), with tumor lysis syndrome in 3 patients and death of toxicity in 1 patient who had multiorgan failure 2 days after initiation of COP. Three patients in group C relapsed and died (all patients relapsed during the first 6 months), with tumor lysis syndrome in 4 patients but no deaths from toxicity. EFS for LDH less than twice was 96.4%, EFS for LDH more than twice was 73.3% (P=0.002). OS according to primary site: bone and ovary: 100%; head and neck: 95%; abdomen: 92%; mediastinum: 50%. The difference between the mediastinal primary site to all other primary sites was statistically significant with P=0.003. All the mediastinal tumors were of DLBC origin but no significant differences in outcome were found when DLBC was compared with other histologies (DLBC: 81.8%, other B line: 90.9%). OS for patients of Arabic ethnic origin was 79.2%, for Jewish patients was 95.3%, P=0.02. We could not determine any prognostic factors that were different between the groups, which raises the question of a genetic influence. CONCLUSIONS: In nonresected mature B-cell lymphoma of childhood and adolescence with no BM or CNS involvement, a 93% cure rate can be achieved, similar to the French-American-British/LMB 96 trial. Patients with primary DLBC mediastinal mass had a significantly reduced OS, indicating the need for a different therapeutic approach.","['Eldar, Adi Hersalis', 'Futerman, Boris', 'Abrahami, Gali', 'Attias, Dina', 'Barak, Ayelet Ben', 'Burstein, Yoav', 'Dvir, Rina', 'Gabriel, Herzl', 'Horovitz, Joseph', 'Kapelushnik, Joseph', 'Kaplinsky, Haim', 'Miskin, Hagit', 'Sthoeger, Dahlia', 'Toren, Amos', 'Vilk-Revel, Shoshana', 'Weintraub, Michael', 'Yaniv, Isaac', 'Linn, Shai', 'Arush, Myriam Ben']","['Eldar AH', 'Futerman B', 'Abrahami G', 'Attias D', 'Barak AB', 'Burstein Y', 'Dvir R', 'Gabriel H', 'Horovitz J', 'Kapelushnik J', 'Kaplinsky H', 'Miskin H', 'Sthoeger D', 'Toren A', 'Vilk-Revel S', 'Weintraub M', 'Yaniv I', 'Linn S', 'Arush MB']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Rambam Health Care Campus, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,2009/08/04 09:00,2009/09/05 06:00,['2009/08/04 09:00'],"['2009/08/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e31819a5d58 [doi]', '00043426-200906000-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2009 Jun;31(6):428-36. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e31819a5d58.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*mortality/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Israel', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/pathology', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the children presenting with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and hypercalcemia tend to be in older age groups and have an absence of blasts in the peripheral blood film. The chromosomal translocation 17;19 seems to be more frequent in children who present with hypercalcemia but the presence of hypercalcemia by itself does not seem to be closely linked to prognosis. Some of the less common immunophenotypes in the form of CD19 negativity and CD10 positivity have also been observed in hypercalcemic patients. In this study, we shall illustrate this clinical problem using the details of 2 patients with hematologic malignancy who were found to be hypercalcemic at presentation.

A Nordic quality assurance program, aimed on standardization of the flow cytometry MRD analysis, has been established before implementation of MRD at cutoff level 10 as one of stratifying parameters in next Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) treatment program for ALL. In 4 quality control (QC) rounds 15 laboratories determined the MRD levels in 48 follow-up samples from 12 ALL patients treated according to NOPHO 2000. Analysis procedures were standardized. For each QC round a compact disc containing data in list-mode files was sent out and results were submitted to a central laboratory. At cutoff level 10, which will be applied for clinical decisions, laboratories obtained a high concordance (91.6%). If cutoff level 10 was applied, the concordance would be lower (85.3%). The continuing standardization resulted in better concordance in QC3 and QC4 compared with QC1 and QC2. The concordance was higher in precursor B as compared with T-cell ALL.

We retrospectively analyzed the infectious complications reported on the case report forms of all 115 patients enrolled on CCG 1953. Overall 495 infectious complications were identified in 115 patients. Bacterial infections occurred most frequently (74%), followed by viral (13%), fungal (11%), and protozoan (1%). Infection related mortality disproportionately occurred with viral (31%) and fungal (19%) infections. Twenty-three percent (n=26) of patients died of infectious complications, with the majority occurring during induction/intensification. Lower respiratory infections contributed to death in 12 patients and were most commonly viral (n=6) and fungal (n=3). Intensification of therapy resulted in increased infectious complications and deaths compared with previous studies.

Predictors of neurotoxicity are lacking, because of inconsistency between clinical symptoms and imaging. Some have suggested that cerebrospinal fluid myelin basic protein (MBP) levels to be of potential interest. A retrospective analysis of MBP levels in correlation with clinical and radiologic data is presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MBP levels obtained at the time of intrathecals, charts, and neuroradiology reports were retrospectively analyzed. Academic achievement data were obtained from phone contacts with patients and families. RESULTS: We retrieved 1248 dosages of MBP in 83 patients, 381 neurologic examinations in 34 patients and 69 neuroradiologic investigations in 27 patients. Fifty-two patients had abnormal MBP levels. Radiologic anomalies were present in 47% of those investigated, 14% of them having school difficulties. Proportions of patients with school difficulties in the groups with abnormal MBP levels but no radiologic anomalies or with no radiologic investigations were 0% and 3%, respectively, which was lower than in the group of patients with normal MBP levels (100%, 22%, and 5%, respectively). DISCUSSION: Notwithstanding the retrospective character of our study, we conclude that there is limited usefulness of systematic dosage of MBP as indicator of treatment-induced neurotoxicity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients.","['Diezi, Manuel', 'Garcia, Emma', 'Weid, Nicolas von der', 'Beck-Popovic, Maja']","['Diezi M', 'Garcia E', 'Weid Nv', 'Beck-Popovic M']","['Hematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland. manuel.diezi@chuv.ch']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,2009/08/04 09:00,2009/09/05 06:00,['2009/08/04 09:00'],"['2009/08/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e31819d1807 [doi]', '00043426-200906000-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2009 Jun;31(6):393-7. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e31819d1807.,['0 (Myelin Basic Protein)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Brain/pathology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition Disorders/*cerebrospinal fluid/etiology', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Male', 'Myelin Basic Protein/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*cerebrospinal fluid/pathology/*therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the 234 patients, the 135 patients who received MTX/6MP maintenance therapy had a lower relapse risk than the 98 patients who received LSA2L2 maintenance therapy, which was the case for both B-lineage (27%+/-5% vs. 45%+/-9%; P=0.02) and T-lineage ALL (8%+/-5% vs. 21%+/-5%; P=0.12). In multivariate Cox regression analysis stratified for immune phenotype, a higher white blood count (P=0.01) and administration of LSA2L2 maintenance therapy (P=0.04) were both related to an increased risk of an event (overall P value of the Cox model: 0.003), whereas neither sex, age at diagnosis, administration of central nervous system irradiation, nor presence of a day 15 bone marrow with > or =25% versus <25% lymphoblasts were of statistical significance. These results indicate that oral MTX/6MP maintenance therapy administered after the first year of remission can improve the cure rates of children with T-lineage or with higher risk B-lineage ALL.","['Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Kristinsson, Jon', 'Mogensen, Ulla B', 'Rosthoj, Susanne', 'Vettenranta, Kim', 'Wesenberg, Finn', 'Saarinen-Pihkala, Ulla']","['Schmiegelow K', 'Heyman M', 'Kristinsson J', 'Mogensen UB', 'Rosthoj S', 'Vettenranta K', 'Wesenberg F', 'Saarinen-Pihkala U']","['Institute of Gynecology, Obstetrics, and Pediatrics, Department of Pediatrics, University Hospitals, Rigshospitalet Copenhagen, Denmark. kschmiegelow@rh.dk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,2009/08/04 09:00,2009/09/05 06:00,['2009/08/04 09:00'],"['2009/08/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181a6e171 [doi]', '00043426-200906000-00002 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2009 Jun;31(6):385-92. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181a6e171.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'LSA2-L2 protocol']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",,,,,,['J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2009 Jun;31(6):383-4.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with chronic myloid leukemia (CML) were enrolled in the study. The glucagon stimulation test (GST), and standard deviation scores (SDSs) of insulin-like growth fac- tor 1 (IGF-I) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP-3) were used to determine GHD. The L-dopa test was performed on those with IGF-I SDSs above the -1.8 cut-off level. RESULTS: Of the 17 patients in the study, 12 (70%) had severe GHD (serum GH level <3 microg/l after GST). IGF-I SDSs and IGFBP-3 SDSs were below -1.8 in 12 patients (70%) and below -0.9 in 10 subjects (58%). Four of the 5 remaining subjects with IGF-I SDS >-1.8 showed insufficient GH response to L-dopa stimulation. Nine subjects (52%) had both severe GHD based on GST response and IGF-I SDS below -1.8. If an IGF-I SDS cut-off value l<-3 were used,5 out of 17 subjects (30%) would be classified as GH deficient. These same patients also showed severe GHD based on GST response. CONCLUSIONS: The data showed that a large number of patients on imatinib mesylate therapy had GH deficiency. A study involving a larger number of patients with a matched control group is needed to confirm the present observations.","['Kebapcilar, L', 'Bilgir, O', 'Alacacioglu, I', 'Payzin, B', 'Bilgir, F', 'Oner, P', 'Sari, I', 'Calan, M', 'Binicier, O']","['Kebapcilar L', 'Bilgir O', 'Alacacioglu I', 'Payzin B', 'Bilgir F', 'Oner P', 'Sari I', 'Calan M', 'Binicier O']","['Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Bozyaka Training and Research Hospital, Izmir, Turkey. leventkebapcilar@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090731,Switzerland,Med Princ Pract,"Medical principles and practice : international journal of the Kuwait University, Health Science Centre",8901334,,2009/08/04 09:00,2009/10/29 06:00,['2009/08/04 09:00'],"['2008/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['000226288 [pii]', '10.1159/000226288 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Princ Pract. 2009;18(5):360-3. doi: 10.1159/000226288.

One of the methods is to prevent the immunosuppression accompanying neoplastic diseases including acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in children. In healthy people regulatory T cells (Tregs) prevent the autoimmune, destructive activation of T lymphocytes. However, the hyperfunction of Tregs will lead to impairement of the immune system. THE AIM: of our study was to determine the Tregs (including molecules important for their function) in the peripheral blood of children with ALL. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty children were enrolled into our study, the assessment of Tregs was performed with flow cytometry including the following antigens: CD4, CD10, CD19, CD25, CD28, CD45, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD54 (ICAM-1), CD62L, CD69, CD103, CD127, CD134 (OX40), CD152 (CTLA-4), GITR. RESULTS: 1. The percentages of Tregs were higher in the blood of the examined group, however the difference was not statistically significant; 2. In the examined group higher percentage of Tregs with the coexpression of CD45RA, CD134 and CD152 antigens were noted; 3. The percentages of Tregs with coexpression of CD62L (with or without CD103) and CD54 were lower then in the control group; 4. We did not observe differences in Tregs with coexpression of CD11a, CD27, CD28, CD45RO, CD69, CD103, GITR antigens between the examined and the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of smaller number and lower percentage of regulatory T cells with coexpression of CD62L or lack expression of CD103 in children with ALL as compared to the control group, may be interpreted as activation of Treg cells and one of the mechanisms of immunosuppression in cancer of children. Further studies in this direction are needed.","['Stasiak-Barmuta, Anna', 'Luczynski, Wlodzimierz', 'Ilendo, Elzbieta', 'Krawczuk-Rybak, Maryna', 'Szymanski, Marcin']","['Stasiak-Barmuta A', 'Luczynski W', 'Ilendo E', 'Krawczuk-Rybak M', 'Szymanski M']","['Pracownia Cytometrii Przeplywowej, ul.

To establish whether targeting CRAC might counteract intestinal inflammation, we evaluated the in vitro effect of a selective CRAC inhibitor on T cell cytokine production and T-bet expression by lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) and biopsy specimens from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. The inhibitory activity of the CRAC blocker was investigated through patch-clamp experiments on rat basophilic leukemia cells and fluorometric imaging plate reader intracellular Ca(2+) assays using thapsigargin-stimulated Jurkat T cells and its detailed selectivity profile defined using a range of in vitro radioligand binding and functional assays. Anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated LPMC and biopsy specimens from 51 patients with IBD were cultured with a range of CRAC inhibitor concentrations (0.01-10 microM). IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-8, and IL-17 were analyzed by ELISA. T-bet was determined by immunoblotting. We found that the CRAC blocker concentration-dependently inhibited CRAC current in rat basophilic leukemia cells and thapsigargin-induced Ca(2+) influx in Jurkat T cells. A concentration-dependent reduction in T-bet expression and production of IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-17, but not IL-8, was observed in IBD LPMC and biopsy specimens treated with the CRAC inhibitor. In conclusion, we provide evidence that the suppression of CRAC channel function may dampen the increased T cell response in the inflamed gut, thus suggesting a promising role for CRAC inhibitor drugs in the therapeutic management of patients with IBD.","['Di Sabatino, Antonio', 'Rovedatti, Laura', 'Kaur, Rejbinder', 'Spencer, Jonathan P', 'Brown, Jon T', 'Morisset, Valerie D', 'Biancheri, Paolo', 'Leakey, Nicholas A B', 'Wilde, Jonathan I', 'Scott, Laurie', 'Corazza, Gino R', 'Lee, Kevin', 'Sengupta, Neel', 'Knowles, Charles H', 'Gunthorpe, Martin J', 'McLean, Peter G', 'MacDonald, Thomas T', 'Kruidenier, Laurens']","['Di Sabatino A', 'Rovedatti L', 'Kaur R', 'Spencer JP', 'Brown JT', 'Morisset VD', 'Biancheri P', 'Leakey NA', 'Wilde JI', 'Scott L', 'Corazza GR', 'Lee K', 'Sengupta N', 'Knowles CH', 'Gunthorpe MJ', 'McLean PG', 'MacDonald TT', 'Kruidenier L']","['Centre for Infectious Disease, Institute of Cell and Molecular Science, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090731,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,,2009/08/04 09:00,2009/09/19 06:00,['2009/08/04 09:00'],"['2009/08/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.0802887 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0802887 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2009 Sep 1;183(5):3454-62. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0802887.

The largest randomized clinical trial of imatinib was the multinational IRIS trial in which 1106 patients were randomized to receive either imatinib 400 mg/day or a standard regimen of interferon-alpha plus cytarabine. DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients were allowed to cross over to the opposite treatment for intolerance, lack of response, disease progression, and, following release of the initial efficacy data, reluctance to remain on therapy with interferon-alpha plus cytarabine. The safety and efficacy of imatinib in patients who crossed over from interferon-alpha plus cytarabine to imatinib is reported here. RESULTS: Of 553 patients originally assigned to interferon-alpha plus cytarabine, 65% crossed over to imatinib, of whom 67% continue to receive treatment. After a median of 54 months of imatinib treatment on study, 93% achieved complete hematologic remission, 86% achieved major cytogenetic remission, and 81% achieved a complete cytogenetic remission as the best observed response. Estimated rates of freedom from progression to accelerated or blast phase and overall survival were 91% and 89%, respectively, at 48 months after starting imatinib. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest analysis to date describing the efficacy of imatinib in patients who have received prior therapies for chronic myeloid leukemia and it demonstrates excellent responses to this treatment.

Although T-cell depletion abrogates graft-versus-host disease, the impact on disease-free survival in acute lymphoblastic leukemia is not known. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the outcome of 48 adults (median age 26 years) with high-risk, Philadelphia-chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia undergoing T-cell depleted unrelated donor-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (67% 10 of 10 loci matched) in first complete remission reported to the British Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation Registry from 1993 to 2005. RESULTS: T-cell depletion was carried out by in vivo alemtuzumab administration. Additional, ex vivo T-cell depletion was performed in 21% of patients. Overall survival, disease-free survival and non-relapse mortality rates at 5 years were 61% (95% CI 46-75), 59% (95% CI 45-74) and 13% (95% CI 3-25), respectively. The incidences of grades II-IV and III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease were 27% (95% CI 16-44) and 10% (95% CI 4-25), respectively. The actuarial estimate of extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease at 5 years was 22% (95%CI 13-38). High-risk cytogenetics at diagnosis was associated with a lower 5-year overall survival (47% (95% CI 27-71) vs. 68% (95% CI 44-84), p=0.045). CONCLUSIONS: T-cell depleted hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from unrelated donors can result in good overall survival and low non-relapse mortality for adults with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first complete remission and merits prospective evaluation.","['Patel, Bella', 'Kirkland, Keiren E', 'Szydlo, Richard', 'Pearce, Rachel M', 'Clark, Richard E', 'Craddock, Charles', 'Liakopoulou, Effie', 'Fielding, Adele K', 'Mackinnon, Stephen', 'Olavarria, Eduardo', 'Potter, Mike N', 'Russell, Nigel H', 'Shaw, Bronwen E', 'Cook, Gordon', 'Goldstone, Anthony H', 'Marks, David I']","['Patel B', 'Kirkland KE', 'Szydlo R', 'Pearce RM', 'Clark RE', 'Craddock C', 'Liakopoulou E', 'Fielding AK', 'Mackinnon S', 'Olavarria E', 'Potter MN', 'Russell NH', 'Shaw BE', 'Cook G', 'Goldstone AH', 'Marks DI']","[""Department of Haematology, Royal Free and University College London Medical School, and BSBMT Data Registry, Guy's Hospital, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20090731,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC2754956,2009/08/04 09:00,2011/08/05 06:00,['2009/08/04 09:00'],"['2009/08/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.008649 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.008649 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Oct;94(10):1399-406. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.008649.

To validate the potential of this receptor as a therapeutic target in acute myeloid leukemia, we generated a series of monoclonal antibodies against the extracellular domain of C-type lectin-like molecule-1 and used them to extend the expression profile analysis of acute myeloid leukemia cells and to select cytotoxic monoclonal antibodies against acute myeloid leukemia cells in preclinical models. DESIGN AND METHODS: C-type lectin-like molecule-1 expression was analyzed in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines, and in myeloid derived cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia and healthy donors. Anti-C-type lectin-like molecule-1 antibody-mediated in vitro cytotoxic activity against acute myeloid leukemia blasts/cell lines and in vivo anti-cancer activity in a mouse xenograft model were assessed. Internalization of C-type lectin-like molecule-1 monoclonal antibodies upon receptor ligation was also investigated. RESULTS: C-type lectin-like molecule-1 was expressed in 86.5% (45/52) of cases of acute myeloid leukemia, in 54.5% (12/22) of acute myeloid leukemia CD34(+)/CD38(-) stem cells, but not in acute lymphoblastic leukemia blasts (n=5). Selected anti-C-type lectin-like molecule-1 monoclonal antibodies mediated dose-dependent complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity specifically against acute myeloid leukemia-derived cell lines. Exogenous expression of the transmembrane receptor in HEK293 cells rendered the cells susceptible to antibody-mediated killing by monoclonal antibodies to the receptor. Furthermore, these monoclonal antibodies demonstrated strong complement-dependent cytotoxicity against freshly isolated acute myeloid leukemia blasts (15/16 cases; 94%). The monoclonal antibodies were efficiently internalized upon binding to C-type lectin-like molecule-1 in HL-60 cells. Moreover, a lead chimeric C-type lectin-like molecule-1 monoclonal antibody reduced the tumor size in xenograft mice implanted with HL-60 cells. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that targeting C-type lectin-like molecule-1 with specific cytotoxic monoclonal antibodies is an attractive approach which could lead to novel therapies for acute myeloid leukemia.","['Zhao, Xiaoxian', 'Singh, Shweta', 'Pardoux, Cecile', 'Zhao, Jingsong', 'Hsi, Eric D', 'Abo, Arie', 'Korver, Wouter']","['Zhao X', 'Singh S', 'Pardoux C', 'Zhao J', 'Hsi ED', 'Abo A', 'Korver W']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20090731,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC2805740,2009/08/04 09:00,2011/08/06 06:00,['2009/08/04 09:00'],"['2009/08/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.009811 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.009811 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Jan;95(1):71-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.009811.

Prediction of toxicity is difficult because of inter-individual variability susceptibility to antileukemic agents. Methotrexate interferes with folate metabolism leading to depletion of reduced folates. DESIGN AND METHODS: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of polymorphisms for folate metabolizing enzymes with respect to toxicity and survival in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with methotrexate maintenance therapy. To this purpose, we evaluated possible associations between genotype and hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity and effects on survival at 2 years of follow-up in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. RESULTS: Polymorphisms in the genes encoding for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR 677C>T) and in dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR 19 bp deletion) significantly increased the risk of hepatotoxicity in single (odds ratio 5.23, 95% confidence interval 1.13-21.95 and odds ratio 4.57, 95% confidence interval 1.01-20.77, respectively) and in combined analysis (odds ratio 6.82, 95% confidence interval 1.38-33.59). MTHFR 677C>T also increased the risk of leukopenia and gastrointestinal toxicity, whilst thymidylate synthase 28 bp repeat polymorphism increased the risk of anemia (odds ratio 8.48, 95% confidence interval 2.00-36.09). Finally, patients with MTHFR 677TT had a decreased overall survival rate (hazard ratio 2.37, 95% confidence interval 1.46-8.45). CONCLUSIONS: Genotyping of folate polymorphisms might be useful in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia to optimize methotrexate therapy, reducing the associated toxicity with possible effects on survival.","['Ongaro, Alessia', 'De Mattei, Monica', 'Della Porta, Matteo Giovanni', 'Rigolin, GianMatteo', 'Ambrosio, Cristina', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Pellati, Agnese', 'Masieri, Federica Francesca', 'Caruso, Angelo', 'Catozzi, Linda', 'Gemmati, Donato']","['Ongaro A', 'De Mattei M', 'Della Porta MG', 'Rigolin G', 'Ambrosio C', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Pellati A', 'Masieri FF', 'Caruso A', 'Catozzi L', 'Gemmati D']","['Department of Morphology and Embryology, Section of Histology, University of Ferrara, Via Fossato di Mortara 64/B, 44100 Ferrara, Italy. ngrlss@unife.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090731,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC2754955,2009/08/04 09:00,2011/08/05 06:00,['2009/08/04 09:00'],"['2009/08/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.008326 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.008326 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Oct;94(10):1391-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.008326.

The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of FAK protein in a series of normal and neoplastic lymphoid tissues. An anti-FAK antibody was used to study the protein expression in paraffin-embedded samples of normal and neoplastic, hematolymphoid and non-hematolymphoid tissues by immunohistochemistry. In normal hematolymphoid tissue, the strongest expression of FAK was detected in germinal center and marginal-zone B cells; positive staining was also found in mantle zone B cells. In human lymphomas, FAK was expressed mostly in B-cell lymphomas and was predominantly negative in T-cell lymphoma. In Hodgkin lymphomas, FAK was found only in the neoplastic cells of lymphocyte predominant type, whereas the tumor cells of the classical form were FAK-negative. We demonstrate for the first time the expression of FAK in paraffin-embedded hematolymphoid tissue samples. Its differential expression in lymphomas may be of relevance for some B-cell neoplasms by using it as an additional marker to distinguish B- from T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma to further differentiate lymphocyte predominant from classical Hodgkin lymphoma.","['Ozkal, Sermin', 'Paterson, Jennifer C', 'Tedoldi, Sara', 'Hansmann, Martin-Leo', 'Kargi, Aydanur', 'Manek, Sanjiv', 'Mason, David Y', 'Marafioti, Teresa']","['Ozkal S', 'Paterson JC', 'Tedoldi S', 'Hansmann ML', 'Kargi A', 'Manek S', 'Mason DY', 'Marafioti T']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Immunodiagnostics Unit, Nuffield Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. sermin.ozkal@deu.edu.tr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090803,Germany,Pathol Res Pract,"Pathology, research and practice",7806109,,2009/08/04 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/04 09:00'],"['2009/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0344-0338(09)00193-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.prp.2009.07.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Res Pract. 2009;205(11):781-8. doi: 10.1016/j.prp.2009.07.002.

In vitro studies of resistant human cell lines have confirmed that human concentrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hCNT1)-deficient cells display resistance. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We applied real-time PCR method to assess the mRNA expression of equilibrative and concentrative nucleoside transporter (hENT1, hCNT1), deoxycytidine and deoxyguanosine kinase (dCK, dGK), 5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT), ribonucleotide reductase catalytic and regulatory (RR1, RR2) subunits in bone marrow cells from 32 patients with Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who received 2CdA-based chemotherapy. Responses to chemotherapy, were then correlated to the expression of these markers. RESULTS: All 32 patients enrolled expressed lower levels of hCNT1 as compared to healthy donors. In univariate analysis, lower expression level of hCNT1 (p=0.0021) and RR2 (p=0.02) correlated with response to chemotherapy. In particular, patients with low levels of hCNT1 achieved inferior clinical response. No significant correlation between these genes expression and age, stage of disease was found. This study suggests that nucleotidase expression levels can be used to identify subgroups of WM and SLL patients who will likely respond differently to a 2CdA-based therapy.","['Rabascio, C', 'Laszlo, D', 'Andreola, G', 'Saronni, L', 'Radice, D', 'Rigacci, L', 'Fabbri, A', 'Frigeri, F', 'Calabrese, L', 'Billio, A', 'Bertolini, F', 'Martinelli, G']","['Rabascio C', 'Laszlo D', 'Andreola G', 'Saronni L', 'Radice D', 'Rigacci L', 'Fabbri A', 'Frigeri F', 'Calabrese L', 'Billio A', 'Bertolini F', 'Martinelli G']","['Dept of Haematology, European Institute of Oncology, via Ripamonti 435, 20141 Milano, Italy. cristina.rabascio@ieo.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20090803,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,2009/08/04 09:00,2010/03/27 06:00,['2009/08/04 09:00'],"['2009/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/25 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00349-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.07.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Apr;34(4):454-7. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.07.002.

Evidence for this is limited because of poor engraftment of human CML-LICs in NOD-SCID mice and nonphysiologic expression of oncogenes in retroviral transduction mouse models. To address these challenges, we generated mice bearing conditional knockin alleles of two human oncogenes: HIP1/PDGFbetaR (H/P) and AML1-ETO (A/E). Unlike retroviral transduction, physiologic expression of H/P or A/E individually failed to induce disease, but coexpression of both H/P and A/E led to rapid onset of a fully penetrant, myeloproliferative disorder, indicating cooperativity between these two alleles. Although imatinib dramatically decreased disease burden, LICs persisted, demonstrating imatinib refractoriness of LICs.","['Oravecz-Wilson, Katherine I', 'Philips, Steven T', 'Yilmaz, Omer H', 'Ames, Heather M', 'Li, Lina', 'Crawford, Brendan D', 'Gauvin, Alice M', 'Lucas, Peter C', 'Sitwala, Kajal', 'Downing, James R', 'Morrison, Sean J', 'Ross, Theodora S']","['Oravecz-Wilson KI', 'Philips ST', 'Yilmaz OH', 'Ames HM', 'Li L', 'Crawford BD', 'Gauvin AM', 'Lucas PC', 'Sitwala K', 'Downing JR', 'Morrison SJ', 'Ross TS']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Cell,Cancer cell,101130617,PMC2763369,2009/08/04 09:00,2009/08/22 09:00,['2009/08/04 09:00'],"['2008/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/22 09:00 [medline]']","['S1535-6108(09)00181-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ccr.2009.06.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Cell. 2009 Aug 4;16(2):137-48. doi: 10.1016/j.ccr.2009.06.007.,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Knock-In Techniques', 'Genotype', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Spleen/metabolism/pathology']",,,"['R01 CA082363-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098730-04S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA082363-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R01 CA082363/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA82363-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009676/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA082363-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098730-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA082363-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098730-05A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA009676/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA082363-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS128643'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sequenced based typing of these genes has been carried out extensively from blood samples; however it is often impractical or expensive to obtain such samples. Repositories of well-characterized serum from cattle are readily available in many veterinary research facilities. This paper reports a retrospective analysis of BoLA class II genotypes of cattle obtained from stored serum samples from Holstein cattle from Quebec dairy farms, which were obtained as part of a previous study on bovine neosporosis. It was possible to genotype 56 cattle with known infection status for Neospora caninum. We identified 14 different DRB3 and 10 different DQA1 alleles in this population. The allele frequency distribution was consistent with previously studied cattle populations, and alleles known to be associated with BLV and mastitis were present. No association was found between allele frequency distribution of DRB3 or DQA genes and infection with N. caninum. However, an association of allele DRB3*1001 and allele DRB3*2703 with resistance and susceptibility to pregnancy loss, irrespective of infection status, was identified.","['Schwab, Anne E', 'Geary, Timothy G', 'Baillargeon, Paul', 'Schwab, Andreas J', 'Fecteau, Gilles']","['Schwab AE', 'Geary TG', 'Baillargeon P', 'Schwab AJ', 'Fecteau G']","['Departement des sciences cliniques, Faculte de Medecine Veterinaire, Universite de Montreal, St-Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090710,Netherlands,Vet Parasitol,Veterinary parasitology,7602745,,2009/08/04 09:00,2010/02/04 06:00,['2009/08/04 09:00'],"['2009/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/25 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-4017(09)00401-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetpar.2009.07.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Parasitol. 2009 Oct 28;165(1-2):136-40. doi: 10.1016/j.vetpar.2009.07.004.

In this work, we evaluated the effects of the pharmacological NFkappaB inhibitors BAY117082 and MG132 on leukemia cells apoptosis. BAY117082 and MG132 presented potent apoptotic effects compared to inhibitors of MAPKs, EGFR, PI3K/Akt, PKC and PKA signaling pathways. Non-tumor peripheral blood cells were insensitive to BAY117082 and MG132 apoptotic effects. BAY117082 and MG132-induced apoptosis was dependent on their ability to increase ROS as a prelude to mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) depolarization, permeability transition pore opening and cytochrome c release. Antioxidants blocked MG132 and BAY117082 effects on ROS, MMP and cell death. Although apoptotic markers as phosphatidylserine externalization, chromatin condensation and sub-G1 were detected in BAY117082-treated cells, caspases activation did not occur and apoptosis was insensitive to caspase inhibitors, suggesting a caspase-independent mechanism. In contrast, MG132 induced classical apoptosis through ROS-mitochondria and subsequent caspase-9/caspase-3 activation. At sub-apoptotic concentrations, BAY117082 and MG132 arrested cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle and blocked doxorubicin-induced NFkappaB, which sensitized doxorubicin-resistant cells. Data suggest that the NFkappaB inhibitors MG132 and BAY117082 are potential anti-leukemia agents.","['Zanotto-Filho, Alfeu', 'Delgado-Canedo, Andres', 'Schroder, Rafael', 'Becker, Matheus', 'Klamt, Fabio', 'Moreira, Jose Claudio Fonseca']","['Zanotto-Filho A', 'Delgado-Canedo A', 'Schroder R', 'Becker M', 'Klamt F', 'Moreira JC']","['Centro de Estudos em Estresse Oxidativo, Departamento de Bioquimica, UFRGS, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. ohalceu@yahoo.com.br']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090730,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,,2009/08/04 09:00,2010/02/26 06:00,['2009/08/04 09:00'],"['2009/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/28 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(09)00463-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2009.06.038 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2010 Feb 28;288(2):192-203. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2009.06.038.

A significant difference in overall survival was noted between patients receiving <or=2 units and those receiving >2 units of RBC transfusions/month (65.0 vs. 35.3 months, respectively, P=0.02). Univariate statistical analysis identified the presence of disease progression to advanced MDS (chi(2)=26.4, P=0.001) and the administration of >1 or >2 units of RBC per month (chi(2)=15.9 and 14.6, respectively, P=0.001) as the most important parameters affecting survival. Nevertheless, even the administration of 1 RBC unit every 4-8 weeks had a significantly adverse impact on survival compared to non-transfused patients. Transfusion dependency itself did not affect disease progression as determined by the presence of multilineage dysplasia and adverse karyotype (expressed by the IM-1 or IM-2 score). Multivariate analysis confirmed disease progression towards leukemia as a highly significant independent variable affecting survival (P=0.0001). None of the other evaluated parameters had a significant impact on survival in patients with progressive disease. In non-transplanted patients without MDS progression, administration of >2 units of RBC transfusions/month was the only independent variable with adverse impact on survival in patients with unilineage erythroid dysplasia (P=0.02). In patients with multilineage dysplasia, only heavy transfusion dependency (>3TURBC/month) and serum ferritin >2000 microg/l adversely affected survival (P=0.03). Modification of the WPSS by replacing transfusion dependency with initial Hb level <80 g/l retained its prognostic relevance and allowed the identification of a potential risk subset of early MDS patients with intermediate and high scores and limited survival (<40% at 5 years) as early as at the time of diagnosis. Our results confirm a significant negative impact of transfusion dependency on survival in patients with early MDS without excess of blasts. The main risk subgroup is characterized by unilineage dysplasia limited to erythropoiesis in combination with dependency on >2TU of RBC per month. These patients usually have prolonged survival that leads to the development of heavy transfusion iron overload and they thus represent the most important target group for intensive chelation therapy.","['Cermak, Jaroslav', 'Kacirkova, Petra', 'Mikulenkova, Dana', 'Michalova, Kyra']","['Cermak J', 'Kacirkova P', 'Mikulenkova D', 'Michalova K']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, 128 20 Prague, Czech Republic. cermak@uhkt.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090730,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,2009/08/04 09:00,2009/09/04 06:00,['2009/08/04 09:00'],"['2008/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00341-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.06.033 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2009 Nov;33(11):1469-74. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.06.033.

Interleukin 6 family cytokines, whose signal transduction requires gp130, promote astrocyte differentiation in the optic nerve, though the mechanism of astrocyte differentiation in the retina has not been clarified. We found that GFAP-positive astrocytes were significantly decreased in number but that a considerable number of astrocytes were still present in gp130-deficient mouse retina. These findings suggest that gp130-dependent signaling pathways play essential roles in retinal astrocyte differentiation and that retinal astrocyte differentiation can also be promoted by other signaling pathways. We found that leukemia inhibitory factor, bone morphogenetic proteins, and their receptors are expressed in P0 retina. In addition, leukemia inhibitory factor and bone morphogenetic protein 2 synergistically promote astrocyte differentiation of retinal precursor cells isolated from P0 mouse retina. These observations demonstrated that not only gp130-dependent signaling but also bone morphogenetic proteins play essential roles in retinal astrocyte differentiation.","['Fukushima, Mikiko', 'Setoguchi, Takao', 'Komiya, Setsuro', 'Tanihara, Hidenobu', 'Taga, Tetsuya']","['Fukushima M', 'Setoguchi T', 'Komiya S', 'Tanihara H', 'Taga T']","['Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Kumamoto University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto 860-8556, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090729,United States,Int J Dev Neurosci,International journal of developmental neuroscience : the official journal of the International Society for Developmental Neuroscience,8401784,,2009/08/04 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/04 09:00'],"['2009/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0736-5748(09)00111-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2009.07.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Dev Neurosci. 2009 Nov;27(7):685-90. doi: 10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2009.07.006.

OBJECTIVE: Report differences in laboratory values between FIV- or FeLV-infected and noninfected and between FIV- and FeLV-infected cats. ANIMALS: Three thousand seven hundred and eighty client-owned cats tested for FIV and FeLV. METHODS: Retrospective study. Evaluation of clinicopathologic changes in cats with defined FIV and FeLV status and for which laboratory data were available. RESULTS: FIV-infected cats were more likely to be neutropenic (odds ratio [OR]=3.6, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 2.1-6.2, P < .0001) and had lower serum activities of aspartate aminotransferase and glutamate dehydrogenase than control cats; serum total protein (8.1 +/- 1.1 versus 7.6 +/- 1.3 g/dL, P < .001) and gamma-globulin concentrations (2.2 +/- 1.1 versus 1.7 +/- 1.3 g/dL, P < .001) were higher than in uninfected cats. Compared with controls, FeLV-infected cats had a higher risk of anemia (OR = 3.8, 95% CI 2.4-6.0, P < .0001), thrombocytopenia (OR = 5.0, 95% CI 3.0-8.4, P < .0001), neutropenia (OR = 3.6, 95% CI 2.1-6.1, P < .0001), lymphocytosis (OR = 2.8, 95% CI 1.6-4.8, P= .0002), and lower erythrocyte counts (6.13 +/- 2.95 x 10(3) versus 8.72 +/- 2.18 x 10(3)/microL, P < .001), thrombocyte counts (253.591 +/- 171.841 x 10(3) versus 333.506 +/- 156.033 x 10(3)/microL, P < .001), hematocrit (28.72 +/- 12.86 versus 37.67 +/- 8.90%, P < .001), hemoglobin and creatinine concentration. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Hematologic abnormalities are common in FeLV-infected but not in FIV-infected cats. Clinicopathologic abnormalities are less frequent in FIV-infected cats and might reflect an unspecific immunologic response.","['Gleich, S', 'Hartmann, K']","['Gleich S', 'Hartmann K']","['Clinic of Small Animal Internal Medicine, Ludwig Maximilian University Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Vet Intern Med,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,8708660,,2009/08/04 09:00,2009/11/10 06:00,['2009/08/04 09:00'],"['2009/08/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['JVIM303 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1939-1676.2009.0303.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Vet Intern Med. 2009 May-Jun;23(3):552-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1939-1676.2009.0303.x.,,IM,"['Aging', 'Animals', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Cat Diseases/*blood/virology', 'Cats', 'Female', '*Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline', 'Lentivirus Infections/blood/*veterinary', '*Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retroviridae Infections/blood/*veterinary', 'Tumor Virus Infections/blood/*veterinary']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we show that magnolol concentration dependently (0-40 microM) decreased the cell number in a cultured human glioblastoma cancer cell line (U373) and arrested the cells at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Magnolol treatment decreased the protein levels of cyclins A and D1 and increased p21/Cip1, but not cyclins B and D3, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)2, CDK4, CDC25C, Weel, p27/Kip1, and p53. The CDK2-p21/Cip1 complex was increased, and the CDK2 kinase activity was decreased in the magnolol-treated U373. Pretreatment of U373 with p21/Cip1 specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotide prevented the magnolol-induced increase of p21/Cip1 protein levels and the decrease of DNA synthesis. Magnolol at a concentration of 100 microM induced DNA fragmentation in U373.

Developing individualized, 'targeted' therapy for each AML patient based on unique molecular features of disease remains a daunting goal yet one that we can now begin to envision. Hypothesis-based study designs-from pre-clinical/laboratory experiments to phase-I and subsequent efficacy trials-provide the foundation for advances in the diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment for patients with AML. Here we critically review the literature for the management of AML, try to give recommendations regarding the appropriate induction and remission strategy, clarify the role of stem cell transplantation and discuss novel agents on the horizon.","['Hamadani, Mehdi', 'Awan, Farrukh T']","['Hamadani M', 'Awan FT']","['Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center, West Virginia University, PO Box 9162, Morgantown, WV, USA. mehdi.hamadani@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,2009/08/01 09:00,2010/04/16 06:00,['2009/08/01 09:00'],"['2009/08/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.915 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2010 Mar;28(1):3-12. doi: 10.1002/hon.915.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",,,,,83,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of a randomly selected FN episode per patient during 2004-2005 at a pediatric oncology center were reviewed. Patients were managed as per institutional FN guidelines and blood cultures collected in continuously read BACTEC bottles. RESULTS: Of 337 FN episodes, infection was proven in 86 (25%) and probable in 75 (22%). In all, 177 episodes (53%) were judged fever of unknown origin (FUO). Bacteremia accounted for most (41) of the proven bacterial episodes, with viridans streptococci (13), Pseudomonas spp. (6) and Escherichia coli (6) the most frequently isolated organisms. The median time to positivity of blood cultures was 12 hours (range, 5.4-143.7) with 93% positive within 24 hours of incubation. Viral pathogens were identified in 29 (34%) episodes. Compared with other patients, those with FUO had shorter median duration of fever (0.5 vs. 2.0 d; P<0.0001) and hospitalization (3 vs. 6 d; P<0.0001), longer median duration since last chemotherapy (6.0 vs. 4.0 d; P=0.01), and were less likely to have a diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia (11% vs. 22%; P=0.009) or develop a clinical complication (5.1% vs. 24.4%; P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite currently available diagnostic resources, the majority of patients with FN have FUO marked by a low rate of clinical complications and no infection-related mortality. Emergence of viridans streptococci as the most common blood isolate has affected FN treatment recommendations. Study findings will help further development of strategies for risk stratified management of fever with neutropenia in pediatric patients.","['Hakim, Hana', 'Flynn, Patricia M', 'Knapp, Katherine M', 'Srivastava, Deo Kumar', 'Gaur, Aditya H']","['Hakim H', 'Flynn PM', 'Knapp KM', 'Srivastava DK', 'Gaur AH']","[""Departments of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.

The aim of the study was to define the epidemiologic and clinical features of typhlitis and to elucidate predisposing factors for its development. The medical records of pediatric patients with cancer who were diagnosed with typhlitis from 1995 to 2005 were reviewed for clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings. The results were compared with a group of patients with cancer but without typhlitis who were hospitalized during the same period. Of the 843 cancer patients, 42 (5%) had episodes of typhlitis; 32 of them (76%) were being treated for hematologic malignancies. The incidence was highest in patients with Burkitt's lymphoma (15%) and acute myeloblastic leukemia (12%). Work-up included abdominal x-ray in all patients; abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography were performed in 23% and 11% of patients, respectively. No cases were missed by plain x-ray when compared with computed tomography and ultrasonography. The typhlitis was treated without surgery and survival was 100%. On multivariate analysis, mucositis [odds ratio (OR) = 30.7], stem cell transplantation (OR = 58.9), and receipt of chemotherapy in the previous 2 weeks (OR = 12.9) were significantly associated with the occurrence of typhlitis. We conclude that most children with typhlitis may be treated without surgery in most cases with favorable outcome. A high index of suspicion may be warranted in patients after stem cell transplantation or chemotherapy and patients with mucositis.","['Moran, Hadar', 'Yaniv, Isaac', 'Ashkenazi, Shai', 'Schwartz, Michael', 'Fisher, Salvador', 'Levy, Itzhak']","['Moran H', 'Yaniv I', 'Ashkenazi S', 'Schwartz M', 'Fisher S', 'Levy I']","[""Infectious Diseases Unit, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva and Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,2009/08/01 09:00,2009/09/23 06:00,['2009/08/01 09:00'],"['2009/08/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181b1ee28 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2009 Sep;31(9):630-4. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181b1ee28.,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/complications/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Israel/epidemiology', 'Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Mucositis/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy/surgery', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Postoperative Complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Single-Blind Method', 'Typhlitis/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This 57-year-old man presented with shortness of breath and intermittent upper quadrant abdominal pain for 4 days. Laboratory tests showed markedly increased white blood cell. A diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia was made based on a peripheral blood smear and flow cytometry.

Micromolar levels of CG0006 induced cell death in several breast, central nervous system, colon, hematopoietic, lung, melanoma, ovarian, prostatic, renal, and stomach cancer cell lines. We further analyzed cell death mechanisms activated by CG0006 in HCT116 (colon cancer) and K562 (leukemia) cells. First, to test the activity of CG0006, we analyzed acetylation of substrates of HDACs and effect on gene expression. CG0006 increased acetylation of histone 3, histone 4, and tubulin in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner in both HCT116 and K562 cells. Moreover, CG0006 increased the mRNA level of p21 and decreased that of Bcl-xl efficiently in HCT116 cells. Cell cycle analysis showed G2-M arrest, and increased apoptosis in populations of HCT116 and K562 cells treated with CG0006. Western blot analysis showed that CG0006 increased levels of p21 in HCT116 cells and of p21 and p27 in K562 cells. In addition, CG0006 activated caspase-9, caspase-3, and caspase-8.

TEL-PDGFRbeta (TPbeta, also called ETV6-PDGFRB) is a hybrid protein produced by the t(5;12) translocation, FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha (FPalpha) results from a deletion on chromosome 4q12 and ZNF198-FGFR1 is created by the t(8;13) translocation. These fusion proteins are found in patients with myeloid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia. Wild-type receptor tyrosine kinases are efficiently targeted for degradation upon activation, in a process that requires Cbl-mediated monoubiquitination of receptor lysines. Since protein degradation pathways have been identified as useful targets for cancer therapy, the aim of this study was to compare the degradation of hybrid and wild-type receptor tyrosine kinases. DESIGN AND METHODS: We used Ba/F3 as a model cell line, as well as leukocytes from two patients, to analyze hybrid protein degradation. RESULTS: In contrast to the corresponding wild-type receptors, which are quickly degraded upon activation, we observed that TPbeta, FPalpha and the ZNF198-FGFR1 hybrids escaped down-regulation in Ba/F3 cells. The high stability of TPbeta and FPalpha hybrid proteins was confirmed in leukocytes from leukemia patients. Ubiquitination of TPbeta and FPalpha was much reduced compared to that of wild-type receptors, despite marked Cbl phosphorylation in cells expressing hybrid receptors. The fusion of a destabilizing domain to TPbeta induced protein degradation. Instability was reverted by adding the destabilizing domain ligand, Shield1. The destabilization of this modified TPbeta reduced cell transformation and STAT5 activation. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that chimeric receptor tyrosine kinases escape ubiquitination and down-regulation and that their stabilization is critical to efficient stimulation of cell proliferation.","['Toffalini, Federica', 'Kallin, Anders', 'Vandenberghe, Peter', 'Pierre, Pascal', 'Michaux, Lucienne', 'Cools, Jan', 'Demoulin, Jean-Baptiste']","['Toffalini F', 'Kallin A', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Pierre P', 'Michaux L', 'Cools J', 'Demoulin JB']","['Universite Catholique de Louvain, de Duve Institute, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC2719031,2009/08/01 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/01 09:00'],"['2009/08/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['94/8/1085 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2008.001149 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Aug;94(8):1085-93. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2008.001149.,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis)', '0 (TEL-PDGFRbeta fusion protein, human)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', '1B56C968OA (Becaplermin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Becaplermin', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/blood', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/blood', 'Leukocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', '*Ubiquitination', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The vast majority of KIT mutation detection procedures are time-consuming, costly, or with a high lower limit of detection. High-resolution melting (HRM) is a gene scanning method that combines simplicity and rapid identification of genetic variants. We describe an HRM method for the simultaneous screening of exons 8 and 17 KIT mutations and report the results obtained in 69 core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia patients. Mutation detection was compared with sequencing as the gold standard. The HRM method used high-resolution melting master reagents (Roche) and the LightCycler 480 (Roche) platform. HRM was reproducible, showed a lower limit of detection of 1%, and discriminated all patients with mutated KIT from controls without false positive or false negative results. Additionally, most of the mutations were differentiated from the other mutations. KIT mutations were present in 15.9% of patients, showing a higher incidence in inv(16) (25.8%) than in t(8;21) (7.9%). The presence of a KIT mutation was associated with a high white blood cell count, and adult patients with an exon 17 mutation had a higher incidence of relapse. These findings verify that HRM is a reliable, rapid, and sensitive method for KIT mutation screening. Furthermore, our study corroborates the unfavorable prognosis associated with exon 17 KIT mutations.","['Fuster, Oscar', 'Barragan, Eva', 'Bolufer, Pascual', 'Cervera, Jose', 'Larrayoz, Maria Jose', 'Jimenez-Velasco, Antonio', 'Martinez-Lopez, Joaquin', 'Valencia, Ana', 'Moscardo, Federico', 'Sanz, Miguel Angel']","['Fuster O', 'Barragan E', 'Bolufer P', 'Cervera J', 'Larrayoz MJ', 'Jimenez-Velasco A', 'Martinez-Lopez J', 'Valencia A', 'Moscardo F', 'Sanz MA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Department of Medical Pathology, Escuela de enfermeria 7 planta.

However, additional changes using available drugs are unlikely to provide significant improvement in survival. New therapies are warranted given the risk of severe therapy-associated toxicities including infertility, organ damage, and secondary malignancy. Here, we report ectopic expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase Mer in pediatric B-cell ALL. Inhibition of Mer prevented Erk 1/2 activation, increased the sensitivity of B-ALL cells to cytotoxic agents in vitro by promoting apoptosis, and delayed disease onset in a mouse model of leukemia. In addition, we discovered cross-talk between the Mer and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways. Our results identify Mer as a novel therapeutic target in ALL and suggest that inhibitors of Mer will interact synergistically with currently used therapies. This strategy may allow for dose reduction resulting in decreased toxicity and increased survival rates. Mer is aberrantly expressed in numerous other malignancies suggesting that this approach may have broad applications.","['Linger, Rachel M A', 'DeRyckere, Deborah', 'Brandao, Luis', 'Sawczyn, Kelly K', 'Jacobsen, Kristen M', 'Liang, Xiayuan', 'Keating, Amy K', 'Graham, Douglas K']","['Linger RM', 'DeRyckere D', 'Brandao L', 'Sawczyn KK', 'Jacobsen KM', 'Liang X', 'Keating AK', 'Graham DK']","['Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology, Oncology, and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",20090730,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC2927045,2009/08/01 09:00,2009/10/29 06:00,['2009/08/01 09:00'],"['2009/08/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36877-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-03-209247 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Sep 24;114(13):2678-87. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-03-209247.

Recently, Id1 has been identified as a common downstream target of several constitutively activated oncogenic tyrosine kinase, such as FLT3 internal tandem duplication, in leukemia cells. We analyzed Id1 expression as possible prognostic factor in 237 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. High Id1 expression was associated with older age (P = .009) and with FLT3 internal tandem duplication (P = .003). However, 61% of the patients in the group of FLT3(-) AML were Id1(+), suggesting that other tyrosine kinases are involved. In whole population, high Id1 expression independently predicted shorter disease-free survival (P = .05) and overall survival (P = .003). In young patients (age <OR= 60 years) with normal cytogenetics, Id1(+) was, in multivariate analysis, associated with lower complete remission rates (P = .02), shorter disease-free survival (P = .02), and overall survival (P = .006). In conclusion, our data provide a new molecular marker for refining the risk classification of AML, especially in young patients with normal cytogenetic. Id1(-) patients with normal cytogenetic should be classified as favorable-risk leukemia. Id1, as a downstream target of constitutively activated tyrosine kinase, could be a suitable candidate for targeted therapy.","['Tang, Ruoping', 'Hirsch, Pierre', 'Fava, Fanny', 'Lapusan, Simona', 'Marzac, Christophe', 'Teyssandier, Irene', 'Pardo, Julia', 'Marie, Jean-Pierre', 'Legrand, Ollivier']","['Tang R', 'Hirsch P', 'Fava F', 'Lapusan S', 'Marzac C', 'Teyssandier I', 'Pardo J', 'Marie JP', 'Legrand O']","[""Departement d'Hematologie, Hotel-Dieu, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090730,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/08/01 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/01 09:00'],"['2009/08/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36837-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-05-223115 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Oct 1;114(14):2993-3000. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-05-223115.

Twelve of 67 (18%) patients without the 17p deletion showed a TP53 mutation and 50% showed evidence of uniparental disomy. A total of 75% of cases with TP53 mutation (without 17p-) showed clonal evolution/expansion. TP53 mutations had no impact on overall survival (P = .48).

To investigate the mechanisms underlying refractory CLL beyond p53, we studied cases without 17p-/TP53 mutation in detail. In several paired samples before and after F-refractory disease, no change in p21/p53 induction was observed after DNA damage. Although TP53 mutations and 17p deletions are found in a high proportion of F-refractory CLL, more than half of the cases cannot be explained by p53 defects (deletion or mutation), and alternative mechanisms need to be investigated.

This study uses voxel-based analyses (VBA) of T2-weighted imaging of patients during treatment to identify which WM regions are preferentially damaged. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two sets of conventional T2-weighted axial images were acquired on a 1.5T MR imaging scanner from 197 consecutive patients (85 female, 112 male; aged 1.0-18.9 years) enrolled on an institutional ALL treatment protocol. Images were acquired after completion of induction therapy and after the final of the 4 courses of intravenous high-dose methotrexate in consolidation therapy (3.9 +/- 0.8 months apart). Voxel-wise statistical testing of the incremental change between normalized longitudinal T2 images was performed with radiologist reading (normal or abnormal) and treatment risk-group as covariates. RESULTS: Two highly significant bilateral clusters of T2 signal intensity change were identified in both 1-group and 2-group analyses. The regions were symmetric in size, shape, and average signal intensity. Increased T2-weighted signal intensity from these regions both within and between examinations were nonlinear functions of age at examination, and the difference between the examinations was greater for older subjects who received more intense therapy. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses identified specific WM tracts involving predominantly the anterior, superior, and posterior corona radiata and superior longitudinal fasciculus, which were at increased risk for the development of T2-weighted hyperintensities during therapy for childhood ALL. These vulnerable regions may be the cause of subsequent cognitive difficulties consistently observed in survivors.","['Reddick, W E', 'Glass, J O', 'Johnson, D P', 'Laningham, F H', 'Pui, C-H']","['Reddick WE', 'Glass JO', 'Johnson DP', 'Laningham FH', 'Pui CH']","[""Division of Translational Imaging Research, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA. gene.reddick@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090730,United States,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,AJNR.

While some patients never require treatment or can be managed effectively with palliative chemotherapy, others experience early disease progression and death. The development of new prognostic markers has helped in the identification of patients with high risk disease, even among those diagnosed at early stage. Recent prospective trials have established chemo-immunotherapy combinations as the new standard of care for CLL patients requiring therapy. Unfortunately, patients whose tumour cells have certain genomic aberrations, such as a chromosome 17 deletion, have a disease that is frequently refractory to conventional therapy and should have their treatment tailored accordingly. Younger patients with high risk disease should be referred for allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation if they have an appropriate donor. For the remaining high risk patients, a number of new compounds are emerging, which could lead to further improvement in their outcome.","['Delgado, Julio', 'Briones, Javier', 'Sierra, Jorge']","['Delgado J', 'Briones J', 'Sierra J']","['Department of Haematology, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Sant Antoni Maria Claret 167, Barcelona 08025, Spain. jdelgadog@santpau.cat']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090729,England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,,2009/08/01 09:00,2009/10/22 06:00,['2009/08/01 09:00'],"['2009/08/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0268-960X(09)00039-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.blre.2009.07.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2009 Sep;23(5):217-24. doi: 10.1016/j.blre.2009.07.001.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of a plant alkaloid, homoharringtonine, in combination with cytarabine as an induction therapy for AML in elderly patients (> or =60 years). RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were treated with the HA regimen consisting of homoharringtonine (2 mg/m2/day for 7 days) and cytarabine (Ara-C, 100 mg/m2/day for 7 days). The overall response rate was 56.5% with complete remission (CR) rate of 39.1% and partial remission of 17.4%. There was no early death in this cohort of patients. The estimated median overall survival (OS) time of all patients was (12.0 +/- 3.0) months. The estimated OS time of the CR patients was 15 months. The estimated one-year OS rate of all patients treated with HA protocol was (49.3 +/- 13.5) %. The estimated one-year OS rate of the CR patients was (62.5 +/- 17.1) %. CONCLUSION: HA is a suitable induction regimen for elderly patients with AML, with relatively low toxicity and reasonable response rate.","['Wang, Jianmin', 'Lu, Shuqing', 'Yang, Jianmin', 'Song, Xianmin', 'Chen, Li', 'Huang, Chongmei', 'Hou, Jun', 'Zhang, Weiping']","['Wang J', 'Lu S', 'Yang J', 'Song X', 'Chen L', 'Huang C', 'Hou J', 'Zhang W']","['Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, PR China. jmwang@medmail.com.cn']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20090730,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,PMC2731035,2009/08/01 09:00,2010/06/16 06:00,['2009/08/01 09:00'],"['2009/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-2-32 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-2-32 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2009 Jul 30;2:32. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-2-32.,"['0 (Harringtonines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,"['*Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'China/epidemiology', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Harringtonines/*administration & dosage', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/epidemiology/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They bind client proteins to assist in protein stabilization, translocation of polypeptides across cell membranes and recovery of proteins from aggregates. Heat shock protein inhibitors are a diverse group of novel agents that have been demonstrated to have pro-apoptotic effects on malignant cells through inhibition of ATP binding on the ATP/ADP-binding pocket of the heat shock protein. Initial development of heat shock protein 90 inhibitors, geldanamycin and 17-AAG, were limited by hepatotoxicity and the need for solvent carrying agents. In contrast, retaspimycin, or IPI-504, a derivative of geldanamycin and 17-AAG, is highly soluble in water and generally well tolerated. In Phase I/II trials, retaspimycin has shown activity in NSCLC and gastrointestinal stromal tumor. The most promising activity was observed in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Phase I/II trials are currently underway to evaluate the dosing schedules and activity of IPI-504 in breast cancer.

Most were atypical for the category by histology, phenotype, or abnormally high turnover rate. Seven low-grade lesions defied easy categorization and were characterized only as ""atypical histiocytic lesion"" following ALL. For those evaluated, the molecular signature of the prior leukemia was present in the histiocytic lesion. In 3 of 15 patients, the leukemia and histiocytic lesion shared immunoglobulin H or monoclonal TCR gene rearrangements and, in 4 of 15 patients, clonal identity was documented by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Four patients died of progressive disease, 3 of whom had histiocytic sarcoma and 1 who had an atypical lesion. One patient died of recurrent ALL. The other 10 patients are alive, 7 after recurrences and treatment with surgery and/or chemotherapy. The post-ALL lesions are more aggressive than their native counterparts, but despite the demonstration of the presence of the leukemia signature in 7 of 15 patients, the prognosis is generally favorable, except for patients with histiocytic sarcoma.

In fact, general, relapse-free, and uneventful survival rates in patients with atypical abnormalities were significantly lower that in the remaining patients with t(8;21) AML. Poor survival was associated not only with early relapses but also with high mortality from fatal infections soon after onset of treatment. The incidence of fatal infections in this group was significantly higher than in patients without atypical abnormalities (p = 0.027).

METHODS: Retrospectively analyze the clinical and laboratory data of 27 patients with T-LGLL diagnosed between 1999 and 2007 in our hospital. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 48 years. All patients were symptomatic, mainly complaining of fatigue. Of the 27 patients, 14 (51.9%) had splenomegaly, and 4(14.8%) hepatomegaly. Rheumatoid arthritis was not present in any patients. The most frequent hematological abnormality was anemia (24 patients, 88.9%) with a median Hb level of 57.5 g/L. Pure red cell aplasia was found in 18 patients (66.67%). The median WBC count was 4.24 x 10(9)/L and 19 cases were neutropenia (ANC < 1.5 x 10(9)/L). The median LGL count in peripheral blood was 1.45 x 10(9)/L and most of them (77.8%) were less than 2.0 x 10(9)/L. Twenty-two patients (81.5%) showed the CD3+ CD8+ CD57+ CD56(-) LGL phenotype.

METHODS: Plasma fibrinogen concentration was determined with the conventional method, and the levels of fibrin degradation products (FDP) and D-dimer were quantified with ELISA. Plasminogen was measured by chromogenic assay. Cell surface expression of Annexin II and u-PAR and their mRNA levels were measured by flow cytometry and real time-PCR, respectively. RESULTS: The levels of FDP and D-dimer in APL were remarkably higher in APL patients than that in normal controls, while fibrinogen and plasminogen were lower. Both Annexin II and u-PAR were highly expressed on APL cells, which declined after treatment with ATRA and/or ATO, but remained higher than those on normal bone marrow mononuclear cells. CONCLUSION: Abnormally high levels of Annexin II and u-PAR expression on APL cells may contribute to the increased production of plasmin, leading to primary hyperfibrinolysis in APL. ATRA and ATO therapy induces down-regulation of Annexin II and u-PAR expression, which may be contribute, at least in part, to the relief of the hemorrhagic complications in APL.","['Liu, Yan-Hui', 'Wang, Zhao-Yue', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Dai, Lan', 'Shen, Wen-Hong', 'Ruan, Chang-Geng']","['Liu YH', 'Wang ZY', 'Zhang W', 'Dai L', 'Shen WH', 'Ruan CG']","['First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Ministry of Health, Suzhou 215006, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,2009/08/01 09:00,2010/06/04 06:00,['2009/08/01 09:00'],"['2009/08/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Mar;30(3):145-9.,"['0 (Annexin A2)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Annexin A2/analysis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Fibrinolysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/analysis', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its use in medicine is widespread, especially in diagnostics of inherited disorders and cancer related diseases. Development of DNA diagnostics has been strongly accelerated by publication of the human genome sequence in 2001. During the last few years one can observe rapid development of novel sequencing technologies, which have led to the introduction of so called ""New Generation Sequencing"". These new technologies based on principles of massive parallel sequencing (e.g. Roche/454, Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx, Life Technologies SOLiD 3 and others) enable a massive increase of sequencing capacity and in parallel also a fundamental decrease of costs. This major technological breakthrough allowed development of the whole-genome sequencing including analyses of individual human genomes. It also started the era of personal genomics. The first sequenced individual human genomes belonged to famous geneticists J. C. Venter (2007) and J. D. Watson (2008), but they were rapidly followed by sequencing analyses of other individuals from various ethnic groups. These studies brought substantial information about interpersonal differences in genome structure (through characterization of nucleotide polymorphisms, DNA deletions and amplifications etc.). Sequencing of cancer cell genomes, e.g. acute myeloid leukemia has already brought first important clinically relevant results. Although currently we are still unable to interpret the relevance of all detected genome variants, it is obvious, that the possibility to sequence individual human genomes represents a fundamental breakthrough not only in DNA diagnostics but also in clinical medicine.","['Pospisilova, S', 'Tichy, B', 'Mayer, J']","['Pospisilova S', 'Tichy B', 'Mayer J']","['Centrum molekularni biologie a genove terapie, Interni hematoonkologicka klinika LF MU a FN Brno. sarka.pospisilova@fnbrno.cz']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,,2009/08/01 09:00,2009/08/26 09:00,['2009/08/01 09:00'],"['2009/08/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 2009;148(7):296-302.,,IM,"['*Genome, Human', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Humans', '*Sequence Analysis, DNA']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sekvenovani lidskeho genomu--technologie nove generace aneb budeme rutinne sekvenovat lidske genomy?,,,,

METHODS: Age of patient, disease stage, time interval from diagnosis to transplant, donor type, and donor-recipient sex combination were used to establish a score from 0 to 7 points. Its validity was tested in 56,505 patients, 33,113 (58%) male, 23,392 female, median age 33 years (range, 0.5-77 years), with an allogeneic HSCT for a hematological disorder between 1980 and 2005. RESULTS: Survival probability at 5 years decreased from 71% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69%-73%) for risk score 0 for the whole cohort (75%, 95% CI, 72%-78% for the most recent time cohort) to 24% (95% CI, 21%-27% for risk score 6 and 7; 25%, 95% CI, 22%-29% most recent cohort). Transplant-related mortality increased from 15% (95% CI, 14%-17%) for risk score 0 (11%, 95% CI, 9%-13%, most recent cohort) to 47% with risk score 6 and 7 (95% CI, 44%-50%) for the whole cohort (45%, 95% CI, 42%-48%, most recent cohort). The risk score was predictive in all disease categories, over all time periods, and was not altered by transplant techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Five well-defined pretransplant patient and donor characteristics give a reasonable risk estimate of allogeneic HSCT. This risk score can provide a basis for the decision between transplant and nontransplant strategies.","['Gratwohl, Alois', 'Stern, Martin', 'Brand, Ronald', 'Apperley, Jane', 'Baldomero, Helen', 'de Witte, Theo', 'Dini, Giorgio', 'Rocha, Vanderson', 'Passweg, Jakob', 'Sureda, Anna', 'Tichelli, Andre', 'Niederwieser, Dietger']","['Gratwohl A', 'Stern M', 'Brand R', 'Apperley J', 'Baldomero H', 'de Witte T', 'Dini G', 'Rocha V', 'Passweg J', 'Sureda A', 'Tichelli A', 'Niederwieser D']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland. hematology@uhbs.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,2009/07/31 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/31 09:00'],"['2009/07/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.24531 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2009 Oct 15;115(20):4715-26. doi: 10.1002/cncr.24531.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*surgery', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,,,,,,['European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation and the European Leukemia Net'],"['McDonald F', 'McGrath E', 'Jones SM', 'MacHale EJ', 'Chesnel V', 'Kenzey C', 'Gorin NC', 'Ruiz de Elvira C', 'de Souza S', 'Greinix H', 'Lindner B', 'Benesova K', 'Trnkova M', 'Blaise D', 'Marry E', 'Mesnil F', 'Ottinger H', 'Muller C', 'Fuchs K', 'Allgaier S', 'Siebinger A', 'Neidlinger H', 'Bosi A', 'Oneto R', 'Bruno B', 'Schattenberg A', 'v Biezen A', 'Carreras E', 'Espigado I', 'Lopez J', 'Cedillo A', 'Schanz U', 'Baldomero H', 'Buhrfeind E', 'Gurman G', 'Arat M', 'Arpaci F', 'Ertem M', 'Marks D', 'Cornish J', 'Kirkland K', 'Paul R', 'Stockli S', 'Gratwohl A', 'Stern M', 'Brand R', 'Baldomero H', 'de Witte T', 'Dini G', 'Rocha V', 'Passweg J', 'Sureda A', 'Tichelli A', 'Niederwieser D']","['McDonald, F', 'McGrath, E', 'Jones, S M', 'MacHale, E J', 'Chesnel, V', 'Kenzey, C', 'Gorin, N C', 'Ruiz de Elvira, C', 'de Souza, S', 'Greinix, H', 'Lindner, B', 'Benesova, K', 'Trnkova, M', 'Blaise, D', 'Marry, E', 'Mesnil, F', 'Ottinger, H', 'Muller, C', 'Fuchs, K', 'Allgaier, S', 'Siebinger, A', 'Neidlinger, H', 'Bosi, A', 'Oneto, R', 'Bruno, B', 'Schattenberg, A', 'v Biezen, A', 'Carreras, E', 'Espigado, I', 'Lopez, J', 'Cedillo, A', 'Schanz, U', 'Baldomero, H', 'Buhrfeind, E', 'Gurman, G', 'Arat, M', 'Arpaci, F', 'Ertem, M', 'Marks, D', 'Cornish, J', 'Kirkland, K', 'Paul, R', 'Stockli, S', 'Gratwohl, Alois', 'Stern, Martin', 'Brand, Ronald', 'Baldomero, Helen', 'de Witte, Theo', 'Dini, Giorgio', 'Rocha, Vanderson', 'Passweg, Jakob', 'Sureda, Anna', 'Tichelli, Andre', 'Niederwieser, Dietger']",,['Copyright (c) 2009 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,

Data were obtained from registry databases, including information on population coverage and data quality indicators. The International Classification of Childhood Cancer was used. Age-adjusted rates were calculated by world population. Incidence by cancer registry, age, sex, and cancer type were calculated per 1,000,000 children. Age-adjusted rates per 1,000,000 children/adolescents ranged from 92 to 220 among the 14 PBCRs. The principal groups of cancers were leukemia, lymphoma and central nervous tumors. The median incidence rate of childhood cancer in the 14 PBCRs was 154.3 per million; children 1-4 years of age had the highest incidence rates. The Brazilian PBCRs provide important information about pediatric cancer incidence in an emerging country. The observed incidence rates of childhood leukemia were similar to previous reported rates, and the age-specific incidence rates of retinoblastoma (0-4 years of age) were higher than those for developed countries.

In patients with CML, BCR-ABL transcript measurement is the most sensitive method for assessing minimal residual disease. Here, molecular responses were analyzed in 1067 patients with CML-CP treated with dasatinib during phase II/III trials. After 3, 6, 12, and 24 months of follow-up, a major molecular response (MMR) was achieved by 12, 22, 35, and 40% of patients, respectively. The 24-month MMR rate was 34% in patients with resistance or suboptimal response to imatinib (n=829) and 63% in imatinib-intolerant patients (n=238). Among patients who had achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), 72% also achieved MMR. Responses with dasatinib 100 mg once daily were similar to other doses. In landmark analyses, 24-month progression-free survival was higher in patients who had achieved MMR or CCyR at 12 months than in those without MMR or CCyR at 12 months. MMR at 12 months was associated with a longer duration of CCyR. Overall, this analysis shows that dasatinib treatment results in high MMR rates in patients with CML-CP after imatinib failure.","['Hochhaus, A', 'Muller, M C', 'Radich, J', 'Branford, S', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Hanfstein, B', 'Rousselot, P', 'Kim, D-W', 'Lipton, J H', 'Bleickardt, E', 'Lambert, A', 'Hughes, T P']","['Hochhaus A', 'Muller MC', 'Radich J', 'Branford S', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Hanfstein B', 'Rousselot P', 'Kim DW', 'Lipton JH', 'Bleickardt E', 'Lambert A', 'Hughes TP']","['III.

ABT-737 is a BH3 mimetic compound that selectively targets BCL2 and BCLX(L). In the present work, we report that ABT-737 is highly effective (LC(50)<50 nM) as a single agent against most (21/30) primary CLL samples, but that a sizable minority is relatively insensitive. In vitro sensitivity to ABT-737 could not be simply predicted by the patients' clinical features, including response to prior therapy or known prognostic markers (CD38 expression, 17p deletion), or the relative expression of BCL2 family proteins (BCL2, MCL1, BAX, BIM). Strikingly, co-incubation with cytotoxic agents (dexamethasone, etoposide, fludarabine, doxorubicin) sensitized most CLL samples to ABT-737, but this could not be predicted by responses to either ABT-737 or the cytotoxic agent alone. Of 17 samples least sensitive to ABT-737, 13 were sensitized by co-treatment with at least one cytotoxic agent. These data indicate that combination of ABT-737 with a second anti-leukemic agent would improve response rates and suggest a potential role for combination therapies that include BH3 mimetics for the treatment of this disease.","['Mason, K D', 'Khaw, S L', 'Rayeroux, K C', 'Chew, E', 'Lee, E F', 'Fairlie, W D', 'Grigg, A P', 'Seymour, J F', 'Szer, J', 'Huang, D C S', 'Roberts, A W']","['Mason KD', 'Khaw SL', 'Rayeroux KC', 'Chew E', 'Lee EF', 'Fairlie WD', 'Grigg AP', 'Seymour JF', 'Szer J', 'Huang DC', 'Roberts AW']","['Divisions of Cancer and Haematology and Molecular Genetics of Cancer, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090730,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2009/07/31 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/31 09:00'],"['2009/07/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009151 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.151 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Nov;23(11):2034-41. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.151.

Quantitative MRD levels assessed by both techniques were closely correlated irrespective of therapy (r=0.95). The sensitivity and specificity of MRD flow was not influenced by the presence of rituximab. With 58.9% positive and 26.4% negative samples by both techniques, 85.3% of assessments (452/530) were qualitatively concordant between MRD flow and RQ-PCR.

First, to address recent controversies on Oct4 expression in cells isolated from adult organs, we show here evidence that Oct4 promoter in bone marrow (BM)-derived VSELs has an open chromatin structure and is actively transcribed. Next, to explain VSELs quiescence and lack of teratoma formation, we demonstrate a unique DNA methylation pattern at some developmentally crucial imprinted genes, showing hypomethylation/erasure of imprints in paternally methylated and hypermethylation of imprints in maternally methylated ones. These epigenetic characteristics leading to upregulation in VSELs of H19 and p57(KIP2) (also known as Cdkn1c) and repression of Igf2 and Rasgrf1 explain VSEL's quiescent status. Interestingly, this unique pattern in imprinted gene methylation is reverted in cocultures with a C2C12 supportive cell-line when VSELs are induced to form VSEL-derived spheres (VSEL-DSs) enriched for stem cells able to differentiate into all three germ layers. Therefore, we suggest that the proliferative/developmental potential of Oct4(+) VSELs is epigenetically regulated by expression of Oct4 and some imprinted genes, and postulate that restoring the proper methylation pattern of imprinted genes will be a crucial step for using these cells in regenerative medicine.","['Shin, D M', 'Zuba-Surma, E K', 'Wu, W', 'Ratajczak, J', 'Wysoczynski, M', 'Ratajczak, M Z', 'Kucia, M']","['Shin DM', 'Zuba-Surma EK', 'Wu W', 'Ratajczak J', 'Wysoczynski M', 'Ratajczak MZ', 'Kucia M']","['Stem Cell Institute at the James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090730,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC2783188,2009/07/31 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/31 09:00'],"['2009/07/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009153 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.153 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Nov;23(11):2042-51. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.153.

In this work, we have explored the impact of TLR ligands (TLR-L) on human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). We show that HSCs and HPCs have a comparable pattern of expression of TLR transcripts characterized by the predominance of TLR1, -2, -3, -4 and -6. In long-term cultures of HSCs, HPCs and stromal cells, most TLR-L profoundly inhibited B-cell development while preserving or enhancing the production of myeloid cells. In short-term cultures, the TLR1/2 ligand PAM(3)CSK(4) induced a large proportion of HPCs to express markers of the myelomonocytic lineage. PAM(3)CSK(4) induced only marginal expression of myeloid lineage markers on HSCs but promoted their myeloid commitment as revealed by their acquisition of the phenotype of multi- and bipotential myeloid progenitors and by upregulation of the transcription factors PU.1, C/EBPalpha and GATA-1. Our results suggest that TLR agonists can bias the lineage commitment of human HSCs and shift the differentiation of lineage-committed progenitors to favor myelopoiesis at the expense of lymphoid B-cell development.","['De Luca, K', 'Frances-Duvert, V', 'Asensio, M-J', 'Ihsani, R', 'Debien, E', 'Taillardet, M', 'Verhoeyen, E', 'Bella, C', 'Lantheaume, S', 'Genestier, L', 'Defrance, T']","['De Luca K', 'Frances-Duvert V', 'Asensio MJ', 'Ihsani R', 'Debien E', 'Taillardet M', 'Verhoeyen E', 'Bella C', 'Lantheaume S', 'Genestier L', 'Defrance T']","['INSERM, U851, 21 Avenue Tony Garnier, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090730,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2009/07/31 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/31 09:00'],"['2009/07/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009155 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.155 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Nov;23(11):2063-74. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.155.

The donor T-cell infusions associated with such transplantation can promote post-transplantation immune reconstitution and control residual disease. METHODS: We identified 43 patients who underwent haploidentical transplantation and infusion of donor T cells for acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome and conducted post-transplantation studies that included morphologic examination of bone marrow, assessment of hematopoietic chimerism with the use of short-tandem-repeat amplification, and HLA typing. The genomic rearrangements in mutant variants of leukemia were studied with the use of genomic HLA typing, microsatellite mapping, and single-nucleotide-polymorphism arrays. The post-transplantation immune responses against the original cells and the mutated leukemic cells were analyzed with the use of mixed lymphocyte cultures. RESULTS: In 5 of 17 patients with leukemia relapse after haploidentical transplantation and infusion of donor T cells, we identified mutant variants of the original leukemic cells. In the mutant leukemic cells, the HLA haplotype that differed from the donor's haplotype had been lost because of acquired uniparental disomy of chromosome 6p. T cells from the donor and the patient after transplantation did not recognize the mutant leukemic cells, whereas the original leukemic cells taken at the time of diagnosis were efficiently recognized and killed. CONCLUSIONS: After transplantation of haploidentical hematopoietic stem cells and infusion of donor T cells, leukemic cells can escape from the donor's antileukemic T cells through the loss of the mismatched HLA haplotype. This event leads to relapse.","['Vago, Luca', 'Perna, Serena Kimi', 'Zanussi, Monica', 'Mazzi, Benedetta', 'Barlassina, Cristina', 'Stanghellini, Maria Teresa Lupo', 'Perrelli, Nicola Flavio', 'Cosentino, Cristian', 'Torri, Federica', 'Angius, Andrea', 'Forno, Barbara', 'Casucci, Monica', 'Bernardi, Massimo', 'Peccatori, Jacopo', 'Corti, Consuelo', 'Bondanza, Attilio', 'Ferrari, Maurizio', 'Rossini, Silvano', 'Roncarolo, Maria Grazia', 'Bordignon, Claudio', 'Bonini, Chiara', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Fleischhauer, Katharina']","['Vago L', 'Perna SK', 'Zanussi M', 'Mazzi B', 'Barlassina C', 'Stanghellini MT', 'Perrelli NF', 'Cosentino C', 'Torri F', 'Angius A', 'Forno B', 'Casucci M', 'Bernardi M', 'Peccatori J', 'Corti C', 'Bondanza A', 'Ferrari M', 'Rossini S', 'Roncarolo MG', 'Bordignon C', 'Bonini C', 'Ciceri F', 'Fleischhauer K']","['Hospital San Raffaele-Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,,2009/07/31 09:00,2009/08/07 09:00,['2009/07/31 09:00'],"['2009/07/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/07 09:00 [medline]']","['361/5/478 [pii]', '10.1056/NEJMoa0811036 [doi]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2009 Jul 30;361(5):478-88. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa0811036.,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*genetics/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*genetics', 'Haplotypes', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation Chimera']",,,['GGP08201/TI_/Telethon/Italy'],,,['N Engl J Med. 2009 Jul 30;361(5):524-5.

The 2 abnormalities result in deregulated expression of the cytokine receptor, cytokine receptor-like factor 2, CRLF2 (also known as thymic stromal-derived lymphopoietin receptor, TSLPR). Overexpression of CRLF2 was associated with activation of the JAK-STAT pathway in cell lines and transduced primary B-cell progenitors, sustaining their proliferation and indicating a causal role of CRLF2 overexpression in lymphoid transformation.

Conversely, cells showing little endogenous expression of miR-21 or miR-155 were transduced by the use of lentiviral vectors, leading to their overexpression. Reducing expression of miR-21 or miR-155 led to up-regulation of phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), or Src homology-2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase 1 (SHIP1). ASO-21- and ASO-155-treated cell lines all showed down-regulation of phosphorylated AKT(ser473). Moreover, transduction with either miR-21 or miR-155 led to down-regulation of PTEN and PDCD4 or SHIP1 with up-regulation of phosphorylated AKT(ser473). Collectively, these results provide important new insight into the pathogenesis of NK-cell lymphoma/leukemia and suggest targeting miR-21 and/or miR-155 may represent a useful approach to treating NK-cell lymphoma/leukemia.","['Yamanaka, Yasuo', 'Tagawa, Hiroyuki', 'Takahashi, Naoto', 'Watanabe, Atsushi', 'Guo, Yong-Mei', 'Iwamoto, Keiko', 'Yamashita, Junsuke', 'Saitoh, Hirobumi', 'Kameoka, Yoshihiro', 'Shimizu, Norio', 'Ichinohasama, Ryo', 'Sawada, Ken-ichi']","['Yamanaka Y', 'Tagawa H', 'Takahashi N', 'Watanabe A', 'Guo YM', 'Iwamoto K', 'Yamashita J', 'Saitoh H', 'Kameoka Y', 'Shimizu N', 'Ichinohasama R', 'Sawada K']","['Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090729,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/07/31 09:00,2009/10/29 06:00,['2009/07/31 09:00'],"['2009/07/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36802-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-06-222794 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Oct 8;114(15):3265-75. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-06-222794.

Exposure to imatinib while pregnant may cause serious fetal malformations and interferon-alpha is sometimes associated with side effects. Furthermore, little is known of the possibility that BCR/ABL-positive cells might be passed to the fetus and the role of the treatment given to the pregnant mother. DESIGN AND METHODS: Detection of BCR-ABL transcripts in the peripheral blood of the mother, the newborn and the cord blood was performed by quantitative real time PCR and FISH. RESULTS: A patient with CML diagnosed at the beginning of pregnancy was treated with leukapheresis at 31 weeks of gestation until delivery without any untoward effects. Since no tyrosine kinase inhibitor was administered BCR-ABL transcripts contamination of the cord blood and peripheral blood of the newborn was a reasonable concern. In practice no transcripts were detected in the cord blood or in the peripheral blood of the newborn at birth, at 1 month or 3 at months of age despite the fact that throughout her pregnancy and on the day of delivery the mother had 90% BCR/ABL positive cells in her blood. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Leukapheresis does not eliminate the malignant clone; however the absence of BCR-ABL transcripts in the peripheral blood of the neonate and in the cord blood supports the view that transmission of CML to a fetus is improbable even if the mother's treatment during pregnancy is suboptimal.","['Salomon, Ophira', 'Tohami, Tali', 'Trakhtenbrot, Luba', 'Meirov, Rita', 'Kneller, Abraham', 'Berkowitz, Miriam', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Sivan, Eyal', 'Goldman, John M', 'Rechavi, Gideon', 'Amariglio, Ninette']","['Salomon O', 'Tohami T', 'Trakhtenbrot L', 'Meirov R', 'Kneller A', 'Berkowitz M', 'Nagler A', 'Sivan E', 'Goldman JM', 'Rechavi G', 'Amariglio N']",,['eng'],['Letter'],20090728,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,2009/07/31 09:00,2010/03/11 06:00,['2009/07/31 09:00'],"['2009/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/02 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/31 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00353-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.07.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Feb;34(2):e78-81. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.07.010.

Using immunocytochemistry, we show that, after a single i.v. injection, DM accumulates in the nuclei of matrix cells and in the outer root sheath of hair follicles. DM-positive matrix cells are detectable up to 48 h after injection and exhibit a characteristic granular morphology, which is not observed in saline-injected controls. TUNEL-staining has revealed that DM injection induces programmed cell death (PCD) in rat hair follicles. Cells undergoing PCD are detectable as late as 5 days postinjection in both the matrix and outer root sheath. Newly developed double-staining has shown that some of the DM-positive matrix cell nuclei are also TUNEL-positive. Staining for activated caspase-3 has demonstrated immunopositive cells following DM administration both in the matrix and in the outer root sheath. Ultrastructural immunocytochemistry has shown the presence of DM-positive cells with two different types of morphology. About half of the immunopositive cells exhibit a morphology typical of classical apoptosis (PCD type 1), whereas the other half show signs of autophagic cell death (PCD type 2). Interestingly, little, if any, DM accumulation or apoptosis has been detected in the dermal hair papillae. This may have a bearing on potential regeneration of the hair follicles. Thus, DM accumulates in a characteristic pattern in hair follicles. This accumulation is associated with the induction of two morphologically distinct forms of PCD.","['Shin, Masashi', 'Larsson, Lars-Inge', 'Hougaard, David M', 'Fujiwara, Kunio']","['Shin M', 'Larsson LI', 'Hougaard DM', 'Fujiwara K']","['Department of Applied Life Science, Faculty of Biotechnology and Life Science, Sojo University, Ikeda, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090729,Germany,Cell Tissue Res,Cell and tissue research,0417625,,2009/07/30 09:00,2009/12/24 06:00,['2009/07/30 09:00'],"['2008/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00441-009-0840-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Tissue Res. 2009 Sep;337(3):429-38. doi: 10.1007/s00441-009-0840-8.

Interestingly, in myeloid bone marrow cells chromosomes 8 (di- and trisomic) and 21 tended to co-localize with their homologue chromosome(s), rather than to be separated.

The relationships are cell type-dependent and have not been fully elucidated. We examined the effects of Notch activation induced by a recombinant Notch ligand, Delta-like1 (Dll1), on the NF-kappaB activity in two acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. We found that Delta1-induced Notch activation activated the NF-kappaB pathway in THP-1 cells. Regarding the possible mechanisms, Dll1 stimulation increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of some components of the NF-kappaB pathway and induced phosphorylation of IKKalpha/beta, IkappaB and RelA proteins after 24 or 48 h of stimulation. Since the phosphorylation required a long time, it did not appear to be caused by physical interactions between Notch and NF-kappaB proteins, but rather by indirect effects. One possible mechanism for the indirect effects was the observed induction of IL-1beta expression by Dll1 stimulation. On the other hand, Notch activation did not affect NF-kappaB activity in TMD7 cells. RelA was phosphorylated without stimulation, indicating that NF-kappaB was constitutively activated in TMD7 cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate AML cells and use a recombinant Notch ligand to activate Notch. The present findings lead to better understanding of Notch functions, which have not been fully elucidated.","['Itoh, Mai', 'Fu, Lu', 'Tohda, Shuji']","['Itoh M', 'Fu L', 'Tohda S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,,2009/07/30 09:00,2009/09/25 06:00,['2009/07/30 09:00'],"['2009/07/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or_00000482 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2009 Sep;22(3):631-4. doi: 10.3892/or_00000482.,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DLK1 protein, human)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Notch/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show the first evidence for diagnostic performance of the molecule B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (Bmi-1) in breast cancer patients. Only 5 out of 46 non-cancerous samples were positive for Bmi-1 mRNA expression resulting in a sensitivity and specificity of 72.0 and 91.3%, respectively. The mRNA expression was estimated using the cut-off value obtained from the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Further, Bmi-1 mRNA expression was found to be elevated in 97.8% (45/46) of cancerous tissues in comparison to the expression in paired cancerous tissues and non-cancerous tissues obtained from identical patients. Bmi-1 mRNA was found to be highly expressed even in the early clinical stages of breast cancer. Our results suggest that Bmi-1 mRNA might be a new tool to support the diagnosis of breast cancers, irrespective of the clinical stage.","['Saeki, Masachika', 'Kobayashi, Daisuke', 'Tsuji, Naoki', 'Kuribayashi, Kageaki', 'Watanabe, Naoki']","['Saeki M', 'Kobayashi D', 'Tsuji N', 'Kuribayashi K', 'Watanabe N']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Chuo-Ku, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,,2009/07/30 09:00,2009/10/02 06:00,['2009/07/30 09:00'],"['2009/07/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo_00000362 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2009 Sep;35(3):511-5. doi: 10.3892/ijo_00000362.,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'ROC Curve', 'Repressor Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intercellular (between cell) communication networks are particularly relevant in stem cell biology, as stem cell fate decisions (self-renewal, proliferation, lineage specification) are tightly regulated based on physiological demand. We have developed a novel mathematical model of blood stem cell development incorporating cell-level kinetic parameters as functions of secreted molecule-mediated intercellular networks. By relation to quantitative cellular assays, our model is capable of predictively simulating many disparate features of both normal and malignant hematopoiesis, relating internal parameters and microenvironmental variables to measurable cell fate outcomes. Through integrated in silico and experimental analyses, we show that blood stem and progenitor cell fate is regulated by cell-cell feedback, and can be controlled non-cell autonomously by dynamically perturbing intercellular signalling. We extend this concept by demonstrating that variability in the secretion rates of the intercellular regulators is sufficient to explain heterogeneity in culture outputs, and that loss of responsiveness to cell-cell feedback signalling is both necessary and sufficient to induce leukemic transformation in silico.","['Kirouac, Daniel C', 'Madlambayan, Gerard J', 'Yu, Mei', 'Sykes, Edward A', 'Ito, Caryn', 'Zandstra, Peter W']","['Kirouac DC', 'Madlambayan GJ', 'Yu M', 'Sykes EA', 'Ito C', 'Zandstra PW']","['Institute for Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090728,England,Mol Syst Biol,Molecular systems biology,101235389,PMC2724979,2009/07/30 09:00,2009/10/14 06:00,['2009/07/30 09:00'],"['2009/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['msb200949 [pii]', '10.1038/msb.2009.49 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Syst Biol. 2009;5:293. doi: 10.1038/msb.2009.49.

Aberrant expression of oncogenes neighboring the gamma-RV vector insertion site via induction by the enhancer element of the viral long terminal repeats (LTRs) is thought to have played a role in leukemogenesis. Consequently, RV vectors devoid of LTR enhancer elements could prove as safer tools for gene transfer. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the immortalization ability of two RV vectors: one carrying the full-length Moloney leukemia virus (MLV) LTR and one with the same LTR in which the enhancer element was deleted [MLV self-inactivating (SIN)]. Unexpectedly, transduction with MLV SIN resulted in an only slightly and not significant decreased immortalization frequency of primary bone marrow (BM) cultures (about 37%) compared to transduction with MLV (about 48%). Similar to MLV, immortalization by MLV SIN is likely caused by insertional activation of oncogenes including Evi1, Mds1, Mef2c, and Hoxa7. Our results indicate that the MLV SIN, devoid of the LTR enhancer element, was still able to immortalize BM cells by activating nearby gene expression, indicating the need of an accurate selection of the internal promoter to obtain safer SIN RV vectors.","['Bosticardo, Marita', 'Ghosh, Amrita', 'Du, Yang', 'Jenkins, Nancy A', 'Copeland, Neal G', 'Candotti, Fabio']","['Bosticardo M', 'Ghosh A', 'Du Y', 'Jenkins NA', 'Copeland NG', 'Candotti F']","['Genetics and Molecular Biology Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20090728,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,PMC2835037,2009/07/30 09:00,2010/01/14 06:00,['2009/07/30 09:00'],"['2009/07/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-0016(16)30803-6 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2009.172 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2009 Nov;17(11):1910-8. doi: 10.1038/mt.2009.172.

METHOD: Physicians and fellows at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Children's National Medical Center were recruited to participate in Informed Consent Seminars and subsequent half-day booster sessions. Training was followed by a multisite study of informed consent communication. Real-life ICCs were observed and audiotaped, and parents were interviewed after the ICC to ascertain their understanding. Data from the ICC and interview were then coded and analyzed. Trained physician performances were compared with untrained physicians (controls) at two other research sites. Data were collected from 2003 to 2007 at PDI sites and control sites for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 102 cases were included for initial analyses, with 60 cases from the PDI sites and 42 control cases. Fifty-nine cases were included in the final analysis. Findings revealed that trained physicians followed the sequenced approach more often when compared with controls. Similarly, physicians at the PDI sites tended to elicit parental questions and understanding in an open-ended way and clarify parents' questions more frequently than physicians at the control sites. CONCLUSIONS: Academic physicians who are involved in the current transformation of clinical research should be trained to conduct effective ICCs. The ""see one, do one, teach one"" approach is no longer adequate for informed consent.","['Yap, Tsiao Yi', 'Yamokoski, Amy', 'Noll, Robert', 'Drotar, Dennis', 'Zyzanski, Steve', 'Kodish, Eric D']","['Yap TY', 'Yamokoski A', 'Noll R', 'Drotar D', 'Zyzanski S', 'Kodish ED']","[""Children's Hospital Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Acad Med,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,8904605,,2009/07/30 09:00,2009/09/16 06:00,['2009/07/30 09:00'],"['2009/07/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181acfbcd [doi]', '00001888-200908000-00017 [pii]']",ppublish,Acad Med. 2009 Aug;84(8):1036-42. doi: 10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181acfbcd.,,IM,"['Adult', 'Audiovisual Aids', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Communication', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Informed Consent', '*Inservice Training', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Patient Education as Topic/*methods', 'Patient Selection', '*Physician-Patient Relations', '*Professional-Family Relations', '*Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",,,['R01 CA 083267/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['Multi-site Intervention Study to Improve Consent Research Team'],"['Angiolillo A', 'Eder M', 'Feusner J', 'Khayat A', 'Lew G', 'Reilly A', 'Ruccione K']","['Angiolillo, Anne', 'Eder, Michelle', 'Feusner, James', 'Khayat, Anita', 'Lew, Glen', 'Reilly, Anne', 'Ruccione, Kathy']",,,,,,,,

Translocations or down-regulation of RUNX1 have been linked to favorable clinical outcomes in acute leukemias, suggesting that RUNX1 may also play critical roles in chemotherapy responses in acute leukemias; however, the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The median level of RUNX1b transcripts in Down syndrome (DS) children with acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMkL) were 4.4-fold (P < .001) lower than that in non-DS AMkL cases. Short hairpin RNA knockdown of RUNX1 in a non-DS AMkL cell line, Meg-01, resulted in significantly increased sensitivity to cytosine arabinoside, accompanied by significantly decreased expression of PIK3CD, which encodes the delta catalytic subunit of the survival kinase, phosphoinositide 3 (PI3)-kinase. Transcriptional regulation of PIK3CD by RUNX1 was further confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation and promoter reporter gene assays. Further, a PI3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, and cytosine arabinoside synergized in antileukemia effects on Meg-01 and primary pediatric AMkL cells. Our results suggest that RUNX1 may play a critical role in chemotherapy response in AMkL by regulating the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway. Thus, the treatment of AMkL may be improved by integrating PI3-kinase or Akt inhibitors into the chemotherapy of this disease.","['Edwards, Holly', 'Xie, Chengzhi', 'LaFiura, Katherine M', 'Dombkowski, Alan A', 'Buck, Steven A', 'Boerner, Julie L', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Matherly, Larry H', 'Ge, Yubin']","['Edwards H', 'Xie C', 'LaFiura KM', 'Dombkowski AA', 'Buck SA', 'Boerner JL', 'Taub JW', 'Matherly LH', 'Ge Y']","['Developmental Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090728,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC2756129,2009/07/30 09:00,2009/10/29 06:00,['2009/07/30 09:00'],"['2009/07/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36884-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-09-179812 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Sep 24;114(13):2744-52. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-09-179812.

This induces trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3, regulates the expression of HOX genes, and promotes proliferation and aggressiveness of neoplastic cells. In this study, we demonstrate that treatment with the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitor 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep) depletes EZH2 levels, and inhibits trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 in the cultured human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) HL-60 and OCI-AML3 cells and in primary AML cells. DZNep treatment induced p16, p21, p27, and FBXO32 while depleting cyclin E and HOXA9 levels. Similar findings were observed after treatment with small interfering RNA to EZH2. In addition, DZNep treatment induced apoptosis in cultured and primary AML cells. Furthermore, compared with treatment with each agent alone, cotreatment with DZNep and the pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat caused more depletion of EZH2, induced more apoptosis of AML, but not normal CD34(+) bone marrow progenitor cells, and significantly improved survival of nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice with HL-60 leukemia. These findings indicate that the combination of DZNep and panobinostat is effective and relatively selective epigenetic therapy against AML cells.","['Fiskus, Warren', 'Wang, Yongchao', 'Sreekumar, Arun', 'Buckley, Kathleen M', 'Shi, Huidong', 'Jillella, Anand', 'Ustun, Celalettin', 'Rao, Rekha', 'Fernandez, Pravina', 'Chen, Jianguang', 'Balusu, Ramesh', 'Koul, Sanjay', 'Atadja, Peter', 'Marquez, Victor E', 'Bhalla, Kapil N']","['Fiskus W', 'Wang Y', 'Sreekumar A', 'Buckley KM', 'Shi H', 'Jillella A', 'Ustun C', 'Rao R', 'Fernandez P', 'Chen J', 'Balusu R', 'Koul S', 'Atadja P', 'Marquez VE', 'Bhalla KN']","['Medical College of Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, GA30912, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090728,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC2756128,2009/07/30 09:00,2009/10/29 06:00,['2009/07/30 09:00'],"['2009/07/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36883-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-03-213496 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Sep 24;114(13):2733-43. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-03-213496.

The signaling lymphocyte activation molecule-related receptor 2B4 (CD244) is an important regulator of NK cell activation. We investigated whether 2B4-enhanced activation signals can redirect the cytolytic function of human NK cells to NK cell-resistant and autologous leukemia and tumor targets. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In vitro-stimulated NK cells from healthy donors and pediatric leukemia patients were gene modified with CD19 or G(D2)-specific chimeric receptors containing either the T-cell receptor zeta or 2B4 endodomain alone or combined. RESULTS: Chimeric 2B4 signaling alone failed to induce interleukin-2 receptor up-regulation and cytokine secretion but triggered a specific degranulation response. Integration of the 2B4 endodomain into T-cell receptor zeta chimeric receptors significantly enhanced all aspects of the NK cell activation response to antigen-expressing leukemia or neuroblastoma cells, including CD25 up-regulation, secretion of IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, release of cytolytic granules, and growth inhibition, and overcame NK cell resistance of autologous leukemia cells while maintaining antigen specificity. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that the 2B4 receptor has a potent costimulatory effect in NK cells. Antigen-specific 2B4zeta-expressing NK cells may be a powerful new tool for adoptive immunotherapy of leukemia and other malignancies.","['Altvater, Bianca', 'Landmeier, Silke', 'Pscherer, Sibylle', 'Temme, Jaane', 'Schweer, Katharina', 'Kailayangiri, Sareetha', 'Campana, Dario', 'Juergens, Heribert', 'Pule, Martin', 'Rossig, Claudia']","['Altvater B', 'Landmeier S', 'Pscherer S', 'Temme J', 'Schweer K', 'Kailayangiri S', 'Campana D', 'Juergens H', 'Pule M', 'Rossig C']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090728,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,PMC2771629,2009/07/30 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/30 09:00'],"['2009/07/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-08-2810 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2810 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Aug 1;15(15):4857-66. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2810.

We conducted a phase II multicenter study on the combination of the DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-AZA) and the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) in patients with higher risk MDS. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We enrolled 62 patients with MDS (refractory anemia with excess blasts, 39 patients; refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation, 19 patients; and chronic myelomanocytic leukemia (CMML), 4 patients) and an International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) rating of Intermediate-2 (42 patients) or high (20 patients). VPA was given to reach a plasma concentration of >50 microg/mL, then 5-AZA was added s.c. at 75 mg/m(2) for 7 days in eight monthly cycles. RESULTS: The median overall survival was 14.4 months. At a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 0.7-21.0), the disease progressed in 20 patients, with 21% cumulative incidence of progression. Of 26 patients who completed eight cycles, 30.7% obtained complete or partial remission, 15.4% had a major hematologic improvement, whereas 38.5% showed stable disease. Drug-related toxicity was mild. Favorable prognostic factors for survival were IPSS Intermediate-2 and plasma VPA of > or =50 microg/mL (log rank = 0.013 and 0.007, respectively). Analysis of polymorphisms important for the metabolism of the drugs used in the trial showed that carriers of the CYP2C19*2 variant of cytochrome P450 required higher VPA doses to achieve the target VPA plasma concentration of 50 microg/mL on day 1 of 5-AZA treatment (P = 0.0021). CONCLUSION: Our data show that the 5-AZA/VPA combination is active and safe in patients with MDS with a poor prognosis.

Whereas the underlying cause is unknown, epigenetic change of the genome has been suggested as a candidate molecular mechanism for perinatal contributions to later disease risk. We hypothesized that mode of delivery affects epigenetic activity in newborn infants. METHODS: A total of 37 newborn infants were included. Spontaneous vaginal delivery (VD) occurred in 21, and 16 infants were delivered by elective CS. Blood was sampled from the umbilical cord and 3-5 days after birth. DNA-methylation was analyzed in leucocytes. RESULTS: Infants born by CS exhibited higher DNA-methylation in leucocytes compared with that of those born by VD (p < 0.001). After VD, newborn infants exhibited stable levels of DNA-methylation, as evidenced by comparing cord blood values with those 3-5 days after birth (p = 0.55). On postnatal days 3-5, DNA-methylation had decreased in the CS group (p = 0.01) and was no longer significantly different from that of VD (p = 0.10). CONCLUSION: DNA-methylation is higher in infants delivered by CS than in infants vaginally born. Although currently unknown how gene expression is affected, or whether epigenetic differences related to mode of delivery are long-lasting, our findings open a new area of clinical research with potentially important public health implications.","['Schlinzig, T', 'Johansson, S', 'Gunnar, A', 'Ekstrom, T J', 'Norman, M']","['Schlinzig T', 'Johansson S', 'Gunnar A', 'Ekstrom TJ', 'Norman M']","['Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Norway,Acta Paediatr,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",9205968,,2009/07/30 09:00,2009/08/14 09:00,['2009/07/30 09:00'],"['2009/07/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/14 09:00 [medline]']","['APA1371 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1651-2227.2009.01371.x [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Paediatr. 2009 Jul;98(7):1096-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2009.01371.x.,"['9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)']",IM,"['Adult', 'C-Reactive Protein/analysis', 'Cesarean Section/*adverse effects', '*DNA Methylation', 'Delivery, Obstetric', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Folic Acid/analysis', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn/*blood', 'Leukocytes', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",,,,,,['Acta Paediatr. 2009 Jul;98(7):1082-4.

There are 7 core regional medical centers in Tokushima Prefecture. A Tokushima rural medical center's clinical hematology division experienced difficulty in treating patients due to a lack of physicians despite an increasing number of patients with hematological malignancies. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the regional medical supply and demand associated with newly diagnosed hematological malignancies in Tokushima Prefecture, Japan. METHODS: The study investigated the home addresses of patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia, malignant lymphoma and multiple myeloma who were hospitalized in the 7 core Tokushima centers in 2006. The surveyed patients were compared with the estimated number of patients with those diseases that were newly developed, based on a calculation of incidence and population by age group. The survey also investigated the number and distribution of hematologists. RESULTS: A total of 248 patients were newly hospitalized in the 7 core centers in Tokushima Prefecture during the 1 year period. The surveyed number of patients was similar to the estimated number of patients in all secondary medical areas, except for one area where there was active traffic to and from adjacent prefectures. More than 70% (median 80%; range 72-100%) of the patients received their treatments within a radius of approximately 25 km from their homes. There were 24 hematologists in November 2006 and 63% of these worked in the city with the largest population. The mean estimated number of patients per unit population was significantly higher in rural and remote areas than in urban areas (p <0.01). Three regional centers had only one or two hematologists. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with newly developed hematological malignancies in Tokushima Prefecture received treatment from intra-prefectural hematologists within a 25 km distance of their homes. Rural areas had a shortage of hematologists who were localized in urban areas. It is recommended that functions of core medical centres and rural clinics are redesigned according the availability of specialized treatments, and to maximize cooperation between physicians at rural clinics and hematologists at urban hospitals.","['Takita, Morihito', 'Tanaka, Yuji', 'Matsumura, Tomoko', 'Kishi, Yukiko', 'Kodama, Yuko', 'Nishimura, Tomoyo', 'Goto, Tetsuya', 'Nagai, Masami', 'Kami, Masahiro']","['Takita M', 'Tanaka Y', 'Matsumura T', 'Kishi Y', 'Kodama Y', 'Nishimura T', 'Goto T', 'Nagai M', 'Kami M']","['Division of Social Communication System for Advanced Clinical Research, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. takita-ygc@umin.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090728,Australia,Rural Remote Health,Rural and remote health,101174860,,2009/07/30 09:00,2009/11/05 06:00,['2009/07/30 09:00'],"['2009/07/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['1106 [pii]'],ppublish,Rural Remote Health. 2009 Jul-Sep;9(3):1106.

The cell line used was human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60). Three different media were considered: distilled water, a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution, and HL-60 cell line. Porous PLGA 85/15 scaffolds were prepared with an optimized gas foaming/salt leaching technique using a NaCl/polymer mass ratio of five, a saturation pressure of 5.52 MPa and a saturation time of 12 h. The cell growth and viability were not impaired by the presence of the scaffold. The mass change of the scaffold due to degradation over the period was varied only by 4% across all three media. The average macropore size and molecular weight decreased as the degradation time increased in each medium. The scaffolds maintained mechanical and structural integrity throughout the study in all three media over the degradation period studied, and the change of Young's modulus of the scaffold under wet condition was not significant. Overall, PBS solution most strongly affected physical and mechanical properties, followed by dH(2)O and HL-60 cells. The distinct variations of the scaffold's properties using different media, demonstrated the importance of carefully selecting the medium to perform in vitro studies. The medium must replicate the actual environment where the scaffold would be used, to represent accurately the changes in properties that the scaffold would be undergoing.","['Perron, Josee K', 'Naguib, Hani E', 'Daka, Joseph', 'Chawla, Attar', 'Wilkins, Ruth']","['Perron JK', 'Naguib HE', 'Daka J', 'Chawla A', 'Wilkins R']","['Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario K1N 6N5, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Biomed Mater Res B Appl Biomater,"Journal of biomedical materials research.

Use of this modality in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been hampered by the extensive marrow involvement seen in patients with CLL, which would produce a high risk for marrow aplasia after treatment with RIT. Patients with lymphoma and marrow involvement have been treated with RIT if involved marrow was less than 25% of the total marrow. Thus, we adapted this approach as consolidation therapy in patients with CLL responding to chemoimmunotherapy. METHODS: Fourteen patients with relapsed CLL either in partial remission or in complete remission but with disease documented by flow cytometry were treated with (90)Y ibritumomab tiuxetan. RESULTS: One patient responded and achieved a complete remission but with residual disease detected by flow cytometry. Of note was that grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity was seen in 12 of the 13 (92%) evaluable patients, with grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia noted in 11 (85%) of the patients. In addition, myelosuppression was prolonged with a median duration of grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia of 37 days. Five patients had persistent thrombocytopenia 3 months post-therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Even in patients with CLL and limited marrow involvement, the use of RIT results in unacceptable hematologic toxicity.","['Jain, Nitin', 'Wierda, William', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Wong, Franklin', 'Lerner, Susan', 'Keating, Michael', ""O'Brien, Susan""]","['Jain N', 'Wierda W', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Wong F', 'Lerner S', 'Keating M', ""O'Brien S""]","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Aberrant cytoplasmic localization of nucleophosmin (NPM) protein is reported be a surrogate for NPM1 gene mutation. METHODS: Using immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis, we assessed for NPM (clone 376) expression in formalin-fixed, formic acid-decalcified bone marrow biopsy specimens. DNA sequencing of exon 12 of NPM1 gene was performed in 104 patients. RESULTS: The study included 252 AML patients: 192 de novo AML, 33 AML preceded by either myelodysplastic syndrome or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and 27 therapy-related AML. The median age was 62 years and 115 patients were <or=60 years old. All patients received intensive chemotherapy. Cytoplasmic NPM was detected in 59 of 252 (23%) patients, including 48 of 192 (25%) de novo AML and 33 of 94 (35%) with a normal karyotype. DNA sequencing identified NPM1 mutations in 30 of 38 cases with cytoplasmic NPM and 10 of 66 cases with nuclear NPM. Cytoplasmic NPM was associated with young patient age (P=.024), FLT3/ITD (P=.005), CD34 negative blasts (P<.001), high peripheral blood blast count (P=.041), and high serum albumin level (P=.028). No statistical differences in overall or event-free survival were found on the basis of NPM localization. Similar results were obtained in patients<or=60 years old with normal karyotype and wild-type FLT3 (P=.768). CONCLUSIONS: IHC assessment for NPM localization did not predict prognosis in this patient cohort. The discordance between immunohistochemistry and DNA sequencing results indicates that DNA sequencing cannot be replaced by IHC assessment.","['Konoplev, Sergej', 'Huang, Xuelin', 'Drabkin, Harry A', 'Koeppen, Hartmut', 'Jones, Dan', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Chen, Weina', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E']","['Konoplev S', 'Huang X', 'Drabkin HA', 'Koeppen H', 'Jones D', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Chen W', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Bueso-Ramos CE']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.

The Children's Oncology Group (COG) conducted a limited institution Phase II trial of Campath-1H, a monoclonal antibody that targets CD52 on leukemic cells, in children with relapsed or refractory ALL. METHODS: From October 2005 to December 2006, 13 eligible patients were enrolled on the COG phase II study of Campath-1H (ADVL0222). Campath-1H was initially administered as an intravenous infusion over 2 hr, five times per week for 1 week, then three times per week for three additional weeks. Patients with stable disease or better on day 29 could continue on to combination therapy with Campath-1H, methotrexate, and 6-mercaptopurine for two additional cycles. RESULTS: One of 13 patients enrolled had a complete response to Campath-1H and 4 had stable disease. Dose limiting toxicity occurred in two out of nine fully evaluable patients (Grade IV pain and Grade III allergic reaction/hypersensitivity). No patients received combination therapy. Serum Campath-1H concentrations appeared to be somewhat lower in children with ALL compared with adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. CONCLUSION: Although a single complete response was observed, activity of single agent Campath-1H appears limited.

A somatic point mutation that causes a constitutive activation of the JAK2 gene is found in one in two ET patients. ET is more common in women, its incidence being 0.6-2.5/100,000 patient/year and the median age at diagnosis is 65-70 years. ET can affect all age groups, including children (0.09 cases/year), and is often diagnosed in the third-fourth decade of life. Rare cases of familial ET have been reported. Miscarriages are 3-4 times more common among women with ET than in the general population, especially in patients carrying JAK2V617F. Microvascular disturbances are typical of ET, but a major thrombosis (2/3 arterial and 1/3 venous; 1, 2-3% patient/year) is the main cause of morbidity and mortality. Age over 60 years and/or previous thrombosis are validated risk factor for thrombosis. Hemorrhages occur in 0.33% patient/year, mainly in those with a platelet count over 1,500 x 10(9)/L. Progression to myelofibrosis and leukemia is more common in patients carrying the JAK2V617F mutation, and is estimated to occur in 0.16% and 0.12% patient/year, respectively. The ET-related mortality ratio with respect to the general population is 1:1, while for polycythemia vera it is 1.6:1. Low-dose aspirin is useful for microvascular disturbances, and in the primary and secondary prevention of major thrombosis in high-risk patients, but it is not recommended in patients with a platelet count over 1,500 x 10(9)/L. Hydroxyurea is used as first-line treatment in high-risk patients. Other drugs available are alpha-interferon, anagrelide, pipobroman and busulphan.","['Fabris, Fabrizio', 'Randi, Maria Luigia']","['Fabris F', 'Randi ML']","['Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Padua Medical School, Via Giustiniani 2, 35128 Padua, Italy. fabrizio.fabris@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090728,Italy,Intern Emerg Med,Internal and emergency medicine,101263418,,2009/07/29 09:00,2010/09/15 06:00,['2009/07/29 09:00'],"['2009/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11739-009-0284-x [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Emerg Med. 2009 Oct;4(5):381-8. doi: 10.1007/s11739-009-0284-x.

METHODS: A total of 19 paediatric patients with ALL who were receiving 6-MP therapy were enrolled in this study. A new objective tool (hierarchical cluster analysis of drug metabolite concentrations) was explored as a novel approach to assess non-adherence to oral thiopurines, in combination with other objective measures (the pattern of variability in 6-thioguanine nucleotide erythrocyte concentrations and 6-thiouric acid plasma levels) and the subjective measure of self-reported adherence questionnaire. RESULTS: Parents of five ALL patients (26.3%) reported at least one aspect of non-adherence, with the majority (80%) citing ""carelessness at times about taking medication"" as the primary reason for non-adherence followed by ""forgetting to take the medication"" (60%). Of these patients, three (15.8%) were considered non-adherent to medication according to the self-reported adherence questionnaire (scored > or = 2). Four ALL patients (21.1%) had metabolite profiles indicative of non-adherence (persistently low levels of metabolites and/or metabolite levels clustered variably with time). Out of these four patients, two (50%) admitted non-adherence to therapy. Overall, when both methods were combined, five patients (26.3%) were considered non-adherent to medication, with higher age representing a risk factor for non-adherence (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The present study explored various ways to assess adherence rates to thiopurine medication in ALL patients and highlighted the importance of combining both objective and subjective measures as a better way to assess adherence to oral thiopurines.","['Hawwa, Ahmed F', 'Millership, Jeff S', 'Collier, Paul S', 'McCarthy, Anthony', 'Dempsey, Sid', 'Cairns, Carole', 'McElnay, James C']","['Hawwa AF', 'Millership JS', 'Collier PS', 'McCarthy A', 'Dempsey S', 'Cairns C', 'McElnay JC']","[""Clinical and Practice Research Group, School of Pharmacy, Medical Biology Centre, Queen's University Belfast, 97 Lisburn Road, BT9 7BL, Belfast, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090728,Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,,2009/07/29 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/29 09:00'],"['2009/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00228-009-0700-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2009 Nov;65(11):1105-12. doi: 10.1007/s00228-009-0700-1.

Recently the pathogenic role of bcl-2 has been questioned and attention has turned to prognostic subtypes of CLL differing in CD38 and ZAP-70 expression. However, the relationship between bcl-2 and CD38 or ZAP-70 expression remains uncertain and was investigated using flow cytometric immunophenotyping of 50 CLL specimens. CLL cells were consistently bcl-2 positive but varied in expression level: mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) 45-152. Although there was no significant difference in bcl-2 expression between CD38 or ZAP-70 positive and negative specimens, an inverse correlation was identified between percentage of CD38 positive B-cells and bcl-2 MFI when all (p<0.03, r(2)=0.10) and peripheral blood (p<0.004, r(2)=0.27) samples were analyzed. While bcl-2 levels do not appear to be a major discriminator between indolent and more aggressive subtypes of CLL, CD38 and bcl-2 expression appear to be interrelated.","['Sargent, Rachel L', 'Craig, Fiona E', 'Swerdlow, Steven H']","['Sargent RL', 'Craig FE', 'Swerdlow SH']","['Department of Pathology, Division of Hematopathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090616,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,PMC2713455,2009/07/29 09:00,2009/07/29 09:01,['2009/07/29 09:00'],"['2009/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/29 09:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2009 Jun 16;2(6):574-82.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD38', 'ZAP-70', 'bcl-2', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Applying 4D imaging to a model retrovirus, the murine leukemia virus, we directly monitor and quantify sequential assembly, release, and transmission events for individual viral particles as they happen in living cells. We demonstrate that de novo assembly is highly polarized towards zones of cell-cell contact. Viruses assembled approximately 10-fold more frequently at zones of cell contact with no change in assembly kinetics. Gag proteins were drawn to adhesive zones formed by viral Env glycoprotein and its cognate receptor to promote virus assembly at cell-cell contact. This process was dependent on the cytoplasmic tail of viral Env. Env lacking the cytoplasmic tail while still allowing for contact formation, failed to direct virus assembly towards contact sites. Our data describe a novel role for the viral Env glycoprotein in establishing cell-cell adhesion and polarization of assembly prior to becoming a fusion protein to allow virus entry into cells.","['Jin, Jing', 'Sherer, Nathan M', 'Heidecker, Gisela', 'Derse, David', 'Mothes, Walther']","['Jin J', 'Sherer NM', 'Heidecker G', 'Derse D', 'Mothes W']","['Section of Microbial Pathogenesis, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090728,United States,PLoS Biol,PLoS biology,101183755,PMC2709449,2009/07/29 09:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/07/29 09:00'],"['2009/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pbio.1000163 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS Biol. 2009 Jul;7(7):e1000163. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000163.

We aimed to assess the prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity and thyroid dysfunction in such patients. DESIGN: Case-control cross-sectional study. METHODS: Eighty-four patients diagnosed with ALL and treated only with chemotherapy. Mean age at diagnosis 5.9+/-3.6 yr, at recruitment 12.1+/-4.3 yr. The treatment had been stopped 4.3+/-3.2 yr before recruitment. A control group of 60 subjects was recruited. Free T4, TSH, anti-thyroperoxidase, and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies were measured. RESULTS: Anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies were negative in all patients. TSH was increased in 7 patients (8.3%) and 3 controls (5.0%). Free T4 was within the normal limits in all patients and controls.Mean TSH and free T4 levels did not statistically differ between controls and ALL offtherapy patients. TSH was negatively correlated with the age at the diagnosis (p=0.01) and the age at the end of therapy (p=0.008). Anti-thyroglobulin and/or anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies were detected in 3 controls (5%; vs study group: p=0.038), 1 of them with increased TSH. CONCLUSIONS: Some patients present hyperthyrotropinemia, without anti-thyroid antibodies, with a prevalence comparable to the control group. The thyroid gland seems more prone to be damaged by chemotherapy at a younger age. We think that a thyroid follow- up in ALL off-therapy patients may be advisable and should be differentiated on the basis of the age at the end of treatment, with more frequent tests for younger patients.","['Delvecchio, M', 'Cecinati, V', 'Brescia, L P', 'Faienza, M F', 'De Mattia, D', 'Cavallo, L', 'Santoro, N']","['Delvecchio M', 'Cecinati V', 'Brescia LP', 'Faienza MF', 'De Mattia D', 'Cavallo L', 'Santoro N']","['Department of Biomedicine of Developing Age, University of Bari, 70124 Bari, Italy. lucicava@tin.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090728,Italy,J Endocrinol Invest,Journal of endocrinological investigation,7806594,,2009/07/29 09:00,2010/07/29 06:00,['2009/07/29 09:00'],"['2009/07/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/29 06:00 [medline]']","['6473 [pii]', '10.1007/BF03346571 [doi]']",ppublish,J Endocrinol Invest. 2010 Mar;33(3):135-9. doi: 10.1007/BF03346571.

We hypothesized that a supramolecular complex, the leukemia-cell invadosome, which contains certain integrins, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and other as-yet unidentified proteins, is essential for tissue invasion and may be central to the phenotypic diversity observed in the clinic. Here we show that the specific binding of MMP-9 to leukocyte surface beta(2) integrin is required for pericellular proteolysis and migration of AML-derived cells. An efficient antileukemia effect was obtained by the hexapeptide HFDDDE, a motif of the MMP-9 catalytic domain that mediates integrin binding: HFDDDE prevented proMMP-9 binding, transmigration through a human endothelial cell layer, and extracellular matrix degradation. Notably, the functional protein anchorage between beta(2) integrin and proMMP-9 described in this study does not involve the enzymatic active sites targeted by known MMP inhibitors. Taken together, our results provide a biochemical working definition for the human leukemia invadosome. Disruption of specific protein complexes within this supramolecular target complex may yield a new class of anti-AML drugs with anti-invasion (rather than or in addition to cytotoxic) attributes.","['Stefanidakis, Michael', 'Karjalainen, Katja', 'Jaalouk, Diana E', 'Gahmberg, Carl G', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Pasqualini, Renata', 'Arap, Wadih', 'Koivunen, Erkki']","['Stefanidakis M', 'Karjalainen K', 'Jaalouk DE', 'Gahmberg CG', ""O'Brien S"", 'Pasqualini R', 'Arap W', 'Koivunen E']","['Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences, Division of Biochemistry, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090727,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC2756207,2009/07/29 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/29 09:00'],"['2009/07/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36839-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-04-148643 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Oct 1;114(14):3008-17. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-04-148643.

To further the development of CpG ODN as a novel ALL therapy, we investigated the antileukemia activity induced by CpG ODN in a transplantable syngeneic pre-B ALL model. CpG ODN induced early killing of leukemia by innate immune effectors both in vitro and in vivo. Mice were treated with CpG ODN starting 7 days after injection with leukemia to mimic a minimal residual disease state and achieved T cell-dependent remissions of more than 6 months. In addition, mice in remission after CpG ODN treatment were protected from leukemia rechallenge, and adoptive transfer of T cells from mice in remission conferred protection against leukemia growth. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that CpG ODN induce a durable remission and ongoing immune-mediated protection in ALL, suggesting this treatment may have clinical utility in patients with minimal residual disease.","['Seif, Alix E', 'Barrett, David M', 'Milone, Michael', 'Brown, Valerie I', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'Reid, Gregor S D']","['Seif AE', 'Barrett DM', 'Milone M', 'Brown VI', 'Grupp SA', 'Reid GS']","[""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, PA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090727,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC2746473,2009/07/29 09:00,2009/10/23 06:00,['2009/07/29 09:00'],"['2009/07/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36915-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-02-203984 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Sep 17;114(12):2459-66. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-02-203984.

Therefore, disrupting the crosstalk between malignant B cells and their milieu is an attractive novel strategy for treating selected mature B-cell malignancies. Here we summarize the current knowledge about the cellular and molecular interactions between neoplastic B lymphocytes and accessory cells that shape a supportive microenvironment, and the potential therapeutic targets that are emerging, together with the new problems they raise. We discuss clinically relevant aspects and provide an outlook into future biologically oriented therapeutic strategies. We anticipate a paradigm shift in the treatment of selected B-cell malignancies, moving from targeting primarily the malignant cells toward combining cytotoxic drugs with agents that interfere with the microenvironment's proactive role. Such approaches hopefully will help eliminating residual disease, thereby improving our current therapeutic efforts.","['Burger, Jan A', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Rosenwald, Andreas', 'Caligaris-Cappio, Federico']","['Burger JA', 'Ghia P', 'Rosenwald A', 'Caligaris-Cappio F']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

Their prognostic significance in adult T-ALL is unclear. We sought to evaluate the outcome according to mutation status of patients with adult T-ALL treated on the United Kingdom Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia XII (UKALLXII)/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) E2993 protocol. METHODS: NOTCH1 and FBXW7 were screened by a combination of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and sequencing in 88 adult patients with T-ALL treated on the UKALLXII/ECOG E2993 protocol and compared with clinical characteristics and outcome. RESULTS: NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations were common (60% and 18%, respectively) and were not associated with age or WBC count. NOTCH1 heterodimerization domain mutations were associated with FBXW7 mutations (P = .02), and NOTCH1 proline, glutamic acid, serine, threonine (PEST) rich domain and FBXW7 mutations were mutually exclusive. There were an equal number of high- and standard-risk patients in the NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutated (MUT) groups. Patients wild type (WT) for both markers trended toward poorer event-free survival (EFS; MUT v WT, 51% v 27%, P = .10; hazard ratio, 0.6). Analysis by each marker individually was not significantly predictive of outcome (NOTCH1 MUT v WT, EFS 49% v 34%, P = .20; FBXW7 MUT v WT, EFS 53% v 41%, P.72).

The process is propelled by c-Cbl, which binds the CD38 receptor as part of a signaling complex generating MAPK signaling. Here we report that the capability of c-Cbl to do this is lost in the G306E tyrosine kinase-binding domain mutant. Unlike wild-type (WT) c-Cbl, the G306E mutant c-Cbl fails to propel RA-induced differentiation, and disrupts the normal association with CD38. The G306E mutant does, like WT c-Cbl, co-immunoprecipitate with Vav, Slp-76, and p38. But unlike WT c-Cbl, does not cause MAPK signaling. In contrast, the C381A Ring finger domain mutant functions like WT c-Cbl. It binds CD38 and is part of the same apparent c-Cbl/Slp-76/Vav/p38 signaling complex. The C381A mutant causes MAPK signaling and propels RA-induced differentiation. In addition to HL-60 cells and their WT or mutant c-Cbl stable transfectants, the c-Cbl/Vav/Slp-76 complex is also found in NB4 cells where c-Cbl was previously also found to bind CD38. The data are consistent with a model in which the G306E mutant c-Cbl forms a signaling complex that includes Slp-76, Vav, and p38; but does not drive MAPK signaling because it fails to bind the CD38 receptor. Without the G306E mutation the c-Cbl unites CD38 with the signaling complex and delivers a MAPK signal that drives RA-induced differentiation. The results demonstrate the importance of the Gly306 residue in the ability of c-Cbl to propel RA-induced differentiation.","['Shen, Miaoqing', 'Yen, Andrew']","['Shen M', 'Yen A']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090727,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC2757968,2009/07/29 09:00,2009/10/20 06:00,['2009/07/29 09:00'],"['2009/07/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(18)81041-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.014241 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Sep 18;284(38):25664-77. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.014241.

Since deletion of some genes often prevents the survival of null mice to adulthood, we have used a proven inhibitor of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signalling to identify the precise window of time during which LIF is required in vivo, and assessed the cellular expression of several LIF-associated targets. On day 4 of pregnancy, mice were injected with hLIF-05 (inhibitor) into the uterine lumen, with corresponding volumes of PBS (vehicle) injected into the contralateral horn. On days 5 and 6, the number of implantation sites was recorded and the uteri processed for immunohistochemistry. Blockade of LIF on day 4 reduced embryo implantation by 50% (P<or=0.0001) and was effective maximally between 0930 and 1230 h. Antagonism of LIF signalling was evidenced by a lack of phosphorylated STAT3 in the luminal epithelium (LE). Amphiregulin was absent from the LE on day 4 evening and H-type-1 antigen expression was retained in the LE on day 5 in inhibited uteri. Interleukin-1alpha and oncostatin M expression were reduced in the stroma on day 6, following LIF inhibition. Unexpectedly, PTGS2 expression in stroma was unaffected by LIF inhibition in vivo, in contrast to Lif null mice. In summary, this suggests that LIF signalling is effective for implantation during a discrete time window on day 4 and antagonism of LIF signalling recapitulates many features exhibited in Lif null uteri. The data presented validates the use of antagonists to investigate tissue specific and temporal cytokine signalling in reproductive function.","['Mohamet, L', 'Heath, J K', 'Kimber, S J']","['Mohamet L', 'Heath JK', 'Kimber SJ']","['Faculty of Life Sciences, The University of Manchester, Core Technology Facility, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090727,England,Reproduction,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",100966036,,2009/07/29 09:00,2012/01/13 06:00,['2009/07/29 09:00'],"['2009/07/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['REP-09-0113 [pii]', '10.1530/REP-09-0113 [doi]']",ppublish,Reproduction. 2009 Nov;138(5):827-36. doi: 10.1530/REP-09-0113.

In many genetic case-control studies, the collection of DNA material extends to relatives such as parents of cases. Thus, case-control and case-parent trio association analyses are possible. Whereas the goal of collecting genetic information from family members in a study initially designed as a case-control study is to enrich the genetic analysis, increase power, or address concern about population structure bias, methods of combining genetic data from unrelated case and control subjects with genetic trio data from the same study population are not well known. A number of hybrid approaches have been developed that utilize such data together. In this paper, the authors describe key features of genetic case-control and case-parent trio studies and review commonly used methods of genetic analysis for case-parent trio designs. In addition, they provide a pragmatic review of statistical methods and available software for existing hybrid approaches that combine various components of case-control and genetic trio data. The application of all methods is illustrated using a candidate gene study of childhood leukemia that included case-control subjects and their parents.","['Infante-Rivard, Claire', 'Mirea, Lucia', 'Bull, Shelley B']","['Infante-Rivard C', 'Mirea L', 'Bull SB']","['Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, 1110 Pine Avenue West, Montreal, Quebec H3A1A3, Canada. claire.infante-rivard@mcgill.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090727,United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,2009/07/29 09:00,2009/09/16 06:00,['2009/07/29 09:00'],"['2009/07/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['kwp180 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kwp180 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2009 Sep 1;170(5):657-64. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwp180.

However, many patients experience relapse caused by the persistence of residual malignant cells. Cytogenetic and molecular techniques are increasingly being used to assess and quantify minimal residual disease (MRD). The emergence of advanced technologies has led to the discovery of multiple novel molecular markers that can be used to detect MRD and predict outcome in patients with leukemias and lymphomas. Gene expression signatures that predict clinical outcomes in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have been identified. In chronic myelogenous leukemia, molecular monitoring has become more important in assessing response and detecting resistance to therapy. In acute leukemias, several new markers have shown potential in prognostication and monitoring treatment. In leukemias and lymphomas, microRNAs have been identified that may be useful in diagnostics and prognostication.

However, the role of FLT3 expression as well as its correlation to FLT3/ITD has not sufficiently studied. This study was to evaluate the relationship between FLT3 gene expression and FLT3/ITD mutation in patients with de novo AML. METHODS: FLT3 gene expression was determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR). FLT3/ITD mutation was detected by PCR in 79 de novo AML patients. RESULTS: FLT3/ITD mutations were found in 22.8% (18/79) patients. FLT3 gene expression (range: 0-7320, median: 312) was detected in 92.4% (73/79) patients, but not in normal controls. Compared to AML patients with low FLT3 expressers and without FLT3/ITD mutation, patients with high FLT3 expressers and FLT3/ITD mutation had a significantly higher white blood count as well as a higher ratio of bone marrow blasts. The positive rate of FLT3/ITD mutation was not correlated to the level of FLT3 expression, and no statistical difference of FLT3 expression was found between AML patients with and without FLT3/ITD mutation. The complete remission (CR) rate of AML patients with FLT3/ITD mutation (58.8%) was significance lower than that of those without FLT3/ITD mutation (82.1%). In AML patients without FLT3/ITD mutation, the CR rate was significantly lower in patients with high FLT3 expressers (69.2%) than in those with low FLT3 expressers (93.3%).

This study was to compare the efficacy and toxicity of the chemotherapy regimen containing perarubicin (THP) with that containing mitoxantrone (MIT) for young patients with newly diagnosed AML. METHODS: A total of 129 patients with newly diagnosed AML, aged 16 to 60 years olds, were assigned for induction chemotherapy containing one to two courses with standard-dose cytarabine (Ara-C) and an anthracycline antibiotic, THP or MIT. When complete remission was achieved after induction therapy, the patients received two courses of consolidation therapy identical to the induction regimen. From then, the patients were alternately given four courses of consolidation therapy consisting of Ara-C/THP or Ara-C/MIT every three weeks. Maintenance treatment continued for three years when patients were in continuous complete remission (CCR). RESULTS: Twenty-six out of 42 patients (61.90%) receiving THP therapy, and 48 out of 73 patients (65.75%) treated by MIT achieved CR (P>0.05). Nine (34.61%) and 11 (22.92%) out of CR patients treated by THP and MIT, respectively, relapsed within one year (P=0.28). Moreover, the incidences of toxicities, such as infection, nausea/vomiting and cardiac events, were similar in these two groups (P>0.05) except for alopecie, which was 26.19% in the THP group compared to 42.47% in the MIT group (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Regimen containing THP plus Ara-C can be used for young adults with newly diagnosed AML for remission induction, but it is not superior to the regimen with MIT.

METHODS: DNA fragment of bcr/abl fusion gene was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to construct a recombinant adenovirus vector and produce recombinant adenoviruses. DCs were induced from peripheral blood monocytes in vitro, and transfected with recombinant adenoviruses or pulsed with peptide to induce specific CTLs. The lethal effect of CTLs against leukemic K562 cells in vitro was observed. RESULTS: We successfully constructed the replication-defective recombinant adenoviral vector expressing bcr/abl fusion gene. The recombinant adenoviruses we produced had a high virus titer of 2.0 x 10(10) pfu/mL. Transfection efficiency of DCs in vitro was 50%-60%. DC vaccines expressing bcr/abl fusion gene were successfully prepared and used to induce specific CTLs. With effector:target cell ratios of 40:1 and 20:1, the killing rates of K562 cells by CTLs were (47.6+/-4.7)% and (47.5+/-1.6)% in genetically modified DCs group, (25.8+/-4.4)% and (24.6+/-6.3)% in peptide-pulsed DCs group, and were (5.7+/-1.3)% and (4.5+/-1.6)% in control DCs group. The differences between every two groups were significant (all P<0.05).

These mechanisms involve a number of different molecules. CD44 is one such molecule, although its molecular basis has not been elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effect of CD44 monoclonal antibodies and hyaluronan, which is a ligand of CD44, on drug-induced apoptosis in human myeloid cell line KG1. Preincubation with anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody J173 or a lower-molecular-weight form of hyaluronan (LMW-HA) could reduce drug-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner from 23.0 +/- 1.4% to 5.9 +/- 5.0% (p<0.01) or 9.7 +/- 1.8% (p<0.01) respectively. On the other hand, another anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody L178 and the native high-molecular-weight polymer of hyaluronan had no effect on drug-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, J173 and LMW-HA induced a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins. Genistein, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, abrogated the inhibition of drug-induced apoptosis promoted by J173 and LMW-HA. These results suggest that the anti-apoptotic effect by ligation of CD44 was mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins. These data indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation via CD44 is involved in the survival of primitive myeloid cells.","['Onoda, Masahiro', 'Nakaseko, Chiaki', 'Yokota, Akira', 'Saito, Yasushi']","['Onoda M', 'Nakaseko C', 'Yokota A', 'Saito Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Chiba Aoba Municipal Hospital, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,2009/07/29 09:00,2009/10/16 06:00,['2009/07/29 09:00'],"['2009/07/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453309X426236 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2009 Aug;14(4):213-9. doi: 10.1179/102453309X426236.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Ligands)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Genistein/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Hyaluronic Acid/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Ligands', 'Molecular Weight', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Failure of therapeutic treatment may be due to the development of multidrug resistance (MDR), the mechanisms of which include upregulation of membrane-resident transporters that efflux chemotherapeutic drugs from tumor cells. Deregulation may occur at different levels: gene or protein expression or function depletion. Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells of adults were studied. ABCB1 (P-gp) and ABCG2 (BCRP) expression were determined by flow cytometry, rhodamine 123 (Rho123) and mitoxantrone were used for functional activity study of MDR proteins, sensitization of leukemic cells to drugs was quantified by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assays. Appropriate gene expression was determined using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. No differences between expression of P-gp and BCRP and genes in primary and relapsed acute leukemia (AL) cells as well as in de novo and treated CLL samples were established. Higher expression of P-gp and BCRP proteins was detected in CLL lymphocytes compared to blast cells. Increased P-gp protein expression and function was detected in cells of CLL patients who had more aggressive therapy regimen. Doxorubicine, rubomycinum and L-asparaginase resistance correlates with P-gp overexpression and increased function in pediatric AL whereas vincristine resistance might be associated with P-gp protein expression in AL samples and impared P-gp function in CLL lymphocytes only. A tendency for the decreased doxorubicin cytotoxic activity was shown in BCRP-overexpressing cells both in children and adults leukemia. Multifactorial ANOVA showed that P-gp/MDR1 and BCRP as well as their function could not be used as unconditional and universal predictors of leukemia cell drug resistance in vitro. These results suggest that studied MDR transporter-proteins have a limited role per se in vitro and admittedly in vivo drug resistance estimated in leukemia patients or it is not yet fully understood unless would not be studied in aggregate.

The cell line differentiates into macrophage-like cells by stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Although it has been used frequently as a model for macrophage differentiation in research including the FANTOM4/Genome Network Project, there are few reports on its genomic constitution. Therefore, we attempted to reveal the genomic aberrations in these cells with the microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) technique. FINDINGS: We report large aberrations, including deletions 6p, 12p, 17p, and trisomy 8, and revealed breakpoints in the MLL and MLLT3 genes. Moreover, we found novel genomic aberrations such as a hemizygous narrow deletion partially containing the TP73 gene and homozygous deletions, including the CDKN2A, CDKN2B and PTEN genes. CONCLUSION: In this study, we identified 119 aberrant regions in autosomal chromosomes, and at least 16 of these aberrations were less than 100 kb, most of which were undetectable in the previous works. We also revealed a total of 4.6 Mb of homozygous deleted regions. Our results will provide a base to precisely understand studies involving the THP-1 cell line, especially the huge amount of data generated from the FANTOM4/Genome Network Project.","['Adati, Naoki', 'Huang, Ming-Chih', 'Suzuki, Takahiro', 'Suzuki, Harukazu', 'Kojima, Toshio']","['Adati N', 'Huang MC', 'Suzuki T', 'Suzuki H', 'Kojima T']","['Computational Systems Biology Research Group, RIKEN Advanced Science Institute, 1-7-22 Suehiro-cho, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 230-0045, Japan. ada@gsc.riken.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090727,England,BMC Res Notes,BMC research notes,101462768,PMC2729307,2009/07/29 09:00,2009/07/29 09:01,['2009/07/29 09:00'],"['2009/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/29 09:01 [medline]']","['1756-0500-2-153 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-0500-2-153 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Res Notes. 2009 Jul 27;2:153. doi: 10.1186/1756-0500-2-153.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They also have the potential to induce asthma, aplastic anemia, and leukemia, even cause abortion or fetus malformation in humans. In this study, the airborne toxicity of benzene, toluene, xylene, and formaldehyde to murine embryonic stem cells (mES cells) were tested using airborne exposure technique to evaluate the mES cell airborne exposure model on embryotoxicity prediction. Briefly, mES cells were cultured on Transwell inserts and were exposed to an airborne surrounding of test chemicals in a chamber for 1 h at 37 degrees C. Cytotoxicity was determined using the MTT assay after further culture for 18 h at 37 degrees C in normal medium. The airborne IC(50) (50% inhibition concentration) of benzene, toluene, xylene, and formaldehyde derived from the fitted dose-response curves were 17,400 +/- 1290, 16,000 +/- 250, 4680 +/- 500, and 620 +/- 310 ppm, respectively. Formaldehyde was found to be the compound most toxic to mES cells compared to benzene homologues. The toxicity data had good correlation with the in vivo data. The results showed that the mES airborne exposure model may be used to predict embryotoxicity of volatile organic compounds.","['Shen, Shuijie', 'Yuan, Lingmin', 'Zeng, Su']","['Shen S', 'Yuan L', 'Zeng S']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis and Drug Metabolism, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Inhal Toxicol,Inhalation toxicology,8910739,,2009/07/29 09:00,2009/12/31 06:00,['2009/07/29 09:00'],"['2009/07/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/08958370802687493 [doi]'],ppublish,Inhal Toxicol. 2009 Oct;21(12):973-8. doi: 10.1080/08958370802687493.,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Solvents)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants, Occupational/*toxicity', 'Air Pollution, Indoor/*adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Atmosphere Exposure Chambers', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coloring Agents', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Solvents/*toxicity', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, following intravenous administration, this drug is rapidly inactivated by enzymatic deamination and displays a short biological half-life necessitating the administration of high doses leading also to unwanted side effects. To overcome these drawbacks and to improve the therapeutic index of gemcitabine, we have recently developed the concept of squalenoylation which consisted in the bioconjugation of gemcitabine with squalene, a natural lipid. In our preliminary studies, we have shown that this bioconjugate (SQgem) self-organized in water as nanoassemblies with considerable resistance to deamination and significantly higher anticancer activity compared with gemcitabine in an intravenously grafted tumor model in mice. To further establish the candidature of this nanomedicine for clinical trials, in this communication we have tested the preclinical efficacy of squalenoyl gemcitabine nanomedicine on several human tumor cell lines and on the subcutaneously grafted experimental L1210 murine tumor in mice. SQgem nanomedicine displayed an efficient cytotoxicity against a variety of human tumor cell lines in the 60 human tumor cell panel. In vivo, following intravenous administration, SQgem nanomedicine displayed a superior anticancer activity against subcutaneous L1210 tumor, comparatively to gemcitabine. The molecular mechanism behind the anticancer efficacy of SQgem has been investigated by flow cytometry analysis and protein expression profiling of L1210 wt cells treated in vitro with the squalenoyl gemcitabine bioconjugate. It was found that this nanomedicine arrested the cell cycle in G2/M, characterized by an increased cyclin A and cyclin E expression, and activation of caspase-3 and the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase with an increase of cytochrome C level. Taken together, these results suggest that the cell kill by this nanomedicine occurred through mitochondrial apoptotic triggered pathway, similarly to that of gemcitabine free.","['Reddy, L Harivardhan', 'Renoir, Jack-Michel', 'Marsaud, Veronique', 'Lepetre-Mouelhi, Sinda', 'Desmaele, Didier', 'Couvreur, Patrick']","['Reddy LH', 'Renoir JM', 'Marsaud V', 'Lepetre-Mouelhi S', 'Desmaele D', 'Couvreur P']","['Universite Paris-Sud XI, Faculte de Pharmacie, UMR CNRS 8612, IFR 141, 92296 Chatenay-Malabry Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,,2009/07/29 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/29 09:00'],"['2009/07/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/mp900099e [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2009 Sep-Oct;6(5):1526-35. doi: 10.1021/mp900099e.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '7QWM220FJH (Squalene)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'GW89575KF9 (squalane)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin A/metabolism', 'Cyclin E/metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Nanomedicine', 'Nanostructures/*chemistry', 'Nanotechnology', 'Protein Array Analysis', 'Squalene/analogs & derivatives/chemistry']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cisplatin exposure of sensitive cells has been previously associated with a down-regulation of Bcl-X(L) expression and apoptosis, whereas recurrence was systematically observed when Bcl-X(L) expression was maintained. Bcl-X(L) down-regulation could thus constitute an interesting chemosensitizing strategy. We showed that a Bcl-X(L)targeted RNA interference strategy efficiently sensitized chemoresistant ovarian carcinoma cells to cisplatin, but some of them were still able to re-proliferate. Considering the possible cooperation between Bcl-X(L)and MCL-1, we investigated the possibility to avoid recurrence in vitro using a multi-targeted RNAi strategy directed against these two anti-apoptotic proteins. We showed that their concomitant inhibition lead to massive apoptosis in absence of cisplatin, this multi-targeted RNAi approach being much more efficient than conventional chemotherapy. We thus demonstrated that Bcl-X(L) and MCL-1 cooperate to constitute together a strong molecular ""bolt"", which elimination could be sufficient to allow chemoresistant ovarian carcinoma cells apoptosis. Moreover, we demonstrated that in presence of a low concentration of cisplatin, the concomitant down-regulation of Bcl-X(L) and MCL-1 allowed a complete annihilation of tumour cells population thus avoiding subsequent recurrence in vitro in cell lines highly refractory to any type of conventional chemotherapy. Therefore, Bcl-X(L) and MCL-1 targeted strategies could constitute an efficient therapeutic tool for the treatment of chemoresistant ovarian carcinoma, in association with conventional chemotherapy.","['Brotin, Emilie', 'Meryet-Figuiere, Matthieu', 'Simonin, Karin', 'Duval, Raphael E', 'Villedieu, Marie', 'Leroy-Dudal, Johanne', 'Saison-Behmoaras, Ester', 'Gauduchon, Pascal', 'Denoyelle, Christophe', 'Poulain, Laurent']","['Brotin E', 'Meryet-Figuiere M', 'Simonin K', 'Duval RE', 'Villedieu M', 'Leroy-Dudal J', 'Saison-Behmoaras E', 'Gauduchon P', 'Denoyelle C', 'Poulain L']","[""Groupe Regional d'Etudes sur le Cancer (EA 1772, Universite de Caen), Unite Biologie et Therapies Innovantes des Cancers Localement Agressifs, Centre de Lutte Contre le Cancer F.

A total of 122 patients (38%) developed some form of GVHD. We analyzed GVHD by clinical presentation (acute or chronic GVHD) and onset time after the first DLI (early (< or =45 days) or late (>45 days)). There was a significant overlap between onset time and clinical presentation. Some form of GVHD occurred at a median of 104 days, acute GVHD at 45 days and chronic GVHD at 181 days after DLI. The clinical presentation was acute GVHD in 71 patients, of whom 31 subsequently developed chronic GVHD subsequently. De novo chronic GVHD was seen in 51 patients. OS for all patients was 69% (95% confidence interval (CI) 63-75) at 5 years, DLI-related mortality was 11% (95% CI 8-15) and disease-related mortality was 20% (95% CI 16-25).

The regulatory mechanisms for the rapid proliferation of synovial sarcoma cells and the particular aggressiveness of this sarcoma remain poorly understood. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades have been shown to play important roles in synovial sarcoma survival. Sorafenib (Nexavar, BAY 43-9006), a potent recombinant activated factor (RAF) inhibitor, inhibits the MAPK signaling pathway both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we examined the inhibitory proliferation effects of sorafenib in synovial sarcoma growth and evaluated whether sorafenib modulates MAPK and tumor apoptosis cascades in human synovial sarcoma cell lines SW982 and HS-SY-II. Our results indicated that sorafenib effectively inhibited cellular proliferation and induces apoptosis of these two cells. Sorafenib inhibited the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK, downregulated cyclin D1 and Rb levels, caused G(1) arrest and S phase decrease, and induced apoptosis as confirmed by flow cytometry and the TUNEL assay. Furthermore, Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 levels significantly decreased, whereas expression levels of the proteins bcl-2 and bax were unchanged in response to sorafenib treatment in SW982 and HS-SY-II cells. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that sorafenib is effective for growth inhibition of synovial sarcoma cell lines in vitro and suggest that sorafenib may be a new therapeutic option for patients with synovial sarcoma.","['Peng, Chang-Liang', 'Guo, Wei', 'Ji, Tao', 'Ren, Tingting', 'Yang, Yi', 'Li, Da-Sen', 'Qu, Hua-Yi', 'Li, Xiao', 'Tang, Shun', 'Yan, Tai-Qiang', 'Tang, Xiao-Dong']","['Peng CL', 'Guo W', 'Ji T', 'Ren T', 'Yang Y', 'Li DS', 'Qu HY', 'Li X', 'Tang S', 'Yan TQ', 'Tang XD']","[""Musculoskeletal Tumor Center, Peking University Peoples' Hospital, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090906,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,,2009/07/28 09:00,2010/02/26 06:00,['2009/07/28 09:00'],"['2009/07/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['9208 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.8.18.9208 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2009 Sep;8(18):1729-36. doi: 10.4161/cbt.8.18.9208.

The study of this genetic susceptibility with the use of DS as a model of leukemogenesis has broad applicability to the understanding of leukemia in children overall. On the basis of the role of GATA1 mutations in DS AMkL, we analyzed the mutational spectrum of GATA1 mutations to begin elucidating possible mechanisms by which these sequence alterations arise. Mutational analysis revealed a predominance of small insertion/deletion, duplication, and base substitution mutations, including G:C>T:A, G:C>A:T, and A:T>G:C. This mutational spectrum points to potential oxidative stress and aberrant folate metabolism secondary to genes on chromosome 21 (eg, cystathionine-beta-synthase, superoxide dismutase) as potential causes of GATA1 mutations. Furthermore, DNA repair capacity evaluated in DS and non-DS patient samples provided evidence that the base excision repair pathway is compromised in DS tissues, suggesting that inability to repair DNA damage also may play a critical role in the unique susceptibility of DS children to develop leukemia. A model of leukemogenesis in DS is proposed in which mutagenesis is driven by cystathionine-beta-synthase overexpression and altered folate homeostasis that becomes fixed as the ability to repair DNA damage is compromised.","['Cabelof, Diane C', 'Patel, Hiral V', 'Chen, Qing', 'van Remmen, Holly', 'Matherly, Larry H', 'Ge, Yubin', 'Taub, Jeffrey W']","['Cabelof DC', 'Patel HV', 'Chen Q', 'van Remmen H', 'Matherly LH', 'Ge Y', 'Taub JW']","['Department of Nutrition and Food Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090724,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC2756130,2009/07/28 09:00,2009/10/29 06:00,['2009/07/28 09:00'],"['2009/07/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36885-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-11-190330 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Sep 24;114(13):2753-63. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-11-190330.

By using flow cytometry, we detected the surface expression of CD79b in almost all non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, suggesting that anti-CD79b-vcMMAE could be widely used in these malignancies. By using NHL cell lines to simulate a patient population we discovered that a minimal cell-surface expression level of CD79b was required for in vitro activity. Within the subpopulation of cell lines above this minimal threshold, we found that sensitivity to free MMAE, mutation of cancer genes, and cell doubling time were poorly correlated with in vitro activity; however, the expression level of BCL-XL was correlated with reduced sensitivity to anti-CD79b-vcMMAE. This observation was supported by in vivo data showing that a Bcl-2 family inhibitor, ABT-263, strikingly enhanced the activity of anti-CD79b-vcMMAE. Furthermore, anti-CD79b-vcMMAE was significantly more effective than a standard-of-care regimen, R-CHOP (ie, rituximab with a single intravenous injection of 30 mg/kg cyclophosphamide, 2.475 mg/kg doxorubicin, 0.375 mg/kg vincristine, and oral dosing of 0.15 mg/kg prednisone once a day for 5 days), in 3 xenograft models of NHL.

In primary cultures, three different colony types with distinctive morphologies could be recognized. From colonies resembling mouse spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), two cell lines were derived and maintained for nine passages after which proliferation stopped. Growth of these cell lines depended on the growth factors leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). In both cell lines NANOG, promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger (PLZF), and EPCAM, were expressed at higher levels and GFRA1, ITGA6, and THY1 at lower levels than in neonate porcine testis. Primary cultures of neonate pig testis were subjected to a factorial design of the growth factors LIF, GDNF, EGF, and FGF. EGF and FGF had a positive effect on the number and size of the SSC-like colonies. Addition of EGF and FGF to primary cell cultures of neonate pig testis affected the expression of NANOG, PLZF, POU5F1, and GATA4, whereas effects of LIF or GDNF could not be detected. FGF decreased the expression levels of NANOG, a marker for pluripotency also expressed in neonatal porcine male germ cells. FGF decreased expression of PLZF and enhanced the expression of pluripotency-related gene POU5F1 and Sertoli cell marker GATA4. EGF had a positive effect on PLZF expression levels and counteracted the positive effect of FGF on GATA4 expression. These results suggest that FGF can impede successful derivation of porcine SSCs from neonate pig testis.","['Kuijk, Ewart W', 'Colenbrander, Ben', 'Roelen, Bernard A J']","['Kuijk EW', 'Colenbrander B', 'Roelen BA']","['Department of Farm Animal Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, Yalelaan 104, 3584 CM Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090724,England,Reproduction,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",100966036,,2009/07/28 09:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2009/07/28 09:00'],"['2009/07/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['REP-09-0138 [pii]', '10.1530/REP-09-0138 [doi]']",ppublish,Reproduction. 2009 Oct;138(4):721-31. doi: 10.1530/REP-09-0138.

Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a neuroimmunopeptide that has anti-inflammatory effects, promotes Th2 cytokines and CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) Treg activation, and stimulates exocrine secretion, smooth muscle relaxation, and vasodilatation favoring uterus quiescence. The goal of the present work was to explore the participation of VIP in the implantation sites of normal and pregnant prediabetic nonobese diabetic (NOD) females, a mouse strain that spontaneously develops an autoimmune exocrinopathy similar to Sjogren's syndrome. Our results indicate a reduction in litter size from the third parturition onwards in the NOD female lifespan with increased resorption rates. Progesterone systemic levels were significantly decreased in pregnant NOD mice compared with BALB/c mice, although the allogeneic response to progesterone by spleen cells was not impaired. VIP receptors, Vipr1 and Vipr2 (Vpac1 and Vpac2), were expressed at the implantation sites and VIP induced leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and Treg marker expression in both strains; however, a reduced Vip expression was found in NOD implantation sites. We conclude that the reduced birth rate at 16-week-old NOD mice with a Th1 systemic cytokine profile involves resorption processes with a lower expression of VIP at the sites of implantation, which acts as a local inducer of pro-implantatory LIF and Treg activation.","['Roca, Valeria', 'Calafat, Mario', 'Larocca, Luciana', 'Ramhorst, Rosanna', 'Farina, Mariana', 'Franchi, Ana Maria', 'Leiros, Claudia Perez']","['Roca V', 'Calafat M', 'Larocca L', 'Ramhorst R', 'Farina M', 'Franchi AM', 'Leiros CP']","['Immunopharmacology Laboratory, Department of Biological Chemistry, School of Exact and Biological Sciences, University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090724,England,Reproduction,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",100966036,,2009/07/28 09:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2009/07/28 09:00'],"['2009/07/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['REP-09-0171 [pii]', '10.1530/REP-09-0171 [doi]']",ppublish,Reproduction. 2009 Oct;138(4):733-42. doi: 10.1530/REP-09-0171.

Platinum compounds have modest but distinct single-agent activity. Carboplatin may have greatest potential for benefit when combined with taxanes. We investigated whether there is a subset of patients with CRPC for whom the efficacy of combination taxane-estramustine-carboplatin (TEC) chemotherapy may be greatest. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Individual patient data (n = 310) were obtained from seven trials using TEC chemotherapy. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response was defined as > or = 50% post-therapy decline from baseline. Overall survival was defined from baseline to death from any cause. Logistic and Cox regression were used to investigate heterogeneity in outcome to TEC by patient and disease characteristics. Predicted survival probabilities were calculated from the Halabi Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) nomogram. RESULTS: The pooled PSA response proportion was 69% [95% confidence interval (CI) 56% to 80%]. There was no evidence of differential PSA response by disease characteristics.

Therefore, currently available estimates of long-term survival, which are based on survival for patients treated with potentially now obsolete protocols, may not pertain to patients currently diagnosed. METHODS: Using data from the 1973-2005 database of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, we empirically validated a novel model-based method to project 5- and 10-year relative survival of AML patients and we applied the method to project relative survival of AML patients in the United States diagnosed during 2006-2010. RESULTS: Empirical evaluation indicated that the modeling approach provides more accurate estimates of currently diagnosed patients than standard methods of survival analysis, such as cohort analysis or period analysis, in the majority of cases. Projected figures for 2006-2010 show 5- and 10-year relative survival estimates of 21.4% and 18.7% for all ages combined, 62.2% and 57.4% for ages 25-34, and 60.6% and 58.1% for ages 35-44. These estimates are substantially higher than the most up-to-date estimates obtained by standard survival analysis. CONCLUSION: Patients diagnosed with AML during 2006-2010 at younger ages have much higher long-term survival expectations than indicated by previously available survival statistics.","['Pulte, D', 'Gondos, A', 'Brenner, H']","['Pulte D', 'Gondos A', 'Brenner H']","['Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Aging Research, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany; Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark, NJ, USA.

Specific niches within the bone marrow microenvironment provide a sanctuary for subpopulations of leukemic cells to evade chemotherapy-induced death and allow acquisition of a drug-resistant phenotype. This review focuses on molecular and cellular biology of the normal hematopoietic stem cell and the leukemia stem cell niche, and of the molecular pathways critical for microenvironment/leukemia interactions. The key emerging therapeutic targets include chemokine receptors (CXCR4), adhesion molecules (VLA4 and CD44), and hypoxia-related proteins HIF-1alpha and VEGF. Finally, the genetic and epigenetic abnormalities of leukemia-associated stroma will be discussed.

In the present study we tried to identify the mechanism by which antigen causes mast cell migration. Antigen caused migration of RBL-2H3 cells at the concentration ranges of 1000-fold lower than those required for degranulation and the dose response was biphasic. This suggests that mast cells can detect very low concentration gradients of antigen (pg/ml ranges), which initiate migration until they degranulate near the origin of antigen, of which concentration is in the ng/ml ranges. Similar phenomenon was observed in human mast cells (HMCs) derived from CD34(+) progenitors. As one mechanism of mast cell migration, we tested the involvement of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). Fc epsilon RI-mediated cell migration was dependent on the production of S1P but independent of a S1P receptor or its signaling pathways as determined with S1P receptor antagonist VPC23019 and Gi protein inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTX). This indicated that the site of action of S1P produced by antigen stimulation was intracellular. However, S1P-induced mast cell migration was dependent on S1P receptor activation and inhibited by both VPC23019 and PTX. Cell migration towards antigen or extracellular S1P was dependent on the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, while only migration towards antigen was inhibited by the inhibitors of sphingosine kinase and phospholipase C (PLC) and intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA. In summary, our data suggest that the high affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon RI)-mediated mast cell migration is dependent on the production of S1P but independent of S1P receptors. Cell migration mediated by either Fc epsilon RI or S1P receptors involves activation of both PI3K and MAPK.","['Jung, In Duk', 'Lee, Hyun-Sil', 'Lee, Hoi Young', 'Choi, Oksoon Hong']","['Jung ID', 'Lee HS', 'Lee HY', 'Choi OH']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090724,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,PMC2752894,2009/07/28 09:00,2009/11/07 06:00,['2009/07/28 09:00'],"['2009/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(09)00215-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2009.07.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2009 Nov;21(11):1698-705. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2009.07.008.

We found that CD47 was more highly expressed on AML LSC than their normal counterparts, and that increased CD47 expression predicted worse overall survival in three independent cohorts of adult AML patients. Furthermore, blocking monoclonal antibodies directed against CD47 preferentially enabled phagocytosis of AML LSC and inhibited their engraftment in vivo. Finally, treatment of human AML LSC-engrafted mice with anti-CD47 antibody depleted AML and targeted AML LSC.

Cell-surface CD47 interacts with its receptor on macrophages, SIRPalpha, to inhibit phagocytosis of normal, healthy cells. We find that mobilizing cytokines and inflammatory stimuli cause CD47 to be transiently upregulated on mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitors just prior to and during their migratory phase, and that the level of CD47 on these cells determines the probability that they are engulfed in vivo. CD47 is also constitutively upregulated on mouse and human myeloid leukemias, and overexpression of CD47 on a myeloid leukemia line increases its pathogenicity by allowing it to evade phagocytosis. We conclude that CD47 upregulation is an important mechanism that provides protection to normal HSCs during inflammation-mediated mobilization, and that leukemic progenitors co-opt this ability in order to evade macrophage killing.","['Jaiswal, Siddhartha', 'Jamieson, Catriona H M', 'Pang, Wendy W', 'Park, Christopher Y', 'Chao, Mark P', 'Majeti, Ravindra', 'Traver, David', 'van Rooijen, Nico', 'Weissman, Irving L']","['Jaiswal S', 'Jamieson CH', 'Pang WW', 'Park CY', 'Chao MP', 'Majeti R', 'Traver D', 'van Rooijen N', 'Weissman IL']","['Ludwig Center at Stanford, Stanford Cancer Center, Department of Pathology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. sjaiswal@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,PMC2775564,2009/07/28 09:00,2009/08/18 09:00,['2009/07/28 09:00'],"['2008/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/04 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [medline]']","['S0092-8674(09)00651-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cell.2009.05.046 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 2009 Jul 23;138(2):271-85. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2009.05.046.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD47 Antigen)', '0 (Ptpns1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'CD47 Antigen/*immunology', 'Cell Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology', '*Phagocytosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry', 'Receptors, Immunologic', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Up-Regulation', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",,,"['T32 CA009302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA086017-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01HL058770-08/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01CA086017-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P01DK053074-08/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DK053074/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DK053074-08/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA086017/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL058770-08/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL058770/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS123121'],,['Cell. 2009 Jul 23;138(2):226-8.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was used in the research. We investigated clinical and laboratory characteristics of CMML patients and survival status. Patients were followed up regularly through out the course of the research. RESULTS: Forty-one cases were diagnosed as CMML, including 27 male and 14 female patients. Median WBC was 13.7 x 10(9)/L. Five patients had leukocytopenia (1.92-3.46 x 10(9)/L). Median monocyte count in the peripheral blood was 2.13 x 10(9)/L. All patients presented with bone marrow dysplasia, and most showed hyperplasia, except 3 cases. Abnormal chromosome was detected in 34% cases. Median survival time for CMML-1 and CMML-2 was 20 and 12 months, respectively, but there were no statistical significance of survival duration between them. Univariable analysis showed that age (>60 years), neutrophil count (<2.0 x 10(9)/L), lymphocyte count (<1.0 x 10(9)/L), mature monocyte count (>or=5 x 10(9)/L) and anemia (Hb<60 g/L) were associated with poor prognosis for CMML. There was no statistical significance in LDH, gender, and abnormal chromosome for survival time. Only lymphocyte count and neutrophil count in peripheral blood were independent prognostic factors for CMML after multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: CMML mainly occurs in elderly patients. Although most patients have leukocytosis and monocytosis at diagnosis, few cases show leucopenia and monocytopenia. Age, neutrophil, lymphopenia, monocytosis, and severe anemia are associated with inferior prognosis of CMML. Lymphocyte<1.0 x 10(9)/L and neutrophil count<2.0 x 10(9)/L are adversely independent prognostic factors for CMML.","['Chen, Bobin', 'Ma, Yan', 'Xu, Xiaoping', 'Wang, Xiaoqin', 'Qin, Wenjiao', 'Ji, Meirong', 'Lin, Guowei']","['Chen B', 'Ma Y', 'Xu X', 'Wang X', 'Qin W', 'Ji M', 'Lin G']","['Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, 12 Urumqi Road Middle, 200040 Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090724,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,2009/07/28 09:00,2010/03/27 06:00,['2009/07/28 09:00'],"['2009/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/03 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00352-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.07.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Apr;34(4):458-62. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.07.011.

Infection of two HNSCC cell lines, SCC25 and CAL27 by an Ad5 mutant (lp11w) defective in coding for the viral anti-apoptosis protein, E1B-19K efficiently induced apoptotic cell death. In cells infected with lp11w there was a dramatic down-regulation of EGFR by apoptosis-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-2, BCL-xL and MCL-1 were also down-regulated in lp11w-infected cells compared to uninfected or Ad5-RM infected cells. Infection with lp11w also enhanced sensitivity of the HNSCC cells to the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin.

Increased expression of Bcl-2 has been associated with poor response to chemotherapy in various malignancies, including leukemia. Therefore, bypassing the resistance conferred by anti-apoptotic factors such as Bcl-2 represents an attractive therapeutic strategy against cancer cells, including leukemic cells. We undertook this study to examine whether SAHA (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid) overcomes the resistance by Bcl-2 in human leukemic cells, with a specific focus on the involvement of PML-NBs. Experiments were conducted with Bcl-2-overexpressing human leukemic U937 cells. Since we previously demonstrated that overexpression of Bcl-2 attenuates resveratrol-induced apoptosis in human leukemic U937 cells, resveratrol-treated U937 cells were used as a negative control. The present study indicates that SAHA at 1-7 microM, the dose range known to induce apoptosis in various cancer cells, overcomes the anti-apoptotic effects of Bcl-2 in Bcl-2-overexpressing human leukemic U937 cells. Notably, we observed that SAHA-induced formation of mature promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) correlates with overcoming the anti-apoptotic effects of Bcl-2 in human leukemic U937 cells. Thus, PML protein and the formation of mature PML-NBs could be considered as therapeutic targets that could help bypass the resistance to apoptosis conferred by Bcl-2.

Hematopoiesis, the process of blood cell formation, provides a powerful experimental system for investigating this process. Here, we employ transcriptional regulatory elements from the stem cell leukemia (SCL) gene to selectively label primitive and definitive hematopoiesis. We report that SCL-labelled cells arising in the mid to late streak embryo give rise to primitive red blood cells but fail to contribute to the vascular system of the developing embryo. Restricting SCL-marking to different stages of foetal development, we identify a second population of multilineage progenitors, proficient in contributing to adult erythroid, myeloid and lymphoid cells. The distinct lineage-restricted potential of SCL-labelled early progenitors demonstrates that primitive erythroid cell fate specification is initiated during mid gastrulation. Our data also suggest that the transition from a hemangioblastic precursors with endothelial and blood forming potential to a committed hematopoietic progenitor must have occurred prior to SCL-marking of definitive multilineage blood precursors.","['Bockamp, Ernesto', 'Antunes, Cecilia', 'Liebner, Stefan', 'Schmitt, Steffen', 'Cabezas-Wallscheid, Nina', 'Heck, Rosario', 'Ohnngemach, Svetlana', 'Oesch-Bartlomowicz, Barbara', 'Rickert, Christof', 'Sanchez, Maria Jose', 'Hengstler, Jan', 'Kaina, Bernd', 'Wilson, Anne', 'Trumpp, Andreas', 'Eshkind, Leonid']","['Bockamp E', 'Antunes C', 'Liebner S', 'Schmitt S', 'Cabezas-Wallscheid N', 'Heck R', 'Ohnngemach S', 'Oesch-Bartlomowicz B', 'Rickert C', 'Sanchez MJ', 'Hengstler J', 'Kaina B', 'Wilson A', 'Trumpp A', 'Eshkind L']","['Medical Centre of the Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz, Institute for Toxicology, 55131 Mainz, Germany. bockamp@uni-mainz.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090723,Ireland,Mech Dev,Mechanisms of development,9101218,,2009/07/28 09:00,2010/02/02 06:00,['2009/07/28 09:00'],"['2009/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/13 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0925-4773(09)01422-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mod.2009.07.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mech Dev. 2009 Oct;126(10):863-72. doi: 10.1016/j.mod.2009.07.005.

As leukemia is a disease state that may be associated with a compromised immune system, it was hypothesized that depressed TLR4 function resulting from decreased gene expression might be related to the development and further sustained presence of a leukemic clone of cells. This study thus analyzed gene expression of TLR4 in groups of lymphocytic leukemia cases, myeloid leukemia cases, cases of myeloid leukemia in remission, and normal controls by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). It was observed that TLR4 gene expression was indeed decreased to a statistically significant degree (P<0.05) in both the lymphocytic leukemic subset and myeloid leukemic subset when compared to normal controls. Thus, further study is warranted into determining whether this decreased TLR4 expression contributes to the pathogenesis of leukemic clone development through an associated depressed immune surveillance as well as whether TLR4 agonists might serve to effectively strengthen the response of the immune system in battling leukemic burden.","['Webb, R N', 'Cruse, J M', 'Lewis, R E']","['Webb RN', 'Cruse JM', 'Lewis RE']","['Immunopathology Section, University of Mississippi Medical Center, 2500 North State Street, Jackson, MS 39216, USA. rachwebb@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090723,Netherlands,Exp Mol Pathol,Experimental and molecular pathology,0370711,,2009/07/28 09:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/07/28 09:00'],"['2009/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4800(09)00092-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexmp.2009.07.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Pathol. 2009 Oct;87(2):117-26. doi: 10.1016/j.yexmp.2009.07.007.

Specifically, we evaluated compounds in which the reactive warhead is positioned in place of the P1 aspartic acid side chain as well as at the C-terminus of the peptide. Interestingly, both classes of inhibitors were effective and vinyl ketones and vinyl sulfones showed the greatest potency for the target protease.

We aimed to quantify the incidence of and mortality from leukaemias in the UK and their variation with gender, age, year of diagnosis as well as socio-economic status. METHODS: All incident cases of leukaemia were identified in 'The Health Improvement Network' (THIN) General Practice dataset. Crude incidence rates and incidence rate ratios (using Poisson Regression) stratified by age, gender, year of diagnosis and socio-economic status were calculated. Median survival and hazard ratios for risk of death (using Cox regression) were then calculated, and stratified in a similar manner. RESULTS: A total of 4162 cases of leukaemia were identified, 2314 (56%) of whom were male. The overall incidence of leukaemia was 11.25 per 100,000 person-years. The age and gender distributions of ALL, AML, CLL and CML were similar to UK cancer registry data. The incidence of leukaemias was independent of socio-economic class. Median survival from leukaemia was 6.58 years and mortality increased with increasing age at diagnosis. The prognosis in AML was dismal and worsened with increasing socio-economic deprivation. For other leukaemias mortality was independent of socio-economic status. CONCLUSION: This is the first general population study to describe the incidence of and mortality from leukaemias in the UK by socio-economic status. Similar mortality across socio-economic gradients in the leukaemias studied suggests equal access to and uptake of services. The exception to this was in AML, where poorer survival in AML patients from lower socio-economic classes may represent a class bias in treatment offered and/or greater co-morbidity in these patients, and warrants further exploration.","['Bhayat, Fatima', 'Das-Gupta, Emma', 'Smith, Chris', 'McKeever, Tricia', 'Hubbard, Richard']","['Bhayat F', 'Das-Gupta E', 'Smith C', 'McKeever T', 'Hubbard R']","['Division of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Nottingham, Clinical Sciences Building, Nottingham City Hospital, Nottingham, NG5 1PB, UK. mcxfb1@exmail.nottingham.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090726,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC2722672,2009/07/28 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/28 09:00'],"['2009/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-9-252 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-9-252 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2009 Jul 26;9:252. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-9-252.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Sex Factors', 'Social Class', 'United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differences in these areas have become a major health policy focus in the United States. Our study was undertaken to examine the demographic and clinical features of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients presenting initially at the LAC+USC Medical Center, which serves an ethnically diverse population. RESULTS: Patients were evenly split by gender, overwhelmingly Hispanic (60.9%), and quite young (median age 39, range 17-65) compared with previously reported CML patient populations. Previous CML studies identified significant anemia (Hgb <12 g/dl), significant thrombocytosis (platelets >450 x 109/l), and significant leukocytosis (WBC >50 x 109/l) as significant adverse pretreatment prognostic factors. Using these indicators, in addition to the validated Hasford and Sokal scores, patients were stratified and analyzed via gender and ethnicity. A significantly greater proportion of women presented with significant anemia (p = 0.019, Fisher's exact test) and significant thrombocytosis (p = 0.041, Fisher's exact test) compared to men, although no differences were found in risk stratification or treatment response. MCV values for women were significantly (p = 0.02, 2-sample t-test) lower than those for men, suggesting iron deficiency anemia. Focusing on ethnicity, Hispanics as a whole had significantly lower Hasford risk stratification (p = 0.046, Fisher's exact test), and significantly greater likelihood (p = 0.016, Fisher's exact test) of achieving 3-month complete haematological remission (CHR) compared with non-Hispanics at LAC+USC Medical Center, though differences in treatment outcome were no longer significant with analysis limited to patients treated with first-line imatinib. CONCLUSION: Female CML patients at LAC+USC Medical Center present with more significant adverse pre-treatment prognostic factors compared to men, but achieve comparable outcomes. Hispanic patients present with lower risk profile CML and achieve better treatment responses compared to non-Hispanic patients as a whole; these ethnic differences are no longer significant when statistical analysis is limited to patients given imatinib as first-line therapy. Our patients achieve response rates inferior to those of large-scale national studies. This constellation of findings has not been reported in previous studies, and is likely reflective of a unique patient population.","['Lee, Justin P', 'Birnstein, Elliott', 'Masiello, David', 'Yang, Dongyun', 'Yang, Allen S']","['Lee JP', 'Birnstein E', 'Masiello D', 'Yang D', 'Yang AS']","['Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA. justinpl@usc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090724,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,PMC2727534,2009/07/28 09:00,2010/06/16 06:00,['2009/07/28 09:00'],"['2009/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-2-30 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-2-30 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2009 Jul 24;2:30. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-2-30.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', '*Ethnicity/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/epidemiology/ethnology/*therapy', 'Los Angeles/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Sex Characteristics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Validation Studies as Topic', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed the leukemogenic efficacy of one such HZE species, 1 GeV (56)Fe ions, a component of space radiation, in a mouse model for radiation-induced acute myeloid leukemia. CBA/CaJ mice were irradiated with 1 GeV/nucleon (56)Fe ions or (137)Cs gamma rays and followed until they were moribund or to 800 days of age. We found that 1 GeV/nucleon (56)Fe ions do not appear to be substantially more effective than gamma rays for the induction of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, (56)Fe-ion-irradiated mice had a much higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) than gamma-irradiated mice, with an estimated RBE of approximately 50. These data suggest a difference in the effects of HZE iron ions on the induction of leukemia compared to solid tumors, suggesting potentially different mechanisms of tumorigenesis.","['Weil, Michael M', 'Bedford, Joel S', 'Bielefeldt-Ohmann, Helle', 'Ray, F Andrew', 'Genik, Paula C', 'Ehrhart, Eugene J', 'Fallgren, Christina M', 'Hailu, Fitsum', 'Battaglia, Christine L R', 'Charles, Brad', 'Callan, Matthew A', 'Ullrich, Robert L']","['Weil MM', 'Bedford JS', 'Bielefeldt-Ohmann H', 'Ray FA', 'Genik PC', 'Ehrhart EJ', 'Fallgren CM', 'Hailu F', 'Battaglia CL', 'Charles B', 'Callan MA', 'Ullrich RL']","['Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences and, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523, USA. michael.weil@colostate.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,2009/07/28 09:00,2009/09/24 06:00,['2009/07/28 09:00'],"['2009/07/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1667/RR1648.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Res. 2009 Aug;172(2):213-9. doi: 10.1667/RR1648.1.,['E1UOL152H7 (Iron)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Cosmic Radiation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Heavy Ions', 'Incidence', 'Iron', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Liver Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/statistics & numerical data']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After 20 months a diagnosis of disease transformation to acute monocytic leukemia (M5b) was made. Conventional G-banded analysis of unstimulated bone marrow cultures demonstrated a jumping translocation (JT) involving proximal and distal breakpoints on donor chromosome 3 at bands 3q1?2 and 3q21, respectively. Recipient chromosomes included the long-arm telomeric regions of chromosomes 5, 10, 14, 16, and 19. A low-level trisomy 8 clone was also found in association with both proximal and distal JT clones. Conventional G-banded analysis of unstimulated peripheral blood cultures detected the proximal 3q1?2 JT clone involving recipient chromosome 10 several weeks after transformation to acute monocytic leukemia. Interestingly, JTs involving recipient chromosomes 5, 14, 16, and 19 were not detected in this peripheral blood sample. Palliative care was administered until his demise 2.2 months after disease transformation. There have been fewer than 70 cases of acquired JTs reported in the literature, including one myeloproliferative neoplasm and five acute myeloid leukemias involving a single breakpoint site on donor chromosome 3. Our case is unique as it is the first acquired case to demonstrate a JT involving alternative pericentromeric breakpoint sites on a single donor chromosome consisting of a proximal breakpoint at 3q1?2 and a more distal breakpoint at 3q21.","['McGrattan, Peter', 'Logan, Amy', 'Humphreys, Mervyn', 'Bowers, Margaret']","['McGrattan P', 'Logan A', 'Humphreys M', 'Bowers M']","['Northern Ireland Regional Genetics Centre, Belfast City Hospital, Belfast Health & Social Care Trust, Lisburn Road, Belfast, BT9 7AB, Northern Ireland, UK. peter.mcgrattan@belfasttrust.hscni.net']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20090722,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,,2009/07/25 09:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2009/07/25 09:00'],"['2008/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-009-9266-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2010 Sep;27(3):667-72. doi: 10.1007/s12032-009-9266-0.

Furthermore, especially in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, anaemia and leukopenia, doctors recommend abstaining from physical exercise due to the risk of potential bleeding and tissue damage. The normally recommended cutoff level to perform exercise is 50,000 platelets per microliter or haemoglobin of 8 g/dl. This leads to a vicious cycle of losing physical strength and muscle with subsequent development of treatment-related cachexia and an increased treatment mortality. As number of publications focus on the importance of physical exercise in patients with solid tumours, increasing evidence is found that suggests positive effects on major clinical endpoints such as rate of infection, quality of life and even relapse rate and overall survival. With this work, we intended to address whether intense supervised ergometer training is feasible in patients with severe pancytopenia and whether it has any effect on patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy. Furthermore, this study was initiated as the groundwork for a large phase III randomised trial.","['Elter, Thomas', 'Stipanov, Martina', 'Heuser, Eva', 'von Bergwelt-Baildon, Michael', 'Bloch, Wilhelm', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Baumann, Freerk']","['Elter T', 'Stipanov M', 'Heuser E', 'von Bergwelt-Baildon M', 'Bloch W', 'Hallek M', 'Baumann F']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. thomas.elter@uk-koeln.de.', 'Institute for Rehabilitation and Sports for the Disabled, German Sport University Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Max-Eder Nachwuchsgruppe der Deutschen Krebshilfe, Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute for Rehabilitation and Sports for the Disabled, German Sport University Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute for Rehabilitation and Sports for the Disabled, German Sport University Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20090724,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,2009/07/25 09:00,2009/11/13 06:00,['2009/07/25 09:00'],"['2008/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/10 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-009-0376-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-009-0376-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2009 Sep;90(2):199-204. doi: 10.1007/s12185-009-0376-4.

The aim of this study was to investigate the serum thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) concentration in Chinese patients with CLL and its correlation with well-established other prognostic factors. Enhanced chemiluminescent dot blot assay was performed to measure serum TK1 concentration in 80 CLL patients. The concentration of TK1 was significantly increased in patients with Binet C (P = 0.002), higher levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P = 0.012) and beta2-microglobulin (beta2-MG) (P = 0.025), unmutated IGHV status (P < 0.001), or higher expression levels of ZAP-70 (P = 0.014) and CD38 (P = 0.018) groups compared to the patients with Binet A, lower levels of serum LDH and beta2-MG, mutated IGHV status, or lower expression levels of ZAP-70 and CD38 groups, respectively. Strong correlation of TK1 level with IGHV mutations (r = 0.412, P < 0.001) or ZAP-70 (r = 0.263, P = 0.024) was observed. According to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for serum TK1 concentration and IGHV mutational status, area under the curve was 0.757 (P = 0.001) and the optimal cut-off value of serum TK1 concentration level was 1.75 pM, with a 87.8% specificity, a 63.6% sensitivity. It was showed that serum TK1 concentration could be a predictive marker of IGHV mutational status, and might be applied for the assessment of prognosis in patients with CLL.","['Xu, Wei', 'Cao, Xin', 'Miao, Kou-Rong', 'Qiao, Chun', 'Wu, Yu-Jie', 'Liu, Qiong', 'Fan, Lei', 'Li, Jian-Yong']","['Xu W', 'Cao X', 'Miao KR', 'Qiao C', 'Wu YJ', 'Liu Q', 'Fan L', 'Li JY']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, 210029, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, 210029, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, 210029, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, 210029, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, 210029, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, 210029, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, 210029, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, 210029, Nanjing, China. lijianyonglm@medmail.com.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090724,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,2009/07/25 09:00,2009/11/13 06:00,['2009/07/25 09:00'],"['2009/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/06 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-009-0380-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-009-0380-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2009 Sep;90(2):205-211. doi: 10.1007/s12185-009-0380-8.

A descriptive study was conducted in the territory of the VC local health authority. To estimate incidence, hospital discharge forms were analysed together with data from pathology archives. The standardized incidence rate (SIR) was calculated by using age specific rates in the VC local health authority in the years 2002-2005 and the tumour incidence in the city of Turin as the standard population. As regards low mortality tumours, an excess of bladder cancers (SIR=1,2; 1,1-1,3) and melanomas (SIR=1,3; 1,1-1,6) were found in males and of thyroid cancer (SIR=1,9; 1,6-2,2) and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (SIR=1,4; 1,2-1,6) in females. In addition, an excess of rectal and colon cancers, and leukemia were observed in both genders and of central nervous system tumours in women. This preliminary study may be considered as a basis for the creation of a tumour registry which would necessarily need to integrate additional sources of information. In any case the results of this study have identified certain peculiarities regarding the epidemiology of tumours in this area, which should be further studied in terms of a Public Health problem.","['Salerno, Christian', 'Bagnasco, Gabriele', 'Panella, Massimiliano', 'Comelli, Mario']","['Salerno C', 'Bagnasco G', 'Panella M', 'Comelli M']","['Dipartimento Prevenzione - SISP, ASL VC Vercelli. christiansalerno@aliceposta.it']",['ita'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Italy,Ig Sanita Pubbl,Igiene e sanita pubblica,0373022,,2009/07/25 09:00,2009/10/02 06:00,['2009/07/25 09:00'],"['2009/07/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/02 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ig Sanita Pubbl. 2009 May-Jun;65(3):253-60.,,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Medical Records', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Patient Discharge', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stime d'incidenza oncologica nell'Asl Vc di Vercelli dal 2002 al 2005.,,,,

However, little is known about the effect of heavy ion beams on the proliferation and differentiation of human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). The present study examined the effect of heavy ion beams on gene expression in human HSPCs, especially during early stage of megakaryocytopoiesis. Human CD34+ cells were exposed to monoenergetic carbon-ion beams (290 MeV/nucleon, LET = 50 KeV/m) that were generated by an accelerator (Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba). The expression of various genes related to early hematopoiesis, megakaryocytopoiesis/erythropoiesis, cytokine receptors and oxidative stress were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. Friend leukemia virus integration 1, an early hematopoiesis-related gene, showed significantly higher mRNA expression than the control at 6 hr after irradiation. In contrast, no significant differences were observed in almost all of the other early hematopoiesis-related genes, cytokine receptor-coded genes and megakaryocytopoiesis/erythropoiesis-differentiation pathway-related genes, respectively. An analysis of the response of the genes to oxidative stress revealed the expression of heme oxygenase 1 to show a 1.5-fold and 11.9-fold increase from the day 0 control at 24 hr after 0.5 Gy and 2 Gy irradiation, respectively. Similarly, the NAD(P)H dehydrogenase-quinone 1 expression also showed a 22.0-fold and a 21.8-fold increase at 6 hr in comparison to the initial control. These results showed that the heavy ion beams affect megakaryocytopoiesis/ erythropoiesis differentiation of human HSPCs on the gene expression level.","['Monzen, Satoru', 'Takahashi, Kenji', 'Yoshino, Hironori', 'Kasai-Eguchi, Kiyomi', 'Abe, Yoshinao', 'Maruyama, Atsushi', 'Itoh, Ken', 'Kashiwakura, Ikuo']","['Monzen S', 'Takahashi K', 'Yoshino H', 'Kasai-Eguchi K', 'Abe Y', 'Maruyama A', 'Itoh K', 'Kashiwakura I']","['Department of Radiological Life Sciences, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Health Sciences, Hirosaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090724,England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,,2009/07/25 09:00,2009/11/11 06:00,['2009/07/25 09:00'],"['2009/07/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jrr/09058 [pii]', '10.1269/jrr.09058 [doi]']",ppublish,J Radiat Res. 2009 Sep;50(5):477-86. doi: 10.1269/jrr.09058.

This study investigated whether VPA treatment would improve survival in a clinically relevant large animal model of poly-trauma/hemorrhagic shock, and whether the protective effects are executed through the Akt survival pathway. METHODS: Yorkshire swine were subjected to a poly-trauma protocol including: (1) Pre-hospital phase- Femur fracture, 60% hemorrhage, 30 min of shock (mean arterial pressure [MAP]: 25-30 mmHg), and infusion of 154mM NaCl (3 x shed blood); (2) Early hospital phase A Grade V liver injury (simulating rupture of a previously contained hematoma) followed by liver packing; (3) Treatment/monitoring phase randomization to 3 treatment groups (n = 6-8/group): no treatment (control), fresh whole blood (FWB), and intravenous VPA (400 mg/kg, given during the pre-hospital phase). Animals were monitored for 4 h, with survival being the primary endpoint. Liver tissue was subjected to Western blot analysis. RESULTS: FWB (n = 6) and VPA treatments (n = 7) significantly increased survival (100% and 86%, respectively) compared to control group (n = 8) (25%). The protocol produced significant anemia (Hb<6 g/dL) and lactic acidosis (lactate 3-5 mmol/L). Acidosis improved after blood transfusion and worsened in the other two groups. VPA treatment increased phospho-Akt (activated), phospho-GSK-3beta (Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta), beta-catenin and Bcl-2 (B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2) protein levels compared to control group (P = .01, .01, .03, and .02, respectively). There was no significant difference in the level of these proteins between the control and FWB groups. CONCLUSION: Treatment with VPA without blood transfusion improves early survival in a highly lethal poly-trauma and hemorrhagic shock model. The survival advantage is due not to improvement in resuscitation but to better tolerance of shock by the cells, in part due to the preservation of the Akt survival pathway.","['Alam, Hasan B', 'Shuja, Fahad', 'Butt, Muhammad U', 'Duggan, Michael', 'Li, Yongqing', 'Zacharias, Nikolaos', 'Fukudome, Eugene Y', 'Liu, Baoling', 'Demoya, Marc', 'Velmahos, George C']","['Alam HB', 'Shuja F', 'Butt MU', 'Duggan M', 'Li Y', 'Zacharias N', 'Fukudome EY', 'Liu B', 'Demoya M', 'Velmahos GC']","['Department of Surgery, Division of Trauma, Emergency Surgery and Surgical Critical Care, Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA. hbalam@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090625,United States,Surgery,Surgery,0417347,,2009/07/25 09:00,2009/08/19 09:00,['2009/07/25 09:00'],"['2009/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/19 09:00 [medline]']","['S0039-6060(09)00249-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.surg.2009.04.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Surgery. 2009 Aug;146(2):325-33. doi: 10.1016/j.surg.2009.04.007.

Therefore, we examined the possibility that cancer cell growth is reduced by treatment with a Perilla leaf ethanol extract (PLE) using human leukemia HL-60 cells and then investigated the mechanism of the growth inhibition. We found that PLE treatment suppressed cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that PLE treatment caused the appearance of a sub-G1 DNA peak and induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. We detected DNA ladders in PLE-treated cells by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the cleavage of pro-caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase with remarkable activation of caspase-8, -9, and -3. Western blot analysis revealed dose-dependent increases in Bax and cytochrome c in cytosol fractions and decreased Bid and pro-caspase-8 and -3 in PLE-treated cells. In addition, glucose-regulated protein 78, phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha, phosphorylated c-jun N-terminal kinase, and p21 levels were increased by PLE treatment in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the p27 level was not changed. We concluded that PLE induced apoptosis through the combinations of mitochondrial, death receptor-mediated, and endoplasmic reticulum pathways and suppressed the cell proliferation via p21-mediated G1 phase arrest in HL-60 cells.","['Kwak, Chung Shil', 'Yeo, Eui Ju', 'Moon, Sung Chae', 'Kim, Young Wha', 'Ahn, Hong Ju', 'Park, Sang Chul']","['Kwak CS', 'Yeo EJ', 'Moon SC', 'Kim YW', 'Ahn HJ', 'Park SC']","['Institute on Aging, Seoul National University, Seoul. kwakcs@snu.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Med Food,Journal of medicinal food,9812512,,2009/07/25 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/25 09:00'],"['2009/07/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jmf.2008.1103 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Food. 2009 Jun;12(3):508-17. doi: 10.1089/jmf.2008.1103.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/drug effects/metabolism', 'Flavonoids/analysis/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Perilla frutescens/*chemistry', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Plant Leaves', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FK506 and CSA, as two immunosuppress agents, were applied in leukemia mice and intact mice, and leukemia mice were as control. RESULTS: Some HSCs could survive in the host treated with FK506 and CSA at least 2 weeks, while HSCs survived only 1 week in intact or leukemia control mice. Simultaneously, the level of IL-2 and IL-4 in leukemia mice treated with FK506 and CSA decreased significantly than those of intact or leukemia control mice. CONCLUSION: FK506 can promote the survival of HSCs in host, and the mechanism may be associated with the down regulation of IL-2 and IL-4.","['Chen, Jing', 'Li, Chun-fu']","['Chen J', 'Li CF']","['Department of Pediatric, Nan fang Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Sichuan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Sichuan da xue xue bao.

Leukemic cells from 57 adult patients with normal karyotype de novo AML were analyzed for p14ARF mRNA expression level using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We also tested the effect of conventional anti-leukemic drugs and the mutant p53-targeting small molecule PRIMA-1 in vitro. Patients whose cells expressed more p14ARF mRNA than the 75th percentile (0.26) had significantly better survival compared with those expressing lower levels, 61 vs. 30% 3-year survival (p = 0.046). The difference remained significant also when NPM1/FLT3 status was considered. The mean effects of all the tested conventional anti-leukemic drugs were greater in leukemic cell samples expressing p14ARF mRNA >or= 0.26, but the differences were not statistically significant. In contrast, PRIMA-1 had a significantly greater effect on leukemic cell samples with low levels of p14ARF mRNA.

CALGB 8691 is a randomized study of daily oral cyclophosphamide (CPA) at 100 mg/m2 with or without IFN-alpha2 at 2 x 106 IU/m2 three times per week, followed by a second randomization between IFN-alpha2 maintenance (2 x 106 IU/m2 three times weekly) versus observation in treatment-naive patients with follicular lymphoma (FL). Five hundred eighty-one patients were randomized to either CPA (n = 293) or CPA plus IFN-alpha2 (n = 288). One hundred five responding patients were randomized to observation and 99 to maintenance IFN-alpha2. With a median follow-up of 11.5 years, the median event-free and overall survival (OS) for CPA induction alone were 2.5 years (95% CI 2.2, 3.0) and 9 years (95% CI 7.7, 10.2), compared to 2.4 years (95% CI 2.1, 3.1) and 8.4 years (95% CI 7.5, 11.1) for the combination arm (p = NS).

Patients with a PR randomized to IFN-alpha2 had a similar EFS to compared to patients with complete response (CR), but this did not translate into a survival advantage. Myelosuppression was increased in IFN-alpha2-containing arms. Despite the small benefit in EFS in patients with PR randomized to IFN-alpha2 maintenance, we conclude that the addition of low dose IFN-alpha2 did not significantly improve the response rate, duration of response, event-free, or OS obtained with single-agent daily oral CPA in patients with previously untreated FL.","['Smith, S M', 'Johnson, J', 'Cheson, B D', 'Canellos, G', 'Petroni, G', 'Oken, M', 'Duggan, D', 'Hurd, D', 'Gockerman, J P', 'Parker, B', 'Prchal, J', 'Peterson, B A']","['Smith SM', 'Johnson J', 'Cheson BD', 'Canellos G', 'Petroni G', 'Oken M', 'Duggan D', 'Hurd D', 'Gockerman JP', 'Parker B', 'Prchal J', 'Peterson BA']","['Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA. smsmith@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,PMC5765852,2009/07/25 09:00,2010/03/30 06:00,['2009/07/24 09:00'],"['2009/07/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['913275241 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190903093807 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Oct;50(10):1606-17. doi: 10.1080/10428190903093807.,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD20/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Failure', 'Young Adult']",,,"['U10 CA032291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA02599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47555/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA041287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA04326/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA04457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA08025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA07968/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS904156'],,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Oct;50(10):1562-3.

However, a kind of loss of function in mice (CCN3 del VWC domain -/-) demonstrated mild abnormality, which indicates that CCN3 may not be critical for the normal embryogenesis as a single gene. The importance of CCN3 in bone marrow environment becomes to be recognized by the studies of hematopoietic stem cells and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia cells. CCN3 expression in bone marrow has been denied by several investigations, but we found CCN3 positive stromal and hematopoietic cells at bone extremities with a new antibody although they are a very few populations. We investigated the expression pattern of CCN3 in the cultured bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells and found its preference for osteogenic differentiation. From the analyses of in vitro experiment using an osteogenic mesenchymal stem cell line, Kusa-A1, we found that CCN3 downregulates osteogenesis by two different pathways; suppression of BMP and stimulation of Notch. Secreted CCN3 from Kusa cells inhibited the differentiation of osteoblasts in separate culture, which indicates the paracrine manner of CCN3 activity. CCN3 may also affect the extracellular environment of the niche for hematopoietic stem cells.","['Katsube, Ken-Ichi', 'Ichikawa, Saki', 'Katsuki, Yuko', 'Kihara, Tasuku', 'Terai, Masanori', 'Lau, Lester F', 'Tamamura, Yoshihiro', ""Takeda, Shin'ichi"", 'Umezawa, Akihiro', 'Sakamoto, Kei', 'Yamaguchi, Akira']","['Katsube K', 'Ichikawa S', 'Katsuki Y', 'Kihara T', 'Terai M', 'Lau LF', 'Tamamura Y', 'Takeda S', 'Umezawa A', 'Sakamoto K', 'Yamaguchi A']","['Oral Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8549, Japan, ken-tmd@umin.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090723,Netherlands,J Cell Commun Signal,Journal of cell communication and signaling,101308338,PMC2721088,2009/07/25 09:00,2009/07/25 09:01,['2009/07/24 09:00'],"['2009/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/25 09:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12079-009-0059-1 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Commun Signal. 2009 Jun;3(2):135-45. doi: 10.1007/s12079-009-0059-1.

We have analyzed cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](c)) determination, mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase-3 and -9 activity by fluorimetric methods, using the fluorescent ratiometric calcium indicator Fura-2, the dye JC-1, and specific fluorogenic substrate, respectively. Our results indicated that treatment of HL-60 cells with 10 microM UTP or 1 microM thapsigargin induced a transient increase in [Ca(2+)](c) due to calcium release from internal stores. The stimulatory effect of UTP and thapsigargin on calcium signal was followed by a mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Our results also indicated that UTP and thapsigargin were able to increase the caspase-3 and -9 activities. The effect of UTP and thapsigargin on caspase activation was time dependent, reaching a maximal caspase activity after 60 min of stimulation. Loading of cells with 10 microM dimethyl BAPTA, an intracellular calcium chelator, for 30 min significantly reduced both UTP- or thapsigargin-induced mitochondrial depolarization and caspase activation. Similar results were obtained when the cells were pretreated with 10 microM Ru360 for 30 min, a specific blocker of calcium uptake into mitochondria. The findings suggest that UTP- and thapsigargin-induced caspase-3 and -9 activation and mitochondrial membrane depolarization is dependent on rises in [Ca(2+)](c) in human myeloid HL-60 cells.","['Gonzalez, D', 'Espino, J', 'Bejarano, I', 'Lopez, J J', 'Rodriguez, A B', 'Pariente, J A']","['Gonzalez D', 'Espino J', 'Bejarano I', 'Lopez JJ', 'Rodriguez AB', 'Pariente JA']","['Department of Physiology, Faculty of Science, University of Extremadura, 06071, Badajoz, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090721,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,,2009/07/25 09:00,2010/03/03 06:00,['2009/07/24 09:00'],"['2009/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11010-009-0215-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2010 Jan;333(1-2):151-7. doi: 10.1007/s11010-009-0215-1.

Towards this end, using XenoMouse technology, a fully human IgG1 anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody was generated. This antibody, denoted mAb 1.5.3, evoked enhanced pro-apoptotic activity in vitro, as compared to rituximab, in the Ramos lymphoma cell line. Also, mAb 1.5.3 mediated both complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) similar to rituximab in human B-lymphoma lines. Interestingly, mAb 1.5.3 demonstrated superior ADCC compared to rituiximab when FcgammaRIIIa F/F allotype donors were profiled and superior cytolytic activity across multiple human B-lymphoma and chronic B-cell leukemia lines in an in vitro whole blood assay. Furthermore, mAb 1.5.3 exhibited enhanced anti-tumor activity in Ramos, Daudi, and Namalwa tumour xenograft models. Lastly, mAb 1.5.3 produced a superior B-cell depletion profile in lymph node organs and bone marrow as compared to rituximab in a primate pharmacodynamic (PD) model. These findings underscore the potential of mAb 1.5.3 to exhibit improved clinical activity in the treatment of B-cell malignancies compared to rituximab.","['Bornstein, Gadi Gazit', 'Queva, Christophe', 'Tabrizi, Mohammad', 'van Abbema, Anne', 'Chavez, Carlos', 'Wang, Ping', 'Foord, Orit', 'Ahluwalia, Kiran', 'Laing, Naomi', 'Raja, Sandhya', 'Wen, Shenghua', 'Green, Larry L', 'Yang, Xiaodong', 'Webster, Carl', 'Stewart, Ross', 'Blakey, David']","['Bornstein GG', 'Queva C', 'Tabrizi M', 'van Abbema A', 'Chavez C', 'Wang P', 'Foord O', 'Ahluwalia K', 'Laing N', 'Raja S', 'Wen S', 'Green LL', 'Yang X', 'Webster C', 'Stewart R', 'Blakey D']","['AstraZeneca R&D Boston, 35 Gatehouse Drive, Waltham, MA 02451, USA. gadi.gazit-bornstein@astrazeneca.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090721,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,,2009/07/25 09:00,2010/10/22 06:00,['2009/07/24 09:00'],"['2009/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-009-9291-z [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2010 Oct;28(5):561-74. doi: 10.1007/s10637-009-9291-z.

The establishment of the indications for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) therefore requires individualized risk stratification based on a combination of multiple diagnostic methods, including cytogenetic and molecular genetic studies, and immunophenotyping, as well as the sensitivity of the disease to chemotherapy. METHODS: This article surveys the current strategies for establishing the indications for SCT in AML on the basis of a selective review of the relevant literature in the Medline database. RESULTS: In patients with a high risk constellation-e.g., chromosome 7 anomalies, complex aberrations, or FLT3-length mutations-there is an indication for SCT in first remission. The balanced translocations t(15;17) and t(8;21), and the inversion inv(16) are prognostically favorable and are thus not considered an indication for SCT in first remission. The establishment of indications for stem cell transplantation also depends on the residual leukemic cell burden (minimal residual disease, MRD) as determined by the quantitative polymerase chain reaction or by flow cytometry, as well as an insufficient response to induction chemotherapy. Reduced-dose conditioning, a new technique that lessens acute toxicity, has been found to be associated with a 30% to over 50% two-year survival rate when used in the treatment of chemotherapeutically unresponsive or relapsing AML. DISCUSSION: The indications for allogeneic SCT in AML should be further refined by more investigation in large studies.","['Zander, Axel Rolf', 'Bacher, Ulrike', 'Finke, Jurgen']","['Zander AR', 'Bacher U', 'Finke J']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080926,Germany,Dtsch Arztebl Int,Deutsches Arzteblatt international,101475967,PMC2700644,2009/07/25 09:00,2009/07/25 09:01,['2009/07/24 09:00'],"['2006/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/25 09:01 [medline]']",['10.3238/arztebl.2008.0663 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2008 Sep;105(39):663-9. doi: 10.3238/arztebl.2008.0663.

For more than 20 years, the frequency of such mycoses has been increasing with the aggressiveness of tumor treatment. METHODS: Autopsy findings over a 30-year period (1976 to 2005) from a single institution (Institute of Pathology, University of Essen) were retrospectively classified according to basic disease, frequency of mycoses, kind of mycoses, organs involved, hematopoietic transplantation, and cause of death. RESULTS: 340 of 1591 autopsied patients with hematological neoplasias (21.4%) revealed an invasive mycosis. The proportion increased from about 10% before 1980 to some 30% in the 1990s but fell to 21% by 2005. The frequency of mycoses decreased significantly both for transplanted patients (from 47.5% to 30.3%) and for non-transplanted patients (from 29.8% to 16.4%). The rate of deaths due to mycosis also decreased. The relative frequency of candidal mycoses went down, while aspergilloses predominated. The organ most frequently involved was the lung. DISCUSSION: The autopsy results signal a trend reversal in the leading complication of the treatment of hematological neoplasias and lend support to the assumption that antimycotic strategies are having a positive effect.","['Donhuijsen, Konrad', 'Petersen, Peter', 'Schmid, Werner Kurt']","['Donhuijsen K', 'Petersen P', 'Schmid WK']","['Institut fur Pathologie des Stadtischen Klinikums Braunschweig, Celler Strasse 38, Braunschweig, Germany. k.donhuijsen@klinikum-braunschweig.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080714,Germany,Dtsch Arztebl Int,Deutsches Arzteblatt international,101475967,PMC2696922,2009/07/25 09:00,2009/07/25 09:01,['2009/07/24 09:00'],"['2007/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/25 09:01 [medline]']",['10.3238/arztebl.2008.0501 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2008 Jul;105(28-29):501-6. doi: 10.3238/arztebl.2008.0501.

The updated recommendations include (1) alemtuzumab monotherapy can be safely used as first-line therapy; (2) suitable patient subgroups for alemtuzumab therapy include elderly patients, patients with 17p deletion, patients with refractory autoimmune cytopenias and patients with profound pancytopenia at baseline due to heavily infiltrated bone marrow; (3) alemtuzumab treatment should be continued for 12 weeks (36 doses) whenever possible, and bone marrow examination may be considered at week 12 to evaluate response; (4) monitoring CMV reactivation by weekly PCR is mandated during therapy; when CMV reactivation becomes symptomatic or viremia increases, alemtuzumab therapy should be interrupted and anti-CMV therapy started; (5) subcutaneous administration is safe, easy to perform and appears equally effective compared with intravenous infusion and (6) our strong recommendation is that alemtuzumab combination therapy and consolidation therapy shall not be used outside carefully controlled clinical studies.","['Osterborg, A', 'Foa, R', 'Bezares, R F', 'Dearden, C', 'Dyer, M J S', 'Geisler, C', 'Lin, T S', 'Montillo, M', 'van Oers, M H J', 'Wendtner, C-M', 'Rai, K R']","['Osterborg A', 'Foa R', 'Bezares RF', 'Dearden C', 'Dyer MJ', 'Geisler C', 'Lin TS', 'Montillo M', 'van Oers MH', 'Wendtner CM', 'Rai KR']","['Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. anders.osterborg@karolinska.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090723,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2009/07/25 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/24 09:00'],"['2009/07/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009146 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.146 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Nov;23(11):1980-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.146.

However, existing immunodeficient strains of mice have short life spans and low levels of AML cell engraftment, hindering long-term evaluation of primary human AML biology. A recent study suggested that NOD/LtSz-scid IL2Rgammac null (NSG) mice have enhanced AML cell engraftment, but this relied on technically challenging neonatal injections. Here, we performed extensive analysis of AML engraftment in adult NSG mice using tail vein injection. Of the 35 AML samples analyzed, 66% showed bone marrow engraftment over 0.1%. Further, 37% showed high levels of engraftment (>10%), with some as high as 95%. A 2-44-fold expansion of AML cells was often seen. Secondary and tertiary recipients showed consistent engraftment, with most showing further AML cell expansion. Engraftment did not correlate with French-American-British subtype or cytogenetic abnormalities. However, samples with FLT3 mutations showed a higher probability of engraftment than FLT3 wild type. Importantly, animals developed organomegaly and a wasting illness consistent with advanced leukemia. We conclude that the NSG xenotransplantation model is a robust model for human AML cell engraftment, which will allow better characterization of AML biology and testing of new therapies.","['Sanchez, P V', 'Perry, R L', 'Sarry, J E', 'Perl, A E', 'Murphy, K', 'Swider, C R', 'Bagg, A', 'Choi, J K', 'Biegel, J A', 'Danet-Desnoyers, G', 'Carroll, M']","['Sanchez PV', 'Perry RL', 'Sarry JE', 'Perl AE', 'Murphy K', 'Swider CR', 'Bagg A', 'Choi JK', 'Biegel JA', 'Danet-Desnoyers G', 'Carroll M']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090723,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC3659827,2009/07/25 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/24 09:00'],"['2009/07/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009143 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.143 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Nov;23(11):2109-17. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.143.

Neoplastic T lymphocytes frequently become resistant to the IFN-gamma/STAT1 apoptotic pathway, often because of the downregulation of the IFN-gammaR2 receptor chain. Many studies suggest that cross-regulation between different STATs, in particular between STAT1 and STAT3, may profoundly affect cytokine/growth factor signaling. Here, the function of STAT3 in the negative regulation of STAT1 apoptotic pathway was investigated by RNA interference-mediated STAT3 silencing in human malignant T lymphocytes. In STAT3-depleted cells, interleukin (IL)-6 acquired the capacity to induce apoptosis, correlating with prolonged STAT1 activation and the induction of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression. In contrast, in the absence of STAT3, IFN-gamma could slightly enhance apoptosis but its ability to induce MHC class I expression was unchanged. Accordingly, IL-6, but not IFN-gamma, could significantly impair the in vivo growth of STAT3-depleted human neoplastic T lymphocytes transplanted into severe combined immunodeficient mice. Therefore, treatment with IL-6 and simultaneous STAT3 silencing may represent a potential therapeutic approach to control the expansion of IFN-gamma-unresponsive neoplastic T cells.","['Regis, G', 'Icardi, L', 'Conti, L', 'Chiarle, R', 'Piva, R', 'Giovarelli, M', 'Poli, V', 'Novelli, F']","['Regis G', 'Icardi L', 'Conti L', 'Chiarle R', 'Piva R', 'Giovarelli M', 'Poli V', 'Novelli F']","['The Center for Experimental Research and Medical Studies (CERMS), San Giovanni Battista Hospital-Molinette, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090723,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2009/07/25 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/24 09:00'],"['2009/07/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009139 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.139 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Nov;23(11):2102-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.139.

Patients in both studies were randomized to receive 25 mg daily oral lenalidomide or identical placebo, plus 40 mg oral dexamethasone. In this pooled analysis, using data up to unblinding (June 2005 for MM-009 and August 2005 for MM-010), treatment with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone significantly improved overall response (60.6 vs 21.9%, P<0.001), complete response rate (15.0 vs 2.0%, P<0.001), time to progression (median of 13.4 vs 4.6 months, P<0.001) and duration of response (median of 15.8 months vs 7 months, P<0.001) compared with dexamethasone-placebo. At a median follow-up of 48 months for surviving patients, using data up to July 2008, a significant benefit in overall survival (median of 38.0 vs 31.6 months, P=0.045) was retained despite 47.6% of patients who were randomized to dexamethasone-placebo receiving lenalidomide-based treatment after disease progression or study unblinding.

Although CD160 is an important molecule for the control of cell-mediated cytotoxic responses, the mechanisms of regulation of its expression is unknown. We investigated the regulation of CD160 transcription by localizing and analyzing its promoter. The CD160 gene is encoded on chromosome 1, contains 6 exons with the translation initiation codon in exon 3. Bioinformatics analysis pointed to three potential promoter regions, two upstream of exon 1 and one in front of exon 3. RACE-PCR analysis identified a single transcription start site (TSS) and reporter gene transfections localized the active region immediately upstream of exon 1. Sequential deletion analysis led to the identification of a 371 bp sequence, located between -314 and +57 relative to the TSS, as the core promoter sequence driving CD160 gene transcription. Sequence alignment of the mouse and human CD160 genomic promoter region revealed a strong homology in the 371 bp sequence identified and pointed out to three conserved transcription factor binding sites for acute myelogenous leukemia-1 (AML-1), FREAC-4 and Sox17. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that the predicted AML-1 site is essential for the regulation of CD160 gene expression.","['Schmitt, C', 'Ghazi, B', 'Bellier, F', 'Bensussan, A']","['Schmitt C', 'Ghazi B', 'Bellier F', 'Bensussan A']","['INSERM, U976, Paris, France. christian.schmitt@inserm.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090723,England,Genes Immun,Genes and immunity,100953417,,2009/07/25 09:00,2009/12/29 06:00,['2009/07/24 09:00'],"['2009/07/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['gene200952 [pii]', '10.1038/gene.2009.52 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Immun. 2009 Oct;10(7):616-23. doi: 10.1038/gene.2009.52.

Despite response to induction chemotherapy, most patients ultimately relapse. Further, among elderly patients, aggressive therapy options are often limited due to other medical conditions and decreased tolerance of these patients to conventional chemotherapy. Internal tandem duplications (ITD) of the FLT3 juxtamembrane domain occur in 20-30% of AML patients and predict poor outcome. First clinical data with the FLT3 inhibitor tandutinib demonstrated antileukemic activity in approximately half of the patients--predominantly with FLT3 ITD positive AML. But the data also show that optimal use of tandutinib will require combination therapy with cytotoxic agents. Notably, single agent tandutinib has not been associated with myelosuppression, mucositis or cardiac toxicity--the dose limiting toxicities of AML chemotherapy. We determined the feasibility of combining tandutinib with the standard ""3 + 7"" induction regimen in AML and show that, in contrast to other structurally unrelated FLT3 inhibitors recently evaluated in clinical trials, the use of tandutinib displayed application sequence independent synergistic antileukemic effects in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin. Strong synergistic antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects were thereby predominantly seen on FLT3 ITD positive blasts. Further we demonstrate, that addition of tandutinib may allow dose reduction of chemotherapy without loss of overall antileukemic activity--resulting in a potential decrease of side effects. This approach might be an interesting novel strategy especially in the treatment of elderly/comorbid patients. Our data provide a rationale for combining tandutinib with induction chemotherapy in intensified as well as in dose reduction protocols for FLT3 ITD positive AML.","['Schittenhelm, Marcus M', 'Kampa, Kerstin M', 'Yee, Kevin W H', 'Heinrich, Michael C']","['Schittenhelm MM', 'Kampa KM', 'Yee KW', 'Heinrich MC']","['Medizinische Universitatsklinik, Department of Hematology, Oncology, Rheumatology, Immunology and Pulmology, Eberhard-Karls-University, Tubingen, Germany. marcus.schittenhelm@med.uni-tuebingen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090824,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,,2009/07/25 09:00,2009/10/29 06:00,['2009/07/24 09:00'],"['2009/07/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['9355 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.8.16.9355 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2009 Aug 15;8(16):2621-30. doi: 10.4161/cc.8.16.9355.

The attenuation of clock genes has been suggested as a putative cause for the development of sickness behavior syndrome in infectious and autoimmune diseases. Here, the authors studied the effect of TNF-alpha at early time points (<3 h) on intracellular signaling events and clock gene expression in fibroblasts. Interaction of TNF-alpha with TNFR1 (Tnfrsf1a , CD120a, p55), but not TNFR2 (Tnfrsf1b, CD120b , p75), leads to fast downregulation of gene expression of Dbp and upregulation of negative regulators of the molecular clock, Per1 and Per2, Cryptochrome-1 (Cry1), and Differentiated embryo chondrocytes-1 (Dec1). Since the decrease of Dbp is also observed in cells deficient for Per1/Per2, Cry1/Cry2 , or Dec1, these genes are unlikely to be responsible for inhibition of Dbp. The early effect of TNF-alpha on the clock gene Per1 is dependent on p38, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and/or calcium signaling, whereas the effect on Dbp is independent of p38 MAPK, but also involves calcium signaling. Both genes remain unaffected by the NF-kappaB and AP-1 pathway. Taken collectively these data show p38 MAPK- and calcium-dependent TNFR1-mediated transient increase of the negative regulator Per1 and an independent decrease of Dbp.","['Petrzilka, Saskia', 'Taraborrelli, Cornelia', 'Cavadini, Gionata', 'Fontana, Adriano', 'Birchler, Thomas']","['Petrzilka S', 'Taraborrelli C', 'Cavadini G', 'Fontana A', 'Birchler T']","['Division of Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Biol Rhythms,Journal of biological rhythms,8700115,,2009/07/25 09:00,2009/09/15 06:00,['2009/07/24 09:00'],"['2009/07/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['24/4/283 [pii]', '10.1177/0748730409336579 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Rhythms. 2009 Aug;24(4):283-94. doi: 10.1177/0748730409336579.,"['0 (CRY1 protein, human)', '0 (CRY2 protein, human)', '0 (Cry1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cry2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cryptochromes)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Dbp protein, mouse)', '0 (Flavoproteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (PER1 protein, human)', '0 (Per1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Period Circadian Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Clocks/*genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/drug effects', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cryptochromes', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Flavoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Period Circadian Proteins', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PRAME is a tumor-associated antigen and has been described as a corepressor of retinoic acid signaling in solid tumor cells, but its function in hematopoietic cells is unknown. PRAME mRNA expression increased with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) disease progression and its detection in late chronic-phase CML patients before tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy was associated with poorer therapeutic responses and ABL tyrosine kinase domain point mutations. In leukemia cell lines, PRAME protein expression inhibited granulocytic differentiation only in cell lines that differentiate along this lineage after all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) exposure. Forced PRAME expression in normal hematopoietic progenitors, however, inhibited myeloid differentiation both in the presence and absence of ATRA, and this phenotype was reversed when PRAME was silenced in primary CML progenitors. These observations suggest that PRAME inhibits myeloid differentiation in certain myeloid leukemias, and that its function in these cells is lineage and phenotype dependent.

As alternative therapies are available for imatinib resistance, early identification of mutations may prevent disease progression. Because most patients are routinely monitored by BCR-ABL quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), it is important to define the optimal increase in BCR-ABL that should trigger mutation testing. Expert panels have provisionally recommended a 10-fold BCR-ABL increase as the trigger for mutation screening, acknowledging the lack of consensus. To address this question, we monitored 150 CML patients by quantitative PCR and DNA sequencing. Thirty-five different mutations were identified in 53 patients, and, during 22.5 months (median) of follow-up after sequencing, mutations were significantly predictive of shorter progression-free survival. An unbiased receiver operating characteristic analysis identified a 2.6-fold increase in BCR-ABL RNA as the optimal cutoff for predicting a concomitant KD mutation, with a sensitivity of 77% (94% if including subsequent samples). The 2.6-fold threshold approximated the analytic precision limit of our PCR assay.

However, the presence and significance of prolonged cytopenias after completion of treatment have not been thoroughly quantified. METHODS: Sixty-one patients receiving initial therapy with fludarabine-based regimens were categorised according to the presence of post-treatment cytopenias (haemoglobin <110-130 g/l depending on sex and age, neutrophils <2.0 x 10(9)/l, or platelets <140 x 10(9)/l) lasting >3 months. RESULTS: Persistent cytopenias unrelated to persistent disease were found in 43% of patients. Cytopenias were associated with clinically important rates of infection and transfusion requirement (P = 0.03) and predicted for worse overall survival (61% versus 96% at 60 months, P = 0.05). Increasing age predicted for persistent cytopenias (P = 0.02), but the presence of pretreatment cytopenias and delivered dose intensity were not predictive. The median times to resolution of anaemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were 7, 9, and 10 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Cytopenias often persist >3 months after first-line fludarabine combination therapy and can lead to important clinical sequelae. Although cytopenias generally resolve over time, treating physicians should be aware of these factors when considering fludarabine combination chemotherapy and when documenting treatment response status in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.","['Gill, S', 'Carney, D', 'Ritchie, D', 'Wolf, M', 'Westerman, D', 'Prince, H M', 'Januszewicz, H', 'Seymour, J F']","['Gill S', 'Carney D', 'Ritchie D', 'Wolf M', 'Westerman D', 'Prince HM', 'Januszewicz H', 'Seymour JF']","['Division of Haematology and Medical Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre.', 'Division of Haematology and Medical Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre.', 'Division of Haematology and Medical Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre; Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Division of Haematology and Medical Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre.', 'Division of Haematology and Medical Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre.', 'Division of Haematology and Medical Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre; Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Division of Haematology and Medical Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre.', 'Division of Haematology and Medical Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre; Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

Infection is the main side effect of this regimen, which may affect the treatment efficacy and prognosis without proper intervention. This study was to summarize the characteristics of the modified BFM-90 regimen related infection, and explore effective approaches to treat the infection. METHODS: The infection rate, site, pathogen were reviewed for the infections of 104 children and adolescents suffering from lymphoblastic lymphoma at different phases of the modified BFM-90 regimen. The relationship between chemotherapy, bone marrow suppression and infection was analyzed. The value of procalcitonin (PCT) in identifying the infection type and the outcome of anti-infection treatment was evaluated. RESULTS: The infection rates in reduction phases Ia, Ib and re-reduction phases IIa, IIb were 52.5%, 60.7% and 48.6%, 28.2%, respectively. The infection rate in consolidation chemotherapy for patients with low to intermediate risk and high risk were 17.2% and 100%, respectively. In total 302 infections occurred. One hundred and sixty-seven cases (55.3%) had documented infection sites, most of which happened to the respiratory tract. Ninety-five cases (31.5%) had documented pathogens, most of which were Gram-negative bacteria. Infections of 262 cases (86.8%) were secondary to bone marrow suppression. The sensitivity and specificity of PCT in diagnosing sepsis were 83.3% and 70.2%, but it failed to identify the infection type. After the anti-infection treatment, 296 cases were cured, four cases gave up further treatment due to financial difficulties, two cases died of sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Infections caused by modified BFM-90 regimen for lymphoblastic lymphoma in children and adolescents are closely correlated to bone marrow suppression. The positive diagnosis rate of the pathogen is too low to identify most of the infection type. The treatment still mainly depends on experience.","['Zhen, Zi-Jun', 'Xia, Yi', 'Ling, Jia-Yu', 'Tong, Gang-Ling', 'Lin, Lin', 'Cai, Yue', 'Sun, Xiao-Fei']","['Zhen ZJ', 'Xia Y', 'Ling JY', 'Tong GL', 'Lin L', 'Cai Y', 'Sun XF']","[""State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, Guargdong, 510060, People's Republic of China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,,2009/07/25 09:00,2011/07/16 06:00,['2009/07/24 09:00'],"['2009/07/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1000-467X200907718 [pii]', '10.5732/cjc.008.10673 [doi]']",ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2009 Jul;28(7):718-24. doi: 10.5732/cjc.008.10673.,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Cephalosporins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'AIEOP acute lymphoblastic leukemia protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/*drug therapy', 'Cephalosporins/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross Infection/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Itraconazole/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Mouth Diseases/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Mycoses/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: MTT assay was used to detect the effect of AMP on the cytotoxicity of ADR. Jin's formula was used to analyze the effect of combined drug therapy. The expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) on cell membrane of K562/ADR was detected using PE-labeled antibody. Flow cytometry was used to determine the influence of AMP on the intracellular accumulation of ADR. RESULT: AMP at the concentration of 1.25 to 5 mg x L(-1) could significantly reverse the multidrug resistance (MDR) to ADR in K562/ADR cells. Co-administration of 1.25 mg x L(-1) AMP and low concentrations of ADR showed an antagonistic effect, while there was an additional to synergistic effect when the concentration of AMP was above 2.5 mg x L(-1). AMP could decrease the expression of P-gp in a concentration-dependent manner and increase the intracellular accumulation of ADR in K562/ADR cells. CONCLUSION: AMP could increased the cytotoxicity and the intracellular accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs in MDR associated tumor cells through inhibiting the efflux of drugs by P-gp.

Urticaria pigmentosa is the most common manifestation of cutaneous mastocytosis that manifests as a generalized eruption of round or oval erythematous macules, papules and plaques with variable amounts of brown pigment, usually on the trunk, but may also occur in all regions of the body including face and mucous membranes. Pruritus, dermographism and Darier's sign are additional features of these eruptions. Mastocytosis may also be manifested as mastocytoma, a rare, benign, pediatric tumor that results from hyperplasia of mast cells in papillary dermis in the first few weeks of life.

To date, multiple primer pairs for the detection of the various PML-RARalpha transcripts have been designed, potentially generating some nonspecific amplification products. Here, we established a real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) strategy with a single primer pair using LightCycler (sp-RQ-PCR), which could simultaneously detect three isoforms with equal specificity and sensitivity as well as alternative spliced forms. Results obtained with sp-RQ-PCR for 39 samples from 15 APL patients and 31 non-APL samples were compared with those with TaqMan assay with three primer pairs. In two of the APL samples, PML-RARalpha was detected in the TM, but not in the sp-RQ-PCR or nested PCR. Furthermore, the sp-RQ-PCR showed no positive results for the 31 non-APL samples, whereas the TM identified 13% (4/31) as positive. Electrophoresis detected some artifacts in the TM, which do not correspond to PML-RARalpha.

CXCR7 is an atypical chemokine receptor frequently expressed by tumor cells and known to promote cell growth and survival. We found that HTLV-1-immortalized T cells expressing Tax consistently expressed CXCR7. Induction of Tax in JPX-9 upregulated CXCR7. Wild-type Tax efficiently activated the CXCR7 promoter via a proximal NF-kappaB site, while a mutant Tax selectively defective in NF-kappaB activation did not. CCX754, a synthetic CXCR7 antagonist, inhibited cell growth and increased apoptosis of HTLV-1-immortalized T cells. Knockdown of CXCR7 by small interfering RNA also reduced cell growth. Stable expression of CXCR7 in a CXCR7-negative ATL cell line promoted cell growth and survival.

We have shown previously that the negative growth regulator, CCN3, is down-regulated as a result of Bcr-Abl kinase activity and that CCN3 has a reciprocal relationship of expression with BCR-ABL. We now show that CCN3 confers growth regulation in CML cells by causing growth inhibition and regaining sensitivity to the induction of apoptosis. The mode of CCN3 induced growth regulation was investigated in K562 CML cells using gene transfection and treatment with recombinant CCN3. Both strategies showed CCN3 regulated CML cell growth by reducing colony formation capacity, increasing apoptosis and reducing ERK phosphorylation. K562 cells stably transfected to express CCN3 showed enhanced apoptosis in response to treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib. Whilst CCN3 expression was low or undetectable in CML stem cells, primary CD34+ CML progenitors were responsive to treatment with recombinant CCN3. This study shows that CCN3 is an important growth regulator in haematopoiesis, abrogation of CCN3 expression enhances BCR-ABL dependent leukaemogenesis. CCN3 restores growth regulation, regains sensitivity to the induction of apoptosis and enhances imatinib cell kill in CML cells. CCN3 may provide an additional therapeutic strategy in the management of CML.","['McCallum, Lynn', 'Lu, Wanhua', 'Price, Susan', 'Lazar, Noureddine', 'Perbal, Bernard', 'Irvine, Alexandra E']","['McCallum L', 'Lu W', 'Price S', 'Lazar N', 'Perbal B', 'Irvine AE']","[""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Lisburn Road, Belfast, BT9 7BL, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090722,Netherlands,J Cell Commun Signal,Journal of cell communication and signaling,101308338,PMC2721087,2009/07/23 09:00,2009/07/23 09:01,['2009/07/23 09:00'],"['2009/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/23 09:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12079-009-0058-2 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Commun Signal. 2009 Jun;3(2):115-24. doi: 10.1007/s12079-009-0058-2.

The question whether leukemia rates are increased near nuclear power plants is controversial. The German Childhood Cancer Registry has published an epidemiological case-control study on childhood cancer and nuclear power plants. METHOD: The study was based on the distance of children's residences from nuclear power plants and addressed the question whether children under age 5 with cancer live closer, on average, to nuclear power plants than randomly selected controls. Odds Ratios (OR) for distance categories and standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated. RESULTS: An association was found between the nearness of residence to nuclear power plants and the risk of leukemia (593 cases, 1766 controls). Within the 5-km zone, the OR for the development of leukemia in children under 5 years of age was 2.19 compared to the rest of the region, and this elevation of the OR was statistically significant. The incidence of leukemia in the overall study region was the same as that in Germany as a whole (SIR=0.99; 95% confidence interval 0.92-1.07). DISCUSSION: Based on the available information about radiation emissions from German nuclear power plants, a direct relation to radiation seems implausible. Many factors may conceivably cause leukemia, possibly operating in combination, and these factors may be present to a greater extent in the vicinity of German nuclear power plants.","['Kaatsch, Peter', 'Spix, Claudia', 'Jung, Irene', 'Blettner, Maria']","['Kaatsch P', 'Spix C', 'Jung I', 'Blettner M']","['Institut fur Medizinische Biometrie, Epidemiologie und Informatik, Klinikum der Johannes Gutenberg-Universitat Mainz.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20081017,Germany,Dtsch Arztebl Int,Deutsches Arzteblatt international,101475967,PMC2696975,2009/07/23 09:00,2009/07/23 09:01,['2009/07/23 09:00'],"['2008/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/23 09:01 [medline]']",['10.3238/arztebl.2008.0725 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2008 Oct;105(42):725-32. doi: 10.3238/arztebl.2008.0725.

METHODS: This article is based on a selective literature search and on the authors' clinical and pathological experience. RESULTS: The clinical manifestations of mastocytosis range from cutaneous mastocytosis, a common, prognostically favorable presentation, to mast cell leukemia, a rare, life-threatening disease. The mediator-induced symptoms usually respond well to H1 antihistamines. Therapeutic standards for cytoreduction in the progressive, systemic forms of mastocytosis are still lacking. DISCUSSION: Because some of the manifestations of mastocytosis are nonspecific and can be mimicked by other diseases, there is a risk of two types of diagnostic error: Mastocytosis may remain undiagnosed when it is actually present, or it may be diagnosed even though morphological and molecular findings rule out mastocytosis. Well-defined criteria should be used to differentiate mastocytosis from other diseases with a similar clinical presentation.","['Horny, Hans-Peter', 'Sotlar, Karl', 'Valent, Peter', 'Hartmann, Karin']","['Horny HP', 'Sotlar K', 'Valent P', 'Hartmann K']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20081003,Germany,Dtsch Arztebl Int,Deutsches Arzteblatt international,101475967,PMC2696962,2009/07/23 09:00,2009/07/23 09:01,['2009/07/23 09:00'],"['2007/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/23 09:01 [medline]']",['10.3238/arztebl.2008.0686 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2008 Oct;105(40):686-92. doi: 10.3238/arztebl.2008.0686.

METHODS: A total of 121 consecutive patients who underwent allogeneic stem-cell transplantation from November 2001 to March 2008 and survived at least 3 months after transplantation were included in this study. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (38.8%) expressed at least one of various autoantibodies after transplantation. Antinuclear antibody was positive in 22 patients (18.2%), antidouble stranded DNA in seven (5.8%), antismooth muscle antibody in six (5%), rheumatoid factor in 17 (14.0%), and a positive Coombs test recorded for 12 patients (9.9%). cGVHD was more commonly diagnosed in the patients with autoantibody expression (61.7% vs. 43.2%, P=0.048). The patients expressing autoantibodies had a better 5-year overall survival than those without any autoantibody expression: 70.2% and 47.9% for the autoantibody-positive and autoantibody-negative patients, respectively (P=0.002). The cumulative incidence of relapse was 21.5% and 39.3% for the autoantibody-positive and autoantibody-negative patients, respectively (P=0.023). In particular, the patients expressing autoantibodies without cGVHD had a better overall survival (100%) than the patients in the other groups: 63.1% for the autoantibody- and cGVHD-positive patients, 59.6% for the autoantibody-negative and cGVHD-positive patients, and 36.6% for the autoantibody- and cGVHD-negative patients. The multivariate analysis identified autoantibody expression as a good prognostic factor regarding survival (hazard ratio=0.378, 95% confidence interval=0.185-0.775, P=0.008). CONCLUSION: The occurrence of autoantibodies after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation was found to be related to cGVHD, and patients expressing autoantibodies had a better survival.","['Moon, Joon-Ho', 'Lee, Soo-Jung', 'Kim, Jong-Gwang', 'Chae, Yee-Soo', 'Kim, Shi-Nae', 'Kang, Byung-Woog', 'Suh, Jang-Soo', 'Lee, Kun-Soo', 'Sohn, Sang-Kyun']","['Moon JH', 'Lee SJ', 'Kim JG', 'Chae YS', 'Kim SN', 'Kang BW', 'Suh JS', 'Lee KS', 'Sohn SK']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu 700-721, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,2009/07/23 09:00,2009/09/17 06:00,['2009/07/23 09:00'],"['2009/07/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/TP.0b013e3181ac6885 [doi]', '00007890-200907270-00015 [pii]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2009 Jul 27;88(2):242-50. doi: 10.1097/TP.0b013e3181ac6885.,"['0 (Antibodies, Antinuclear)', '0 (Autoantibodies)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Antinuclear/blood', 'Autoantibodies/*blood', 'Female', 'Graft Survival/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T cells and natural killer (NK) cells have been linked to the development of GVHD. Modulation of these cells via the CD2 receptor may be a potentially important approach to the management of this disease. METHODS: The safety profile and tolerability of siplizumab (MEDI-507), a humanized anti-CD2 IgG-1kappa monoclonal antibody, in the treatment of GVHD were evaluated in a phase I, double-blind, multiple-dose, placebo-controlled study. Thirty-four subjects with at least grade II acute GVHD were randomized to receive four doses of 0.012, 0.04, 0.12, or 0.4 mg/kg siplizumab or placebo intravenously every 3 days. Subjects received concurrent 2 mg/kg per day methylprednisolone for more than or equal to 10 days. RESULTS: No meaningful difference occurred between siplizumab and placebo groups in the incidence or severity of adverse events or laboratory test results. No increase in incidence of infection secondary to siplizumab treatment was observed. During 100 days postinitial infusion, a modest increase in resolution of GVHD, grade 0 (67% vs. 54%, P=0.0629), was reported for the siplizumab-treated group. CONCLUSION: Siplizumab administered with corticosteroid therapy for grade II or higher acute GVHD treatment exhibited an acceptable safety profile that would support further clinical development.","['Adkins, Douglas', 'Ratanatharathorn, Voravit', 'Yang, Harry', 'White, Barbara']","['Adkins D', 'Ratanatharathorn V', 'Yang H', 'White B']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University and Siteman Cancer Center, St. Louis, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,2009/07/23 09:00,2009/09/17 06:00,['2009/07/23 09:00'],"['2009/07/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/TP.0b013e3181abfbf7 [doi]', '00007890-200907270-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2009 Jul 27;88(2):198-202. doi: 10.1097/TP.0b013e3181abfbf7.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', 'KUW1QG1ZM3 (siplizumab)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy', 'Safety', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies of allergies suggest that a child's immune development may be modulated by maternal immune status. We conducted a study to explore the relationship between maternal immunoglobulin E (IgE) and childhood leukemia and to investigate whether maternal immune status can influence childhood leukemia risk. Serum total and specific IgE (respiratory and food) were measured in biological mothers of 352 children (193 healthy controls and 159 leukemia cases, including 139 ALL cases) ages <8 years who were enrolled in the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study. Odds ratios associated with maternal IgE were calculated using unconditional logistic regression adjusted for child's age, sex, race/ethnicity, and annual household income. A positive association between childhood leukemia or ALL and elevated levels of maternal serum total IgE was observed, especially among Hispanics.

Among a myriad of biological activities described for xanthone derivatives, the anticancer activity is quite remarkable, but the molecular mechanism is not clearly resolved. In the present study, we investigated the antiangiogenic mechanism of 3,6-di(2,3-epoxypropoxy)xanthone (EPOX), a novel Mcl-1 targeting drug. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To evaluate the antiangiogenic activity of EPOX, we did cell viability, cell cycle, tube formation assay in vitro, and Matrigel plug assay in vivo. To evaluate the effect of EPOX on the endothelial signaling pathway, we did immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence analysis. Intracellular glutathione levels were determined with the use of monochlorobimane, a glutathione-specific probe. RESULTS: EPOX induced endothelial cell apoptosis in association with proteasome-dependent Mcl-1 degradation. Down-regulation of Mcl-1 resulted in an increase in Mcl-1-free Bim, activation of Bax, and then signaling of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Additionally, glutathione depletion and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inactivation was observed in EPOX-treated cells. Glutathione supplementation reversed the inhibitory effects of EPOX on ERK, which increases the phosphorylation of Mcl-1 at T(163.) Overexpression of mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase (MEK) partially reversed the effect of EPOX on Mcl-1 dephosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation, further implicating ERK in the regulation of Mcl-1 stability. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that EPOX induces glutathione depletion, ERK inactivation, and Mcl-1 degradation on endothelial cells, which leads to inhibition of angiogenesis. Our results suggest that EPOX is a novel antiangiogenic agent, making it a promising lead compound for further development in the treatment of angiogenesis-related pathologies.","['Sun, Hui-Lung', 'Tsai, An-Chi', 'Pan, Shiow-Lin', 'Ding, Qingqing', 'Yamaguchi, Hirohito', 'Lin, Chun-Nan', 'Hung, Mien-Chie', 'Teng, Che-Ming']","['Sun HL', 'Tsai AC', 'Pan SL', 'Ding Q', 'Yamaguchi H', 'Lin CN', 'Hung MC', 'Teng CM']","['Pharmacological Institute, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090721,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,2009/07/23 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/23 09:00'],"['2009/07/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-09-0269 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-0269 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Aug 1;15(15):4904-14. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-0269.

We examined MM-targeted delivery of CD40L by a conditional replicative oncolytic adenovirus, AdEHCD40L. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The growth-regulatory activity of AdEHCD40L was determined in vitro and in vivo. Differential analysis with AdEHCD40L and parental virus (AdEHNull)-infected cultures allowed the identification of cellular and molecular pathways modulated by the CD40L transgene. RESULTS: Conditional expression of viral E1A and CD40L transgene was shown in human MM lines RPMI 8226 [interleukin (IL)-6 independent] and Kas-6/1 (IL-6 dependent) under hypoxic conditions commonly found in MM in situ. AdEHCD40L inhibited MM cell growth more effectively than AdEHNull. This enhanced growth-inhibitory activity was abrogated by cotreatment with a CD40L antibody. Chemoresistant MM lines (MR20 and LR5) were similarly susceptible to AdEHCD40L treatment. AdEHCD40L induced apoptosis and S-phase cell cycle blockade while uniquely up-regulating the previously described proapoptotic elements tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, Fas, and IL-8. Intratumoral injections of AdEHCD40L reduced the growth of severe combined immunodeficient/hu RPMI 8226 xenografts by >50% compared with 28% reduction by AdEHNull. Adenoviral hexon and CD40L were detected in AdEHCD40L-treated tumors at day 35 after infection primarily in necrotic areas, suggesting viral replicative activity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that CD40L acts in concert with viral oncolysis to produce MM growth inhibition through activation of cellular apoptosis. The direct growth-inhibitory activity of AdEHCD40L, together with the well-known immune-potentiating features of CD40L, may be clinically applicable for the experimental treatment of MM or plasma cell leukemia.","['Fernandes, Margret S', 'Gomes, Erica M', 'Butcher, Lindsay D', 'Hernandez-Alcoceba, Reuben', 'Chang, Dongkun', 'Kansopon, Joe', 'Newman, Joseph', 'Stone, Marvin J', 'Tong, Alex W']","['Fernandes MS', 'Gomes EM', 'Butcher LD', 'Hernandez-Alcoceba R', 'Chang D', 'Kansopon J', 'Newman J', 'Stone MJ', 'Tong AW']","['Cancer Immunology Research Laboratory, Baylor Sammons Cancer Center, Baylor University Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75246, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090721,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,2009/07/23 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/23 09:00'],"['2009/07/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-09-0451 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-0451 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Aug 1;15(15):4847-56. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-0451.

This study was to investigate the biological function of SHIP gene in pathogenesis of leukemia cells by lentiviral vector-mediated SHIP transfection. METHODS: Ectopic SHIP gene was transfected into leukemia K562 cells by the mediation of lentiviral vector. The mRNA level of SHIP was detected by fluorescent quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR). The expression of SHIP, Akt, and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) was detected by Western blot. The proliferation and morphology of K562 cells before and after SHIP gene transfection were compared. RESULTS: The proliferation of K562 cells was inhibited after transfection: the proliferation inhibition rate was increased from (9.9+/-1.5)% on Day 3 to (40.6+/-2.3)% on Day 5. K562 cells were SHIP-negative but expressed high level of p-Akt which was down-regulated from 0.533 to 0.245 (P<0.01) after SHIP transfection. Apoptotic characteristics were showed in K562 cells after SHIP transfection. The early apoptosis rate was significantly higher in K562-wtSHIP-FIV-G cells than in K562-FIV-G cells and untransfected K562 cells [(38.3+/-4.3)% vs. (8.2+/-0.9)% and (7.7+/-0.8)%, P<0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: SHIP gene can inhibit cell proliferation and promote cell apoptosis via inactivating PI3K/Akt pathway. Loss of SHIP might activate PI3K/Akt pathway and promote the proliferation of K562 cells.","['Yang, Lin', 'Luo, Jian-Min', 'Liu, Xiao-Jun', 'Wen, Shu-Peng', 'Du, Xing-Yan', 'Yao, Li']","['Yang L', 'Luo JM', 'Liu XJ', 'Wen SP', 'Du XY', 'Yao L']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Hebei Midical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, 050000, PR China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,,2009/07/23 09:00,2011/06/24 06:00,['2009/07/23 09:00'],"['2009/07/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['1000-467X200904366 [pii]'],ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2009 Apr;28(4):366-72.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.56 (Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'K562 Cells', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'src Homology Domains/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although PTPs are generally considered to be negative regulators on the basis of their ability to oppose the effects of protein tyrosine kinases, SHP-2 is unusual in that it promotes the activation of the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway by receptors for various growth factors and cytokines. The molecular basis for the activation of SHP-2 is also unique: In the basal state, the NH(2)-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-2 interacts with the PTP domain, resulting in autoinhibition of PTP activity; the binding of SHP-2 via its SH2 domains to tyrosine-phosphorylated growth factor receptors or docking proteins, however, results in disruption of this intramolecular interaction, leading to exposure of the PTP domain and catalytic activation. Indeed, SHP-2 proteins with artificial mutations in the NH(2)-terminal SH2 domain have been shown to act as dominant active mutants in vitro. Such activating mutations of PTPN11 (human SHP-2 gene) were subsequently identified in individuals with Noonan syndrome, a human developmental disorder that is sometimes associated with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Furthermore, somatic mutations of PTPN11 were found to be associated with pediatric leukemia. SHP-2 is also thought to participate in the development of other malignant disorders, but in a manner independent of such activating mutations. Biochemical and functional studies of SHP-2 and genetic analysis of PTPN11 in human disorders have thus converged to provide new insight into the pathogenesis of cancer as well as potential new targets for cancer treatment.","['Matozaki, Takashi', 'Murata, Yoji', 'Saito, Yasuyuki', 'Okazawa, Hideki', 'Ohnishi, Hiroshi']","['Matozaki T', 'Murata Y', 'Saito Y', 'Okazawa H', 'Ohnishi H']","['Laboratory of Biosignal Sciences, Institute for Molecular and Cellular Regulation, Gunma University, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan. matozaki@showa.gunma-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090623,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,,2009/07/23 09:00,2009/10/10 06:00,['2009/07/23 09:00'],"['2009/07/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['CAS1257 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01257.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2009 Oct;100(10):1786-93. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01257.x.

Long-term follow-up of early clinical trials has shown that the majority of imatinib-associated adverse events generally occur early, and the incidence decreases over the course of therapy, making imatinib the treatment of choice for long-term administration. A lack of patient adherence to imatinib, due to the occurrence of adverse events or for other reasons, can decrease response rates, and may cause resistance or disease relapse. Patient adherence to TKI therapies is a critical consideration for successful, long-term management of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In patients who remain intolerant to imatinib, the differing tolerability profiles of second-generation TKIs should be considered when determining a therapeutic course of action.

Imatinib dose is one important factor affecting response, and early clinical studies showed promising molecular response rates with high-dose therapy. Large, randomized trials are now ongoing to test this potential benefit and establish whether a starting dose of 800 mg/d improves long-term clinical outcomes compared with the current standard dose of 400 mg/d. Low plasma imatinib levels are associated with a decreased chance of response. The importance of imatinib dosing and plasma levels is likely due to their impact on intracellular concentrations of the drug. Cellular influx of imatinib is mediated by the OCT-1 protein, and patients with low OCT-1 activity may benefit from dose-intensive therapy. For nonresponding or slowly responding patients, dose escalation to 600 to 800 mg/d may lead to durable responses in patients with primary or secondary resistance. Regular monitoring of response is crucial to maximize therapeutic success, and improved understanding of the factors affecting response will guide future clinical strategies.","['Hughes, Timothy', 'Hochhaus, Andreas']","['Hughes T', 'Hochhaus A']","['Division of Haematology, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, SA, Australia. timothy.hughes@imvs.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,,2009/07/23 09:00,2009/08/27 09:00,['2009/07/23 09:00'],"['2009/07/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/27 09:00 [medline]']","['S0037-1963(09)00019-5 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2009.01.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2009 Apr;46(2 Suppl 3):S11-5. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2009.01.008.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-1)', '0 (POU2F1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Benzamides', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-1/physiology', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent data show that annual event rates decline over time with imatinib therapy, suggesting that long-term disease control is possible in continuously responding patients. Despite these treatment successes, new strategies are continually being evaluated to maximize responses to imatinib and ensure the best treatment outcomes for all patients. For example, high-dose imatinib therapy, with doses up to 800 mg/d, has been shown to improve response rates.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the occurrence, types, and therapies of malignancies in 498 renal allograft recipients who had received operations in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from May 1986 to October 2008. RESULTS: Among 498 renal allograft recipients, 18 patients (3.6% ) were diagnosed with malignancies, which included bladder cancer (n = 5), renal pyloric cancer or ureteric cancer (n = 4), leukemia or lymphoma (n = 3), hepatic cancer (n = 2), skin cancer, rectum carcinoma, pulmonary carcinoma and thymoma (n = 1 each). Surgical operations were performed in 10 cases, 6 of whom survived with normal renal function and had no rejection of transplanted kidneys. Three patients with bladder cancer and one patient with ureteric cancer experienced recurrences 7 to 15 months after operations; among them one bladder cancer patient died. One hepatic carcinoma patient died of pulmonary metastasis 8 months after operation. One non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patient died 11 months after chemotherapy. Five cases with advanced unresectable malignancies died 8 to 17 months after the diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The incidences of malignancies, especially urological epithelial carcinoma, are high in renal allograft recipients.

It is commonly treated according to therapy strategies for lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: The AIEOP LNH-92 protocol was a modified LSA2-L2 therapy used for both T- and B-cell precursor LBL and included Induction, Consolidation, and Maintenance treatment with a total duration of 11 and 24 months for stages I and II, stages III and IV disease, respectively. RESULTS: Fifty-five eligible patients were enrolled, 40 males and 15 females, with a median age of 8 years. Complete remission was achieved in 93% of the cases. With a median follow-up of 9 years the event-free survival (EFS) was 69% and overall survival 72%. EFS of localized disease was 100%. The most frequent grades III and IV toxicity was hematologic and hepatic (elevated transaminases) toxicity. No toxic death nor second tumor were observed. Outcome was comparable to most concomitant international protocols for LBL, but inferior to recent trials that included reinduction treatment or a higher intensity therapy for high stage disease. CONCLUSIONS: AIEOP LNH92 protocol demonstrated similar efficacy compared to contemporary regimens, with limited toxicity.

PROCEDURE: Thirty-two pediatric centers across the United States and Canada were surveyed regarding current treatment practices for Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The survey addressed treatment approaches for Ph+ ALL and CML in terms of imatinib therapy and use of allogeneic-HCT. RESULTS: Twenty-three of the 32 centers returned the survey to provide a 72% response rate. Of the 27 physicians responding to the survey, 22 (81%) recommended a matched sibling donor (MSD) allogeneic-HCT, when available, in first remission for Ph+ ALL compared to 17/27 (63%) for patients with first chronic phase CML. There was universal agreement among survey responders regarding the use of imatinib upfront in Ph+ ALL and CML patients while 13 of 27 (48%) physicians reported using imatinib as maintenance therapy post-HCT for Ph+ ALL compared to 9 of 27 (33%) for CML. CONCLUSIONS: Although a treatment consensus did not exist based on the results of this small survey, current treatment practices for pediatric Ph+ ALL and CML appear to favor allogeneic-HCT when a MSD is available. The use of post-HCT imatinib as maintenance therapy to avoid relapse for either Ph+ ALL or CML remains uncertain and awaits future prospective studies.","['Burke, Michael J', 'Willert, Jennifer', 'Desai, Sunil', 'Kadota, Richard']","['Burke MJ', 'Willert J', 'Desai S', 'Kadota R']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota Children's Hospital-Fairview, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA. burke283@umn.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,2009/07/22 09:00,2009/10/14 06:00,['2009/07/22 09:00'],"['2009/07/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22172 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Dec;53(6):992-5. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22172.,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Canada', 'Data Collection/statistics & numerical data', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Physicians/statistics & numerical data', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Siblings', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our study was to evaluate the association between polymorphisms of genes encoding for proteins involved in the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of these drugs and the occurrence of side effects, in particular infections, in a small population of ALL children. PROCEDURE: Common polymorphisms of NR3C1, ABCB1, glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-M1, GST-P1, GST-T1, and IL-10 genes were analyzed in 36 pediatric patients with ALL, treated according to the AIEOP-BMF ALL 2000 study protocol. Toxicities occurring during the induction and reinduction periods were assessed and their association with genotypes was evaluated. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, the risk of severe infections was increased in subjects with the GST-M1 null genotype, while patients with the GST-M1 normal genotype had significantly more moderate degree infections. The results were confirmed by multivariate analysis. Selection from the reference models of independent variables based on Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) scores maintained the GST-M1 genotype variable in the model to predict severe infections, and the ABCB1 C3435T and GST-M1 genotype variables in the model for moderate infections.

The objective of this study, which separates it from most studies investigating these two diseases, is to determine the role of plain radiography in the initial approach toward patients presenting with musculoskeletal symptoms and to look for signs suggestive of each of the two disease entities. X-rays of patients referred to our center for musculoskeletal symptoms and ultimately diagnosed with JIA or ALL over a period of 10 years were studied retrospectively. The X-rays had been performed in the preliminary stage of the disease process and before the initiation of specific therapeutic measures. Soft tissue swelling, osteopenia, radiolucent metaphyseal bands, coarse trabeculation, and periosteal reactions were studied, and data analysis was performed by SPSS. Among a total of 174 patients, 118 had been diagnosed with JIA and 56 with ALL. The average age of JIA patients and ALL patients were 7.5 and 7.2 years, respectively. Soft tissue swelling was significantly more common among JIA patients (89.8%) than among those with ALL (1.8%) (P < 0.0001). Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to note the presence or absence of soft tissue swelling on plain radiography in the initial diagnostic approach. Osteopenia was seen in 60.2% of JIA patients compared with 14.3% of ALL patients (P < 0.0001). Radiolucent metaphyseal bands were seen among 7.1% of ALL cases but were notably absent in all cases of JIA. Coarse trabeculation was significantly higher in patients with ALL (7.1% ) than among JIA patients (0.8%). Periosteal reactions were seen in 6.8% of JIA group compared with 1.8% of ALL patients. We concluded that plain X-ray may be useful in selecting patients requiring bone marrow examination among those presenting with musculoskeletal symptoms mimicking JIA.","['Tafaghodi, Farhad', 'Aghighi, Yahya', 'Rokni Yazdi, Hadi', 'Shakiba, Madjid', 'Adibi, Ali']","['Tafaghodi F', 'Aghighi Y', 'Rokni Yazdi H', 'Shakiba M', 'Adibi A']","['Medical Imaging Center, Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. tafaghodi2001@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090721,Germany,Clin Rheumatol,Clinical rheumatology,8211469,,2009/07/22 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/22 09:00'],"['2008/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/25 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10067-009-1221-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Rheumatol. 2009 Nov;28(11):1253-8. doi: 10.1007/s10067-009-1221-0.

Our aim was to describe the IFD occurring in our H-O and HSCT patients according to the EORTC/MSG revised criteria. PATIENTS AND METHODS: IFD surveillance was performed in adult patients of the Hospital Clinico Universidad Catolica, Santiago, Chile, from January 2004 to January 2008. RESULTS: A total of 41 IFD episodes were identified in 39 patients; mean age was 46.6 +/- 9.9 years, and 87.8% and 12.2% occurred in H-O and HCTS patients respectively. 15/41(36.6%) episodes were proven, 36.6% probable and 11/41 (26.8%) possible. In 26 (63.4%) episodes aspergillosis was diagnosed (20 pulmonary, 3 sinus, 1 laryngeal and 1 case with pulmonary and cerebral involvement). In 7 patients (17.1%) candidiasis was diagnosed, 5 with a proven bloodstream infection and 2 with possible hepatosplenic candidiasis; mucormyeosis was diagnosed in 4 (9.8%) Fusarium infection was demonstrated in 2 patients (4.9%), and Mucor and Aspergillus pulmonary coinfection and Alternaria sp rhino-sinusitis in one patient each. The frequency of IFD among febrile neutropenic patients was 26.2% and 6.4% in H-O and HSCT receptors respectively. The overall mortality was 36%. CONCLUSIONS: Aspergillosis is the most common IFD infection among H-O patients and HSCT receptors in our center. Candidiasis followed although only in H-O patients most probably because of routine use of antifungal prophylaxis in HSCT recipients. Continuous surveillance is required to develop local guidelines and to evaluate antifungal strategies in different clinical scenarios.","['Rabagliati B, Ricardo', 'Fuentes L, Gino', 'Guzman D, Ana Maria', 'Orellana U, Eric', 'Oporto C, Jorge', 'Aedo C, Igor', 'Garrido S, Marcelo', 'Nervi N, Bruno']","['Rabagliati B R', 'Fuentes L G', 'Guzman D AM', 'Orellana U E', 'Oporto C J', 'Aedo C I', 'Garrido S M', 'Nervi N B']","['Departamento de Hematologia-Oncologia, Facultad de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20090625,Chile,Rev Chilena Infectol,Revista chilena de infectologia : organo oficial de la Sociedad Chilena de Infectologia,9305754,,2009/07/22 09:00,2010/02/05 06:00,['2009/07/22 09:00'],"['2009/07/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0716-10182009000400002 [pii]', '/S0716-10182009000400002 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Chilena Infectol. 2009 Jun;26(3):212-9. doi: /S0716-10182009000400002.

Here we show unique gain-of-function mutations of the C-CBL (also known as CBL) tumour suppressor that are tightly associated with aUPD of the 11q arm in myeloid neoplasms showing myeloproliferative features. The C-CBL proto-oncogene, a cellular homologue of v-Cbl, encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase and negatively regulates signal transduction of tyrosine kinases. Homozygous C-CBL mutations were found in most 11q-aUPD-positive myeloid malignancies. Although the C-CBL mutations were oncogenic in NIH3T3 cells, c-Cbl was shown to functionally and genetically act as a tumour suppressor. C-CBL mutants did not have E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, but inhibited that of wild-type C-CBL and CBL-B (also known as CBLB), leading to prolonged activation of tyrosine kinases after cytokine stimulation. c-Cbl(-/-) haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) showed enhanced sensitivity to a variety of cytokines compared to c-Cbl(+/+) HSPCs, and transduction of C-CBL mutants into c-Cbl(-/-) HSPCs further augmented their sensitivities to a broader spectrum of cytokines, including stem-cell factor (SCF, also known as KITLG), thrombopoietin (TPO, also known as THPO), IL3 and FLT3 ligand (FLT3LG), indicating the presence of a gain-of-function that could not be attributed to a simple loss-of-function. The gain-of-function effects of C-CBL mutants on cytokine sensitivity of HSPCs largely disappeared in a c-Cbl(+/+) background or by co-transduction of wild-type C-CBL, which suggests the pathogenic importance of loss of wild-type C-CBL alleles found in most cases of C-CBL-mutated myeloid neoplasms. Our findings provide a new insight into a role of gain-of-function mutations of a tumour suppressor associated with aUPD in the pathogenesis of some myeloid cancer subsets.","['Sanada, Masashi', 'Suzuki, Takahiro', 'Shih, Lee-Yung', 'Otsu, Makoto', 'Kato, Motohiro', 'Yamazaki, Satoshi', 'Tamura, Azusa', 'Honda, Hiroaki', 'Sakata-Yanagimoto, Mamiko', 'Kumano, Keiki', 'Oda, Hideaki', 'Yamagata, Tetsuya', 'Takita, Junko', 'Gotoh, Noriko', 'Nakazaki, Kumi', 'Kawamata, Norihiko', 'Onodera, Masafumi', 'Nobuyoshi, Masaharu', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide', 'Harada, Hiroshi', 'Kurokawa, Mineo', 'Chiba, Shigeru', 'Mori, Hiraku', 'Ozawa, Keiya', 'Omine, Mitsuhiro', 'Hirai, Hisamaru', 'Nakauchi, Hiromitsu', 'Koeffler, H Phillip', 'Ogawa, Seishi']","['Sanada M', 'Suzuki T', 'Shih LY', 'Otsu M', 'Kato M', 'Yamazaki S', 'Tamura A', 'Honda H', 'Sakata-Yanagimoto M', 'Kumano K', 'Oda H', 'Yamagata T', 'Takita J', 'Gotoh N', 'Nakazaki K', 'Kawamata N', 'Onodera M', 'Nobuyoshi M', 'Hayashi Y', 'Harada H', 'Kurokawa M', 'Chiba S', 'Mori H', 'Ozawa K', 'Omine M', 'Hirai H', 'Nakauchi H', 'Koeffler HP', 'Ogawa S']","['Cancer Genomics Project, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090720,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,,2009/07/22 09:00,2009/09/15 06:00,['2009/07/22 09:00'],"['2008/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['nature08240 [pii]', '10.1038/nature08240 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2009 Aug 13;460(7257):904-8. doi: 10.1038/nature08240.

We conducted to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of GO in our patients with relapsed or refractory AML retrospectively. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were collected between March 1, 2000, and March 1, 2006, on 10 patients with relapsed or refractory AML(excluding FAB: M3). Scheduled treatment was two doses of GO monotherapy, 14-28 days apart. RESULTS: Of the 10 assessable patients, two patients achieved CR. CR duration of one patient lasted for 52 months with post-remission treatment. Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 9 patients, and the incidence of grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was 100%, with no severe bleeding events. Two patients developed infusion-related adverse events that included grade 3 allergic reaction with shock status. Liver damage (grade 3 or 4) were observed in 40% of patients after GO treatment.

Although Fc-FcgammaR interactions are thought to account for much of their therapeutic effect, this does not explain why certain mAb specificities are more potent than others. An additional effector mechanism underlying the action of some mAbs is the direct induction of cell death. Previously, we demonstrated that certain CD20-specific mAbs (which we termed type II mAbs) evoke a nonapoptotic mode of cell death that appears to be linked with the induction of homotypic adhesion. Here, we reveal that peripheral relocalization of actin is critical for the adhesion and cell death induced by both the type II CD20-specific mAb tositumomab and an HLA-DR-specific mAb in both human lymphoma cell lines and primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. The cell death elicited was rapid, nonapoptotic, nonautophagic, and dependent on the integrity of plasma membrane cholesterol and activation of the V-type ATPase. This cytoplasmic cell death involved lysosomes, which swelled and then dispersed their contents, including cathepsin B, into the cytoplasm and surrounding environment. The resulting loss of plasma membrane integrity occurred independently of caspases and was not controlled by Bcl-2. These experiments provide what we believe to be new insights into the mechanisms by which 2 clinically relevant mAbs elicit cell death and show that this homotypic adhesion-related cell death occurs through a lysosome-dependent pathway.","['Ivanov, Andrei', 'Beers, Stephen A', 'Walshe, Claire A', 'Honeychurch, Jamie', 'Alduaij, Waleed', 'Cox, Kerry L', 'Potter, Kathleen N', 'Murray, Stephen', 'Chan, Claude H T', 'Klymenko, Tetyana', 'Erenpreisa, Jekaterina', 'Glennie, Martin J', 'Illidge, Tim M', 'Cragg, Mark S']","['Ivanov A', 'Beers SA', 'Walshe CA', 'Honeychurch J', 'Alduaij W', 'Cox KL', 'Potter KN', 'Murray S', 'Chan CH', 'Klymenko T', 'Erenpreisa J', 'Glennie MJ', 'Illidge TM', 'Cragg MS']","['CRUK Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, School of Cancer and Imaging Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090720,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,PMC2719942,2009/07/22 09:00,2009/08/28 09:00,['2009/07/22 09:00'],"['2008/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [medline]']","['37884 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI37884 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2009 Aug;119(8):2143-59. doi: 10.1172/JCI37884.

The Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) subtype of ALL accounts for 25-30% of cases of adult ALL, has the most unfavorable clinical outcome among all ALL subtypes and is defined by the oncogenic BCR-ABL1 kinase and deletions of the IKAROS gene in >80% of cases. Here, we demonstrate that the pre-B cell receptor functions as a tumor suppressor upstream of IKAROS through induction of cell cycle arrest in Ph(+) ALL cells. Pre-B cell receptor-mediated cell cycle arrest in Ph(+) ALL cells critically depends on IKAROS function, and is reversed by coexpression of the dominant-negative IKAROS splice variant IK6. IKAROS also promotes tumor suppression through cooperation with downstream molecules of the pre-B cell receptor signaling pathway, even if expression of the pre-B cell receptor itself is compromised. In this case, IKAROS redirects oncogenic BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase signaling from SRC kinase-activation to SLP65, which functions as a critical tumor suppressor downstream of the pre-B cell receptor. These findings provide a rationale for the surprisingly high frequency of IKAROS deletions in Ph(+) ALL and identify IKAROS-mediated cell cycle exit as the endpoint of an emerging pathway of pre-B cell receptor-mediated tumor suppression.","['Trageser, Daniel', 'Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Nahar, Rahul', 'Duy, Cihangir', 'von Levetzow, Gregor', 'Klemm, Lars', 'Park, Eugene', 'Schuh, Wolfgang', 'Gruber, Tanja', 'Herzog, Sebastian', 'Kim, Yong-mi', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Li, Aihong', 'Storlazzi, Clelia Tiziana', 'Jack, Hans-Martin', 'Groffen, John', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Heisterkamp, Nora', 'Jumaa, Hassan', 'Muschen, Markus']","['Trageser D', 'Iacobucci I', 'Nahar R', 'Duy C', 'von Levetzow G', 'Klemm L', 'Park E', 'Schuh W', 'Gruber T', 'Herzog S', 'Kim YM', 'Hofmann WK', 'Li A', 'Storlazzi CT', 'Jack HM', 'Groffen J', 'Martinelli G', 'Heisterkamp N', 'Jumaa H', 'Muschen M']","['Leukemia and Lymphoma Program, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090720,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,PMC2722172,2009/07/22 09:00,2009/08/15 09:00,['2009/07/22 09:00'],"['2009/07/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/15 09:00 [medline]']","['jem.20090004 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20090004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2009 Aug 3;206(8):1739-53. doi: 10.1084/jem.20090004.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred forty children with de novo AML were treated with continuous cytarabine-based induction therapy and stratified to three risk groups based on the initial treatment response, age, and WBC at diagnosis and cytogenetics. All of the patients were treated with intensive consolidation chemotherapy including three or four courses of high-dose cytarabine. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) was indicated for only the intermediate-risk patients with matched related donors and for all the high-risk subsets. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-seven children (94.6%) achieved a complete remission (CR). Four children demonstrated induction death. The median follow-up of the live patients was 55 months (range, 37 to 73 months). The 5-year overall survival of all 240 children was 75.6% (95% CI, 70.3% to 81.4%) and event-free survival was 61.6% (95% CI, 55.8% to 68.1%). The 5-year disease-free survival in each risk group were 71.3% (95% CI, 63.4% to 80.2%) in the low-risk group (n = 112), 59.8% (95% CI, 50.6% to 70.7%) in the intermediate-risk group (n = 92), and 56.5% (95% CI, 39.5% to 80.9%) in the high-risk group (n = 23). Eight children died during the first CR, including four after HSCT. CONCLUSION: A high survival rate, 75.6% at 5 years, was achieved for childhood with de novo AML in the AML99 trial. The treatment strategy was well tolerated with only 1.7% induction death rate and 3.5% remission death rate.

The natural history of clinically identified MBL is unclear. The goal of this study was to explore the outcome of patients with MBL relative to that of individuals with Rai stage 0 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used hematopathology records to identify a cohort of 631 patients with newly diagnosed MBL or Rai stage 0 CLL. Within this cohort, 302 patients had MBL (B-cell counts of 0.02 to 4.99 x 10(9)/L); 94 patients had Rai stage 0 CLL with an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) < or = 10 x 10(9)/L; and 219 patients had Rai stage 0 CLL with an ALC more than 10 x 10(9)/L. Data on clinical outcome were abstracted from medical records. RESULTS: The percentage of MBL patients free of treatment at 1, 2, and 5 years was 99%, 98%, and 93%, respectively. B-cell count as a continuous variable (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.9, P = .04) and CD38 status (HR = 10.8, P = .006) predicted time to treatment (TTT) among MBL patients. The likelihood of treatment for MBL patients was lower (HR = 0.32, P = .04) than that of both Rai stage 0 CLL patients with an ALC less than 10 x 10(9)/L (n = 94) and Rai stage 0 CLL patients with an ALC more than 10 x 10(9)/L (n = 219; P = .0003). CONCLUSION: Individuals with MBL identified in clinical practice have a low risk for progression at 5 years. Because B-cell count seems to relate to TTT as a continuous variable, additional studies are needed to determine what B-cell count should be used to distinguish between MBL and CLL.","['Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Rabe, Kari G', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Zent, Clive S', 'Maddocks, Kami', 'Jenkins, Greg', 'Jelinek, Diane F', 'Morice, William G', 'Boysen, Justin', 'Schwager, Susan', 'Bowen, Deborah', 'Slager, Susan L', 'Hanson, Curtis A']","['Shanafelt TD', 'Kay NE', 'Rabe KG', 'Call TG', 'Zent CS', 'Maddocks K', 'Jenkins G', 'Jelinek DF', 'Morice WG', 'Boysen J', 'Schwager S', 'Bowen D', 'Slager SL', 'Hanson CA']","['Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. shanafelt.tait@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090720,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,PMC2734397,2009/07/22 09:00,2009/09/04 06:00,['2009/07/22 09:00'],"['2009/07/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.21.2704 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.21.2704 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Aug 20;27(24):3959-63. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.21.2704.

Dysregulation of GATA-2 is a hallmark of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia in children with Down syndrome, a malignancy that is defined by the combination of trisomy 21 and a GATA1 mutation. Here, we show that GATA-2 is required for normal megakaryocyte development as well as aberrant megakaryopoiesis in Gata1 mutant cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GATA-2 indirectly controls cell cycle progression in GATA-1-deficient megakaryocytes. Genome-wide microarray analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed that GATA-2 regulates a wide set of genes, including cell cycle regulators and megakaryocyte-specific genes. Surprisingly, GATA-2 also negatively regulates the expression of crucial myeloid transcription factors, such as Sfpi1 and Cebpa. In the absence of GATA-1, GATA-2 prevents induction of a latent myeloid gene expression program. Thus, GATA-2 contributes to cell cycle progression and the maintenance of megakaryocyte identity of GATA-1-deficient cells, including GATA-1s-expressing fetal megakaryocyte progenitors.

Since HOXA9 and MEIS1 play key developmental roles, are cooperating DNA binding proteins and leukemic oncoproteins, and are important for normal hematopoiesis, the regulation of Meis1 by its partner protein is of interest. Loss of Hoxa9 caused downregulation of the Meis1 mRNA and protein, while forced HOXA9 expression upregulated Meis1. Hoxa9 and Meis1 expression was correlated in hematopoietic progenitors and acute leukemias. Meis1(+/-) Hoxa9(-/-) deficient mice, generated to test HOXA9 regulation of endogenous Meis1, were small and had reduced bone marrow Meis1 mRNA and significant defects in fluorescence-activated cell sorting-enumerated monocytes, mature and pre/pro-B cells, and functional B-cell progenitors. These data indicate that HOXA9 modulates Meis1 during normal murine hematopoiesis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis did not reveal direct binding of HOXA9 to Meis1 promoter/enhancer regions. However, Creb1 and Pknox1, whose protein products have previously been reported to induce Meis1, were shown to be direct targets of HOXA9. Loss of Hoxa9 resulted in a decrease in Creb1 and Pknox1 mRNA, and forced expression of CREB1 in Hoxa9(-/-) bone marrow cells increased Meis1 mRNA almost as well as HOXA9, suggesting that CREB1 may mediate HOXA9 modulation of Meis1 expression.","['Hu, Yu-Long', 'Fong, Steve', 'Ferrell, Christina', 'Largman, Corey', 'Shen, Wei-Fang']","['Hu YL', 'Fong S', 'Ferrell C', 'Largman C', 'Shen WF']","['Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090720,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,PMC2738281,2009/07/22 09:00,2009/09/16 06:00,['2009/07/22 09:00'],"['2009/07/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00545-09 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00545-09 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2009 Sep;29(18):5181-92. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00545-09.

Unexpectedly, however, we found that Tsc1/2-deficient cells exhibit increased resistance to serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. mTORC1 hyperactivity contributes to the apoptotic resistance of serum-deprived Tsc1/2-deficient cells in part by increasing the growth factor-independent expression of hexokinase II (HKII) and GLUT1. mTORC1-mediated increase in hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) abundance, which occurs in the absence of serum in normoxic Tsc2-deficient cells, contributes to these changes. Increased HIF1alpha abundance in these cells is attributed to both an increased level and the sustained translation of HIF1alpha mRNA. Sustained glycogen synthase kinase 3beta inhibition and Mcl-1 expression also contribute to the apoptotic resistance of Tsc2-deficient cells to serum deprivation. The inhibition of mTORC1 activity by either rapamycin or Raptor knockdown cannot resensitize these cells to serum deprivation-induced apoptosis because of elevated Akt activity that is an indirect consequence of mTORC1 inhibition. However, the increased HIF1alpha abundance and the maintenance of Mcl-1 protein expression in serum-deprived Tsc2(-/)(-) cells are dependent largely on the hyperactive eIF4E in these cells. Consistently, the reduction of eIF4E levels abrogates the resistance of Tsc2(-/)(-) cells to serum deprivation-induced apoptosis.","['Bhaskar, Prashanth T', 'Nogueira, Veronique', 'Patra, Krushna C', 'Jeon, Sang-Min', 'Park, Youngkyu', 'Robey, R Brooks', 'Hay, Nissim']","['Bhaskar PT', 'Nogueira V', 'Patra KC', 'Jeon SM', 'Park Y', 'Robey RB', 'Hay N']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60607, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090720,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,PMC2738274,2009/07/22 09:00,2009/09/16 06:00,['2009/07/22 09:00'],"['2009/07/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.01946-08 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.01946-08 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2009 Sep;29(18):5136-47. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01946-08.

Downregulation of this pathway is required at the onset of differentiation. However, it remained unclear how this is achieved mechanistically. We now show that SOCS1, SOCS3, and PIAS1 promote myogenic differentiation by specifically inhibiting the LIF-induced JAK1/STAT1/STAT3 pathway via distinct targets; whereas SOCS1 and SOCS3 selectively bind and inhibit JAK1 and gp130, respectively, PIAS1 targets mainly the activated STAT1 and prevents its binding to DNA. We further demonstrated that the SUMO E3-ligase activity of PIAS1 is dispensable for its role in myogenic differentiation. Collectively, our current study revealed a molecular mechanism that explains how the LIF-induced JAK1/STAT1/STAT3 pathway is downregulated upon myogenic differentiation.","['Diao, Yarui', 'Wang, Xi', 'Wu, Zhenguo']","['Diao Y', 'Wang X', 'Wu Z']","['Department of Biochemistry, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clearwater Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090720,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,PMC2738280,2009/07/22 09:00,2009/09/16 06:00,['2009/07/22 09:00'],"['2009/07/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00267-09 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00267-09 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2009 Sep;29(18):5084-93. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00267-09.

METHODS: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was performed in 25 children with beta-thalassemia major and 11 with acute leukemia group. The percentages of T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells in peripheral blood of these patients were detected with dual color immunofluorescence on day -10 (before conditioning) and day -5 (after conditioning), and the relationship between the cellular immune function and graft rejection was analyzed. RESULTS: All the patients with acute leukemia showed engraftment. The rate of graft rejection was 34.8% in the patients with beta-thalassemia major. Compared with the leukemic patients, the patients with beta-thalassemia showed significantly increased percentage of CD3(+)CD8(+) T lymphocytes before and after the conditioning (P<0.05). The percentage of CD3(-)CD56(+) NK cells increased significantly in patients with beta-thalassemia major after the conditioning (P<0.05), but decreased markedly after conditioning in the leukemic patients (P<0.05). In patients with beta-thalassemia major and graft rejection, the CD3(-)CD56(+) cell phenotype was predominant after conditioning but remained unchanged in those with engraftment. CONCLUSION: CD3(-)CD56(+) NK cells are probably associated with graft rejection in patients with beta-thalassemia major, and may serve as an index for predicting graft rejection following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Hao, Wen-Ge', 'Huang, Shao-Liang', 'Sun, Xin', 'Liu, Sha']","['Hao WG', 'Huang SL', 'Sun X', 'Liu S']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou 510120, China. haowg1016@163.com""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,China,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,101266132,,2009/07/22 09:00,2013/03/21 06:00,['2009/07/22 09:00'],"['2009/07/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2009 Jul;29(7):1375-7.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Infant', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'beta-Thalassemia/*immunology/surgery']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rosmarinic acid (RA), a naturally occurring polyphenol flavonoid, has been reported to inhibit TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation in human dermal fibroblasts. However, the precise mechanisms of RA have not been well elucidated in TNF-alpha-mediated anti-cancer therapy. In this study, we found that RA treatment significantly sensitizes TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in human leukemia U937 cells through the suppression of nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Activation of caspases in response to TNF-alpha was markedly increased by RA treatment. However, pretreatment with the caspase-3 inhibitor, z-DEVD-fmk, was capable of significantly restoring cell viability in response to combined treatment. RA also suppressed NF-kappaB activation through inhibition of phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha, and nuclear translocation of p50 and p65. This inhibition was correlated with suppression of NF-kappaB-dependent anti-apoptotic proteins (IAP-1, IAP-2, and XIAP). RA treatment also normalized TNF-alpha-induced ROS generation. Additionally, ectopic Bcl-2 expressing U937 reversed combined treatment-induced cell death, cytochrome c release into cytosol, and collapse of mitochondrial potential. These results demonstrated that RA inhibits TNF-alpha-induced ROS generation and NF-kappaB activation, and enhances TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis.","['Moon, Dong-Oh', 'Kim, Mun-Ock', 'Lee, Jae-Dong', 'Choi, Yung Hyun', 'Kim, Gi-Young']","['Moon DO', 'Kim MO', 'Lee JD', 'Choi YH', 'Kim GY']","['Department of Marine Life Sciences, Jeju National University, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090719,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,,2009/07/22 09:00,2010/02/26 06:00,['2009/07/22 09:00'],"['2008/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(09)00461-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2009.06.033 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2010 Feb 28;288(2):183-91. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2009.06.033.

Reliable quantification of gene expression in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues (FFPE), however, has been subjected to serious limitations so far, mainly due to the fragmentation of RNA transcripts. We tried to improve the sensitivity and reliability of mRNA quantification in FFPE by boosting the reverse transcription (RT) step, that is neglected in most of the protocol analysis, but that represents the first confounding event in a quantitative analysis. For this purpose, we compared yield, reproducibility and linearity of RTs performed with random hexamers, random pentadecamers, or a mixture of antisense specific primers in presence of either Moloney murine leukemia virus (MmLV) or the avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) enzymes. Random primers were tested at two concentrations, 0.14 and 3.35 nmol/reaction. Our qRT-PCR results indicate an improvement of RT yield when using the highest concentration of random oligos with MmLV (from -1.4 to -4.1 C(t)s) in comparison to the lowest concentration. Moreover, more reliable standard curves and therefore, efficiencies were obtained. RT reactions performed with specific primers and AMV were those with the highest yield, but efficiencies were unreliable, due to the RT enzyme-driven PCR inhibition. Random priming at the 3.35 nmol/reaction concentration seems to be the most convenient strategy in assays using RNA obtained from FFPE tissues.","['Nardon, Ermanno', 'Donada, Marisa', 'Bonin, Serena', 'Dotti, Isabella', 'Stanta, Giorgio']","['Nardon E', 'Donada M', 'Bonin S', 'Dotti I', 'Stanta G']","['Department of Clinical, Morphological and Technological Sciences, University of Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090718,Netherlands,Exp Mol Pathol,Experimental and molecular pathology,0370711,,2009/07/22 09:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/07/22 09:00'],"['2008/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4800(09)00091-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexmp.2009.07.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Pathol. 2009 Oct;87(2):146-51. doi: 10.1016/j.yexmp.2009.07.005.

Despite these advances, CLL remains incurable with standard therapies. Thus, there remains a need for more effective therapies in both the upfront and relapsed setting, particularly for patients with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities such as del(11q22) and del(17p13). The 2008 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting featured several presentations which highlighted the ongoing clinical advances in CLL. The benefit of adding rituximab to purine analog therapy in the upfront setting was demonstrated by a large randomized study which showed that the addition of rituximab to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FCR) significantly improved OR, CR and PFS. The improvement in PFS directly resulted from an improved ability to eliminate minimal residual disease (MRD) in the peripheral blood, highlighting the importance of MRD eradication. However, a multi-center study suggested that the high CR rates to chemoimmunotherapy regimens such as FCR obtained in academic centers may not be reproducible when the same regimens are given in the community setting. The immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide is active in relapsed high-risk CLL, but two studies of lenalidomide in previously untreated CLL patients failed to achieve a CR and were associated with significant tumor lysis, tumor flare and hematologic toxicity. In the relapsed setting, a combination study of the bifunctional alkylator bendamustine and rituximab (BR) demonstrated a high OR rate in patients with del(11q22) and del(17p13), indicating that further studies to define's bendamustine activity are warranted in high-risk CLL. Similarly, the CDK inhibitor flavopiridol demonstrated significant clinical activity and durable remissions in heavily treated, refractory CLL patients with high-risk cytogenetic features and bulky lymphadenopathy. The monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab appeared to be superior to rituximab in relapsed CLL patients with bulky nodal disease or high-risk cytogenetic features. Ongoing studies of these agents and other novel therapeutic agents in clinical development hold forth the promise that treatment options for CLL patients will continue to expand and improve.","['Maddocks, Kami J', 'Lin, Thomas S']","['Maddocks KJ', 'Lin TS']","['The Ohio State University, Division of Hematology-Oncology, 320 West 10th Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA. kami.maddocks-christianson@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20090720,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,PMC2723130,2009/07/22 09:00,2010/06/16 06:00,['2009/07/22 09:00'],"['2009/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-2-29 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-2-29 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2009 Jul 20;2:29. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-2-29.,"['FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy/trends', 'Congresses as Topic', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Medical Oncology/methods/trends', 'Patient Selection', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",,,,,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TMZ administered at a dose of 150-200 mg/m2 for 5 days every 4 weeks is the standard of care in operated glioblastoma (GBM) after concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Alternative dosing regimens, such as 1-week on/1-week off, or 3-week on/1-week off, that deliver more prolonged exposure have been observed to result in higher cumulative doses than the standard 5-day regimen and may deplete tumor-derived O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) in tumor cells, thus sensitizing tumor cells to the effects of TMZ. Currently, chemotherapy with TMZ is an interesting alternative to radiotherapy in patients with very large tumors or in the elderly who are exposed to a higher risk of delayed neurotoxicity. The DNA damage induced by nitrosoureas and TMZ is partially repaired by MGMT. Thus, administration of the combination of nitrosoureas and TMZ might overcome MGMT-mediated resistance via MGMT depletion, yielding superior treatment results compared to the administration of treatment alone. However, the results of 2 studies that administered BCNU and CCNU with TMZ reported contradictory results. The introduction of TMZ has enabled the extension of chemotherapy treatment by 1-3 years due to the improved toxicity profile and lack of cumulative toxicity. Treatment-induced myelodysplastic syndrome with or without acute myeloblastic leukemia is a well-recognized late treatment-related complication associated with TMZ administration.","['Nishikawa, Ryo']",['Nishikawa R'],"['Department of Neuro-Oncology/Neurosurgery International Medical Center, Saitama Medical University, 1397-1 Yamane, Hidaka-shi, Saitama 350-1298, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Brain Nerve,Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo,101299709,,2009/07/22 09:00,2009/11/03 06:00,['2009/07/22 09:00'],"['2009/07/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Brain Nerve. 2009 Jul;61(7):849-54.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '7BRF0Z81KG (Lomustine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/enzymology/*therapy', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage', 'DNA Damage', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives', 'Glioblastoma/enzymology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced', 'Lomustine/administration & dosage', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase/metabolism/physiology', 'Temozolomide']",,,,,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expanding on previous findings from phase 1 of the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study (NCCLS), a population-based case-control study, we sought to further elucidate and replicate the relationships between maternal diet and ALL risk. METHODS: We matched 282 case-control sets of children (205 pairs and 77 triplets) from phases 1 and 2 of the NCCLS on sex, date of birth, mother's race, Hispanic racial/ethnic status, and county of residence at birth. We used an interviewer-administered food frequency questionnaire to obtain information on maternal dietary intake in the 12 months prior to pregnancy. RESULTS: Risk of ALL was inversely associated with maternal consumption of vegetable (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50, 0.84); protein sources (AOR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.32, 0.96); fruit (AOR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.65, 1.00); and legume food groups (AOR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.59, 0.95). The risk reduction was strongest for consumption of the protein sources and vegetable food groups, independent of the child's diet up to age 2 years, and consistent across phases 1 and 2 of data collection for vegetable consumption. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that it may be prudent for women to consume a diet rich in vegetables and adequate in protein prior to and during pregnancy as a possible means of reducing childhood ALL risk in their offspring.","['Kwan, Marilyn L', 'Jensen, Christopher D', 'Block, Gladys', 'Hudes, Mark L', 'Chu, Lisa W', 'Buffler, Patricia A']","['Kwan ML', 'Jensen CD', 'Block G', 'Hudes ML', 'Chu LW', 'Buffler PA']","['Kaiser Permanente, Division of Research, Oakland, CA 94612, USA.

Examples of these disorders are touched upon in this review as an absence of abnormal findings at postmortem examination is characteristic and the importance of considering the diagnosis lies in the heritable nature of these conditions. Typically, a diagnosis of a possible channelopathy is evoked as an explanation for a 'negative autopsy' in a case of apparent sudden natural death. However, the one potential adverse effect of this approach is that subtle causes of sudden death may be overlooked. The intention of this article is to review and discuss potential causes of sudden adult death (mostly natural) that should be considered before resorting to a diagnosis of possible channelopathy. Nonetheless, it becomes apparent that many of the potential causes of sudden death can have a genetic basis. Thus, it becomes an important consideration that there may be a genetic basis to sudden death that extends beyond the negative autopsy.","['Langlois, Neil E I']",['Langlois NE'],"['University of Adelaide and Forensic Science SA, 21 Divett Place, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.

MUS81 is a DNA structure-specific recombination endonuclease and functions on aberrant DNA replication and recombination. Recently, we demonstrate that MUS81 plays a key role in the maintenance of telomeres in ALT cells (Zeng, et al. Nature Cell Biology, 2009). The MUS81 endonuclease specifically localizes to ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (APBs) and interacts with telomeres in ALT cells. Depletion of MUS81 leads to reduced telomere recombination resulting in the growth arrest of ALT cells. The endonuclease activity of MUS81, regulated by its binding partner TRF2, is found to be essential for telomere post-replicative recombination. This study provides the first direct evidence that MUS81 specifically functions on ALT recombination-based cell survival. The specific function of MUS81 on the ALT pathway provides a potential powerful diagnostic marker and a therapeutic target for ALT tumors.","['Zeng, Sicong', 'Yang, Qin']","['Zeng S', 'Yang Q']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63108, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,,2009/07/21 09:00,2009/10/21 06:00,['2009/07/21 09:00'],"['2009/07/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['9149 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.8.14.9149 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2009 Jul 15;8(14):2157-60. doi: 10.4161/cc.8.14.9149.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (TERF2 protein, human)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (MUS81 protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Endonucleases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombination, Genetic/physiology', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'Telomere/metabolism', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used one such serum in conjunction with retroviral expression cloning to identify the highly polymorphic surface molecule immunoglobulin-like transcript 5 (ILT5) as one of the targets of dendritic cell-reactive antibodies. ILT5 reactive antibodies were found in 5.4% of HSCT patients but not in solid organ transplantation recipients, patients with collagen diseases, multiparous women, or polytransfused or healthy persons. We show that ILT5-specific antibodies can mediate killing of ILT5-bearing cells and furthermore demonstrate ILT5 expression in some leukemic cells, indicating that it might be a target for GVL effects.

Tax1-mediated growth promotion is thought to result from, at least in part, up-regulation of genes for growth factors and their receptors that induce T-cell growth. In the present study, we demonstrate that Tax1 transactivates the interleukin-21 (IL-21) and its receptor (IL-21R) genes in human T-cells. Introduction of Tax1 via recombinant adenoviruses induced expression of endogenous IL-21 and IL-21R. Isolated promoters of the IL-21 and IL-21R genes were activated by Tax1 in reporter assays, which further revealed that there were at least two Tax1-responsive elements in either the IL-21 promoter or the IL-21R promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and gel mobility shift assay exhibited that the IL-21 promoter elements bound transcription factors AP-1 and NF-kappaB, and the IL-21R promoter elements were associated with AP-1 and interferon regulatory factor. Collectively, Tax1-dependent activation of these transcriptional factors presumably contributes to expression of the IL-21 gene and its receptor gene. The related virus HTLV-2 with Tax2 similar to Tax1 is known not to be pathogenic. Tax2 exhibited little, if any, or no induction of the IL-21 transcription in CD4+ T-cells, in contrast to Tax1. The study suggests insights into cytokine-dependent aberrant growth of HTLV-1-infected T-cells and the molecular basis of different pathogenicity between HTLV-1 and HTLV-2.","['Mizuguchi, Mariko', 'Asao, Hironobu', 'Hara, Toshifumi', 'Higuchi, Masaya', 'Fujii, Masahiro', 'Nakamura, Masataka']","['Mizuguchi M', 'Asao H', 'Hara T', 'Higuchi M', 'Fujii M', 'Nakamura M']","['Human Gene Sciences Center, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090717,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC2757951,2009/07/21 09:00,2009/10/20 06:00,['2009/07/21 09:00'],"['2009/07/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(18)81024-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.010959 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Sep 18;284(38):25501-11. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.010959.

A robust and automated RNA-extraction method with a high sample throughput is required. METHODS: We evaluated extraction performance for 4 silica-based RNA-extraction protocols: (a) a fully automated, bead-based RNA-isolation procedure; (b) its manual counterpart; (c) a semiautomated bead-based extraction system; and (d) a manual column-based extraction kit. RNA from 360 sections (90 sections per extraction method) of 30 FFPE tumor blocks up to 20 years of age was purified and analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR for ESR1 (estrogen receptor 1), PGR (progesterone receptor), ERBB2 [v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2, neuro/glioblastoma derived oncogene homolog (avian)], and RPL37A (ribosomal protein L37a). RESULTS: The semiautomated protocol gave the best yield. The 3 bead-based methods showed good across-method correlations in both yield and relative mRNA amounts (r = 0.86-0.95 and 0.98, respectively). In contrast, correlations between any of the bead-based methods and the manual column-based method were worse (r = 0.77-0.95 and 0.96, respectively). The fully automated method showed the lowest variation from section to section (root mean square error, 0.32-0.35 Cq, where Cq is the quantification cycle) and required the least hands-on time (1 h). CONCLUSIONS: The fully automated RNA-purification method showed the best reproducibility in gene expression analyses of neighboring sections of tissue blocks between 3 and 20 years of age and required the least overall and hands-on times. This method appears well suited for high-throughput RNA analyses in both routine clinical testing and translational research studies with archived FFPE material.","['Bohmann, Kerstin', 'Hennig, Guido', 'Rogel, Uwe', 'Poremba, Christopher', 'Mueller, Berit Maria', 'Fritz, Peter', 'Stoerkel, Stephan', 'Schaefer, Karl-L']","['Bohmann K', 'Hennig G', 'Rogel U', 'Poremba C', 'Mueller BM', 'Fritz P', 'Stoerkel S', 'Schaefer KL']","['Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products, Molecular Research Germany, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20090717,England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,,2009/07/21 09:00,2009/09/17 06:00,['2009/07/21 09:00'],"['2009/07/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['clinchem.2008.122572 [pii]', '10.1373/clinchem.2008.122572 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2009 Sep;55(9):1719-27. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2008.122572.

As metHb cannot carry oxygen, clinical sequelae result when the concentration of metHb is high enough to compromise oxygen delivery to the tissues.

Nevertheless, the good progress in the management of paediatric diseases that were a big concerns in former times authorize to think that in future, these countries will be engaged in programs to fit malignant diseases as major health problems in children. A good knowledge of epidemiologic aspects of these diseases must be therefore an important concern. This study describes epidemiologic and prognosis particularities of malignant hemopathies in children diagnosed in a last referral hospital ward, Bamako, Mali (West Africa) during height years. Fifty-nine cases of malignant hemopathies were diagnosed by January 1996 to December 2003 in 19 females and 40 males. Data were analysed retrospectively with SPSS 11.0. These children were aged from 4 to 15 years and the modal class of age was 6-10 years. The mean recruitment of cases per year was 7.37. Lymphomas were more frequent (70%) particularly the Burkitt lymphoma. The Hodgkin's lymphoma was not observed under 5 years of age but represents 24% of cases over this age and was more frequent in male. This study emphasizes the need to put in place strategies for a better understanding of epidemiological aspects of malignant hemopathies in children and for developing policies to improve management and prevention of cases in Mali.","['Diallo, Dapa Aly', 'Baby, Mounirou', 'Dembele, Abdoul Karim', 'Diallo, Yacouba Lazare', ""Cissoko, Lala N'Drainy Sidibe"", 'Dicko, Mariam Soumare', 'Dembele, Mamadou', 'Cissoko, Yacouba']","['Diallo DA', 'Baby M', 'Dembele AK', 'Diallo YL', 'Cissoko LN', 'Dicko MS', 'Dembele M', 'Cissoko Y']","[""Service d'Hematologie Oncologie Medicale, Hopital du Point G, Bamako, BP: 333.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Mali,Mali Med,Le Mali medical,18420390R,,2008/01/01 00:00,2011/08/13 06:00,['2009/07/21 09:00'],"['2009/07/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [medline]']",['jMAM.v23.i4.pg63 [pii]'],ppublish,Mali Med. 2008;23(4):63-8.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Developing Countries', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Hematology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology', 'Hospital Departments/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitals, University/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mali/epidemiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology', 'Oncology Service, Hospital/*statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Les hemopathies malignes de l'enfant: aspects epidemiologiques dans Le Service D'Hematologie Oncologie Medicale de L'Hopital Du Point G, Bamako, Mali (1996-2003).",,,,

During the study, 264 cases were diagnosed for hematological malignancies corresponding to an annual mean of 33 cases. Hematological malignancies were mostly lymphoid types (76.51%), among which NHL were predominant. For non lymphoid malignancies, CML was the most frequent (70.96 %). The prevalence of hematological malignancies was multiplied by 2.18 for lymphomas, 2.16 for leukemia, and 1.87 for multiple myeloma; whereas it was stable for other cases. The sex ratio was in favor of men with regard to all hematological malignancies except for CML that is more frequent un female (p=0,002). The case frequency repartition according to age showed a bimodal distribution with one peak for the 10-19 years old and another peak for the 40-49 years old. Among 44 patients tested for HIV, 11.4 % were positive. We couldn't establish a relationship with other classic risk factors. There were some particularities in the distribution of cases with regard to patient's provenances and the time spent before the hospital visits. The hospital-based mortality rate was 10.4 per 1000 and, lethality was high, probably because of case management difficulties and particular popular representation of the disease. More prospective studies with emphasis on risk factors in relation with hematological malignancies in Mali will help to better understand these observed epidemiologic particularities and to elaborate prevention and treatment strategies.","['Diallo, D A', 'Cissoko, Ls', 'Cissoko, Y', 'Diallo, Y', 'Baby, M', 'Mouhaha, J', 'Diop, Ct', 'Dembele, M', 'Sidibe, At', 'Ndjinga Ndjinga, V', 'Salissou, Gm', 'Dicko, Ms', 'Traore, Ha']","['Diallo DA', 'Cissoko L', 'Cissoko Y', 'Diallo Y', 'Baby M', 'Mouhaha J', 'Diop C', 'Dembele M', 'Sidibe A', 'Ndjinga Ndjinga V', 'Salissou G', 'Dicko M', 'Traore H']",,"['eng', 'fre']",['Journal Article'],,Mali,Mali Med,Le Mali medical,18420390R,,2005/01/01 00:00,2005/01/01 00:01,['2009/07/21 09:00'],"['2009/07/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2005/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['jMAM.v20.i4.pg1 [pii]'],ppublish,Mali Med. 2005;20(4):1-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High doses of MTX may cause acute renal dysfunction. Nephrotoxicity is prevented by the use of alkalinization and hydration. More recently Carboxypeptidase-G2, a recombinant bacterial enzyme that rapidly hydrolyzes MTX to inactive metabolites, has become available for the treatment of acute nephrotoxicity. On the other hand, glutamine is usually administered in oncology treatments to avoid other side effects. We report a case of an adolescent who was diagnosed with T lymphoblastic lymphoma. He was receiving treatment with glutamine when the third course of methotrexate was administered (5 g/m(2)) and he suffered a deterioration in his renal function. Carboxypeptidase was used but the methotrexate serum concentration reduction was not satisfactory. The technique to assess the amount of enzyme-inactivated methotrexate by quantification of MTX metabolites is not available in our country, therefore, the concentrations of MTX may be overestimated. The literature was reviewed to study the influence of glutamine on delayed methotrexate elimination which may lead to acute toxicity.","['Cozar Olmo, J A', 'Martinez Colmenero, C', 'Pelaez Pleguezuelos, I', 'Leiva Gea, I', 'Lopez Garcia, A B', 'de la Cruz Moreno, J']","['Cozar Olmo JA', 'Martinez Colmenero C', 'Pelaez Pleguezuelos I', 'Leiva Gea I', 'Lopez Garcia AB', 'de la Cruz Moreno J']","['Unidad Gestion Clinica de Pediatria, Unidad Oncohematologia, Complejo Hospitalario de Jaen, Jaen, Espana. jcozarolmo@hotmail.com']",['spa'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20090718,Spain,An Pediatr (Barc),"Anales de pediatria (Barcelona, Spain : 2003)",101162596,,2009/07/21 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/21 09:00'],"['2009/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/20 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1695-4033(09)00347-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.anpedi.2009.05.014 [doi]']",ppublish,An Pediatr (Barc). 2009 Sep;71(3):230-4. doi: 10.1016/j.anpedi.2009.05.014.

Respectively 15 and three months after graft, these two patients presented with multiple organ failure including very severe hepatic dysfunction. The diagnosis was made according to positive blood PCR, positive BAL, and hepatic histological findings. DISCUSSION: Adenoviruses, frequent in pediatrics, can be responsible for extremely severe infections among immunocompromised adults. T lymphocyte depletion plays a key role.

Neuropathological features include the progressive degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the forebrain cholinergic projection system especially nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM). New cell therapeutic approaches for the replacement of degenerated cells are being researched. The aim of this study was to investigate the production of cholinergic neurons from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and potential for utilizing ESC-derived neuronal precursor cells (NPCs) and primed NPCs (PNPCs) for cell restorative therapy in a rodent model of AD. NPCs were produced by growth factor-mediated selection under serum-free conditions and differentiated better into cholinergic neurons when NPCs primed with Shh (approximately 22%) in comparison with different cholinergic promoting factors. Behavioral assessment of unilateral nbM ibotenic acid-lesioned rats by Morris water maze and spatial probe test revealed a significant behavioral improvement in memory deficits following transplantation with NPCs and/or PNPCs. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the majority (approximately 70%) of the NPCs and/or PNPCs retained neuronal phenotype and approximately 40% of them had a cholinergic cell phenotype following transplantation with no tumor formation, indicating that these may be safe for transplantation. This experimental study has important implications as it suggests that the transplantation of mouse ESC-derived NPCs and/or following commitment to a cholinergic cell phenotype can promote behavioral recovery in a rodent model of AD.","['Moghadam, Farshad Homayouni', 'Alaie, Hojatoallah', 'Karbalaie, Khadije', 'Tanhaei, Somayeh', 'Nasr Esfahani, Mohammad Hossein', 'Baharvand, Hossein']","['Moghadam FH', 'Alaie H', 'Karbalaie K', 'Tanhaei S', 'Nasr Esfahani MH', 'Baharvand H']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Royan Institute for Animal Biotechnology, Esfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090718,England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,,2009/07/21 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/21 09:00'],"['2009/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-4681(09)00080-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.diff.2009.06.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 2009 Sep-Oct;78(2-3):59-68. doi: 10.1016/j.diff.2009.06.005.

Our goal was to investigate: (i) the spontaneous and hypoxia-induced production of pro-angiogenic factors, VEGF and Ang2, by Real-time PCR and ELISA, (ii) the degree of vascularization in CLL-infiltrated bone marrow (BM) compartment by CD34 immunohistochemical staining of microvessels and (iii) the direct angiogenic effect of CLL-derived VEGF and Ang2 by function-blocking experiments in Matrigel assays. The results demonstrated that CLL cells spontaneously express both VEGF and Ang2 and are able to secrete these factors in surrounding microenvironment. Full-length Ang2 mRNA and truncated form Ang2(443) were detectable. Moreover, CLL cells were shown to enhance secretion of both VEGF and Ang2 proteins when subjected to hypoxic condition. Furthermore, increased in vivo and in vitro angiogenesis was induced by CLL cells. Enhanced BM vascularity correlated with Ig-unmutated CLL subset and increased expression of Ang2. Then, we demonstrated that supernatants obtained from CLL cells significantly increase the HUVEC tube formation in Matrigel assays and that this enhanced angiogenic capacity is mediated by both CLL-derived VEGF and Ang2. Taken together, these results suggest that several simultaneous mechanisms may be involved in the CLL capacity to induce the disruption of pre-existing vessel structures to give rise to tumor neoangiogenesis. The preliminary studies in solid tumors, showing that the disruption of Ang2 function can inhibit tumor vessel density and growth, are encouraging and suggest the possibility of new future therapeutic options targeting CLL microenvironment.","['Maffei, Rossana', 'Martinelli, Silvia', 'Castelli, Ilaria', 'Santachiara, Rita', 'Zucchini, Patrizia', 'Fontana, Marcella', 'Fiorcari, Stefania', 'Bonacorsi, Goretta', 'Ilariucci, Fiorella', 'Torelli, Giuseppe', 'Marasca, Roberto']","['Maffei R', 'Martinelli S', 'Castelli I', 'Santachiara R', 'Zucchini P', 'Fontana M', 'Fiorcari S', 'Bonacorsi G', 'Ilariucci F', 'Torelli G', 'Marasca R']","['Hematology Unit, Department of Oncology and Hematology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090718,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,2009/07/21 09:00,2010/03/24 06:00,['2009/07/21 09:00'],"['2009/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/18 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00319-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.06.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Mar;34(3):312-21. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.06.023.

Here, we present evidence that a cellular restriction is the obstacle to transduction of macrophages by MLV. Neutralization of the restriction by Vpx, a primate lentiviral protein previously shown to protect primate lentiviruses from a macrophage restriction, rendered macrophages permissive to MLV infection. We further demonstrate that this restriction prevents transduction of quiescent monocytes by HIV-1. Monocyte-HeLa heterokaryons were resistant to HIV-1 infection, while heterokaryons formed between monocytes and HeLa cells expressing Vpx were permissive to HIV-1 infection. Encapsidation of Vpx within HIV-1 virions conferred the ability to infect quiescent monocytes. Collectively, our results indicate that the relative ability of lentiviruses and gammaretroviruses to transduce nondividing myeloid cells is dependent upon their ability to neutralize a cellular restriction.","['Kaushik, Rajnish', 'Zhu, Xiaonan', 'Stranska, Ruzena', 'Wu, Yuanfei', 'Stevenson, Mario']","['Kaushik R', 'Zhu X', 'Stranska R', 'Wu Y', 'Stevenson M']","['Program in Molecular Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cell Host Microbe,Cell host & microbe,101302316,PMC2777639,2009/07/21 09:00,2009/10/23 06:00,['2009/07/21 09:00'],"['2008/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/13 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S1931-3128(09)00221-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.chom.2009.05.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Host Microbe. 2009 Jul 23;6(1):68-80. doi: 10.1016/j.chom.2009.05.022.,"['0 (VPX protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 2)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'HIV-1/*growth & development/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*growth & development/*immunology', 'Macrophages/*immunology/virology', 'Monocytes/*immunology/virology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins/immunology']",,,"['AI37475/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'RR11589/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI032890-16/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 RR011589/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI032890/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH093306/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 RR011589-14/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI037475/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 AI037475/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-AI42845/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI042845/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS128645'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Irradiated (0-6 Gy) human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with or without various agents--a cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) inhibitor, a cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) inhibitor, or lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs)--were used to assess IL-32 expression by Northern blot analysis and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Expression of cell adhesion molecules and leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells using human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) cells was also analyzed. RESULTS: Ionizing radiation dramatically increased IL-32 expression in vascular endothelial cells through multiple pathways. Ionizing radiation induced IL-32 expression through nuclear factor kappaB activation, through induction of cPLA2 and LPC, as well as induction of Cox-2 and subsequent conversion of arachidonic acid to prostacyclin. Conversely, blocking nuclear factor kappaB, cPLA2, and Cox-2 activity impaired IR-induced IL-32 expression. Importantly, IL-32 significantly enhanced IR-induced expression of vascular cell adhesion molecules and leukocyte adhesion on endothelial cells. CONCLUSION: This study identifies IL-32 as a positive regulator in IR-induced vascular inflammation, and neutralization of IL-32 may be beneficial in protecting from IR-induced inflammation.","['Kobayashi, Hanako', 'Yazlovitskaya, Eugenia M', 'Lin, P Charles']","['Kobayashi H', 'Yazlovitskaya EM', 'Lin PC']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,PMC2713876,2009/07/21 09:00,2009/08/04 09:00,['2009/07/21 09:00'],"['2008/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [medline]']","['S0360-3016(09)00580-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.04.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Aug 1;74(5):1573-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.04.017.,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)', '0 (IL32 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Group IV Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (PCSK7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Subtilisins)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Group IV Phospholipases A2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*physiology', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology', 'Subtilisins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Umbilical Veins/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism', 'Vasculitis/etiology/*metabolism']",,,"['R01 CA108856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR053718/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS45888/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA108856-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS045888/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', '5T32CA093240/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR053718-03/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS045888-04/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR053718/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA108856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA093240/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS114038'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that dogs transplanted with homeobox B4 (HOXB4)-transduced autologous CD34(+) cells developed myeloid leukemia associated with HOXB4 overexpression. Here we describe the transmission, engraftment, and expansion of these canine leukemia cells into two genetically unrelated, immunosuppressed dogs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two dogs immunosuppressed after major histocompatibility complex-haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation and exhibiting mixed donor-host chimerism were accidentally infused trace amounts of HOXB4-overexpressing leukemia cells from a third-party dog. RESULTS: Six weeks after infusion of HOXB4-overexpressing leukemia cells, these two dogs rapidly developed myeloid leukemia consisting of marrow and organ infiltration, circulating blasts, and, in one dog, chloromatous masses. Despite neither of these dogs sharing any dog leukocyte antigen haplotypes with the sentinel case, the HOXB4-transduced clones engrafted and proliferated without difficulty in the presence of immunosuppression. Chimerism studies in both dogs confirmed that donor and, in one case, host hematopoietic cell engraftment was lost and replaced by third-party HOXB4 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The engraftment and expansion of these leukemia cells in dogs will allow studies into the biology of leukemia and development and evaluation of novel antileukemia therapies in a clinically relevant large animal model.","['Thakar, Monica S', 'Zhang, Xiao-Bing', 'Beard, Brian C', 'Sale, George E', 'Santos, Erlinda B', 'Peterson, Laura', 'Kiem, Hans-Peter', 'Sandmaier, Brenda M']","['Thakar MS', 'Zhang XB', 'Beard BC', 'Sale GE', 'Santos EB', 'Peterson L', 'Kiem HP', 'Sandmaier BM']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090717,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,PMC2748853,2009/07/21 09:00,2009/10/08 06:00,['2009/07/21 09:00'],"['2009/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(09)00255-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2009.07.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Oct;37(10):1157-66. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2009.07.004.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 1,910 patients who consecutively underwent radical prostatectomy between 1992 and 2004. These patients had a median age of 65 years, a median prostate specific antigen of 7.6 ng/ml and a median followup of 5.9 years. Overall disease specific, comorbid, second cancer specific and other mortality data were used as study end points in competing risk analyses. Fatal second cancers were subdivided into 10 categories. The numbers of observed deaths from second cancers were compared with expected rates using cancer registry data. RESULTS: The risk of dying of a second cancer within 10 years after radical prostatectomy was 4.1%. This death rate was lower than that of comorbidity (5.8%) and prostate cancer (5.4%). Among second cancers colorectal cancer (0.74%), lung cancer (0.69%) and lymphoma, myeloma or leukemia (0.66%) were the most common causes of death after 10 years. Whereas the mortality rates from the other second cancers were within the expected range, fatal lung cancer occurred significantly less frequently than expected. CONCLUSIONS: The low probability of dying of a second malignancy within 10 years after surgery (about 4%) and the nevertheless relatively large contribution of second cancers to competing mortality (about 40%) reflect the good general health status of men selected for radical prostatectomy.","['Froehner, Michael', 'Koch, Rainer', 'Hakenberg, Oliver W', 'Wirth, Manfred P']","['Froehner M', 'Koch R', 'Hakenberg OW', 'Wirth MP']","['Department of Urology, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technical University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany.

DNA adducts (N7-methylguanine, N7MeG and O(6)-methylguanine, O(6)MeG) were quantified as biomarkers of exposure. Both endpoints were assessed using 5replicates/dose (4-h treatment) with MMS or MNU (0.0069-50muM), or vehicle (1% DMSO). Mutant frequency (MF) (thymidine kinase (TK) locus) was determined using the soft agar cloning methodology and a 2-day expression period; in addition, microwell and Sequester-Express-Select (SES) methods were used for MMS. Isolated DNA was acid-hydrolyzed, and adducts quantified by LC/ESI-MS/MS, using authentic and internal standards. MF dose-responses were analyzed using several statistical approaches, all of which confirmed that a threshold dose-response model provided the best fit. NOAELs for MF were 10muM MMS and 0.69muM MNU, based on ANOVA and Dunnett's test (p<0.05). N7MeG adducts were present in all cell samples, including solvent-control cells, and were increased over control levels in cells treated with >/=10muM MMS or 3.45muM MNU. O(6)MeG levels were only quantifiable at >/=10muM MNU; O(6)MeG was not quantifiable in control or MMS-treated cells at current detection limits. Thus, (1) cells treated with </=0.69muM MNU or </=10muM MMS did not demonstrate increases in TK(-) MF, but did demonstrate quantifiable levels of N7MeG adducts; and (2) the levels of N7MeG adducts did not correlate with induced MF, as MNU-treated cells had fewer N7MeG adducts but higher MF compared with MMS-treated cells, for quasi-equimolar doses.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that the tumor cells in adult T-cell leukemia lymphomas can function as Treg, raising the question of whether any variant of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma may also express a regulatory phenotype. We describe an extraordinary case of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma clinically characterized by protean cutaneous manifestations and histologically showing a pattern consistent with epidermotropic pleomorphic medium-/large-cell primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The majority of neoplastic cells were CD4+ CD25+ T cells and strongly expressed FOXP3.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gene expression profiling followed by cytofluorimetric, morphologic, and biologic analyses were used to monitor WEB-2170 effects in AML cell lines (ie, NB4, KG1, NB4-MR4, THP1, and U937) and blasts from patients with different AML (M0-M5) subtypes. PTEN silencing with small interfering RNA was also performed. RESULTS: We have demonstrated that drug-mediated cytostasis/apoptosis in NB4 cells is characterized by upregulation of cyclin G2, p21/WAF1, NIX, TNF-alpha, and PTEN expression, and downregulation of cyclin D2 and BCL2 expression. We observed an increase in PTEN protein accompanied by a decrease in phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) and phospho-AKT, and by forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a) cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation; the mitochondrial cytochrome C release and PARP cleavage marked the late apoptotic steps. We have found that WEB-2170 triggered apoptosis in NB4, KG1, and NB4-MR4 cells where PTEN was expressed, but not in THP1 and U937 cells where PTEN was absent. Finally, we show that PTEN silencing in NB4 cells by PTEN-specific small interfering RNA resulted in a significant reduction of drug-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that WEB-2170 is a powerful antileukemic agent with interesting translational opportunities to treat AML and described mechanisms of drug-induced intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis both in AML cell lines and blasts from AML patients by addressing PTEN as the master regulator of the whole process.","['Cellai, Cristina', 'Laurenzana, Anna', 'Bianchi, Elisa', 'Sdelci, Sara', 'Manfredini, Rossella', 'Vannucchi, Alessandro M', 'Caporale, Roberto', 'Balliu, Manjola', 'Mannelli, Francesco', 'Ferrari, Sergio', 'Bosi, Alberto', 'Miniati, Debora', 'Cocco, Pier L', 'Veronneau, Steeve', 'Stankova, Jana', 'Paoletti, Francesco']","['Cellai C', 'Laurenzana A', 'Bianchi E', 'Sdelci S', 'Manfredini R', 'Vannucchi AM', 'Caporale R', 'Balliu M', 'Mannelli F', 'Ferrari S', 'Bosi A', 'Miniati D', 'Cocco PL', 'Veronneau S', 'Stankova J', 'Paoletti F']","['Department of Experimental Pathology and Oncology, University of Florence, 50134 Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090715,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,2009/07/21 09:00,2009/10/08 06:00,['2009/07/21 09:00'],"['2009/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/29 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(09)00254-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2009.07.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Oct;37(10):1176-1185.e21. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2009.07.002.

METHODS: 262 APL patients diagnosed by chromosome analysis and/or fusion gene examination in the last five years were retrospectively analyzed in this study. To survey the expression of CD34 in those patients, all the cases were divided into two groups (CD34(+) APL vs. CD34(-) APL). The clinical features including age, gender, abnormal values of the peripheral hemogram before treatment, the complete remission (CR) rate and the incidence of DIC and laboratory data such as the results of morphology, immunology, cytogenetics and molecular biology (MICM) between those two groups were compared. RESULTS: Of the 262 APL patients, 38 (14.5%) cases were positive for CD34 expression. There were no statistically significant differences between CD34(+) APL and CD34(-) APL groups in gender and age (P > 0.05). Before treatment, the median level of WBC in CD34(+) APL was 25.92 x 10(9)/L, which was significantly higher than that of CD34(-) APL (5.3 x 10(9)/L, P < 0.05). CD34(+) APL by morphology classification were mostly of the subtypes M3b and M3v (65.8%), while these subtypes in CD34(-) APL (40.3%) were significantly less (P < 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups compared in respect of complete remission (CR) rate and the incidence of DIC (P > 0.05). The expression level of CD34 in APL had correlation to the expression level of CD2, CD7 and CD117; the latter three phenotypes in CD34(+) APL were significantly higher than those in CD34(-) APL (P < 0.01). No significant difference was found between those two groups by chromosome analysis, but there was more PML-RAR-alpha transcript short form in CD34(+) APL than that in CD34(-) APL (P < 0.05).

METHODS: Gene clonal rearrangement of IgH was detected by semi-nested PCR using primers of FR2 & FR3A in 105 bone marrow samples of patients with B-cell lymphoma. The PCR detection results were compared with the cytomorphology of bone marrow aspiration biopsy. The correlation between PCR detection results and clinicopathological factors were evaluated. RESULTS: Among 105 cases of B-cell lymphoma, bone marrow involvement was detected by PCR technique in 48 cases (45.7%), while only 22 cases (21.0%) were detected by bone marrow cytological analysis. There was a significant difference between two methods (P < 0.05), and the concordance rate was 71.4%. The incidence of bone marrow involvement at the time of initial diagnosis detected by PCR technique was 30.8% for diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 25.0% for follicular lymphoma (FL), and 100.0% for small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), respectively. Bone marrow involvement detected by PCR detection correlated with Ann Arbor stage. Rate of clonal IgH gene rearrangement by PCR in early B-cell lymphoma was lower than that in advanced stage B-cell lymphoma patients (P = 0.02). There was no statistically significant difference in efficacy between patients with positive and negative results detected by PCR (P > 0.05). But difference in complete response (CR) rate (23.3% and 46.3%) had significant difference (P = 0.019). CONCLUSION: Semi-nested PCR analysis may be an effective method for detection of abnormalities in bone marrow in patients with B-cell lymphoma and is superior to cytomorphology. The positive rate in patients with advanced Ann Arbor stage is higher than that in patients with early Ann Arbor stage, and patients with PCR negative result have more chances to achieved CR after treatment.","['Chen, Zhi-yu', 'Zhou, Xiao-yan', 'Zhang, Tai-ming', 'Hong, Xiao-nan', 'Yin, Ji-liang', 'Hu, Xi-chun', 'Shi, Da-ren']","['Chen ZY', 'Zhou XY', 'Zhang TM', 'Hong XN', 'Yin JL', 'Hu XC', 'Shi DR']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Cancer Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],7910681,,2009/07/21 09:00,2010/09/30 06:00,['2009/07/21 09:00'],"['2009/07/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2009 Mar;31(3):183-8.,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy/methods', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Remission Induction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several reports have demonstrated the relevance of mechanical stress to induce adaptive responses in different cell types. Interestingly, these signaling pathways also participate in mammary gland involution. Then, it has been suggested that cell stretching caused by milk accumulation after weaning might be the first stimulus that initiates the complete remodeling of the mammary gland. However, no previous report has demonstrated the impact of mechanical stress on mammary cell physiology. To address this issue, we have designed a new practical device that allowed us to evaluate the effects of radial stretching on mammary epithelial cells in culture. RESULTS: We have designed and built a new device to analyze the biological consequences of applying mechanical stress to cells cultured on flexible silicone membranes. Subsequently, a geometrical model that predicted the percentage of radial strain applied to the elastic substrate was developed. By microscopic image analysis, the adjustment of these calculations to the actual strain exerted on the attached cells was verified. The studies described herein were all performed in the HC11 non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell line, which was originated from a pregnant BALB/c mouse. In these cells, as previously observed in other tissue types, mechanical stress induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and c-Fos mRNA and protein expression. In addition, we found that mammary cell stretching triggered involution associated cellular events as Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) expression induction, STAT3 activation and AKT phosphorylation inhibition. CONCLUSION: Here, we show for the first time, that mechanical strain is able to induce weaning-associated events in cultured mammary epithelial cells. These results were obtained using a new practical and affordable device specifically designed for such a purpose. We believe that our results indicate the relevance of mechanical stress among the early post-lactation events that lead to mammary gland involution.","['Quaglino, Ana', 'Salierno, Marcelo', 'Pellegrotti, Jesica', 'Rubinstein, Natalia', 'Kordon, Edith C']","['Quaglino A', 'Salierno M', 'Pellegrotti J', 'Rubinstein N', 'Kordon EC']","['Departamento de Quimica Biologica e Instituto de Fisiologia, Biologia Molecular y Neurociencias-CONICET, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina. quaglino@qb.fcen.uba.ar']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090717,England,BMC Cell Biol,BMC cell biology,100966972,PMC2721828,2009/07/21 09:00,2009/10/29 06:00,['2009/07/21 09:00'],"['2009/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2121-10-55 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2121-10-55 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cell Biol. 2009 Jul 17;10:55. doi: 10.1186/1471-2121-10-55.,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Epithelial Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pregnancy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', '*Stress, Mechanical']",,,"['R01 TW006212/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'R01TW006212/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We outline key histologic and immunohistochemical features that aide in the diagnosis of LC. The presence of cytophagocytosis on histologic examination, a phenomenon more commonly associated with lymphoid rather than myeloid malignancies, provided a clue to the possibility of a malignant process. The atypical myeloid infiltrate showed S-100 protein positivity, an unusual finding that may be seen in LC. Although not commonly reported in LC, the presence of S-100 protein positivity and cytophagocytosis should not lead to the premature exclusion of LC as a possible diagnosis until a thorough clinical, histologic and immunohistochemical evaluation is performed.

Best treatment strategies remain to be defined. The role of induction intensity, first remission hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and maintenance chemotherapy continues to be discussed. We tested a strategy of high intensity treatment of short duration followed by HSCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective phase II study used induction with DV-ICE followed by immediate allogeneic or autologous HSCT (depending on donor availability) without additional consolidation or maintenance treatment. DV-ICE consisted of dexamethasone, vincristine, idarubicin, etoposide, and conventional dose cytosine arabinoside; HSCT was planned immediately if CR was achieved or after an additional course of intermediate high dose cytosine arabinoside and etoposide for patients with induction failure. A total of 42 consecutive patients between 17 and 67 yr of age (median 43 yr) were enrolled. Of the 42 patients, 57% were male, 76% had B-lineage ALL, 19% T-lineage ALL and two patients biphenotypic ALL. 29% were Ph+; 7% had 11q23 and 45% had a normal karyotype. CNS involvement was found in three patients. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients (79%) achieved a CR, 24 patients after induction I or II and nine patients after rescue HSCT. 31 patients received a HSCT (seven autologous and 24 allogeneic). 11 patients did not receive a HSCT because of early death in nine (treatment toxicity in five, refractory disease in four), one patient refused transplantation, one patient was not suitable. Disease-free survival (DFS) of the entire cohort was 46% (95% CI +/-16%) at 1 yr and 16% (+/-13%) at 5 yr. Overall survival (OS) was 63% (+/-15%) at 1 yr and 23% (+/-15%) at 5 yr, with a median follow-up of surviving patients of 55 (4-136) months. Neither disease subtype, cytogenetic abnormalities nor patient age or gender was significantly associated with survival. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive induction using DV-ICE followed by early transplantation without treatment beyond 4 months failed to improve outcome compared with standard treatment.","['Dudler, Christine', 'Bargetzi, Mario', 'Tichelli, Andre', 'Gratwohl, Alois', 'Passweg, Jakob R', 'Wernli, Martin']","['Dudler C', 'Bargetzi M', 'Tichelli A', 'Gratwohl A', 'Passweg JR', 'Wernli M']","['University of Basel, University Hospital, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20090709,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,2009/07/21 09:00,2010/03/13 06:00,['2009/07/21 09:00'],"['2009/07/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1316 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01316.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2009 Dec 1;83(6):512-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01316.x.

TA and TL were analyzed in relation to AL stage and subtype. Five-year survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curve. TA in AL patients was higher than healthy individuals. TA level was the highest in the relapsed group, followed by the newly diagnosed group, and then the CR group. TA had no difference between acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) group and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) group. But TA in group of subtype M3 was lower than other subtypes of ANLL. TL in AL group was shorter than the control group. TL was the shortest in the relapsed group, followed by the newly diagnosed group, and finally the CR group. TL exhibited an inverse correlation with TA. The group of patients with high TA had a significantly poorer five-year-survival than that of low TA group. TA is elevated and TL is shortened in AL patients. There is a significant inverse correlation between TL and TA. Patients in late-stage disease had shorter TL and higher TA than those in early stages. The shortened TL and elevated TA correlated with disease progression and relapse, and they may serve as prognostic factors for AL patients with poor outcome. M3 subtype is special with relative lower TA and long-lasting survival than other subtypes.","['Wang, Y', 'Fang, M', 'Sun, X', 'Sun, J']","['Wang Y', 'Fang M', 'Sun X', 'Sun J']","['Department of Hematology, First University Hospital DaLian Medical University, LiaoNing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090715,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,2009/07/21 09:00,2010/08/25 06:00,['2009/07/21 09:00'],"['2009/07/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['CLH1178 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-553X.2009.01178.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2010 Apr;32(2):230-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2009.01178.x.

Thyroid SPNs can develop after exposure to low-dose radiation, due to the radio-sensitivity of the thyroid gland. The British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (BCCSS) was set up to directly monitor the late effects of treatment, including risk of SPNs, in childhood cancer survivors and includes 17,980 5-year survivors. We carried out a cohort analysis to determine the risk of thyroid SPNs in the BCCSS, and estimated risk using standardised incidence ratios (SIRs), relative risk (RR) using multivariate Poisson regression and cumulative incidence curves. There were 340,202 person years at risk subsequent to a 5-year survival, median follow-up 17.4 years per survivor. We identified 50 thyroid SPNs including 31 (62%) papillary carcinomas, 15 (30%) follicular carcinomas and 4 (8%) other types. 88% of thyroid SPNs developed after exposure to radiotherapy in or around the thyroid gland. SIR overall was 18.0 (95% confidence interval 13.4-23.8). Risk of thyroid cancer was highest after Hodgkin's disease: RR 3.3 (1.1-10.1) and Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma: RR 3.4 (1.1-10.7) relative to leukaemia (RR 1.0) (p < 0.001). Survivors treated with radiotherapy in childhood had a RR of 4.6 (1.4-15.1) relative to survivors not treated with radiotherapy (RR 1.0), p = 0003. In conclusion, the risk of thyroid cancer in childhood cancer survivors is relatively high in this cohort of childhood cancer survivors.

Members of the interleukin-6 family of cytokines, including leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), induce astrocyte differentiation of NPCs by activating the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). We show here that retinoic acid (RA) facilitates LIF-induced astrocyte differentiation of NPCs. RA and LIF synergistically activate the promoter of gfap, which encodes the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein, and a putative RA response element in the promoter was found to be critical for this activation. Histone H3 acetylation around the STAT-binding site in the gfap promoter was increased in NPCs treated with RA, allowing STAT3 to gain access to the promoter more efficiently. These results suggest that RA acts in concert with LIF to induce astrocyte differentiation of NPCs through an epigenetic mechanism that involves cross-talk between distinct signaling pathways.","['Asano, Hirotsugu', 'Aonuma, Makoto', 'Sanosaka, Tsukasa', 'Kohyama, Jun', 'Namihira, Masakazu', 'Nakashima, Kinichi']","['Asano H', 'Aonuma M', 'Sanosaka T', 'Kohyama J', 'Namihira M', 'Nakashima K']","['Laboratory of Molecular Neuroscience, Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Nara 630-0192, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,,2009/07/18 09:00,2010/02/02 06:00,['2009/07/18 09:00'],"['2009/07/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.176 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2009 Nov;27(11):2744-52. doi: 10.1002/stem.176.,"['0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Keratolytic Agents)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Astrocytes/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects/genetics', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Female', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/genetics', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Keratolytic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Neurons/*cytology', 'Pregnancy', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics/physiology', 'Response Elements/genetics/physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over-expression of Aurora kinases is found in several human cancers and correlated with histological malignancy and clinical outcomes. Therefore, Aurora kinase inhibitors should be useful in the treatment of cancers. METHODS: Cell-based screening methods have an advantage over biochemical approaches because hits can be optimized to inhibit targets in the proper intracellular context. We developed a novel Aurora kinase inhibitor R763/AS703569 using an image-based phenotypic screen. The anti-proliferative effect was examined in a panel of tumor cell lines and primary cells. The efficacy was determined in a broad panel of xenograft models. RESULTS: R763/AS703569 inhibits Aurora kinases, along with a limited number of other kinases including FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), and has potent anti-proliferative activity against many cell types accompanying unique phenotypic changes such as enlarged cell size, endoreduplication and apoptosis. The endoreduplication cycle induced by R763/AS703569 was irreversible even after the compound was withdrawn from the culture. Oral administration of R763/AS703569 demonstrated marked inhibition of tumor growth in xenograft models of pancreatic, breast, colon, ovarian, and lung tumors and leukemia. An acute myeloid leukemia cell line MV4-11, which carries a FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutation, is particularly sensitive to R763/AS703569 in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: R763/AS703569 is a potent inhibitor of Aurora kinases and exhibited significant anti-proliferative activity against a wide range of tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of Aurora kinases has the potential to be a new addition to the treatment of cancers.","['McLaughlin, John', 'Markovtsov, Vadim', 'Li, Hui', 'Wong, Steve', 'Gelman, Marina', 'Zhu, Yanhong', 'Franci, Christian', 'Lang, D Wayne', 'Pali, Erlina', 'Lasaga, Joe', 'Low, Caroline', 'Zhao, Feifei', 'Chang, Betty', 'Gururaja, Tarikere L', 'Xu, Weiduan', 'Baluom, Muhammad', 'Sweeny, David', 'Carroll, David', 'Sran, Arvinder', 'Thota, Sambaiah', 'Parmer, Manjeet', 'Romane, Angela', 'Clemens, George', 'Grossbard, Elliott', 'Qu, Kunbin', 'Jenkins, Yonchu', 'Kinoshita, Taisei', 'Taylor, Vanessa', 'Holland, Sacha J', 'Argade, Ankush', 'Singh, Rajinder', 'Pine, Polly', 'Payan, Donald G', 'Hitoshi, Yasumichi']","['McLaughlin J', 'Markovtsov V', 'Li H', 'Wong S', 'Gelman M', 'Zhu Y', 'Franci C', 'Lang D', 'Pali E', 'Lasaga J', 'Low C', 'Zhao F', 'Chang B', 'Gururaja TL', 'Xu W', 'Baluom M', 'Sweeny D', 'Carroll D', 'Sran A', 'Thota S', 'Parmer M', 'Romane A', 'Clemens G', 'Grossbard E', 'Qu K', 'Jenkins Y', 'Kinoshita T', 'Taylor V', 'Holland SJ', 'Argade A', 'Singh R', 'Pine P', 'Payan DG', 'Hitoshi Y']","['Rigel Pharmaceuticals Inc., 1180 Veterans Boulevard, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,,2009/07/18 09:00,2011/05/06 06:00,['2009/07/18 09:00'],"['2008/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-009-0641-1 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2010 Jan;136(1):99-113. doi: 10.1007/s00432-009-0641-1.,"['0 (MSC1992371A)', '0 (Norbornanes)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Norbornanes/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Soluble CD23 (sCD23), short CD23-derived peptides containing the arg-lys-cys (RKC) motif recognized by alphavbeta5 and anti-alphavbeta5 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) all sustain growth of pre-B cell lines. The chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) regulates key processes during B-cell development. SDF-1 enhanced the growth-sustaining effect driven by ligation of alphavbeta5 with anti-alphavbeta5 MAb 15F-11, sCD23 or CD23-derived RKC-containing peptides. This effect was restricted to B-cell precursors and was specific to SDF-1. The enhancement in growth was associated with the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and both these responses were attenuated by the MEK inhibitor U0126. Finally, platelet-derived growth factor also enhanced both alphavbeta5-mediated cell growth and ERK activation. The data suggest that adhesion-independent growth-promoting signals delivered to B-cell precursors through the alphavbeta5 integrin can be modulated by cross-talk with receptors linked to both G-protein and tyrosine kinase-coupled signalling pathways.","['Acharya, M', 'Edkins, A L', 'Ozanne, B W', 'Cushley, W']","['Acharya M', 'Edkins AL', 'Ozanne BW', 'Cushley W']","['Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Biomedical and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Scotland, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090716,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2009/07/18 09:00,2009/11/06 06:00,['2009/07/18 09:00'],"['2009/07/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009126 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.126 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Oct;23(10):1807-17. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.126.

To identify T-cell epitopes mediating lysis of malignant cells, peptides were eluted from the patient's blasts and analyzed by mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based peptide sequencing. Using this approach, an HLA-A24-binding peptide derived from Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1), a regulator of apoptosis pathways, was identified as an epitope recognized by the generated CTLs. To further characterize this novel antigenic peptide, CTLs were induced using DCs electroporated with RNA coding for BI-1 or pulsed with the cognate peptide. These CTLs generated from healthy donors in vitro efficiently lysed the patient's blasts as well as other HLA-matched leukemic cells. In conclusion, we identified a BI-1 peptide as a novel immunogenic tumor-associated antigen (TAA) in AML. In vitro induction of BI-1-specific CTLs by RNA transfection or pulsing of DCs with the synthetically generated peptide was a feasible and highly effective method to generate leukemia-specific CTLs.

In this study, we have found that Abeta(1-42) produced a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability and dose-dependent increase in apoptotic cell death in PC12 cells. Meanwhile, Abeta(1-42) (0.1 muM) increased the phosphorylation of serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase1 (SGK1) at Ser-78 specifically. A parallel increase in ERK1/2, STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation and the anti-apoptotic gene Mcl-1 expression was also observed. Transfection of rat siRNAs against ERK1/2, SGK1, STAT1 and STAT2 abolished these effects of Abeta. Transfection of sgkS78D, the constitutively active SGK1, dose-dependently protected against Abeta-induced apoptosis and dose-dependently increased the expression of Mcl-1. SGK1 activation further phosphorylates STAT1 at Tyr-701 and Ser-727 directly, and activates STAT2 at Tyr-690 indirectly. Phosphorylation of STAT1/STAT2 upregulated Mcl-1 expression which in turn protected against Abeta-induced apoptosis. But Mcl-1 siRNA transfection enhanced Abeta-induced apoptosis. Mutation of SGK1 at Ser-78 blocked the effect of Abeta on STAT1/STAT2 phosphorylation and Mcl-1 expression. Further, mutation of STAT1/STAT2 prevented the effect of both Abeta and SGK1 on Mcl-1 expression. These results together showed a novel endogenous protection mechanism that is activated on Abeta insult to mediate cell survival.","['Hsu, W L', 'Chiu, T H', 'Tai, D J C', 'Ma, Y L', 'Lee, E H Y']","['Hsu WL', 'Chiu TH', 'Tai DJ', 'Ma YL', 'Lee EH']","['Department of Physiology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090717,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,,2009/07/18 09:00,2009/12/17 06:00,['2009/07/18 09:00'],"['2009/07/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd200991 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2009.91 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2009 Nov;16(11):1515-29. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2009.91.

METHODS: A national SLE cohort identified through SLE discharge diagnoses in the Swedish hospital discharge register during 1964 to 1995 (n = 6438) was linked to the national cancer register. A nested case-control study in SLE patients who developed acute or chronic myeloid leukaemia was performed with SLE patients without malignancy as controls. Medical records from cases and controls were reviewed and bone marrow specimens were re-evaluated. A Medline search of previously published cases of SLE and myeloid leukaemia was performed. RESULTS: After confirmation of SLE diagnosis according to the ACR criteria, eight patients with SLE and myeloid leukaemia and 18 SLE controls were included in the study. Preceding leucopenia was significantly associated with leukaemia development, whereas other SLE manifestations were not. Two cases had a preceding bone marrow confirming myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Only two cases were significantly treated with cyclophosphamide or AZA. A Medline search resulted in only 15 previously published cases of coincident SLE and myeloid leukaemia. Preceding MDS was reported in five of these, whereas only eight had been treated with cytotoxic drugs. CONCLUSION: Low-dose chemotherapy was not a major cause of myeloid malignancy in our population-based cohort of SLE patients nor in the reported cases from literature. Leucopenia was a risk factor for myeloid leukaemia development and an MDS was frequently seen. Therefore bone marrow investigation should be considered in SLE patients with long-standing leucopenia and anaemia.","['Lofstrom, Bjorn', 'Backlin, Carin', 'Sundstrom, Christer', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva', 'Ekbom, Anders', 'Lundberg, Ingrid E']","['Lofstrom B', 'Backlin C', 'Sundstrom C', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E', 'Ekbom A', 'Lundberg IE']","['Department of Rheumatology, Malar Hospital, SE 631 88 Eskilstuna, Sweden. bjorn.lofstrom@dll.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090716,England,Rheumatology (Oxford),"Rheumatology (Oxford, England)",100883501,,2009/07/18 09:00,2009/11/10 06:00,['2009/07/18 09:00'],"['2009/07/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['kep204 [pii]', '10.1093/rheumatology/kep204 [doi]']",ppublish,Rheumatology (Oxford). 2009 Oct;48(10):1222-6. doi: 10.1093/rheumatology/kep204.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2005, 739 patients with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia enrolled in two consecutive trials (PETHEMA LPA96 and LPA99) received induction therapy with all-trans retinoic acid and idarubicin. Consolidation therapy comprised three courses of anthracycline monochemotherapy (LPA96), with all-trans retinoic acid and reinforced doses of idarubicin in patients with an intermediate or high risk of relapse (LPA99). Central nervous system prophylaxis was not given. RESULTS: Central nervous system relapse was documented in 11 patients. The 5-year cumulative incidence of central nervous system relapse was 1.7% (LPA96 3.2% and LPA99 1.2%; p=0.09). The cumulative incidence was 0%, 0.8%, and 5.5% in low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients, respectively. Relapse risk score (p=0.0001) and the occurrence of central nervous system hemorrhage during induction (5-year cumulative incidence 18.7%, p=0.006) were independent risk factors for central nervous system relapse. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a low incidence of central nervous system relapse in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia following therapy with all-trans retinoic acid and anthracycline without specific central nervous system prophylaxis. Central nervous system relapse was significantly associated with high white blood cell counts and prior central nervous system hemorrhage, which emerged as independent prognostic factors.","['Montesinos, Pau', 'Diaz-Mediavilla, Joaquin', 'Deben, Guillermo', 'Prates, Virginia', 'Tormo, Mar', 'Rubio, Vicente', 'Perez, Inmaculada', 'Fernandez, Isolda', 'Viguria, Maricruz', 'Rayon, Chelo', 'Gonzalez, Jose', 'de la Serna, Javier', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Bergua, Juan M', 'Rivas, Concha', 'Gonzalez, Marcos', 'Gonzalez, Jose D', 'Negri, Silvia', 'Brunet, Salut', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Sanz, Miguel A']","['Montesinos P', 'Diaz-Mediavilla J', 'Deben G', 'Prates V', 'Tormo M', 'Rubio V', 'Perez I', 'Fernandez I', 'Viguria M', 'Rayon C', 'Gonzalez J', 'de la Serna J', 'Esteve J', 'Bergua JM', 'Rivas C', 'Gonzalez M', 'Gonzalez JD', 'Negri S', 'Brunet S', 'Lowenberg B', 'Sanz MA']","['Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Avda.

This has led to different reported frequencies of mutations and the finding of a heterogeneous pattern of individual mutations. DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared direct sequencing alone and in combination with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and two high-sensitivity allele-specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction approaches for analysis of BCR-ABL mutations in 200 blinded cDNA samples prior to and during second-line dasatinib or nilotinib therapy in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in whom imatinib treatment had failed. RESULTS: One hundred and fourteen mutations were detected by both direct sequencing alone or in combination with high performance liquid chromatography and 13 mutations were additionally detected by the combined technique. Eighty of 83 mutations (96%) within a selected panel of 11 key mutations were confirmed by both allele-specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction techniques and 62 mutations were identified in addition to those detected by combined liquid chromatography and direct sequencing, indicating the presence and a high prevalence of low-level mutations in this cohort of patients. Furthermore, 125 mutations were detected by only one allele-specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction technique. Pre-existing mutations were traceable 4.5 months longer and emerging clones were detectable 3.0 months earlier by allele-specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction than by direct sequencing together with liquid chromatography. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that denaturing high performance liquid chromatography combined with direct sequencing is a reliable screening technique for the detection of BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations. Allele-specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction further increases the number of detected mutations and indicates a high prevalence of mutations at a low level. The clinical impact of such low-level mutations remains uncertain and requires further investigation. Allele-specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction allows detection of defined mutations at a lower level than does denaturing high performance liquid chromatography combined with direct sequencing and may, therefore, provide clinical benefit by permitting early reconsideration of therapeutic strategies.","['Ernst, Thomas', 'Gruber, Franz X', 'Pelz-Ackermann, Oliver', 'Maier, Jacqueline', 'Pfirrmann, Markus', 'Muller, Martin C', 'Mikkola, Ingvild', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Lange, Thoralf']","['Ernst T', 'Gruber FX', 'Pelz-Ackermann O', 'Maier J', 'Pfirrmann M', 'Muller MC', 'Mikkola I', 'Porkka K', 'Niederwieser D', 'Hochhaus A', 'Lange T']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology/Hemosta seology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090716,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC2738714,2009/07/18 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/18 09:00'],"['2009/07/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.006981 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.006981 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Sep;94(9):1227-35. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.006981.

The cure of acute myeloid leukemia may depend on eradication of leukemic stem cells, the self-renewing component of leukemia. Whether natural killer cells can recognize and lyse leukemic stem cells is not known. To develop strategies that effectively target acute myeloid leukemia-leukemic stem cells, we investigated anti-leukemic effects of human alloreactive single KIR(+) natural killer cells. Natural killer effectors with KIR specificity mismatched with respect to HLA class I allotype of target cells effectively recognized acute myeloid leukemia-leukemic stem cells defined phenotypically as CD34(+)CD38(-), while healthy bone marrow-derived CD34(+)CD38(-) hematopoietic stem cells were spared, as demonstrated by cytotoxicity and hematopoietic colony-forming assays. The HDAC inhibitor valproic acid increased the activating NKG2D ligand-dependent lysis of acute myeloid leukemia-CD34(+)CD38(-) leukemic stem cells. These results show that alloreactive natural killer cells have the potential to detect and target leukemic stem cells, and thus to improve the treatment outcome in acute myeloid leukemia.","['Langenkamp, Ulrich', 'Siegler, Uwe', 'Jorger, Simon', 'Diermayr, Stefan', 'Gratwohl, Alois', 'Kalberer, Christian P', 'Wodnar-Filipowicz, Aleksandra']","['Langenkamp U', 'Siegler U', 'Jorger S', 'Diermayr S', 'Gratwohl A', 'Kalberer CP', 'Wodnar-Filipowicz A']","['Experimental Hematology, Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090716,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC2770970,2009/07/18 09:00,2010/01/09 06:00,['2009/07/18 09:00'],"['2009/07/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.005967 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.005967 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Nov;94(11):1590-4. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.005967.

We analyzed 4 cases of cycD2(+) mantle cell lymphoma with a translocation involving the CCND2 locus, and its differential diagnosis from 35 mature B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas based on immunohistochemistry, quantitative RT-PCR and FISH analysis. Bona fide cycD2(+) mantle cell lymphoma carried translocations involving the CCND2 gene, and IGH and IGK loci were identified as partners. As a result of this translocation, cycD2 mRNA was highly over-expressed when compared with normal lymphoid tissue and other B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, making this technique ideally suited to identify cycD2(+)mantle cell lymphoma.

In this study, we found that loss of Men1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts caused abrogation of the G1/S and intra-S checkpoints following ionizing radiation. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21, failed to be upregulated in the mutant although upstream checkpoint signaling remained intact. Menin localized to the p21 promoter in a DNA damage-dependent manner. The MLL histone methyltransferase, a positive transcriptional regulator, bound to the same region in the presence of menin but not in Men1(-/-) cells. Finally, p53 retained damage-responsive binding to the p21 promoter in the Men1 mutant. These data indicate that menin participates in the checkpoint response in a transcriptional capacity, upregulating the DNA damage-responsive target p21.","['Kottemann, Molly C', 'Bale, Allen E']","['Kottemann MC', 'Bale AE']","['Department of Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar St., SHM-I 321, New Haven, CT 06510, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090715,Netherlands,DNA Repair (Amst),DNA repair,101139138,PMC2745199,2009/07/18 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/18 09:00'],"['2009/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1568-7864(09)00160-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.dnarep.2009.06.001 [doi]']",ppublish,DNA Repair (Amst). 2009 Aug 6;8(8):944-52. doi: 10.1016/j.dnarep.2009.06.001.

Subsequently we focused on the mechanisms responsible for aberrant expression of LYL1 in comparison to TAL1. Quantitative genomic PCR indicated microdeletions upstream of both, TAL1 and LYL1, targeting STIL/SIL and TRMT1, respectively. Additionally, one LYL1-expressing cell line exhibited amplification of TRMT1. While deletion of STIL correlated with expression of the STIL-TAL1 fusion transcript, no TRMT-LYL1 fusion transcripts were detected in parallel with genomic rearrangements thereof. Sequence analysis of the LYL1 promoter region revealed potential binding sites for transcription factors HOXA10, LMO2 and NKX2-5. Overexpression analysis, reporter gene assays and chromatin immuno-precipitation confirmed their activating impact on LYL1 expression. In conclusion, we identified multiple mechanisms which activate LYL1 in leukemic cells, including structural genomic alterations, namely microdeletion or amplification, together with the involvement of prominent oncogenic transcription factors.","['Nagel, Stefan', 'Venturini, Letizia', 'Meyer, Corinna', 'Kaufmann, Maren', 'Scherr, Michaela', 'Drexler, Hans G', 'MacLeod, Roderick A F']","['Nagel S', 'Venturini L', 'Meyer C', 'Kaufmann M', 'Scherr M', 'Drexler HG', 'MacLeod RA']","['Dept of Human and Animal Cell Lines, DSMZ - German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Inhoffenstr 7B, 38124 Braunschweig, Germany. sna@dsmz.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090715,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,2009/07/18 09:00,2010/03/27 06:00,['2009/07/18 09:00'],"['2009/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/09 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00297-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.06.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Apr;34(4):521-8. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.06.020.

We refer to the involvement of inflammatory mediators in vincristine-induced neuropathic pain in this review. Several reports using rodents have shown that long-lasting neuropathic pain (mechanical allodynia) is caused by repeated systemic injection of vincristine. Vincristine damaged Schwann cells and DRG neurons in this model. Vincristine-induced macrophage infiltration in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and macrophage-derived IL-6 elicited mechanical allodynia. These findings proved that inhibition of IL-6 function prevented neuropathic pain caused by vincristine. In the central nervous system (CNS), activation of microglia and astrocytes in the spinal cord were demonstrated after long-term vincristine treatment. TNF-alpha was upregulated in activated microglia and astrocytes, and inhibition of TNF-alpha function attenuated neuropathic pain caused by vincristine. These results suggest that vincristine induces macrophage infiltration to the damaged PNS, and that macrophage-derived inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 elicits neuroinflammation. Signal transduction of pain from the PNS to the CNS activates microglia and astrocytes, and these activated glial cells release inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha. In the CNS, these inflammatory cytokines have an important role in the neuropathic pain caused by vincristine. Immune-modulating agents that prevent activation of immune cells and/or the inhibitory agents of inflammatory cytokines could prevent the neuropathic pain caused by vincristine. These agents could increase the tolerability of vincristine when used for the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma.","['Kiguchi, Norikazu', 'Maeda, Takehiko', 'Kobayashi, Yuka', 'Saika, Fumihiro', 'Kishioka, Shiroh']","['Kiguchi N', 'Maeda T', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Saika F', 'Kishioka S']","['Department of Pharmacology, Wakayama Medical University, 811-1 Kimiidera, Wakayama 641-0012, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Int Rev Neurobiol,International review of neurobiology,0374740,,2009/07/18 09:00,2009/09/11 06:00,['2009/07/18 09:00'],"['2009/07/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0074-7742(09)85014-9 [pii]', '10.1016/S0074-7742(09)85014-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Rev Neurobiol. 2009;85:179-90. doi: 10.1016/S0074-7742(09)85014-9.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Central Nervous System/*drug effects/*immunology', 'Inflammation Mediators/*physiology', 'Models, Biological', 'Neuralgia/chemically induced', 'Neurogenic Inflammation/*physiopathology', 'Pain/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Peripheral Nervous System/drug effects/immunology', 'Vincristine/*toxicity']",,,,,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study using patient records of adults (n=91) with chronic-phase CML treated at a single university medical centre in the Netherlands. Occurrence of grade III/IV haematological AEs, defined according to CTC-NCI guidelines criteria, was derived from the laboratory registration. Mean age at time of diagnosis was 48 years; 56% male. A healthcare perspective was adopted. Cost estimates are presented in 2006 euros. RESULTS: Average cost of an episode of anaemia was 1,572 euro, of thrombocytopenia 2,955 euro, and of neutropenia 1,152 euro. The mean cost of febrile neutropenia amounted to 2,462 euro. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment costs of AEs varied considerably. However, apart from the cost of anaemia, the results presented seem to be in line with information from the international literature. The key limitations of the study concern the relatively small cohort of patients at a single centre, the retrospective design and the various treatment regimens of CML during the follow-up.","['Bouwmans, Clazien', 'Janssen, Jeroen', 'Huijgens, Peter', 'Uyl-de Groot, Carin']","['Bouwmans C', 'Janssen J', 'Huijgens P', 'Uyl-de Groot C']","['Erasmus MC, Institute for Medical Technology Assessment, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. c.bouwmans-frijters@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Med Econ,Journal of medical economics,9892255,,2009/07/18 09:00,2010/03/04 06:00,['2009/07/18 09:00'],"['2009/07/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3111/13696990903149479 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Econ. 2009 Jun;12(2):164-9. doi: 10.3111/13696990903149479.,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Antifibrinolytic Agents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia/chemically induced/*economics/epidemiology', 'Anti-Infective Agents/adverse effects', 'Antifibrinolytic Agents/adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Medical Audit', 'Middle Aged', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*economics/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced/*economics/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Golden oyster mushroom, Pleurotus citrinopileatus , is a common mushroom in oriental countries for human consumption. We isolated a functional protein (PCP-3A) from the fresh fruiting body of this mushroom. The isolation procedure included ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B ion exchange chromatography, and Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration. Electrophoresis demonstrated that PCP-3A is a glycoprotein composed of 10 subunits, each approximately 45.0 kDa in size. In vitro cell study showed that PCP-3A at a concentration about 12.5 microg/mL inhibits the proliferation of human tumor cell line U937, in a time- dependent manner (24, 48, and 72 h). It failed to agglutinate rabbit and human erythrocytes, excluding its possibility from being a lectin. Flow cytometry revealed that it is capable of inhibiting the growth of U937 cells by way of S phase arrest and apoptotic induction. We suggest that PCP-3A is worth further investigating for antitumor use.","['Chen, Jian-Nan', 'Wang, Yuh-Tai', 'Wu, James Swi-Bea']","['Chen JN', 'Wang YT', 'Wu JS']","['Graduate Institute of Food Science and Technology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Agric Food Chem,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,0374755,,2009/07/18 09:00,2009/11/05 06:00,['2009/07/18 09:00'],"['2009/07/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/jf901284s [doi]'],ppublish,J Agric Food Chem. 2009 Aug 12;57(15):6706-11. doi: 10.1021/jf901284s.,"['0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Fruiting Bodies, Fungal/chemistry', 'Fungal Proteins/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Glycoproteins/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Hemagglutination/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Pleurotus/*chemistry', 'Rabbits']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to explore the prognostic impact of positive DAT at diagnosis in Chinese patients with CLL. In 123 Chinese patients with CLL, 34 (27.6%) patients presented with a positive DAT at diagnosis. However only 12 patients (9.8%) with a positive DAT developed autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHA). According to the correlation analysis, advanced Binet stage (p < 0.001), high level of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.003) and beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)-M) (p = 0.011), unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene status (p < 0.001), positive ZAP-70 (p = 0.012), and trisomy 12 cytogenetic aberration (p = 0.004) emerged as factors significantly related to the occurrence of DAT-positive. Patients with positive DAT had significantly shorter survival times than patients with negative DAT (p = 0.009). Five-year OS percentages of DAT-positivity and DAT-negative patients were 72.8% and 97.5%, respectively.

Whether low dose IM in combination with agents of distinct but related mechanisms could be one of the strategies to overcome these concerns warrants careful investigation. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We tested the therapeutic efficacies as well as adverse effects of low dose IM in combination with proteasome inhibitor, Bortezomib (BOR) or proteasome inhibitor I (PSI), in two CML murine models, and investigated possible mechanisms of action on CML cells. Our results demonstrated that low dose IM in combination with BOR exerted satisfactory efficacy in prolongation of life span and inhibition of tumor growth in mice, and did not cause cardiotoxicity or body weight loss. Consistently, BOR and PSI enhanced IM-induced inhibition of long-term clonogenic activity and short-term cell growth of CML stem/progenitor cells, and potentiated IM-caused inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis of BCR-ABL+ cells. IM/BOR and IM/PSI inhibited Bcl-2, increased cytoplasmic cytochrome C, and activated caspases. While exerting suppressive effects on BCR-ABL, E2F1, and beta-catenin, IM/BOR and IM/PSI inhibited proteasomal degradation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), leading to a re-activation of this important negative regulator of BCR-ABL. In addition, both combination therapties inhibited Bruton's tyrosine kinase via suppression of NFkappaB. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that combined use of tyrosine kinase inhibitor and proteasome inhibitor might be helpful for optimizing CML treatment.","['Hu, Zheng', 'Pan, Xiao-Fen', 'Wu, Fu-Qun', 'Ma, Li-Yuan', 'Liu, Da-Peng', 'Liu, Ying', 'Feng, Ting-Ting', 'Meng, Fan-Yi', 'Liu, Xiao-Li', 'Jiang, Qian-Li', 'Chen, Xiao-Qin', 'Liu, Jing-Lei', 'Liu, Ping', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Chen, Sai-Juan', 'Zhou, Guang-Biao']","['Hu Z', 'Pan XF', 'Wu FQ', 'Ma LY', 'Liu DP', 'Liu Y', 'Feng TT', 'Meng FY', 'Liu XL', 'Jiang QL', 'Chen XQ', 'Liu JL', 'Liu P', 'Chen Z', 'Chen SJ', 'Zhou GB']","['Laboratory of Molecular Target-Based Therapy for Cancer, Guangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090716,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC2705802,2009/07/17 09:00,2009/11/11 06:00,['2009/07/17 09:00'],"['2009/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0006257 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Jul 16;4(7):e6257. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0006257.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protease Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'RNA Interference']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This corresponds to a doubling of the therapeutic index with respect to illudin M. The monoester of illudin M with ferrocenoic acid was nine times less efficacious in the cancer cells, when compared with the diester.

The German CLL study group (GCLLSG) initiated a multicenter phase III trial for CLL patients older than 65 years comparing first-line therapy with fludarabine with chlorambucil. A total of 193 patients with a median age of 70 years were randomized to receive fludarabine (25 mg/m(2) for 5 days intravenously, every 28 days, for 6 courses) or chlorambucil (0.4 mg/kg body weight [BW] with an increase to 0.8 mg/kg, every 15 days, for 12 months). Fludarabine resulted in a significantly higher overall and complete remission rate (72% vs 51%, P = .003; 7% vs 0%, P = .011). Time to treatment failure was significantly shorter in the chlorambucil arm (11 vs 18 months; P = .004), but no difference in progression-free survival time was observed (19 months with fludarabine, 18 months with chlorambucil; P = .7). Moreover, fludarabine did not increase the overall survival time (46 months in the fludarabine vs 64 months in the chlorambucil arm; P = .15). Taken together, the results suggest that in elderly CLL patients the first-line therapy with fludarabine alone does not result in a major clinical benefit compared with chlorambucil.

Submitted cases highlighted important issues and difficulties in relation to the diagnosis and classification of MDS. Much of the discussion focused on the correlation, or lack of it, between morphologic examination and other diagnostic techniques, cytogenetics in particular. The cases included examples of isolated del(5q) chromosomal abnormality, including the ""classical"" 5q- syndrome and other myeloid neoplasms. Other cytogenetic abnormalities in MDSs and the role of cytogenetics in diagnosing MDSs were addressed. Particularly challenging is the correct identification of fibrotic subtypes of MDSs and their separation from subsets of acute myeloid leukemia with myelofibrosis such as acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis. The association and eventual relation of MDSs (hypoplastic in particular) with aplastic anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and other nonneoplastic disorders were illustrated. Novel cytogenetic and molecular genetic approaches are likely to revolutionize the classification of MDSs. However, it is unlikely that these new techniques will be capable, on their own, of adequately stratifying patients for treatment purposes. At least for the foreseeable future, the diagnosis of MDS requires integration of morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic features in the light of patient history and clinical manifestations.","['Orazi, Attilio', 'Czader, Magdalena B']","['Orazi A', 'Czader MB']","['New York Presbyterian Hospital, Weill Cornell Medical Center, 525 E 68th St, Starr Pavilion ST-702-B, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,2009/07/17 09:00,2009/08/22 09:00,['2009/07/17 09:00'],"['2009/07/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/22 09:00 [medline]']","['132/2/290 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCPRCXX4R0YHKWV [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2009 Aug;132(2):290-305. doi: 10.1309/AJCPRCXX4R0YHKWV.,,IM,"['Humans', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes']",,,,,79,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The borderline between MDS/MPNs and overt acute myeloid leukemias was also an issue, mainly related to the accurate and consistent delineation of blast equivalents such as promonocytes. Aside from juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, genetic features defining specific MDS/MPN subtypes have not been identified.

Although AML cells are characterized by accelerated proliferation and differentiation arrest, MDS cells hyperproliferate when immature but fail to differentiate later and die instead. In agreement with its roles in AML and in immature MDS cells, EVI1 was found to stimulate cell proliferation and inhibit differentiation in several experimental systems. In contrast, the variant protein MDS1/EVI1 caused the opposite effect in some of these assays. In the present study, we expressed EVI1 and MDS1/EVI1 in a tetracycline-regulable manner in the human myeloid cell line U937. Induction of either of these proteins caused cells to accumulate in the G(0)/G(1)-phase of the cell cycle and moderately increased the rate of spontaneous apoptosis. However, when EVI1- or MDS1/EVI1-expressing cells were induced to differentiate, they massively succumbed to apoptosis, as reflected by the accumulation of phosphatidylserine in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and increased rates of DNA fragmentation. In summary, these data show that inducible expression of EVI1 in U937 cells causes phenotypes that may be relevant for its role in MDS and provides a basis for further investigation of its contribution to this fatal disease.","['Konrad, Torsten A', 'Karger, Anna', 'Hackl, Hubert', 'Schwarzinger, Ilse', 'Herbacek, Irene', 'Wieser, Rotraud']","['Konrad TA', 'Karger A', 'Hackl H', 'Schwarzinger I', 'Herbacek I', 'Wieser R']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Medical University of Vienna, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090715,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,PMC2777892,2009/07/17 09:00,2009/10/21 06:00,['2009/07/17 09:00'],"['2009/07/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['jlb.0109042 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0109042 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2009 Oct;86(4):813-22. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0109042.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the present study, the influence of comorbidity on survival and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) evolution was analyzed retrospectively in 419 patients with de novo myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (observation period: 1985-2007). The median age was 71 years (range 24-91 years). Two different scoring systems, the hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation-specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI) and the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) were applied. RESULTS: The HCT-CI was found to be a significant prognostic factor for overall survival (OS, P < 0.05) as well as event-free survival (EFS, P < 0.05) in our patients, whereas the CCI was of prognostic significance for OS (P < 0.05), but not for EFS. For AML-free survival, neither the HCT-CI nor the CCI were of predictive value. A multivariate analysis including age, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, karyotype, number of cytopenias, French-American-British groups, and comorbidity was applied. Comorbidity was found to be an independent prognostic factor in patients with low- or int-1-risk MDS (P < 0.05) regarding OS and EFS. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our data show that comorbidity is an important risk factor for OS and EFS in patients with MDS.","['Sperr, W R', 'Wimazal, F', 'Kundi, M', 'Baumgartner, C', 'Nosslinger, T', 'Makrai, A', 'Stauder, R', 'Krieger, O', 'Pfeilstocker, M', 'Valent, P']","['Sperr WR', 'Wimazal F', 'Kundi M', 'Baumgartner C', 'Nosslinger T', 'Makrai A', 'Stauder R', 'Krieger O', 'Pfeilstocker M', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, A-1090 Vienna, Austria. wolfgang.r.sperr@meduniwien.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090715,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,2009/07/17 09:00,2010/02/25 06:00,['2009/07/17 09:00'],"['2009/07/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0923-7534(19)38229-8 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdp258 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2010 Jan;21(1):114-9. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdp258.

However, the molecules and mechanisms that regulate BMP/Smad signaling in hematopoiesis are largely unknown. Here, we show that the Integrator complex, an evolutionarily conserved group of proteins, functions in zebrafish hematopoiesis by modulating Smad/BMP signaling. The Integrator complex proteins are known to directly interact with RNA polymerase II to mediate 3' end processing of U1 and U2 snRNAs. We have identified several subunits of the Integrator complex in zebrafish. Antisense morpholino-mediated knockdown of the Integrator subunit 5 (Ints5) in zebrafish embryos affects U1 and U2 snRNA processing, leading to aberrant splicing of smad1 and smad5 RNA, and reduced expression of the hematopoietic genes stem cell leukemia (scl, also known as tal1) and gata1. Blood smears from ints5 morphant embryos show arrested red blood cell differentiation, similar to scl-deficient embryos. Interestingly, targeting other Integrator subunits also leads to defects in smad5 RNA splicing and arrested hematopoiesis, suggesting that the Ints proteins function as a complex to regulate the BMP pathway during hematopoiesis. Our work establishes a link between the RNA processing machinery and the downstream effectors of BMP signaling, and reveals a new group of proteins that regulates the switch from primitive hematopoietic stem cell identity and blood cell differentiation by modulating Smad function.","['Tao, Shijie', 'Cai, Yu', 'Sampath, Karuna']","['Tao S', 'Cai Y', 'Sampath K']","['Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory, 1 Research Link, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090715,England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,,2009/07/17 09:00,2009/11/05 06:00,['2009/07/17 09:00'],"['2009/07/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['dev.034959 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.034959 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2009 Aug;136(16):2757-65. doi: 10.1242/dev.034959.

In this study, we have identified a Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain in the core protein that is essential for its proapoptotic property. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that the core protein interacts specifically with the human myeloid cell factor 1 (Mcl-1), a prosurvival member of the Bcl-2 family, but not with other prosurvival members (Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-w). Moreover, the overexpression of Mcl-1 protects against core-induced apoptosis. By using peptide mimetics, core was found to release cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria when complemented with Bad. Thus, core is a bona fide BH3-only protein having properties similar to those of Noxa, a BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family that binds preferentially to Mcl-1. There are three critical hydrophobic residues in the BH3 domain of the core protein, and they are essential for the proapoptotic property of the core protein. Furthermore, the genotype 1b core protein is more effective than the genotype 2a core protein in inducing apoptosis due to a single-amino-acid difference at one of these hydrophobic residues (residue 119). Replacing this residue in the J6/JFH-1 infectious clone (genotype 2a) with the corresponding amino acid in the genotype 1b core protein produced a mutant virus, J6/JFH-1(V119L), which induced significantly higher levels of apoptosis in the infected cells than the parental J6/JFH-1 virus. Furthermore, the core protein of J6/JFH-1(V119L), but not that of J6/JFH-1, interacted with Mcl-1 in virus-infected cells. Taken together, the core protein is a novel BH3-only viral homologue that contributes to the induction of apoptosis during HCV infection.","['Mohd-Ismail, Nur Khairiah', 'Deng, Lin', 'Sukumaran, Sunil Kumar', 'Yu, Victor C', 'Hotta, Hak', 'Tan, Yee-Joo']","['Mohd-Ismail NK', 'Deng L', 'Sukumaran SK', 'Yu VC', 'Hotta H', 'Tan YJ']","['Collaborative Anti-Viral Research Group, Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090715,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC2748021,2009/07/17 09:00,2009/10/08 06:00,['2009/07/17 09:00'],"['2009/07/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00509-09 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00509-09 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2009 Oct;83(19):9993-10006. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00509-09.

The telomeric amplification protocol (TRAP) assay and RT-PCR are customarily used to detect telomerase activity and the expression of the associated genes in cells. However, these methods do not provide any information about telomerase activation at an individual cell level. To analyze cells separately, those cells have to be isolated by sometimes complicated method. The immunohistochemical detection of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is useful to detect telomerase positive cells in a background of non-cancerous cells. A method has been developed for the detection of intranuclear hTERT protein, in a subpopulation of hematopoietic cells, using concurrent staining of a cell surface antigen and multicolor flow cytometry. Only mouse monoclonal anti-hTERT antibody demonstrated the specific positivity in immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescent flow cytometry. Human leukemia and myeloma cell lines showed 100% positivity, whereas normal neutrophils showed 0% positivity. hTERT expression was analyzed in hematopoietic precursor cells of bone marrow samples using concurrent staining of surface CD34 antigen and intracellular hTERT protein and multi-parameter flow cytometry.

In addition to a > 9-fold difference between lines for the selected trait, large behavioural and metabolic differences between the two lines evolved during the course of the selection. We recently compared gene expression in brain tissue from birds representing these lines using a global cDNA array analysis and the results showed multiple but small expression differences in protein coding genes. The main differentially expressed transcripts were endogenous retroviral sequences identified as avian leucosis virus subgroup-E (ALVE). RESULTS: In this work we confirm the differential ALVE expression and analysed expression and number of proviral integrations in the two parental lines as well as in F9 individuals from an advanced intercross of the lines. Correlation analysis between expression, proviral integrations and body weight showed that high ALVE levels in the LWS line were inherited and that more ALVE integrations were detected in LWS than HWS birds. CONCLUSION: We conclude that only a few of the integrations contribute to the high expression levels seen in the LWS line and that high ALVE expression was significantly correlated with lower body weights for the females but not males. The conserved correlation between high expression and low body weight in females after 9 generations of intercrosses, indicated that ALVE loci conferring high expression directly affects growth or are very closely linked to loci regulating growth.","['Ka, Sojeong', 'Kerje, Susanne', 'Bornold, Lina', 'Liljegren, Ulrika', 'Siegel, Paul B', 'Andersson, Leif', 'Hallbook, Finn']","['Ka S', 'Kerje S', 'Bornold L', 'Liljegren U', 'Siegel PB', 'Andersson L', 'Hallbook F']","['Department of Neuroscience, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. sojeong.ka@neuro.uu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090715,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,PMC2717048,2009/07/17 09:00,2009/09/09 06:00,['2009/07/17 09:00'],"['2009/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-6-68 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-6-68 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2009 Jul 15;6:68. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-6-68.,,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/genetics/*physiology', '*Body Weight', 'Chickens/*growth & development/virology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Male', 'Proviruses/genetics/*physiology', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Sex Factors', '*Virus Integration']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluated the impact of various pre-transplant variables, including disease duration, intensity of the conditioning regimen, type of donor and year of transplantation on outcome. The study population consisted of 374 patients; 244 were transplanted from human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-identical siblings and 130 patients from matched unrelated donors. The median age was 39 years. One hundred and two patients were transplanted after reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). The overall 4-year survival was 52%. The 4-year survival of patients transplanted with HLA-identical sibling donors and matched unrelated donors was 52% and 50%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed an improved survival (P = 0.05) and a lower NRM (P = 0.02) when the transplantation was performed in recent years. Increasing age, and disease duration of >12 months were associated with inferior survival. RIC resulted in a similar survival despite an increased relapse risk (P = 0.02). This improved outcome permits alloSCT in patients older than 50 years of age, even with the use of matched unrelated donors.

This review highlights pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data for the use of cladribine. It also discusses existing and new mechanisms that may contribute to its unique clinical activity. Emerging data show that in addition to its known purine nucleoside analogue activity, cladribine possesses epigenetic properties, inhibiting S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and DNA methylation.

Patients reaching molecular remission had lower incidence of relapse and better overall survival (OS) than those not achieving molecular remission (p = 0.008 and 0.044, respectively). The overall incidence of C-KIT mutations was 33.3%, FLT3/internal tandem duplication (ITD) 6.6%, FLT3(D835) 10.0% and JAK2(V617F) mutations 3.3%. C-KIT mutations did not predict for clinical/molecular relapse (p = 0.33). OS of patients with C-KIT mutations was identical to patients without them when all patients with CBF-AML were analyzed together (p = 0.58). When AML1/ETO-positive patients were evaluated separately, OS in C-KIT-mutated patients was slightly inferior to unmutated ones (p = 0.14). Patients with CBF-AML with a mutated C-KIT gene were also more prone to extramedullary disease (p = 0.08). Of six patients harboring various FLT3(D835) mutations, four (66.7%) relapsed, whereas among 43 cases without these mutations, 16 relapses (37%) were observed (p = 0.08). Our results on minimal residual disease, C-KIT, and FLT3/ITDs are in line with previous studies. Surprisingly, a possible role for FLT3(D835) mutations was noted in addition. These results need validation in even larger patient cohorts than ours. For routine clinical practice, it may be meaningful to screen for C-KIT mutations in AML1/ETO-positive patients, as well as for FLT3(D835) mutations in CBF-AML.","['Markova, Jana', 'Markova, Jana', 'Trnkova, Zuzana', 'Michkova, Petra', 'Maaloufova, Jacqueline', 'Stary, Jan', 'Cetkovsky, Petr', 'Schwarz, Jiri']","['Markova J', 'Markova J', 'Trnkova Z', 'Michkova P', 'Maaloufova J', 'Stary J', 'Cetkovsky P', 'Schwarz J']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague 2, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2009/07/16 09:00,2011/02/22 06:00,['2009/07/16 09:00'],"['2009/07/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['913168299 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190903085951 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Sep;50(9):1448-60. doi: 10.1080/10428190903085951.,"['0 (Core Binding Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factors/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Mutation/physiology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics/physiology', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/physiology']",,,,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Sep;50(9):1397-8.

It indicated that the Tb(2)Tf complex can be transported into human leukemia K562 cells via a process mediated by transferrin (Tf) receptors as an intact entity and with no obvious cellular toxicity. The supporting evidence includes the following. First, the transport kinetic behavior of Tb was compared with that of the Tf moiety. The Tb was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and Tf was determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis. The kinetic synchronization of internalization of both Tb and Tf into human leukemia K562 cells demonstrated the Tb(2)Tf complex was transported into cells as a whole. Second, using confocal laser scanning microscopy, we observed the localization of Tb(2)Tf in the cell. This showed that the internalized Tb(2)Tf was mostly situated in the same perinuclear region as diferric transferrin (Fe(2)Tf). In addition, pretreatment with pronase largely abolished the transport process of Tb(2)Tf. The relative fluorescence intensities representing the uptake of Tf into the cells decreased to about 16% and the cytosolic Tb content decreased to almost the same percentage as for Tf. Furthermore, the addition of Fe(2)Tf can effectively inhibit transport of Tb(2)Tf into K562 cells. Third, no significant decrease of cell viability was observed in the presence of Tb(2)Tf even for 24 or 48 h by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Moreover, prospects for the use of Tb(2)Tf as a multi-photon-excited microscopy probe in a living system are discussed.","['Yuan, Lan', 'Du, Ping', 'Wang, Kui', 'Yang, Xiao-Gai']","['Yuan L', 'Du P', 'Wang K', 'Yang XG']","[""Peking University Medical and Health Analysis Center, Peking University Health Science Center, 100191 Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090715,Germany,J Biol Inorg Chem,Journal of biological inorganic chemistry : JBIC : a publication of the Society of Biological Inorganic Chemistry,9616326,,2009/07/16 09:00,2010/01/06 06:00,['2009/07/16 09:00'],"['2009/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00775-009-0567-8 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biol Inorg Chem. 2009 Nov;14(8):1243-51. doi: 10.1007/s00775-009-0567-8.

Most LIFR mutations are nonsense mutations, thus prompting us to investigate the impact of aminoglycosides on the readthrough of premature termination codons (PTCs). Culturing skin fibroblasts from three SWS patients and controls for 48 h in the presence of gentamycin (200-500 microg/ml) partially restored the JAK-STAT3 pathway when stimulated by LIF. Consistently, quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that gentamycin stabilized LIFR mRNAs carrying UGA premature termination codons.

Herein, we demonstrate that the complementary strand of the HTLV-2 genome also encodes a protein that we named APH-2 for ""antisense protein of HTLV-2."" APH-2 mRNA is spliced, polyadenylated, and initiates in the 3'-long terminal repeat at different positions.

All patients were treated on 3 German-Austrian AML Study Group protocols. Thirty-four of the 241 patients had more than 1 ITD, leading to a total of 282 ITDs; the median ITD length was 48 nucleotides (range, 15-180 nucleotides). ITD integration sites were categorized according to functional regions of the FLT3 receptor: juxtamembrane domain (JMD), n = 148; JMD hinge region, n = 48; beta1-sheet of the tyrosine kinase domain-1 (TKD1), n = 73; remaining TKD1 region, n = 13. ITD length was strongly correlated with functional regions (P < .001). In multivariable analyses, ITD integration site in the beta1-sheet was identified as an unfavorable prognostic factor for achievement of a complete remission (odds ratio, 0.22; P = .01), relapse-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.86; P < .001), and overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.59; P = .008).

CD34(+) cells were isolated by immunoselection and were analyzed by global gene and microRNA (miR) expression microarrays. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the gene expression data separated the CD34(+) cells into 3 groups based on mobilization regimen.

Prior to this stage, germ cells proliferate, enter meiosis, and associate with somatic cells. Growth and survival factors implicated in these processes include activin A (INHBA), the neurotrophins BDNF and NT4 (NTF5), and MCL1. The prostaglandins have pleiotrophic roles in reproduction, notably in ovulation and implantation, but there are no data regarding roles for prostaglandins in human fetal ovarian development. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate a possible role for prostaglandin (PG) E(2) in human fetal ovary development. DESIGN: In vitro analysis of ovarian development between 8 and 20 wk gestation was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The expression patterns of PG synthesis enzymes and the PGE(2) receptors EP2 and EP4 in the ovary were assessed, and downstream effects of PGE(2) on gene expression were analyzed. RESULTS: Ovarian germ cells express the PG synthetic enzymes COX2 and PTGES as well as the EP2 and EP4 receptors, whereas COX1 is expressed by ovarian somatic cells. Treatment in vitro with PGE(2) increased the expression of BDNF mRNA 1.7 +/- 0.16-fold (P = 0.004); INHBA mRNA, 2.1 +/- 0.51-fold (P = 0.04); and MCL1 mRNA, 1.15 +/- 0.06-fold (P = 0.04), but not that of OCT4, DAZL, VASA, NTF5, or SMAD3. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate novel roles for PGE(2) in the regulation of germ cell development in the human ovary and show that these effects may be mediated by the regulation of factors including BDNF, activin A, and MCL1.","['Bayne, Rosemary A L', 'Eddie, Sharon L', 'Collins, Craig S', 'Childs, Andrew J', 'Jabbour, Henry N', 'Anderson, Richard A']","['Bayne RA', 'Eddie SL', 'Collins CS', 'Childs AJ', 'Jabbour HN', 'Anderson RA']","[""Medical Research Council Human Reproductive Sciences Unit, University of Edinburgh Centre for Reproductive Biology, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, United Kingdom. r.bayne@hrsu.mrc.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090714,United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,,2009/07/16 09:00,2009/10/21 06:00,['2009/07/16 09:00'],"['2009/07/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['jc.2009-0755 [pii]', '10.1210/jc.2009-0755 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2009 Oct;94(10):4053-60. doi: 10.1210/jc.2009-0755.

CD8(+) T-cell responses to MHC class I-restricted tumor epitopes, not just allogeneic antigens, may help mediate antileukemia effects after HSCT, but the specificity and function of such cells are not completely understood. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We examined the diversity, phenotype, and functional potential of leukemia-associated antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells in patients with myeloid leukemia following allogeneic HSCT. Screening for antigen-specific T cells was accomplished with a peptide/MHC tetramer library. RESULTS: Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia in remission following HSCT exhibited significant numbers of peripheral blood CD8(+) T cells that recognized varying combinations of epitopes derived from leukemia-associated antigens. However, these cells failed to proliferate, release cytokines, or degranulate in response to antigen-specific stimuli. As early as 2 months after HSCT, CD8(+) T cells from patients were predominantly CD28(-) CD57(+) and had relatively short telomeres, consistent with cellular senescence. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating leukemia-specific CD8(+) T cells are prominent in myeloid leukemia patients after HSCT, but such cells are largely functionally unresponsive, most likely due to replicative senescence. These findings carry important implications for the understanding of the graft-versus-leukemia effect and for the rational design of immunotherapeutic strategies for patients with myeloid leukemias.","['Beatty, Gregory L', 'Smith, Jasmine S', 'Reshef, Ran', 'Patel, Kunal P', 'Colligon, Theresa A', 'Vance, Barbara A', 'Frey, Noelle V', 'Johnson, F Brad', 'Porter, David L', 'Vonderheide, Robert H']","['Beatty GL', 'Smith JS', 'Reshef R', 'Patel KP', 'Colligon TA', 'Vance BA', 'Frey NV', 'Johnson FB', 'Porter DL', 'Vonderheide RH']","['Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Abramson Cancer Center, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090714,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,PMC2722844,2009/07/16 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/16 09:00'],"['2009/07/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-08-3332 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-3332 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Aug 1;15(15):4944-53. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-3332.

When karyotyping leukemia cells, gene amplification is generally seen as double-minute (dmin) chromosomes and homogeneously staining regions (hsr). One of the more commonly amplified regions is MYC at 8q24.21, but amplification of MLL at 11q23 and regions on 9p, 19q, and elsewhere on 11q have been reported. Increased copy number of these genes has been associated with poor prognosis. Over an 11-year period, we identified 31 cases of possible gene amplification, 27 of which had enough sample material for further investigations. A total of 17 cases had dmin only, 13 cases had hsr only, and 1 case had both dmin and hsr in the karyotype. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis identified amplification of MYC in 12 cases, all on dmin, and amplification of MLL in eight cases, all on hsr. Regions other than MYC and MLL were amplified in eight cases and, using multicolor FISH and multicolor banding, we identified a number of novel regions of amplification: 13q11 approximately q12.1, 15q26.1 approximately q26.3, and 17q12.

Genome-wide studies using microarray chips to identify copy number changes in human cancer are becoming more common. In this pilot study, 45 pediatric leukemia samples were analyzed for gene copy aberrations using novel molecular inversion probe (MIP) technology. Acute leukemia subtypes included precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n=23), precursor T-cell ALL (n=6), and acute myeloid leukemia (n=14). The MIP analysis identified 69 regions of recurring copy number changes, of which 41 have not been identified with other DNA microarray platforms. Copy number gains and losses were validated in 98% of clinical karyotypes and 100% of fluorescence in situ hybridization studies available. We report unique patterns of copy number loss in samples with 9p21.3 (CDKN2A) deletion in the precursor B-cell ALL patients, compared with the precursor T-cell ALL patients. MIPs represent an attractive technology for identifying novel copy number aberrations, validating previously reported copy number changes, and translating molecular findings into clinically relevant targets for further investigation.","['Schiffman, Joshua D', 'Wang, Yuker', 'McPherson, Lisa A', 'Welch, Katrina', 'Zhang, Nancy', 'Davis, Ronald', 'Lacayo, Norman J', 'Dahl, Gary V', 'Faham, Malek', 'Ford, James M', 'Ji, Hanlee P']","['Schiffman JD', 'Wang Y', 'McPherson LA', 'Welch K', 'Zhang N', 'Davis R', 'Lacayo NJ', 'Dahl GV', 'Faham M', 'Ford JM', 'Ji HP']","['Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Oncological Sciences, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, 2000 Circle of Hope, Room 4343, Salt Lake City, UT 84112.

The viral transactivator, Tax, is thought to play an important role during the initial stages of CD4+ T-cell immortalization by HTLV-1. Tax has been shown to activate transcription through CREB/ATF and NF-KB, and to alter numerous signaling pathways. These pleiotropic effects of Tax modify the expression of a wide array of cellular genes. Another viral protein encoded by HTLV-I, p30, has been shown to affect virus replication at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Little is currently known regarding the effect of p30 on the expression and nuclear export of cellular host mRNA transcripts. Identification of these RNA may reveal new targets and increase our understanding of HTLV-I pathogenesis. In this study, using primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we report a genome wide analysis of human genes transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally regulated by the HTLV-I protein p30. RESULTS: Using microarray analysis, we analyzed total and cytoplasmic cellular mRNA transcript levels isolated from PBMCs to assess the effect of p30 on cellular RNA transcript expression and their nuclear export. We report p30-dependent transcription resulting in the 2.5 fold up-regulation of 15 genes and the down-regulation of 65 human genes. We further tested nuclear export of cellular mRNA and found that p30 expression also resulted in a 2.5 fold post-transcriptional down-regulation of 90 genes and the up-regulation of 33 genes. CONCLUSION: Overall, our study describes that expression of the HTLV-I protein p30 both positively and negatively alters the expression of cellular transcripts. Our study identifies for the first time the cellular genes for which nuclear export is affected by p30. These results suggest that p30 may possess a more global function with respect to mRNA transcription and the nuclear shuttling of cellular mRNA transcripts. In addition, these alterations in gene expression may play a role in cell transformation and the onset of leukemia.","['Taylor, John M', 'Ghorbel, Sofiane', 'Nicot, Christophe']","['Taylor JM', 'Ghorbel S', 'Nicot C']","['Center for Viral Oncology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas 66160, USA. jtaylor2@kumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090714,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,PMC2723137,2009/07/16 09:00,2009/08/18 09:00,['2009/07/16 09:00'],"['2009/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-10-311 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-10-311 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2009 Jul 14;10:311. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-10-311.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Line', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', '*RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Up-Regulation', 'Viral Core Proteins/*metabolism']",,,"['P20 RR016475/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI058944/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In AML cell lines and patient material, RIZ1 expression is reduced relative to normal bone marrow. In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), blastic transformation is associated with loss of heterozygosity in the region where RIZ1 is located. RIZ1 is a PR domain methyltransferase that methylates histone H3 lysine 9, a modification important for transcriptional repression. In CML blast crisis cell lines RIZ1 represses insulin-like growth factor-1 expression and autocrine signaling. Together these observations suggest that RIZ1 may have a role in the chronic phase to blast crisis transition in CML. RESULTS: In CML patient material, we observed that RIZ1 expression was decreased during progression from chronic phase to blast crisis. RIZ1 was expressed in mature myeloid and CD34+ cells demonstrating that decreased RIZ1 expression in blast crisis is not due to an increased immature cell population. Expression of RIZ1 CML blast crisis cell lines decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis, and enhanced differentiation. CONCLUSION: RIZ1 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene whose expression is decreased in blast crisis. Loss of RIZ1 activity results in decreased apoptosis and differentiation and enhanced proliferation. Together these results suggest that loss of RIZ1 expression will lead to an increase in myeloid blast cell population resulting in CML progression.","['Lakshmikuttyamma, Ashakumary', 'Takahashi, Naoto', 'Pastural, Elodie', 'Torlakovic, Emina', 'Amin, Hesham M', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Voralia, Michael', 'Czader, Magdalena', 'DeCoteau, John F', 'Geyer, C Ronald']","['Lakshmikuttyamma A', 'Takahashi N', 'Pastural E', 'Torlakovic E', 'Amin HM', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Voralia M', 'Czader M', 'DeCoteau JF', 'Geyer CR']","['Cancer Stem Cell Research Group, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada. ashakum@htmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090714,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,PMC2719666,2009/07/16 09:00,2010/06/16 06:00,['2009/07/16 09:00'],"['2009/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-2-28 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-2-28 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2009 Jul 14;2:28. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-2-28.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (PRDM2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/physiology', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor/physiology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transfection']",,,['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quinol peroxidase is essential for the secretion of leukotoxin (LtxA), which destroys leukocytes and erythrocytes in humans and is one of the major virulence factors of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, which is associated with localized aggressive periodontitis. In the present study, we aimed to find a highly potent QPO inhibitor to attenuate the virulence of A. actinomycetemcomitans. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For screening of QPO inhibitors, QPO activity was measured kinetically by SpectraMax Plus with 96-well UV plates. Three hundred compounds in the Kitasato Institute for Life Sciences Chemical Library were screened. Secretion of LtxA in the culture supernatant was examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cytotoxicity against human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60) cells from the culture supernatant was measured by Trypan Blue exclusion test. RESULTS: The present study characterized ascofuranone as a highly potent inhibitor of QPO (K(i) = 9.557 +/- 0.865 nm). Ascofuranone inhibited secretion of LtxA by A. actinomycetemcomitans in a dose-dependent manner, making A. actinomycetemcomitans less pathogenic to HL-60 cells. CONCLUSION: Quinol peroxidase inhibitors are promising candidates as alternative drugs for the treatment and prevention of the onset of localized aggressive periodontitis. Using ascofuranone as a seed compound, further study of QPO inhibitors could provide novel chemotherapeutic strategies for controlling localized aggressive periodontitis.","['Takashima, E', 'Yamada, H', 'Yajima, A', 'Shiomi, K', 'Omura, S', 'Kiyoshi, K']","['Takashima E', 'Yamada H', 'Yajima A', 'Shiomi K', 'Omura S', 'Kiyoshi K']","['Department of Microbiology, School of Life Dentistry at Tokyo, The Nippon Dental University, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan. eizo.takashima@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090708,United States,J Periodontal Res,Journal of periodontal research,0055107,,2009/07/16 09:00,2010/08/19 06:00,['2009/07/16 09:00'],"['2009/07/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['JRE1211 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0765.2009.01211.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Periodontal Res. 2010 Feb;45(1):123-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0765.2009.01211.x.

Recently, BCR/ABL has been shown to activate survivin, an important regulator of cell growth and survival, but the precise molecular mechanisms behind its expression and consequences thereof in CML cells remain unclear. Here, we reported that BCR/ABL promotes survivin expression and its cytoplasmic accumulation. The increase of survivin was largely controlled at the transcriptional level through a mechanism mediated by JAK2/PI3K signal pathways that activated c-Myc, leading to transactivation of survivin promoter. Dynamic down-regulation of survivin was a key event involved in imatinib-induced cell death while forced expression of survivin partially counteracted imatinib's effect on cell survival. Additionally, shRNA-mediated silencing of survivin or c-Myc eradicated colony formation of K562 cells in semi-solid culture system, implying an essential role for this transcriptional network in BCR/ABL-mediated cell transformation and survival. Finally, interruption of c-Myc activity by 10058-F4 exerted an anti-leukaemia effect with a synergistic interaction with imatinib and overcame the anti-apoptosis rescued by IL-3 supplement. In conclusion, we have identified JAK2/PI3K-mediated and c-Myc-dependent transactivation of survivin as a novel pathway in the transcriptional network orchestrated by BCR/ABL. These results suggest that the interference with this circuitry might be a potential utility for CML treatment.","['Fang, Zhi Hong', 'Dong, Chun Lan', 'Chen, Zhong', 'Zhou, Bin', 'Liu, Na', 'Lan, Hai Feng', 'Liang, Lu', 'Liao, Wen Bin', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Han, Zhong Chao']","['Fang ZH', 'Dong CL', 'Chen Z', 'Zhou B', 'Liu N', 'Lan HF', 'Liang L', 'Liao WB', 'Zhang L', 'Han ZC']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', ""Cardiology Department, Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,PMC6512385,2009/07/16 09:00,2010/07/20 06:00,['2009/07/16 09:00'],"['2009/07/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00549.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2009 Aug;13(8B):2039-2052. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00549.x.,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Survivin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survivin', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is shown that the transients can be resolved and characterized individually at a peak frequency of 1100 particles per second. Design considerations and optimization data are presented. The figures of merit of the instrument are measured under standard inductively coupled plasma (ICP) operating conditions (<3% cerium oxide ratio). At mass resolution (full width at half-maximum) M/DeltaM > 900 for m/z = 159, the sensitivity with a standard sample introduction system of >1.4 x 10(8) ion counts per second per mg L(-1) of Tb and an abundance sensitivity of (6 x 10(-4))-(1.4 x 10(-3)) (trailing and leading masses, respectively) are shown. The mass range (m/z = 125-215) and abundance sensitivity are sufficient for elemental immunoassay with up to 60 distinct available elemental tags. When <15 elemental tags are used, a higher sensitivity mode at lower resolution (M/DeltaM > 500) can be used, which provides >2.4 x 10(8) cps per mg L(-1) of Tb, at (1.5 x 10(-3))-(5.0 x 10(-3)) abundance sensitivity. The real-time simultaneous detection of multiple isotopes from individual 1.8 microm polystyrene beads labeled with lanthanides is shown. A real time single cell 20 antigen expression assay of model cell lines and leukemia patient samples immuno-labeled with lanthanide-tagged antibodies is presented.","['Bandura, Dmitry R', 'Baranov, Vladimir I', 'Ornatsky, Olga I', 'Antonov, Alexei', 'Kinach, Robert', 'Lou, Xudong', 'Pavlov, Serguei', 'Vorobiev, Sergey', 'Dick, John E', 'Tanner, Scott D']","['Bandura DR', 'Baranov VI', 'Ornatsky OI', 'Antonov A', 'Kinach R', 'Lou X', 'Pavlov S', 'Vorobiev S', 'Dick JE', 'Tanner SD']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, 80 St. George Street, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3H6, Canada.

We find that LIF(-/-) mice have a pronounced myelination defect in optic nerve at postnatal day 10. Myelin basic protein (MBP)- and proteolipid protein (PLP)-positive myelin was evident throughout the optic nerve in the wild-type mice, but staining was present only at the chiasmal region in LIF(-/-) mice of the same age. Further experiments suggest that the myelination defect was a consequence of a delay in maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) population. The number of Olig2-positive cells was dramatically decreased in optic nerve of LIF(-/-) mice, and the distribution of Olig2-positive cells was restricted to the chiasmal region of the nerve in a steep gradient toward the retina. Gene expression profiling and cell culture experiments revealed that OPCs from P10 optic nerve of LIF(-/-) mice remained in a highly proliferative immature stage compared with littermate controls. Interestingly, by postnatal day 14, MBP immunostaining in the LIF(-/-) optic nerve was comparable to that of LIF(+/+) mice. These results suggest that, during normal development of mouse optic nerve, there is a defined developmental time window when LIF is required for correct myelination. Myelination seems to recover by postnatal day 14, so LIF is not necessary for the completion of myelination during postnatal development.","['Ishibashi, Tomoko', 'Lee, Philip R', 'Baba, Hiroko', 'Fields, R Douglas']","['Ishibashi T', 'Lee PR', 'Baba H', 'Fields RD']","['Nervous System Development and Plasticity Section, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,PMC2782399,2009/07/15 09:00,2010/02/02 06:00,['2009/07/15 09:00'],"['2009/07/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jnr.22173 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 2009 Nov 15;87(15):3343-55. doi: 10.1002/jnr.22173.,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Myelin Basic Protein)', '0 (Myelin Proteolipid Protein)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Olig2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2)']",IM,"['Aging/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myelin Basic Protein/metabolism', 'Myelin Proteolipid Protein/metabolism', 'Myelin Sheath/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Nerve Fibers, Myelinated/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2', 'Oligodendroglia/cytology/*metabolism', 'Optic Nerve/cytology/*growth & development/*metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",,,['Z01 HD000713-13/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS147827'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of intravenous monotherapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics in patients at high risk for complications is an appropriate alternative. However, few data are available for pediatric patients. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of cefepime (CFP) monotherapy with ceftriaxone plus amikacin (CFT+AK) in children and adolescents with febrile neutropenia (FN). METHODS: A prospective randomized open study of patients with lymphoma or leukemia who had fever and neutropenia during chemotherapy was conducted. Patients were randomized to receive CFP or CFT+AK. The randomization was based on number lists. RESULTS: Fifty seven patients with 125 episodes of fever and neutropenia were evaluated (CFP, 62 episodes; CFT+AK, 63 episodes). The mean neutrophil count at admission to hospital was 118.6 cells/mm(3) for patients in the CFP group and 107 cells/mm(3) for patients in the CFT+AK group. The mean duration of neutropenia was 9 days for the CFP group and 8 days for the CFT+AK group. Analysis of only the first episodes for each patient showed that CFP treatment was successful for 65.5% of episodes and CFT+AK was successful for 64.3% of episodes. The overall rates of success with modification were 90% for the CFP group and 89% for the CFT+AK group. No major treatment-emergent toxicity was reported. CONCLUSION: Monotherapy with CFP seems to be as effective and safe as CFT+AK for initial empirical therapy in children and adolescents with FN.","['Pereira, Carlos Alberto Pires', 'Petrilli, Antonio Sergio', 'Carlesse, Fabianne Altruda', 'Luisi, Flavio Augusto Vercillo', 'da Silva, Katia Veronica Torres Barros', 'de Martino Lee, Maria Lucia']","['Pereira CA', 'Petrilli AS', 'Carlesse FA', 'Luisi FA', 'da Silva KV', 'de Martino Lee ML']","['Instituto de Oncologia Pediatrica, Grupo de Apoio a Crianca com Cancer, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,England,J Microbiol Immunol Infect,"Journal of microbiology, immunology, and infection = Wei mian yu gan ran za zhi",100956211,,2009/07/15 09:00,2009/10/09 06:00,['2009/07/15 09:00'],"['2009/07/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Microbiol Immunol Infect. 2009 Apr;42(2):141-7.,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Cephalosporins)', '75J73V1629 (Ceftriaxone)', '807PW4VQE3 (Cefepime)', '84319SGC3C (Amikacin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Amikacin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/*therapy', 'Cefepime', 'Ceftriaxone/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cephalosporins/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The involvement of p73 in the regulation of EGFR has not been reported. Here, a strong correlation between EGFR overexpression and increased levels of the oncogenic DeltaNp73 isoform in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines was observed. Ectopic expression of TAp73, particularly TAp73beta, resulted in suppression of the EGFR promoter, significant downregulation of EGFR protein and efficient induction of cell death in all six EGFR-overexpressing HNSCC cell lines. EGFR overexpression from a heterologous LTR promoter protected lung cancer cells from TAp73beta-induced EGFR suppression and apoptosis. Expression of TAp73beta efficiently induced promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein expression and PML knockdown by shRNA attenuated the downregulation of EGFR and induction of apoptosis by p73 in HNSCC cells. Furthermore, PML was found to be important for E1A-induced suppression of EGFR and subsequent killing of HNSCC cells. Our data therefore suggest a novel pathway involving PML and p73 in the regulation of EGFR expression.","['Klanrit, P', 'Taebunpakul, P', 'Flinterman, M B', 'Odell, E W', 'Riaz, M A', 'Melino, G', 'Salomoni, P', 'Mymryk, J S', 'Gaken, J', 'Farzaneh, F', 'Tavassoli, M']","['Klanrit P', 'Taebunpakul P', 'Flinterman MB', 'Odell EW', 'Riaz MA', 'Melino G', 'Salomoni P', 'Mymryk JS', 'Gaken J', 'Farzaneh F', 'Tavassoli M']","[""Head and Neck Oncology Group, King's College London Dental Institute, Guy's Hospital Campus, London SE1 9RT, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090713,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,PMC2882231,2009/07/15 09:00,2009/10/15 06:00,['2009/07/15 09:00'],"['2009/07/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2009191 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.191 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2009 Oct 1;28(39):3499-512. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.191.

Isolated del(5q)/5q- MDS patients have a more favorable prognosis than those with additional karyotypic defects, who tend to develop myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and acute myeloid leukemia. The frequency of unbalanced chromosome 5 deletions has led to the idea that 5q harbors one or more tumor-suppressor genes that have fundamental roles in the growth control of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSCs/HPCs). Cytogenetic mapping of commonly deleted regions (CDRs) centered on 5q31 and 5q32 identified candidate tumor-suppressor genes, including the ribosomal subunit RPS14, the transcription factor Egr1/Krox20 and the cytoskeletal remodeling protein, alpha-catenin. Although each acts as a tumor suppressor, alone or in combination, no molecular mechanism accounts for how defects in individual 5q candidates may act as a lesion driving MDS or contributing to malignant progression in MPN. One candidate gene that resides between the conventional del(5q)/5q- MDS-associated CDRs is DIAPH1 (5q31.3). DIAPH1 encodes the mammalian Diaphanous-related formin, mDia1. mDia1 has critical roles in actin remodeling in cell division and in response to adhesive and migratory stimuli. This review examines evidence, with a focus on mouse gene-targeting experiments, that mDia1 acts as a node in a tumor-suppressor network that involves multiple 5q gene products. The network has the potential to sense dynamic changes in actin assembly. At the root of the network is a transcriptional response mechanism mediated by the MADS-box transcription factor, serum response factor (SRF), its actin-binding myocardin family coactivator, MAL, and the SRF-target 5q gene, EGR1, which regulate the expression of PTEN and p53-family tumor-suppressor proteins. We hypothesize that the network provides a homeostatic mechanism balancing HPC/HSC growth control and differentiation decisions in response to microenvironment and other external stimuli.","['Eisenmann, K M', 'Dykema, K J', 'Matheson, S F', 'Kent, N F', 'DeWard, A D', 'West, R A', 'Tibes, R', 'Furge, K A', 'Alberts, A S']","['Eisenmann KM', 'Dykema KJ', 'Matheson SF', 'Kent NF', 'DeWard AD', 'West RA', 'Tibes R', 'Furge KA', 'Alberts AS']","['Laboratories of Cell Structure & Signal Integration, Van Andel Research Institute, Grand Rapids, MI 49503, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090713,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,2009/07/15 09:00,2009/10/15 06:00,['2009/07/15 09:00'],"['2009/07/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2009207 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.207 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2009 Oct 1;28(39):3429-41. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.207.

Although several hypotheses have been put forward, it is unclear as to whether particular gene loci on chromosome 21 (HSA21) are sufficient to cause DS and its associated features. Here we present a high-resolution genetic map of DS phenotypes based on an analysis of 30 subjects carrying rare segmental trisomies of various regions of HSA21. By using state-of-the-art genomics technologies we mapped segmental trisomies at exon-level resolution and identified discrete regions of 1.8-16.3 Mb likely to be involved in the development of 8 DS phenotypes, 4 of which are congenital malformations, including acute megakaryocytic leukemia, transient myeloproliferative disorder, Hirschsprung disease, duodenal stenosis, imperforate anus, severe mental retardation, DS-Alzheimer Disease, and DS-specific congenital heart disease (DSCHD). Our DS-phenotypic maps located DSCHD to a <2-Mb interval. Furthermore, the map enabled us to present evidence against the necessary involvement of other loci as well as specific hypotheses that have been put forward in relation to the etiology of DS-i.e., the presence of a single DS consensus region and the sufficiency of DSCR1 and DYRK1A, or APP, in causing several severe DS phenotypes.

Because a poorer outcome was associated with a shorter interval from CR1 to transplantation, patients were divided into three groups: BM, early PB (< or = 80 days after CR1), and late PB (> 80 days after CR1) transplantation. RESULTS: In a multivariate analysis adjusted for differences between groups and center, RI was higher with both early PB (56% +/- 3%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.45; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.9; P = .006) and late PB transplantation (46% +/- 2%; HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.59; P = .01) as compared with BM transplantation (39% +/- 2%). This translated into a significantly worse leukemia-free survival (LFS) for early PB transplantation (36% +/- 3%; HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.96; P = .02) and a trend for a poorer LFS for late PB (46% +/- 2%; HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.7 to 1.01; P = .06) as compared with BM (52% +/- 2%). CONCLUSION: For patients with AML in CR1, risk of relapse is greater with PB transplantation rather than BM, independent of the interval from CR1 to transplantation.","['Gorin, Norbert-Claude', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Reiffers, Josy', 'Meloni, Giovanna', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'de Witte, Theo', 'Attal, Michel', 'Rio, Bernard', 'Witz, Francois', 'Fouillard, Loic', 'Willemze, Roel', 'Rocha, Vanderson']","['Gorin NC', 'Labopin M', 'Blaise D', 'Reiffers J', 'Meloni G', 'Michallet M', 'de Witte T', 'Attal M', 'Rio B', 'Witz F', 'Fouillard L', 'Willemze R', 'Rocha V']","['Hopital Saint-Antoine, Department of Hematology, Paris, France. norbert-claude.gorin@sat.aphp.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090713,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,2009/07/15 09:00,2009/09/04 06:00,['2009/07/15 09:00'],"['2009/07/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.20.1400 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.20.1400 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Aug 20;27(24):3987-93. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.20.1400.

We developed an index (D-index) that combines duration and severity of neutropenia. The aim of this study was to test the D-index as a predictor of IMI. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The D-index was based on a graph plotting the absolute neutrophil counts during neutropenia and was the area over the neutrophil curve. We tested the D-index in 11 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who developed IMI during neutropenia and 33 AML patients without IMI (controls). We also calculated a cumulative D-index (c-D-index), defined as the cumulative D-index from the start of neutropenia until the date of the first clinical manifestation of IMI in patient cases. We compared the D-index and c-D-index with duration of neutropenia and defined a cutoff for IMI using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: The median duration of neutropenia and profound neutropenia of patient cases were significantly higher compared with controls (P = .002 and P = .001, respectively), as were the D-index (P < .001) and c-D-index (P = .02). The D-index and c-D-index performed better than duration of neutropenia in ROC curve analysis. For a cutoff point of 5,800 of the c-D-index, the sensitivity and specificity were 91% and 58%, respectively, and for a prevalence of IMI of 5%, 10%, and 15%, the negative predictive values were 99%, 98%, and 97%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The high negative predictive value of the c-D-index may be of help in defining different risks for IMI in febrile neutropenic patients.","['Portugal, Rodrigo D', 'Garnica, Marcia', 'Nucci, Marcio']","['Portugal RD', 'Garnica M', 'Nucci M']","['University Hospital, Hematology Service, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Cidade Universitaria, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090713,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,2009/07/15 09:00,2009/08/21 09:00,['2009/07/15 09:00'],"['2009/07/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/21 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.21.0856 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.21.0856 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Aug 10;27(23):3849-54. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.21.0856.

Clinical and biologic markers were evaluated for their impacts on outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred nine patients were enrolled, and 103 received at least one dose of alemtuzumab. After dose escalation, alemtuzumab was administered subcutaneously at 30 mg three times weekly for up to 12 weeks. Response was assessed every 4 weeks during treatment and quarterly thereafter. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 34% (complete response, 4%; partial response, 30%). The median progression-free survival was 7.7 months, and the median overall survival (OS) was 19.1 months. Grades 3 to 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurred in 56%, 57%, and 49% of patients, respectively. Grades 3 to 4 noncytomegalovirus and cytomegalovirus infections occurred in 29% and 8% of patients, respectively. Injection-site skin reactions were generally mild. Efficacy did not vary significantly in subgroups defined by genetic parameters (in particular, in 17p deletion, 11q deletion, mutated TP53, and unmutated VH), but efficacy was inferior in patients with increased beta2-microglobulin (beta2-MG) and thymidine kinase (TK). In multivariate analysis of clinical and biologic variables, age, performance status, beta2-MG, and TK were independent prognostic factors for OS. CONCLUSION: Subcutaneous alemtuzumab appears as effective and safe as intravenous alemtuzumab in fludarabine-refractory CLL. Subcutaneous administration should be the preferred delivery route because of its efficacy, convenience, improved adverse effect profile, and cost savings. In contrast to chemotherapy-based therapy, alemtuzumab treatment overcomes the adverse prognostic impact of VH mutation status, TP53 mutation, and genomic aberrations.","['Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'Winkler, Dirk', 'Buhler, Andreas', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Groner, Silja', 'Busch, Raymonde', 'Hensel, Manfred', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Dreger, Peter', 'Jager, Ulrich', 'Lengfelder, Eva', 'Hohloch, Karin', 'Soling, Ulrike', 'Schlag, Rudolf', 'Kneba, Michael', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Dohner, Hartmut']","['Stilgenbauer S', 'Zenz T', 'Winkler D', 'Buhler A', 'Schlenk RF', 'Groner S', 'Busch R', 'Hensel M', 'Duhrsen U', 'Finke J', 'Dreger P', 'Jager U', 'Lengfelder E', 'Hohloch K', 'Soling U', 'Schlag R', 'Kneba M', 'Hallek M', 'Dohner H']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany. stephan.stilgenbauer@uniklinik-ulm.de']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090713,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,2009/07/15 09:00,2009/09/04 06:00,['2009/07/15 09:00'],"['2009/07/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.21.1128 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.21.1128 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Aug 20;27(24):3994-4001. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.21.1128.

As MEN1 patients frequently develop lipomas and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is expressed in several MEN1-related tumor types, we investigated regulation of PPARgamma activity by menin. We found that menin is required for adipocyte differentiation of murine 3T3-L1 cells and PPARgamma-expressing mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Menin augments PPARgamma target gene expression through recruitment of H3K4 methyltransferase activity. Menin interacts directly with the activation function 2 transcription activation domain of PPARgamma in a ligand-independent fashion. Ligand-dependent coactivation, however, is dependent on the LXXLL motif of menin and the intact helix 12 of PPARgamma. We propose that menin is an important factor in PPARgamma-mediated adipogenesis and that loss of PPARgamma function may contribute to lipoma development in MEN1 patients.","['Dreijerink, Koen M A', 'Varier, Radhika A', 'van Beekum, Olivier', 'Jeninga, Ellen H', 'Hoppener, Jo W M', 'Lips, Cornelis J M', 'Kummer, J Alain', 'Kalkhoven, Eric', 'Timmers, H T Marc']","['Dreijerink KM', 'Varier RA', 'van Beekum O', 'Jeninga EH', 'Hoppener JW', 'Lips CJ', 'Kummer JA', 'Kalkhoven E', 'Timmers HT']","['University Medical Center Utrecht, Department of Physiological Chemistry, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090713,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,PMC2738285,2009/07/15 09:00,2009/09/16 06:00,['2009/07/15 09:00'],"['2009/07/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.01001-08 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.01001-08 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2009 Sep;29(18):5060-9. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01001-08.

A case-control retrospective analysis.,2007-12,10.1093/annonc/mdp259 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic haemopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is increasingly considered as a therapeutic option for younger patients with poor-risk chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). In this retrospective analysis, we assessed the outcomes of CLL patients undergoing RIC allo-HCT compared with a group of matched controls that were candidates for transplantation but did not have a suitable donor or refused the procedure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cases comprised 37 patients who underwent RIC allo-HCT. Haemopoietic cell grafts were harvested from HLA-matched siblings (27) and unrelated donors (7). Controls consisted of 43 patients from the same institutions who received conventional therapy only. Matching variables were age at diagnosis and time to first CLL-specific therapy. RESULTS: Both patient groups were well balanced in terms of cytogenetics by FISH, CD38 and ZAP-70 expression, and immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region mutational status. Median overall survival was 113 months for HCT patients and 85 months for controls when calculated from time of diagnosis (P = 0.072) and 103 and 67 months, respectively, when calculated from time of first therapy (P = 0.041). CONCLUSION: RIC allo-HCT is a reasonable option for patients with high-risk CLL. However, these results require confirmation before the procedure can be recommended outside clinical trials.","['Delgado, J', 'Pillai, S', 'Phillips, N', 'Brunet, S', 'Pratt, G', 'Briones, J', 'Lovell, R', 'Martino, R', 'Ewing, J', 'Sureda, A', 'Milligan, D W', 'Sierra, J']","['Delgado J', 'Pillai S', 'Phillips N', 'Brunet S', 'Pratt G', 'Briones J', 'Lovell R', 'Martino R', 'Ewing J', 'Sureda A', 'Milligan DW', 'Sierra J']","['Department of Haematology, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain. jdelgadog@santpau.cat']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090712,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,2009/07/15 09:00,2010/01/26 06:00,['2009/07/15 09:00'],"['2009/07/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0923-7534(19)39872-2 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdp259 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2009 Dec;20(12):2007-12. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdp259.

The flavonoids were found to suppress the degranulation from Ag-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells to different extents. To disclose the inhibitory mechanism of degranulation by flavonoids, we examined their effects on the intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) and the intracellular signaling pathway such as Lyn, Syk, and PLCgammas. The intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) was elevated by Fc epsilonRI activation, but these flavonoid treatments reduced the elevation of [Ca(2+)]i by suppressing Ca(2+) influx. Kaempferol strongly suppressed the activation of Syk and PLCgammas. It was thus suggested that suppression of Ag-stimulated degranulation by the flavonoids is mainly due to suppression of [Ca(2+)]i elevation and Syk activation. These results suggested that strawberry would be of some ameliorative benefit for the allergic symptoms.","['Itoh, Tomohiro', 'Ninomiya, Masayuki', 'Yasuda, Masaharu', 'Koshikawa, Kaneyuki', 'Deyashiki, Yoshihiro', 'Nozawa, Yoshinori', 'Akao, Yukihiro', 'Koketsu, Mamoru']","['Itoh T', 'Ninomiya M', 'Yasuda M', 'Koshikawa K', 'Deyashiki Y', 'Nozawa Y', 'Akao Y', 'Koketsu M']","['Gifu International Institute of Biotechnology, 1-1 Naka-Fudogaoka, Kakamigahara, Gifu 504-0838, Japan. titoh@giib.or.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090627,England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,,2009/07/15 09:00,2009/10/14 06:00,['2009/07/15 09:00'],"['2009/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/23 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0968-0896(09)00620-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2009.06.050 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2009 Aug 1;17(15):5374-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2009.06.050.

One way of handling such cases is to use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). In this work HMMs of LTRs were constructed for three groups of orthoretroviruses: the betaretroviruslike human MMTV-like (HML) endogenous retroviruses, the lentiviruses, including HIV, and gammaretroviruslike human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs). The HMM-generated LTR alignments and the phylogenetic trees constructed from them were compared with trees based on alignments of the pol gene at the nucleic acid level. The majority of branches in the LTR and pol based trees had the same order for the three retroviral genera, showing that HMM methods are successful in aligning and constructing phylogenies of LTRs. The HML LTR tree deviated somewhat from the pol tree for the groups HML3, HML7 and HML6. Among the gammaretroviruslike proviruses, the exogenous Mouse Leukemia Virus (MLV) was highly related to HERV-T in the pol based tree, but not in the LTR based tree. Aside from these differences, the similarity between the trees indicates that LTRs and pol coevolved in a largely monophyletic way.","['Benachenhou, Farid', 'Blikstad, Vidar', 'Blomberg, Jonas']","['Benachenhou F', 'Blikstad V', 'Blomberg J']","['Section of Virology, Dept. of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Dag Hammarskjolds v. 17, SE-75185 Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090709,Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,,2009/07/15 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/15 09:00'],"['2009/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-1119(09)00386-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.gene.2009.07.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2009 Dec 15;448(2):134-8. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2009.07.002.

Activation of STAT3 is under tight regulation, and yet the different signaling pathways and the mechanisms that regulate its activity remain to be elucidated. Using a yeast two-hybrid screening, we have identified a nuclear protein IkappaB-zeta that interacts in a novel way with STAT3. This physical interaction was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays. The interaction regions were mapped to the coiled-coil domain of STAT3 and the C-terminal of IkappaB-zeta. Overexpression of IkappaB-zeta inhibited the transcriptional activity of STAT3. It also suppressed cell growth and induced cell apoptosis in SRC-simulated cells, which is partially mediated by down-regulation of expression of a known STAT3 target gene, MCL1.

To investigate this in haematologic malignancies, we evaluated the aberrant promoter methylation of two imprinted genes (MEG3 and SNRPN) in 43 MDS and 42 AML patients. MEG3 hypermethylation occurred in 15 MDS patients (34.9%), and in 20 AML patients (47.6%). SNRPN hypermethylation was observed in 15 MDS patients (34.9%), and in 21 AML patients (50%). There were no significant correlations between WHO subtype, WPSS score, karyotype, haemoglobin levels, white blood cell count, platelet count and CpG methylation of any gene. MEG3 hypermethylation was associated with significantly reduced overall survival in individuals with AML (HR=1.98, p=0.04), while SNRPN CpG methylation was not associated with survival (HR=0.94, p=0.87). In addition, no association between survival and aberrant MEG3 (HR=2.15, p=0.072) or SNRPN methylation (HR=1.08, p=0.85) was observed in patients MDS. Our findings suggest that these genes are abnormally methylated in AML and MDS patients, and methylation of MEG3 confers worse overall prognosis. The MEG3 methylation status may serve as a useful biomarker in leukemia.","['Benetatos, Leonidas', 'Hatzimichael, Eleftheria', 'Dasoula, Aggeliki', 'Dranitsaris, George', 'Tsiara, Stavroula', 'Syrrou, Maria', 'Georgiou, Ioannis', 'Bourantas, Konstantinos L']","['Benetatos L', 'Hatzimichael E', 'Dasoula A', 'Dranitsaris G', 'Tsiara S', 'Syrrou M', 'Georgiou I', 'Bourantas KL']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Ioannina, Niarchos Avenue, 45500 Ioannina, Greece. me01532@cc.uoi.gr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,2009/07/15 09:00,2010/03/11 06:00,['2009/07/15 09:00'],"['2009/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00296-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.06.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Feb;34(2):148-53. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.06.019.,"['0 (MEG3 non-coding RNA, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (snRNP Core Proteins)']",IM,"['CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', '*Genomic Imprinting', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'Survival Rate', 'snRNP Core Proteins/*genetics']",,,,,,['Leuk Res. 2010 Feb;34(2):139-40.

This interaction leads to a reduction of c-Jun DNA-binding activity and prevents the protein from activating transcription of AP-1-dependent promoters. However, it remained unclear whether the negative effect of HBZ-SP1 was due to its weak DNA-binding activity or to its capacity to target cellular factors to transcriptionally-inactive nuclear bodies. To answer this question, we produced a mutant in which specific residues present in the modulatory and DNA-binding domain of HBZ-SP1 were substituted for the corresponding c-Fos amino acids to improve the DNA-binding activity of the c-Jun/HBZ-SP1 heterodimer. The stability of the mutant, its interaction with c-Jun, DNA-binding activity of the resulting heterodimer, and its effect on the c-Jun activity were tested. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the repression of c-Jun activity in vivo is mainly due to the HBZ-SP1-mediated sequestration of c-Jun to the HBZ-NBs.","['Clerc, Isabelle', 'Hivin, Patrick', 'Rubbo, Pierre-Alain', 'Lemasson, Isabelle', 'Barbeau, Benoit', 'Mesnard, Jean-Michel']","['Clerc I', 'Hivin P', 'Rubbo PA', 'Lemasson I', 'Barbeau B', 'Mesnard JM']","[""Universite Montpellier 1, Centre d'etudes d'agents Pathogenes et Biotechnologies pour la Sante (CPBS), France; CNRS, UM5236, CPBS, F-34965 Montpellier, France; Universite Montpellier 2, CPBS, F-34095 Montpellier, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090712,United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,,2009/07/15 09:00,2009/09/01 06:00,['2009/07/15 09:00'],"['2009/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/23 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0042-6822(09)00359-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2009.06.027 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2009 Sep 1;391(2):195-202. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2009.06.027.

In the present study, microvessel density (MVD), analysed in 185 diagnostic bone marrow biopsies, was higher in T-cell ALL compared to B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL (P = 0.013). In the BCP group, cases with t(12;21) were characterized by a low MVD while patients with high-hyperdiploid leukaemia (HeH, 51-61 chromosomes) showed a high MVD compared to other BCP patients (P = 0.001 and 0.002 respectively). There was a correlation between MVD and white blood cell (WBC) count in high-risk BCP patients (P = 0.021). In addition, BCP patients with a high marrow reticulin fibre density and high MVD had an unfavourable outcome compared to the other BCP patients (P = 0.002). The fraction of vessels in which lumina were filled with blasts (blast congested vessel fraction) correlated strongly with WBC count (P < 0.001). These findings indicate that the angiogenic process interacts with other stroma-factors, such as reticulin fibre density, in its effect on outcome, and is coupled to both the ALL genotype and phenotype. One possible implication is that different subtypes of childhood ALL may respond differently to anti-angiogenic drugs as a supplement in first-line treatment.","['Noren-Nystrom, Ulrika', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Frisk, Per', 'Golovleva, Irina', 'Sundstrom, Christer', 'Porwit, Anna', 'Roos, Goran', 'Bergh, Anders', 'Forestier, Erik']","['Noren-Nystrom U', 'Heyman M', 'Frisk P', 'Golovleva I', 'Sundstrom C', 'Porwit A', 'Roos G', 'Bergh A', 'Forestier E']","['Department of Clinical Sciences, Pediatrics, Umea University, Umea, Sweden. ulrika.norennystrom@pediatri.umu.se']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090706,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,2009/07/15 09:00,2009/10/09 06:00,['2009/07/15 09:00'],"['2009/07/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH7796 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07796.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Sep;146(5):521-30. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07796.x.

The distinct stages of DS-TMD and DS-AMKL provide an excellent tractable model to study leukaemogenesis. This review focuses on recent studies describing clinical, haematological and biological features of DS-AMKL and DS-TMD. The findings from these studies suggest that mutations in the key haemopoietic regulator GATA1 (GATA binding protein 1) in DS-AMKL and DS-TMD may be useful in diagnosis and assessing minimal residual disease. These findings raise the possibility of population-based screening strategies for DS-TMD and the development of treatment to eliminate the preleukaemic TMD clone to prevent DS-AMKL. Advances in our understanding of perturbed haemopoiesis in DS, the role of GATA1 and of cooperating mutations are also discussed. These findings have implications for leukaemia biology more broadly given the frequency of acquired trisomy in other human leukaemias.","['Roy, Anindita', 'Roberts, Irene', 'Norton, Alice', 'Vyas, Paresh']","['Roy A', 'Roberts I', 'Norton A', 'Vyas P']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College London, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090706,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,2009/07/15 09:00,2010/02/23 06:00,['2009/07/15 09:00'],"['2009/07/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH7789 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07789.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Oct;147(1):3-12. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07789.x.

Three secondary aberrations in TEL/AML1 positive ALL have been suspected to negatively influence outcome: deletion of the second TEL allele (T), gain of the second AML1 allele (A) and duplication of the derivative chromosome 21 (der(21), TA). Many studies have explored such aberrations in initial disease, while only few reports have investigated them in relapses. METHODS: In this study, bone marrow samples from 38 children with relapsed TEL/AML1 RT-PCR positive and negative BCP-ALL were analyzed for these mutations by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization and results were compared with published data. RESULTS: In children with TEL/AML1 positive ALL relapse, additional (a) TEL loss, (b) combined AML1 and der(21) gain, (c) combined TEL loss and AML1 gain as well as (d) the occurrence of a subpopulation with the signal pattern 1T/3A/1TA appear to be related to higher peripheral blast counts (PBCs) at relapse diagnosis (a and d) or a tendency towards the occurrence of a subsequent relapse (b and c) (P-values <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our data together with published results on TEL/AML1 positive ALL suggest that frequencies of additional TEL and AML1 mutations are, with the exception of loss of untranslocated TEL, higher in first relapses than in initial disease. They also show that it is important to consider combined mutations in the analysis of this leukemia entity.","['Peter, Anita', 'Heiden, Thomas', 'Taube, Tillmann', 'Korner, Gabriele', 'Seeger, Karl']","['Peter A', 'Heiden T', 'Taube T', 'Korner G', 'Seeger K']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Otto-Heubner-Center for Pediatrics, Charite Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Berlin D-13353, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090706,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,2009/07/15 09:00,2009/11/07 06:00,['2009/07/15 09:00'],"['2009/07/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/07 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1315 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01315.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2009 Nov;83(5):420-32. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01315.x.

We examined the feasibility of a 4-month school reintegration intervention by: (1) developing collaboration with a community-based advocacy organisation; (2) developing intervention modules and observable end points; and (3) determining how the study achieved recruitment expectations. Eight families with children aged 6-12 years diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and parents were enrolled in the study. An experienced advocate implemented a series of eight modules over a 4-month period (twice per month) with the families. Participants completed pre-post measures. Successful collaboration with the advocacy organisation and the development of an intervention module series were achieved. Recruitment aims proved more difficult: enrolment was extended when recruitment for the original 1- to 6-month post-diagnosis window proved difficult.

METHODS: Central nervous system tumours registered in the Swedish Childhood Cancer Registry were reclassified according to ICCC-3. Incidence and survival analyses were performed in the study population. RESULTS: There were 1479 children (<15 years) in Sweden diagnosed with CNS tumours 1984-2005. The distribution of diagnoses was similar to that reported in other studies. The annual incidence was 4.2/100,000 children. The survival rates have not improved significantly between the two time periods before/after 1995 (70% vs. 74%; p = 0.10).

Any increase in the efficiency of blastocyst formation upon nuclear transfer will greatly enhance the efficiency of cloning. In the present study, the effect of various media, protein sources, and growth factors on the development of cloned buffalo embryos was evaluated. Among various combinations tested, culture of cloned embryos in TCM-199 media on the feeder layer of Buffalo Oviductal Epithelial Cells (BOEC) in the presence of bovine serum albumin-free fatty acid (BSA-FFA) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) provided most suitable environment for efficient development of cloned blastocysts. Under these conditions, we achieved a blastocyst formation rate of 43%, which is better than those reported previously. Because preimplantation embryonic development, in vivo, occurs in an environment of oviductal cells, the blastocysts generated by this method may presumably be more suitable for implantation and further development. Additionally, we generated green blastocysts from enucleated oocytes by transfer of nuclei from cells transfected with EGFP transgene, showing possibility of transgenesis via cloning in this species. To our knowledge, this is the first report regarding the production of transgenic cloned buffalo embryos and their developmental competence with respect to various media, cocultures, and supplements.","['Wadhwa, Neerja', 'Kunj, Neetu', 'Tiwari, Shuchita', 'Saraiya, Megha', 'Majumdar, Subeer S']","['Wadhwa N', 'Kunj N', 'Tiwari S', 'Saraiya M', 'Majumdar SS']","['Embryo Biotechnology Laboratory, National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cloning Stem Cells,Cloning and stem cells,101125444,,2009/07/15 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/15 09:00'],"['2009/07/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/clo.2009.0003 [doi]'],ppublish,Cloning Stem Cells. 2009 Sep;11(3):387-95. doi: 10.1089/clo.2009.0003.,,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Blastocyst/*cytology', 'Buffaloes/*embryology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cloning, Organism/*methods', '*Nuclear Transfer Techniques']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemiotherapeutic regimens include methotrexate, administered either intravenously or via intrathecal route. Although multiple drugs are used in addition to methotrexate, the acute neurotoxicity reported in patients is usually attributed to methotrexate. The acute neurotoxicity usually results in stroke-like symptoms such as aphasia, weakness, sensory deficits, ataxia and seizures. OUTLINE OF CASES: From 2002 until January 2008, 32 children with ALL were diagnosed and treated at the Children's Hospital in Nis. The patients' age ranged from 1.5 to 16 years. They were treated in accordance with the protocol ALL IC-BFM 2002 (ALL Intercontinental Berlin Frankfurt Munster 2002). Two of the patients (6.25%) exhibited neurotoxicity. After the occurrence of neurological symptoms, the patients were ophthalmologically and neurologically examined. In addition, the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, computerized tomography and electroencephalography were applied. The paper presents two patients, aged 9 and 15 years respectively, who exhibited acute neurotoxicity--methotrexate encephalopathy during ALL treatment. Both patients had tonic-clonic seizures and neurological symptoms in the course of the induction therapy. Neurotoxicity occurred 7 days after the third, and 3 days after the fourth intrathecal methotrexate therapy. MR images confirmed multi-focal morphological changes of brain density in one of the patients, while the other patient had normal CT reading. Even though the development significantly differed, the changes were reversible in both patients. CONCLUSION: The neurotoxicity in patients with ALL can be combined with significant structural changes of the brain, but also morphological changes can be absent. Several questions concerning aetiology and treatment of neurological events are raised.","['Kostic, Gordana', 'Jovancic, Danijela', 'Saranac, Ljiljana', 'Bjelakovic, Bojko']","['Kostic G', 'Jovancic D', 'Saranac L', 'Bjelakovic B']",,['srp'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Serbia,Srp Arh Celok Lek,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,0027440,,2009/07/15 09:00,2009/08/26 09:00,['2009/07/15 09:00'],"['2009/07/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [medline]']",['10.2298/sarh0906266k [doi]'],ppublish,Srp Arh Celok Lek. 2009 May-Jun;137(5-6):266-70. doi: 10.2298/sarh0906266k.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Brain/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the polymorphisms of debrisoquine hydroxylase (CYP2D6), epoxide hydrolase (EPHX1), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and quinone-oxoreductase (NQO1), which have been implicated in xenobiotic metabolism, on the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We evaluated the frequency of polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 (*3 and *4), EPHX1 (*2 and *3), MPO (*2), and NQO1 (*2) genes in 206 patients with childhood ALL and in 364 healthy individuals matched for age and gender from a Brazilian population separated by ethnicity (European ancestry and African ancestry), using the PCR-RFLP method. The CYP2D6 polymorphism variants were associated with an increased risk of ALL. The EPHX1, NQO1, and MPO variant genotypes were significantly associated with a reduced risk of childhood ALL. A significantly stronger protective effect is observed when the EPHX1, NQO1, and MPO variant genotypes are combined suggesting that, CYP2D6 polymorphisms may play a role in the susceptibility to pediatric ALL, whereas the EPHX1, NQO1, and MPO polymorphisms might have a protective function against leukemogenesis.","['Silveira, Vanessa da Silva', 'Canalle, Renata', 'Scrideli, Carlos Alberto', 'Queiroz, Rosane Gomes de Paula', 'Tone, Luiz Gonzaga']","['Silveira Vda S', 'Canalle R', 'Scrideli CA', 'Queiroz RG', 'Tone LG']","['Department of Genetics, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil. vssilveira@usp.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Environ Mol Mutagen,Environmental and molecular mutagenesis,8800109,,2009/07/14 09:00,2010/01/26 06:00,['2009/07/14 09:00'],"['2009/07/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/em.20510 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Mol Mutagen. 2010 Jan;51(1):48-56. doi: 10.1002/em.20510.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (myelopoietin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NQO1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.3.2.- (Epoxide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.3.2.9 (EPHX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brazil', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*genetics', 'Epoxide Hydrolases/*genetics', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-3/*genetics', 'Male', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins']",,,,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,

We observed that the frequency of HLA-DR15 expression in MDS patients (38.7%) was significantly higher than that in the healthy controls (p < 0.01). We noted the following observations with regard to disease progression: None of the 46 HLA-DR15 positive patients with international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) scores <or=1 developed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) during the follow-up period, while six of the 63 DR15-negative patients with the same IPSS score developed AML within a shorter follow-up period (p = 0.039). Furthermore, the incidence of poor chromosomal abnormalities, the percentage of patients with IPSS scores >or=1.5 and the presence of >or=5% blasts in the bone marrow in the DR15-positive patients were lower than the corresponding findings in the DR15-negative patients. In addition, we also recorded the following observations with regard to bone marrow (BM) failure: The bicytopenia/pancytopenia ratio in the DR15-positive patients was higher than that in the DR15-negative patients (92.4 vs. 78.3%; p = 0.029). The peripheral-neutrophil count and the platelet count in the DR15-positive patients were lower than those in the DR15-negative patients (p = 0.028 and p = 0.011, respectively). Moreover, hypocellularity was more easily detectable in the DR15-positive patients (26.4 vs. 16.9%). In addition, the BM CD4+ lymphocyte count and the CD4/CD8 ratio in the DR15-positive patients were higher than the corresponding values in the DR15-negative patients (p < 0.05 for both). However, there were no significant differences between the polarization of T-helper (T(h)) and T-cytotoxic (T(c)) cells and the cytokine levels in these two patient groups.

We assessed 67 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma for expression of SHH (ligand), GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3 (transcriptional effectors of SHH signaling), and the ATP-binding cassette (ABC)G2 (a downstream target of SHH signaling), using immunohistochemistry. For comparison, we assessed the expression levels of these proteins in 28 cases of follicular lymphoma, 5 chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, and 5 reactive lymph nodes. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, SHH was expressed in 61 of 67 (91%) cases, GLI1 in 62 of 67 (93%), GLI2 in 41 of 56 (73%), and GLI3 in 22 of 56 (39%). Expression of ABCG2 was detected in 52 of 55 (95%) cases and was high in 15 (27%) cases. SHH expression positively correlated with expression levels of ABCG2 (P=0.05). Patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with high ABCG2 expression showed significantly shorter overall survival (P=0.031) and failure-free survival (P=0.029) compared with patients with tumors with low or no expression of ABCG2. Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas expressed SHH, and GLI1, GLI2, and GLI3 more frequently and more intensely than cases of follicular lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. In conclusion, our data show that SHH signaling proteins and ABCG2 are aberrantly expressed in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and that ABCG2 expression has prognostic implications. These findings also provide evidence that dysregulation of the SHH pathway may be involved in the pathogenesis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","['Kim, Ji Eun', 'Singh, Rajesh R', 'Cho-Vega, Jeong Hee', 'Drakos, Elias', 'Davuluri, Yogesh', 'Khokhar, Faisal A', 'Fayad, Luis', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Vega, Francisco']","['Kim JE', 'Singh RR', 'Cho-Vega JH', 'Drakos E', 'Davuluri Y', 'Khokhar FA', 'Fayad L', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Vega F']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090710,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,,2009/07/14 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/14 09:00'],"['2009/07/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol200998 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2009.98 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2009 Oct;22(10):1312-20. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2009.98.

Fifty (45%) patients had microbiologically documented infections, and the remaining patients had negative cultures at the start of therapy.An overall clinical response was noted in 70 (64%) patients. More clinical responses were seen in patients with bacteremia than in those with pneumonia (79% vs. 51%; p = 0.029). Patients with microbiologically documented infections had significantly higher clinical response rates than patients with non-microbiologically documented infections (73% vs. 55%; p = 0.047). Forty (36%) patients did not respond to treatment; 36 of these patients died of active infection during tigecycline therapy. Patients with pneumonia had a significantly higher mortality rate than patients with bacteremia (44% vs. 16%; p = 0.026). During the 60 days of follow-up from the date of clinical response, patients with pneumonia had significantly shorter survival durations than patients with other infections. Of the 42 patients who were not on antiemetics or ventilator support at the start of tigecycline therapy, 2 (5%) experienced mild nausea, and 1 (2%) experienced nausea and vomiting. Only 4 (4%) patients overall experienced diarrhea during tigecycline therapy, all of whose stools were negative for Clostridium difficile toxin. No serious adverse events related to tigecycline use were identified. The combination of tigecycline and an antipseudomonal drug may be appropriate for treating refractory infections and multidrug-resistant organisms in cancer patients, including hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Patients with refractory pneumonia had a relatively low clinical response rate in our study.","['Chemaly, Roy F', 'Hanmod, Santosh S', 'Jiang, Ying', 'Rathod, Dhanesh B', 'Mulanovich, Victor', 'Adachi, Javier A', 'Rolston, Kenneth V', 'Raad, Issam I', 'Hachem, Ray Y']","['Chemaly RF', 'Hanmod SS', 'Jiang Y', 'Rathod DB', 'Mulanovich V', 'Adachi JA', 'Rolston KV', 'Raad II', 'Hachem RY']","['From Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control, and Employee Health, The University of Texas M.

The effectiveness of the proposed methodology, is demonstrated using five microarray gene expression datasets dealing with human lung, colon, sarcoma, breast cancer and leukemia. Moreover, the superior capability of the methodology in selecting important genes, over five other existing gene selection methods, viz., Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Neighborhood analysis (NA), Bayesian Regularization (BR) and Data-adaptive (DA) is demonstrated, in terms of the enrichment of each GO category of the important genes based on P-values. The results are appropriately validated by earlier investigations, gene expression profiles and t-test. The proposed methodology has been able to select genes that are more biologically significant in mediating the development of a disease than those obtained by the others.","['De, Rajat K', 'Ghosh, Anupam']","['De RK', 'Ghosh A']","['Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, West Bengal, India. rajat@isical.ac.in']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090708,United States,J Biomed Inform,Journal of biomedical informatics,100970413,,2009/07/14 09:00,2010/01/26 06:00,['2009/07/14 09:00'],"['2008/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/20 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S1532-0464(09)00091-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jbi.2009.06.003 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biomed Inform. 2009 Dec;42(6):1022-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jbi.2009.06.003.

Despite their abundance in most cells the transcriptional regulation of miR-15a/16-1 remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that the putative tumor suppressor DLEU2 acts as a host gene of these microRNAs. Mature miR-15a/miR-16-1 are produced in a Drosha-dependent process from DLEU2 and binding of the Myc oncoprotein to two alterative DLEU2 promoters represses both the host gene transcript and levels of mature miR-15a/miR-16-1. In line with a functional role for DLEU2 in the expression of the microRNAs, the miR-15a/miR-16-1 locus is retained in four CLL cases that delete both promoters of this gene and expression analysis indicates that this leads to functional loss of mature miR-15a/16-1. We additionally show that DLEU2 negatively regulates the G1 Cyclins E1 and D1 through miR-15a/miR-16-1 and provide evidence that these oncoproteins are subject to miR-15a/miR-16-1-mediated repression under normal conditions. We also demonstrate that DLEU2 overexpression blocks cellular proliferation and inhibits the colony-forming ability of tumor cell lines in a miR-15a/miR-16-1-dependent way. Together the data illuminate how inactivation of DLEU2 promotes cell proliferation and tumor progression through functional loss of miR-15a/miR-16-1.","['Lerner, Mikael', 'Harada, Masako', 'Loven, Jakob', 'Castro, Juan', 'Davis, Zadie', 'Oscier, David', 'Henriksson, Marie', 'Sangfelt, Olle', 'Grander, Dan', 'Corcoran, Martin M']","['Lerner M', 'Harada M', 'Loven J', 'Castro J', 'Davis Z', 'Oscier D', 'Henriksson M', 'Sangfelt O', 'Grander D', 'Corcoran MM']","['Department of Oncology-Pathology, Cancercentrum Karolinska, Karolinska Institutet R8:03, 171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090708,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,,2009/07/14 09:00,2009/10/24 06:00,['2009/07/14 09:00'],"['2009/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/30 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(09)00302-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.07.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2009 Oct 15;315(17):2941-52. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.07.001.

OBJECTIVES: We used carpet dust as an exposure indicator to examine the risk of childhood leukemia in relation to residential exposure to persistent organochlorine chemicals: six polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and the pesticides alpha- and gamma-chlordane, p,p'-DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), p,p'-DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene), methoxychlor, and pentachlorophenol. METHODS: We conducted a population-based case-control study in 35 counties in northern and central California in 2001-2006. The study included 184 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cases 0-7 years of age and 212 birth certificate controls matched to cases by birth date, sex, race, and Hispanic ethnicity. We collected carpet dust samples from the room where the child spent the most time before diagnosis (similar date for controls) using a specialized vacuum. RESULTS: Detection of any PCB congener in the dust conferred a 2-fold increased risk of ALL [odds ratio (OR) = 1.97; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.22-3.17]. Compared with those in the lowest quartile of total PCBs, the highest quartile was associated with about a 3-fold risk (OR = 2.78; 95% CI, 1.41-5.48), and the positive trend was significant (p = 0.017). Significant positive trends in ALL risk were apparent with increasing concentrations of PCB congeners 118, 138, and 153. We observed no significant positive associations for chlordane, DDT, DDE, methoxychlor, or pentachlorophenol. The associations with PCBs were stronger among non-Hispanic whites than among Hispanics despite similar distributions of PCB levels among controls in each racial/ethnic group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that PCBs, which are considered probable human carcinogens and cause perturbations of the immune system, may represent a previously unrecognized risk factor for childhood leukemia.","['Ward, Mary H', 'Colt, Joanne S', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Gunier, Robert B', 'Lubin, Jay', 'Crouse, Vonda', 'Nishioka, Marcia G', 'Reynolds, Peggy', 'Buffler, Patricia A']","['Ward MH', 'Colt JS', 'Metayer C', 'Gunier RB', 'Lubin J', 'Crouse V', 'Nishioka MG', 'Reynolds P', 'Buffler PA']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7240, USA. wardm@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20090127,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,PMC2702395,2009/07/11 09:00,2009/09/24 06:00,['2009/07/11 09:00'],"['2009/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/ehp.0900583 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2009 Jun;117(6):1007-13. doi: 10.1289/ehp.0900583.

This led us to speculate that an unidentified metabolic pathway was mainly responsible for benzene metabolism at ambient levels. OBJECTIVE: We statistically tested whether human metabolism of benzene is better fitted by a kinetic model having two pathways rather than one. METHODS: We fit Michaelis-Menten-like models to levels of urinary benzene metabolites and the corresponding air concentrations for 263 nonsmoking Chinese females. Estimated benzene concentrations ranged from less than 0.001 ppm to 299 ppm, with 10th and 90th percentile values of 0.002 ppm and 8.97 ppm, respectively. RESULTS: Using values of Akaike's information criterion obtained under the two models, we found strong statistical evidence favoring two metabolic pathways, with respective affinities (benzene air concentrations analogous to K(m) values) of 301 ppm for the low-affinity pathway (probably dominated by cytochrome P450 enzyme 2E1) and 0.594 ppm for the high-affinity pathway (unknown). The exposure-specific metabolite level predicted by our two-pathway model at nonsaturating concentrations was 184 muM/ppm of benzene, a value close to an independent estimate of 194 muM/ppm for a typical nonsmoking Chinese female. Our results indicate that a nonsmoking woman would metabolize about three times more benzene from the ambient environment under the two-pathway model (184 muM/ppm) than under the one-pathway model (68.6 muM/ppm). In fact, 73% of the ambient benzene dose would be metabolized via the unidentified high-affinity pathway. CONCLUSION: Because regulatory risk assessments have assumed nonsaturating metabolism of benzene in persons exposed to air concentrations well above 10 ppm, our findings suggest that the true leukemia risks could be substantially greater than currently thought at ambient levels of exposure-about 3-fold higher among nonsmoking females in the general population.","['Rappaport, Stephen M', 'Kim, Sungkyoon', 'Lan, Qing', 'Vermeulen, Roel', 'Waidyanatha, Suramya', 'Zhang, Luoping', 'Li, Guilan', 'Yin, Songnian', 'Hayes, Richard B', 'Rothman, Nathaniel', 'Smith, Martyn T']","['Rappaport SM', 'Kim S', 'Lan Q', 'Vermeulen R', 'Waidyanatha S', 'Zhang L', 'Li G', 'Yin S', 'Hayes RB', 'Rothman N', 'Smith MT']","['School of Public Health, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720-7356, USA. srappaport@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20090219,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,PMC2702411,2009/07/11 09:00,2009/09/24 06:00,['2009/07/11 09:00'],"['2008/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/ehp.0800510 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2009 Jun;117(6):946-52. doi: 10.1289/ehp.0800510.

In this study, we showed that FD-891 induces apoptosis in various human cancer cell lines. Human leukemia Jurkat cells were highly sensitive to FD-891, exhibiting caspase activation and mitochondrial release of cytochrome c into the cytosol at early time points after exposure to FD-891. By contrast, Jurkat cells deficient in caspase-8 were resistant to FD-891-induced apoptosis and manifested little induction of cytochrome c release as well as caspase-9 processing. Consistent with these results, the overexpression of the Bcl-2 family member Bcl-x(L) or the caspase-8 modulator c-FLIP(L) markedly prevented FD-891-induced apoptosis. These results clearly demonstrate that FD-891 triggers caspase-8-dependent mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and subsequent apoptosis in Jurkat cells.","['Inaba, Susumu', 'Eguchi, Tadashi', 'Motegi, Atsushi', 'Mizoue, Kazutoshi', 'Usui, Takeo', 'Nagai, Kazuo', 'Kataoka, Takao']","['Inaba S', 'Eguchi T', 'Motegi A', 'Mizoue K', 'Usui T', 'Nagai K', 'Kataoka T']","['Center for Biological Resources and Informatics, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Nagatsuta-cho, Midori-ku, Yokohama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090710,Japan,J Antibiot (Tokyo),The Journal of antibiotics,0151115,,2009/07/11 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/11 09:00'],"['2009/07/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ja200962 [pii]', '10.1038/ja.2009.62 [doi]']",ppublish,J Antibiot (Tokyo). 2009 Sep;62(9):507-12. doi: 10.1038/ja.2009.62.

To identify oncogenic lesions that combine with BCR-ABL1 to cause ALL, we used Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP arrays (250K NspI and SNP 6.0), fluorescence in situ hybridization, and genomic polymerase chain reaction to study 106 cases of adult BCR-ABL1-positive ALL. The most frequent somatic copy number alteration was a focal deletion on 7p12 of IKZF1, which encodes the transcription factor Ikaros and was identified in 80 (75%) of 106 patients. Different patterns of deletions occurred, but the most frequent were those characterized by a loss of exons 4 through 7 (Delta4-7) and by removal of exons 2 through 7 (Delta2-7). A variable number of nucleotides (patient specific) were inserted at the conjunction and maintained with fidelity at the time of relapse. The extent of the Delta4-7 deletion correlated with the expression of a dominant-negative isoform with cytoplasmic localization and oncogenic activity, whereas the Delta2-7 deletion resulted in a transcript lacking the translation start site. The IKZF1 deletion also was identified in the progression of chronic myeloid leukemia to lymphoid blast crisis (66%) but never in myeloid blast crisis or chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia or in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Known DNA sequences and structural features were mapped along the breakpoint cluster regions, including heptamer recombination signal sequences recognized by RAG enzymes during V(D)J recombination, suggesting that IKZF1 deletions could arise from aberrant RAG-mediated recombination.","['Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Storlazzi, Clelia Tiziana', 'Cilloni, Daniela', 'Lonetti, Annalisa', 'Ottaviani, Emanuela', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Astolfi, Annalisa', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Vitale, Antonella', 'Messa, Francesca', 'Impera, Luciana', 'Baldazzi, Carmen', ""D'Addabbo, Pietro"", 'Papayannidis, Cristina', 'Lonoce, Angelo', 'Colarossi, Sabrina', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Piccaluga, Pier Paolo', 'Paolini, Stefania', 'Russo, Domenico', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Foa, Robin', 'Martinelli, Giovanni']","['Iacobucci I', 'Storlazzi CT', 'Cilloni D', 'Lonetti A', 'Ottaviani E', 'Soverini S', 'Astolfi A', 'Chiaretti S', 'Vitale A', 'Messa F', 'Impera L', 'Baldazzi C', ""D'Addabbo P"", 'Papayannidis C', 'Lonoce A', 'Colarossi S', 'Vignetti M', 'Piccaluga PP', 'Paolini S', 'Russo D', 'Pane F', 'Saglio G', 'Baccarani M', 'Foa R', 'Martinelli G']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology L and A Seragnoli S Orsola Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090709,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/07/11 09:00,2009/09/23 06:00,['2009/07/11 09:00'],"['2009/07/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36984-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-08-173963 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Sep 3;114(10):2159-67. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-08-173963.

CPX decreased cell growth and viability of malignant leukemia, myeloma, and solid tumor cell lines as well as primary AML patient samples at low-micromolar concentrations that appear pharmacologically achievable. Furthermore, oral CPX decreased tumor weight and volume in 3 mouse models of leukemia by up to 65% compared with control without evidence of weight loss or gross organ toxicity. In addition, oral CPX prevented the engraftment of primary AML cells in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mouse models, thereby establishing its ability to target leukemia stem cells. Mechanistically, CPX bound intracellular iron, and this intracellular iron chelation was functionally important for its cytotoxicity. By electron paramagnetic resonance, CPX inhibited the iron-dependent enzyme ribonucleotide reductase at concentrations associated with cell death. Thus, in summary, CPX has previously unrecognized anticancer activity at concentrations that are pharmacologically achievable.

This mutation has pleiotropic cellular effects on these myoblasts as demonstrated by nuclear structural defects, exhibiting lobulations which increase with cell passages in culture. The organization of both lamin A/C and its inner nuclear membrane partner emerin are altered, eventually showing a honeycomb pattern upon immunofluorescence microscopy. In addition, the distribution of histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 and of phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, markers of inactive and active chromatin domains, respectively, are altered suggesting an impact on gene expression. Patient myoblasts also presented a high index of senescence in ex vivo culture. Moreover, our data show for the first time in an AD-EDMD context that the 20S core particle of the proteasome was inactivated. With cell passages, the 20S core protein progressively accumulated into discrete nuclear foci that largely colocalized with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies while p21 accumulated throughout the nuclear compartment. Proteasome inactivation has been linked to normal cellular ageing. Our data indicate that it may also contribute to premature senescence in AD-EDMD patient myoblasts. Finally, when transferred to low-serum medium, patient myoblasts were deficient in ex vivo differentiation, as assessed by the absence of myotube formation and myogenin induction. Altogether, these data suggest that the LMNA mutation p.R545C impairs both proliferation and differentiation capacities of myoblasts as part of the pathogenesis of AD-EDMD.","['Kandert, Sebastian', 'Wehnert, Manfred', 'Muller, Clemens R', 'Buendia, Brigitte', 'Dabauvalle, Marie-Christine']","['Kandert S', 'Wehnert M', 'Muller CR', 'Buendia B', 'Dabauvalle MC']","['Division of Electron Microscopy, Biocenter, University of Wurzburg, Am Hubland, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090708,Germany,Eur J Cell Biol,European journal of cell biology,7906240,,2009/07/11 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/11 09:00'],"['2009/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/05 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0171-9335(09)00265-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejcb.2009.06.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cell Biol. 2009 Oct;88(10):593-608. doi: 10.1016/j.ejcb.2009.06.002.

We collected and analyzed over 200 Chinese and English documents from scientific journals, selected newspapers, government publications, and websites pertaining to formaldehyde and its subsequent health effects. Over the last 20 years, China's formaldehyde industry has experienced unprecedented growth, and now produces and consumes one-third of the world's formaldehyde. More than 65% of the Chinese formaldehyde output is used to produce resins mainly found in wood products - the major source of indoor pollution in China. Although the Chinese government has issued a series of standards to regulate formaldehyde exposure, concentrations in homes, office buildings, workshops, public places, and food often exceed the national standards. In addition, there have been numerous reports of formaldehyde-induced health problems, including poisoning and cancer. The lack of quality epidemiological studies and basic data on exposed populations emphasizes the need for more extensive studies on formaldehyde and its related health effects in China.","['Tang, Xiaojiang', 'Bai, Yang', 'Duong, Anh', 'Smith, Martyn T', 'Li, Laiyu', 'Zhang, Luoping']","['Tang X', 'Bai Y', 'Duong A', 'Smith MT', 'Li L', 'Zhang L']","['Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090709,Netherlands,Environ Int,Environment international,7807270,,2009/07/11 09:00,2009/11/13 06:00,['2009/07/11 09:00'],"['2009/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/30 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0160-4120(09)00137-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.envint.2009.06.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Environ Int. 2009 Nov;35(8):1210-24. doi: 10.1016/j.envint.2009.06.002.

Between 1995 and 2006, 23 pediatric patients with MDS were transplanted with unrelated donor umbilical cord blood (UUCB) at our center. The median age was 11.1 years (range: 1.1-19.7), median weight was 38.6 kg (range: 9.6-62.6), 61% of patients were male, and median time from diagnosis to transplant was 6.6 months (range: 2.0-61.4). Patients were followed for a median of 5.3 years (range: 1.6-12.4 years) posttransplant. MDS stage was refractory anemia (RA) in 12, refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) in 8, and refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) in 3 patients; 18 (78%) patients had primary MDS. Monosomy 7 was present in 17(74%) patients. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were excluded. Preparative regimen was total body irradiation (TBI) based in 18 (78%) patients. Graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was cyclosporine (CsA)/steroids (19 patients) or CsA/mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; 4 patients). Grafts were HLA matched at Class I (A and B) at low resolution and Class II (DRB1) at the allelic level, resulting in 16 (70%) 4/6 and 7 (30%) 5/6 matched transplants. The grafts contained a median of 4.0 x 10(7) (range: 1.7-12.6) total nucleated cells (TNC)/kg precryopreservation; 3.6 x 10(7) (range: 1.0-12.0) TNC/kg and 1.7 x 10(5) (range: 0.2-28.5) CD34+ cells/kg were infused. Cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] >500/microL) at day 42 and day 100 was 73.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 55.1%-92.7%) and 91.3% (95% CI 71.3%-100.0%) respectively, and that of platelet engraftment (50 K) at 180 days was 69.6% (95% CI 49.8%-89.4%). Three patients had graft failure whereas 3 patients (13%) engrafted slowly (after day 42). Three patients developed acute GVHD (aGVHD) grades II-IV with a cumulative incidence at 100 days of 13% (95% CI 0.0%-27.1.0%). Four patients relapsed with a cumulative incidence of relapse at 3 years of 13.0% (95% CI 0.0%-27.1%). Cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) at 1 year was 27% (95% CI 8.0%-46.0%). Ten patients died: 3 graft failure, 4 relapse, 2 infections (1 adenovirus, 1 toxoplasmosis), and 1 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lymphoproliferative disorder. Probabilities of event-free survival (EFS) at 1 and 3 years were 69.6% (95% CI 46.6%-84.2%) and 60.9% (95% CI 38.3%-77.4%), respectively. Factors associated with better EFS were age < or = 11 years (P = .05) and weight < or = 38 kg (P = .03). These results, especially in younger patients with monosomy 7 positive MDS, are equivalent to published matched allogeneic bone marrow data.

Recent studies have shown that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess immunomodulatory capacity and may promote hematopoietic engraftment. The purpose of this study was to observe if the new strategy, which included a haploidentical peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) combined with MSCs, modified NMA conditioning, and GVHD prophylaxis would improve donor engraftment and prevent severe GVHD. The modified conditioning approach consisted of fludarabine (Flu), low-dose total body irradiation (TBI), cyclophosphamide (Cy), cytarabine, and anti-Tcell-lymphocyte globulin, whereas the GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporin A (CsA), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), anti-CD25 antibody and intrabone marrow injection of MSCs. Thirty-three patients with high-risk acute leukemia underwent transplantation with PBSC from HLA-haploidentical donors without T cell depletion. All of the patients achieved full donor chimerisms, including 6 who switched to full donor chimerisms from mixed chimerisms in 1 to 2 months after the transplantations. Rapid hematological engraftment was observed with neutrophils >0.5 x 10(9)/L at day 11 and platelets >20 x 10(9)/L at day 14. Fifteen patients (45.5%) developed grade I-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) and only 2 (6.1%) developed grade III to IV aGVHD. Nine (31%) of 29 evaluable patients experienced chronic GVHD (cGVHD). Upon follow-up for 1.5 to 60 months, 20 (60.6%) patients were alive and well and 6 (18.2%) had relapsed leukemia in the 33 patients. The probability of 3-year survival was 57.2%.

To date, the ideal prophylaxis regimen, which minimizes aGVHD and chronic GVHD (cGVHD), but does not abrogate graft-versus-tumor (GVT) response, has not been described. Because tacrolimus is more potent than cyclosporine (CSA), and because mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an effective immunosuppressant that does not lead to mucositis, we hypothesized that a combination of these 2 oral agents may be an effective GVHD prophylactic strategy. We, therefore, designed an outpatient prospective cohort study with a conditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine (Flu) 30 mg/m2 daily and cyclophosphamide (Cy) 300 mg/m2 daily for 5 days followed by infusion of blood stem cells. Tacrolimus 3mg twice a day was started on day (D) -8, adjusted to achieve levels 10-15 nmol/L, continued until D +50 and then tapered by D +100 or +180 according to estimated risk of relapse. MMF 1000 mg twice a day was started on D +1 and discontinued on D +50. To date, 131 patients (males/females: 75/56) with a median age of 54 years have received a 6/6 matched sibling transplant using this protocol. Indication for NMA transplant included age >55 years (24%), expected increased risk of toxicity (28%), or participation in a multiple myeloma (MM) sequential protocol (48%). Most common diagnoses included MM (N = 62), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL, N = 46), and acute leukemia (N = 10). Following infusion of 6.8 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg (range: 0.30-22.3), neutrophil and lymphocyte engraftment occurred in 95% of patients by D +180. The estimated cumulative incidence of classical grade I-IV aGVHD by D +120 was 11.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.1-18.5). No grade IV aGVHD was observed. In addition, 15 patients (12%: CI: 7.4-19.2; median D +140) developed an overlap syndrome consisting of clinical and histologic features of both aGVHD and cGVHD simultaneously. The estimated cumulative incidence of extensive cGVHD was 76.1% (95% CI: 67.4-83.9) at 2 years, with clinical features at presentation similar to other reported series. In patients developing extensive cGVHD, the probability of remaining on immunosuppression at 5 years was 34.8% (95% CI: 16.4-57.3). With a median follow-up of 982 days, the estimated probabilities of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and overall survival (OS) were 15.5% (95% CI: 9.0-26.1) and 62.7% (95% CI: 51.4-72.1). The cumulative incidence of relapse was 30% at 7 years. Following NMA transplant, disease-free survival (DFS) was highest in recipients with follicular NHL (79.8%: 95% CI: 57.6-91.2) and lowest in large cell NHLs (34.3%: 95% CI: 1.6-75.9). From this large group of patients treated with a uniform conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis regimen, we conclude that aGVHD prophylaxis with early use of tacrolimus and MMF is safe, effective, and associated with low NRM.

Basal P-gp ATPase activity was increased by CJX1 with half-maximal activity concentration (Km) of 8.6+/-1.4 microM. Kinetic analysis indicated a non-competitive inhibition of Verapamil (Ver)-stimulated P-gp ATPase activity by CJX1 and competitive inhibition of CJX1-stimulated P-gp ATPase activity by tetrandrine (Tet). The effect of CsA on CJX1-stimulated and Ver-stimulated P-gp ATPase activity was non-competitive and competitive inhibition, respectively. These findings implying that CJX1 and Tet can bind P-gp either on overlapping sites or distinct but interacting sites, while CJX1 and Ver as well as CsA can bind P-gp on separated sites in K562/DOX cells. Furthermore, the combined effect of CJX1 and Ver has been evaluated isobolographically in numerous fixed-ratio combinations of 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:10 in K562/DOX cells. The results show that mixtures of both drugs at these fixed-ratios exerted synergistic interactions, indicating that when the two reverses that bind P-gp on separated sites are combined, each can contribute to the overall interaction with P-gp, leading to the greater effect than that by either agent alone.","['Ji, Bian-Sheng', 'He, Ling']","['Ji BS', 'He L']","['Institute of Pharmacy, Henan University, Kaifeng 475001, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090707,England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,,2009/07/11 09:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/07/11 09:00'],"['2008/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/17 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S1065-6995(09)00166-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellbi.2009.06.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2009 Oct;33(10):1073-8. doi: 10.1016/j.cellbi.2009.06.023.

The prognosis of patients with intermediate- or high-risk MDS is very poor. This is due to the fact that standard therapeutic options are largely palliative. Neither autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) nor chemotherapeutic regimens have been shown to prolong survival in patients with MDS. Allogeneic SCT, while potentially curative, is only available to a selected group of patients and is associated with high morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, which constitute the majority of patients with MDS. Hypermethylation of tumor-suppressor genes has been invoked as an important pathogenetic mechanism in MDS. The pyrimidine nucleoside analog azacitidine, which inhibits DNA methyltransferases, has recently become the first therapeutic to prolong survival in patients with MDS, thus changing the natural history of these malignancies. The activity of azacitidine in MDS has spurred the development of combinations of this agent with other epigenetic modifiers for the treatment of MDS and AML.","['Cataldo, Vince D', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso']","['Cataldo VD', 'Cortes J', 'Quintas-Cardama A']","['Hematology/Oncology Clinic, 8595 Picardy Avenue, Suite 400, Baton Rouge, LA 70809, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,,2009/07/11 09:00,2009/09/26 06:00,['2009/07/11 09:00'],"['2009/07/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/era.09.61 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2009 Jul;9(7):875-84. doi: 10.1586/era.09.61.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/mortality/physiopathology', 'Prognosis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Survival Rate']",,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,55,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While nearly every malignancy has been described to metastasize to the breast; melanoma, lymphoma and leukemia tend to be the most common. Among these primary tumors, melanoma metastasis represents a diagnostic pitfall for both the clinicians and histopathologists. METHODS: We report a case of widely metastatic malignant melanoma with diagnostic difficulties in both clinical and histopathological evaluation. Thorax CT, Abdominal MRI, tumor marker screening and two biopsies were performed to conclude the primary. RESULTS: In clinical evaluation, there were rapidly proliferating multiple nodular lesions at the skin, breasts, lungs, ovaries and peritoneum accompanied by only increased CA 125 in tumor marker panel. The initial biopsy performed from a skin nodule was concordant with a metastatic carcinoma suggesting breast as the primary. The diagnosis was made by immunohistochemical staining of the second biopsy performed from a breast nodule. CONCLUSION: Although no strict clinical criteria exist to differentiate a melanoma metastasis to the breast from a primary breast carcinoma atypically rapid growth, normal Ca 15-3 level, and a history of prior melanoma may be helpful. However, it may be still misdiagnosed in some cases even histopathologically if the immunohistochemical staining is not performed.","['Bahat, Gulistan', 'Colak, Yasar', 'Saka, Bulent', 'Karan, Mehmet Akif', 'Buyukbabani, Nesimi']","['Bahat G', 'Colak Y', 'Saka B', 'Karan MA', 'Buyukbabani N']","['Istanbul University, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Internal Medicine, 34390, Capa, Istanbul, Turkey. gbahatozturk@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Cancer Detect Prev,Cancer detection and prevention,7704778,,2009/07/10 09:00,2009/08/21 09:00,['2009/07/10 09:00'],"['2009/07/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/21 09:00 [medline]']","['S1877-7821(09)00027-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canep.2009.04.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Detect Prev. 2009;32(5-6):458-61. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2009.04.001.,,IM,"['Adult', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/*secondary', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Melanoma/diagnosis/*secondary', 'Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/*pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, reports summarizing diagnosis and outcome of IAL in developing countries are limited. METHODS: Five hundred ninety seven pediatric patients were diagnosed with acute leukemia in our hospital between January 1997 and June 2008, of which 19 were younger than 12 months. Data from our 19 cases and the Chinese literature were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 19 cases, 14 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 5 had acute myeloid leukemia (AML) based on FAB classification. Immunophenotyping and molecular genetic analysis were performed in only 6 cases. Only 16% (3/19) of the infants received treatment. Two infants with immunophenotypic AML who abandoned treatment achieved spontaneous remission without chemotherapy within 2 and 4 months respectively. Combining our data with those from Chinese literature, less than one third of the infants had immunophenotypic and genetic verification of leukemia and 29% (18/63) of them received treatment. CONCLUSION: Family financial difficulties and physicians' lack of confidence in treatment outcome in IAL contributed to a high treatment abandonment rate and poor outcome. Public health insurance as well as physician education on current IAL treatment strategies may decrease treatment abandonment in China.","['Huang, Li-Bin', 'Guan, Xiao-Qing', 'Zhang, Ying-Chuan', 'Zhang, Xiao-Li', 'Ke, Zhi-Yong', 'Luo, Xue-Qun']","['Huang LB', 'Guan XQ', 'Zhang YC', 'Zhang XL', 'Ke ZY', 'Luo XQ']","['Department of Pediatric, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Zhongshan Er Lu, Guangzhou 510080, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,2009/07/10 09:00,2009/10/14 06:00,['2009/07/10 09:00'],"['2009/07/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22145 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Dec;53(6):973-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22145.,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because RMS tumors are highly vascularized, we sought to determine which factors secreted by RMS cells are crucial in stimulating angiogenesis in response to hypoxia. To address this issue, we evaluated expression of several proangiogenic factors [interleukin (IL)-8, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, stromal-derived factor (SDF)-1, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)] in 8 human RMS cell lines in both normal steady-state and hypoxic conditions. We found by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) and confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that from all the factors evaluated, IL-8, whose expression is very low in normoxia, had been very highly expressed and secreted by RMS cells lines during hypoxic conditions ( approximately 40-170 times). Interestingly, this upregulation was not affected by knocking down hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, but was inhibited by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)p42/44 and phosphatidylinositaol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway inhibitors. This suggests that IL-8 expression is regulated in an activating protein (AP)-1- and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that conditioned media (CM) harvested from RMS cells exposed to hypoxia activated and stimulated chemotactic responses in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and that IL-8 was responsible for hypoxia-related effects. Finally, by employing shRNA, the expression of IL-8 in human RH-30 cells was downregulated. We noticed that such RMS cells, if injected into skeletal muscles of immunodeficient mice, have a reduced ability for tumor formation. We conclude that IL-8 is a pivotal proangiogenic factor released by human RMS cells in hypoxic conditions and that the targeting of IL-8 may prove to be a novel and efficient strategy for inhibiting RMS growth.","['Wysoczynski, Marcin', 'Shin, Dong-Myung', 'Kucia, Magda', 'Ratajczak, Mariusz Z']","['Wysoczynski M', 'Shin DM', 'Kucia M', 'Ratajczak MZ']","['James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, KY 40202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,PMC4021846,2009/07/10 09:00,2010/01/14 06:00,['2009/07/10 09:00'],"['2009/07/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24732 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2010 Jan 15;126(2):371-81. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24732.,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia', 'Interleukin-8/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/genetics/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction', '*Up-Regulation', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,"['R01 CA106281/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA106281-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK074720/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS578205'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this respect, it regulates pivotal cell surface events, including trans-membrane signaling, and plays an essential role in carcinogenesis. In this report, we demonstrated that acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphoblasts (primary cells from patients and cell lines) are characterized by a marked down-regulation of Neu3 in terms of both gene expression (-30 to 40%) and enzymatic activity toward ganglioside GD1a (-25.6 to 30.6%), when compared with cells from healthy controls. Induced overexpression of Neu3 in the ALL-cell line, MOLT-4, led to a significant increase of ceramide (+66%) and to a parallel decrease of lactosylceramide (-55%). These events strongly guided lymphoblasts to apoptosis, as we assessed by the decrease in Bcl2/Bax ratio, the accumulation of Neu3 transfected cells in the sub G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle, the enhanced annexin-V positivity, the higher cleavage of procaspase-3. Therefore, the reduced expression of Neu3 in ALL could help lymphoblasts to survive, maintaining the cellular content of ceramide below a critical level. Interestingly, we found that Neu3 activity varied in relation to disease progression, increasing in clinical remission after chemotherapy, and decreasing again in patients that relapsed. In addition, a negative correlation was observed between Neu3 expression and the percentage of the ALL marker 9-OAcGD3 positive cells. Consequently, Neu3 could represent a new potent biomarker in childhood ALL, to assess the efficacy of therapeutic protocols and to rapidly identify an eventual relapse.","['Mandal, Chandan', 'Tringali, Cristina', 'Mondal, Susmita', 'Anastasia, Luigi', 'Chandra, Sarmila', 'Venerando, Bruno', 'Mandal, Chitra']","['Mandal C', 'Tringali C', 'Mondal S', 'Anastasia L', 'Chandra S', 'Venerando B', 'Mandal C']","['Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,2009/07/10 09:00,2010/01/14 06:00,['2009/07/10 09:00'],"['2009/07/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24733 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2010 Jan 15;126(2):337-49. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24733.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Sphingolipids)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (NEU2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neu3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'GZP2782OP0 (N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorometry', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/enzymology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'N-Acetylneuraminic Acid/metabolism', 'Neuraminidase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sphingolipids/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cagA-encoded CagA protein is delivered into gastric epithelial cells and, upon tyrosine phosphorylation at the C-terminal EPIYA segments, binds and deregulates SHP-2 oncoprotein. On the basis of the differential alignment of the EPIYA segments, CagA can be subdivided into Western CagA, which is produced by H. pylori isolated in Western countries, and East Asian CagA, which is produced by H. pylori circulating in East Asian countries. Western CagA contains EPIYA-A, EPIYA-B and variable numbers of EPIYA-C segments, whereas East Asian CagA contains EPIYA-A, EPIYA-B and variable numbers of EPIYA-D segments. Upon tyrosine phosphorylation, EPIYA-C and EPIYA-D, respectively, serve as low-affinity and high-affinity SHP-2-binding sites. We previously reported that systemic expression of East Asian CagA (CagA-ABDD) induces gastrointestinal and hematopoietic malignancies in mice. In this study, we generated transgenic mice that systemically express Western CagA (CagA-ABCCC), the levels of which are comparable to those in mice expressing East Asian CagA. The mice developed gastric epithelial hypertrophy and gastrointestinal tumors and also showed lymphoid abnormality but not myeloid abnormalities such as granulocytosis and myeloid leukemia found in mice carrying East Asian CagA. The incidence of tumors in mice expressing Western CagA was significantly lower than that in mice expressing East Asian CagA. Our results indicate that Western CagA is qualitatively less oncogenic than East Asian CagA. Differential oncogenic potential of geographically distinct CagA isoforms may contribute to the differential prevalence of gastric carcinoma between East Asian countries and Western countries.","['Miura, Motohiro', 'Ohnishi, Naomi', 'Tanaka, Shinya', 'Yanagiya, Kohei', 'Hatakeyama, Masanori']","['Miura M', 'Ohnishi N', 'Tanaka S', 'Yanagiya K', 'Hatakeyama M']","['Division of Molecular Oncology, Institute for Genetic Medicine, Graduate School of Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,2009/07/10 09:00,2009/11/07 06:00,['2009/07/10 09:00'],"['2009/07/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24740 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2009 Dec 1;125(11):2497-504. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24740.,"['0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (cagA protein, Helicobacter pylori)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*microbiology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Bacterial/*physiology', 'Bacterial Proteins/*physiology', 'Far East', 'Female', 'Helicobacter Infections/*microbiology', 'Helicobacter pylori/*pathogenicity', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*microbiology', 'Western World']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in RPS19 coding sequences have been found in 25% of DBA patients, but not in TEC patients. It has been suggested that non-coding RPS19 sequence variants contribute to the considerable clinical variability in red cell aplasia. We therefore aimed at identifying non-coding variations associated with DBA or TEC phenotypes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We targeted a region of 19'980 bp encompassing the RPS19 gene in a cohort of 89 DBA and TEC patients for resequencing. We provide here a catalog of the considerable, previously unrecognized degree of variation in this region. We identified 73 variations (65 SNPs, 8 indels) that all are located outside of the RPS19 open reading frame, and of which 67.1% are classified as novel. We hypothesize that specific alleles in non-coding regions of RPS19 could alter the binding of regulatory proteins or transcription factors. Therefore, we carried out an extensive analysis to identify transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). A series of putative interaction sites coincide with detected variants. Sixteen of the corresponding transcription factors are of particular interest, as they are housekeeping genes or show a direct link to hematopoiesis, tumorigenesis or leukemia (e.g. GATA-1/2, PU.1, MZF-1). CONCLUSIONS: Specific alleles at predicted TFBSs may alter the expression of RPS19, modify an important interaction between transcription factors with overlapping TFBS or remove an important stimulus for hematopoiesis. We suggest that the detected interactions are of importance for hematopoiesis and could provide new insights into individual response to treatment.","['Martinez Barrio, Alvaro', 'Eriksson, Oskar', 'Badhai, Jitendra', 'Frojmark, Anne-Sophie', 'Bongcam-Rudloff, Erik', 'Dahl, Niklas', 'Schuster, Jens']","['Martinez Barrio A', 'Eriksson O', 'Badhai J', 'Frojmark AS', 'Bongcam-Rudloff E', 'Dahl N', 'Schuster J']","['The Linnaeus Centre for Bioinformatics Uppsala University/Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20090709,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC2703794,2009/07/10 09:00,2009/11/11 06:00,['2009/07/10 09:00'],"['2009/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0006172 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Jul 9;4(7):e6172. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0006172.,"['0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ribosomal protein S19)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Anemia, Diamond-Blackfan/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Ribosomal Proteins/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",,,"['R01 HL079567/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01-HL079567-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methylation values allowed separation of untreated FL samples from controls with one exception, based primarily on tumour-specific gains of methylation typically occurring within CpG islands. Genes that are targets for epigenetic repression in stem cells by Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 were significantly over-represented among hypermethylated genes. Methylation profiles were conserved in sequential FL and t-FL biopsies, suggesting that widespread methylation represents an early event in lymphomagenesis and may not contribute substantially to transformation. A significant (P<0.05) correlation between FL methylation values and reduced gene expression was shown for up to 28% of loci. Methylation changes occurred predominantly in B cells with variability in the amount of non-malignant tissue between samples preventing conclusive correlation with survival. This represents an important caveat in attributing prognostic relevance to methylation and future studies in cancer will optimally require purified tumour populations to address the impact of methylation on clinical outcome.","[""O'Riain, C"", ""O'Shea, D M"", 'Yang, Y', 'Le Dieu, R', 'Gribben, J G', 'Summers, K', 'Yeboah-Afari, J', 'Bhaw-Rosun, L', 'Fleischmann, C', 'Mein, C A', 'Crook, T', 'Smith, P', 'Kelly, G', 'Rosenwald, A', 'Ott, G', 'Campo, E', 'Rimsza, L M', 'Smeland, E B', 'Chan, W C', 'Johnson, N', 'Gascoyne, R D', 'Reimer, S', 'Braziel, R M', 'Wright, G W', 'Staudt, L M', 'Lister, T A', 'Fitzgibbon, J']","[""O'Riain C"", ""O'Shea DM"", 'Yang Y', 'Le Dieu R', 'Gribben JG', 'Summers K', 'Yeboah-Afari J', 'Bhaw-Rosun L', 'Fleischmann C', 'Mein CA', 'Crook T', 'Smith P', 'Kelly G', 'Rosenwald A', 'Ott G', 'Campo E', 'Rimsza LM', 'Smeland EB', 'Chan WC', 'Johnson N', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Reimer S', 'Braziel RM', 'Wright GW', 'Staudt LM', 'Lister TA', 'Fitzgibbon J']","['Centre for Medical Oncology, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Institute of Cancer, London EC1M 6BQ, UK. c.l.oriain@qmul.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090709,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC2762475,2009/07/10 09:00,2009/11/06 06:00,['2009/07/10 09:00'],"['2009/07/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009114 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.114 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Oct;23(10):1858-66. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.114.

In this study, we show that malignant plasma cells and T lymphocytes from multiple myeloma (MM) bone disease patients, as well as Karpas 909, a human myeloma cell line, directly produce DcR3. By interacting with FasL, this molecule could inhibit OC apoptosis. In fact, the use of a neutralizing anti-DcR3 antibody induces a reduction of cell viability with a consequent increase of apoptotic cell number, the activation of caspase-8 and -3, and DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, we show that DcR3 supports OC formation in samples from MM patients through the upregulation of RANKL and TNFalpha by T lymphocytes and only TNFalpha by CD14+ cells. In conclusion, our data provide the first evidence of the expression of DcR3 in MM, and the involvement of this molecule in supporting the survival and formation of OCs from MM bone disease patients.

Recent studies show that almost every multiple myeloma (MM) case is preceded by an MGUS stage. Interestingly, prevalence and incidence patterns for MGUS and MM show striking disparity patterns across ethnic/racial groups, most notably the two- to threefold increase in both these disorders in African Americans compared with Caucasians. In contrast, studies on Asian patients show lower prevalence/incidence for MGUS/MM compared with Caucasians. Familial aggregation for both MGUS and MM has been observed; the risk for MGUS or MM in family members with these disorders is increased about two- to three fold compared with the general population. Although underlying mechanisms remain unclear, there is evidence of heterogeneity among MGUS patients from different ethnic/racial groups. For example, compared with Caucasians, African-American and African MGUS patients have reportedly lower rates of immunoglobulin M (IgM) MGUS (versus IgG/IgA MGUS) and higher rates of unquantifiable immunoglobulins (Igs).

In this report, we show that the basic helix-loop-helix factor, TAL1 (T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 1), is a negative regulator of the hTERT promoter. Indeed, TAL1 overexpression leads to a decrease in hTERT mRNA abundance and hence to reduced telomerase activity. Conversely, suppression of TAL1 by RNA interference in Jurkat cells increases hTERT expression. Analysis by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that TAL1 binds to the hTERT proximal promoter and recruits HDAC1. Considering the relationship recently established between TAL1 and the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax protein, which was confirmed in T lymphocyte clones derived from adult T-cell leukemia patients, we analyzed the effect of TAL1 with respect to the earlier characterized effects of Tax and HBZ (HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper) on hTERT expression. TAL1 was observed to reinforce the negative effect of Tax, whereas hTERT transactivation by the HBZ-JunD complex was repressed by TAL1 overexpression. Moreover, HBZ was found to induce proteasome-mediated degradation of TAL1. These observations support a model in which Tax and TAL1 by repressing hTERT would initially favor genomic instability, whereas expression of factors such as HBZ allows at a later stage an increase in hTERT production and consequently in telomerase activity.","['Terme, J-M', 'Mocquet, V', 'Kuhlmann, A-S', 'Zane, L', 'Mortreux, F', 'Wattel, E', 'Duc Dodon, M', 'Jalinot, P']","['Terme JM', 'Mocquet V', 'Kuhlmann AS', 'Zane L', 'Mortreux F', 'Wattel E', 'Duc Dodon M', 'Jalinot P']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire de la Cellule, Unite Mixte de Recherche 5239, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Institut Federatif de Recherche, Lyon cedex 07, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090709,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2009/07/10 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/10 09:00'],"['2009/07/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009131 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.131 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Nov;23(11):2081-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.131.

We analyzed 1227 diagnostic and follow-up samples in 252 NPM1-mutated AML patients with 17 different NPM1 mutation-specific real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) assays. Paired diagnostic/relapse samples of 84 patients revealed stable NPM1 mutations in all cases, suggesting that they are pathogenetically early events and thus applicable for minimal residual disease detection. A total of 47 relapses were predictable because of an NPM1 mutation level (%NPM1/ABL1) increase of at least 1 log or in 15 cases because of NPM1 mutation levels not decreasing less than 3 log ranges. A high prognostic value of NPM1 levels was shown for 4 different intervals after therapy was initiated. Furthermore, thresholds of 0.1 and 0.01%NPM1/ABL1 during/after treatment discriminated between prognostic subgroups. Univariate analyses, including age, white blood cell count, blast count, CD34 positivity, FLT3 mutations status, FAB type, karyotype, NPM1 mutation type, and pretreatment NPM1 mutational level, showed that, besides NPM1 mutation level, only age and FLT3-LM mutation status were prognostically significant for EFS. Multivariate analysis, including age, FLT3-LM status, and NPM1 mutation level at different time points, demonstrated that NPM1 level was the most relevant prognostic factor during first-line treatment. Similar results were obtained in patients undergoing second-line chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","['Schnittger, Susanne', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Tschulik, Claudia', 'Weiss, Tamara', 'Dicker, Frank', 'Falini, Brunangelo', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Schnittger S', 'Kern W', 'Tschulik C', 'Weiss T', 'Dicker F', 'Falini B', 'Haferlach C', 'Haferlach T']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany. susanne.schnittger@mll-online.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20090708,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/07/10 09:00,2009/09/30 06:00,['2009/07/10 09:00'],"['2009/07/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36937-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-03-213389 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Sep 10;114(11):2220-31. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-03-213389.

These different studies gave unique names to the identified groups and no study has yet integrated all the available sequences. Thus, we hypothesized that many of the different groups previously identified actually correspond to a limited group of genotypes that are unevenly distributed worldwide. To examine this hypothesis, we sequenced the env gene from 28 BLV field strains and compared these sequences to 46 env sequences that represent all the genetic groupings already identified. By using phylogenetic analyses, we recovered six clades, or genotypes, that we have called genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Genotypes 1-5 have counterparts among the sequence groupings identified previously. One env sequence did not cluster with any of the others and was highly divergent when compared with the six genotypes identified here. Thus, an extra genotype, which we named 7, may exist. Similarity comparisons were highly congruent with phylogenetic analyses.

They can be induced during human prenatal development upon exposure to etoposide. We also hypothesize that chronic exposure to etoposide might render cells more susceptible to other genomic insults. Here, for the first time, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were used as a model to test the effects of etoposide on human early embryonic development. We addressed whether: (i) low doses of etoposide promote MLL rearrangements in hESCs and hESCs-derived hematopoietic cells; (ii) MLL rearrangements are sufficient to confer hESCs with a selective growth advantage and (iii) continuous exposure to low doses of etoposide induces hESCs to acquire other chromosomal abnormalities. In contrast to cord blood-derived CD34(+) and hESC-derived hematopoietic cells, exposure of undifferentiated hESCs to a single low dose of etoposide induced a pronounced cell death. Etoposide induced MLL rearrangements in hESCs and their hematopoietic derivatives. After long-term culture, the proportion of hESCs harboring MLL rearrangements diminished and neither cell cycle variations nor genomic abnormalities were observed in the etoposide-treated hESCs, suggesting that MLL rearrangements are insufficient to confer hESCs with a selective proliferation/survival advantage. However, continuous exposure to etoposide induced MLL breaks and primed hESCs to acquire other major karyotypic abnormalities. These data show that chronic exposure of developmentally early stem cells to etoposide induces MLL rearrangements and make hESCs more prone to acquire other chromosomal abnormalities than postnatal CD34(+) cells, linking embryonic genotoxic exposure to genomic instability.","['Bueno, Clara', 'Catalina, Purificacion', 'Melen, Gustavo J', 'Montes, Rosa', 'Sanchez, Laura', 'Ligero, Gertrudis', 'Garcia-Perez, Jose L', 'Menendez, Pablo']","['Bueno C', 'Catalina P', 'Melen GJ', 'Montes R', 'Sanchez L', 'Ligero G', 'Garcia-Perez JL', 'Menendez P']","['Andalusian Stem Cell Bank, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica, Parque Tecnologico de la Salud, University of Granada, Granada 18100 Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090708,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,,2009/07/10 09:00,2009/09/16 06:00,['2009/07/10 09:00'],"['2009/07/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['bgp169 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgp169 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2009 Sep;30(9):1628-37. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgp169.

The mitochondrial pathway is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which consists of both pro- and antiapoptotic members. To determine the relative importance of the multidomain proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bak and Bax, HeLa cells were transfected with Bak and/or Bax small interfering RNA (siRNA) and subsequently infected with recombinant wild-type VSV. Our results showed that Bak is more important than Bax for the induction of apoptosis in this system. Bak is regulated by two antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, Mcl-1, which is rapidly turned over, and Bcl-X(L), which is relatively stable. Inhibition of host gene expression by the VSV M protein resulted in the degradation of Mcl-1 but not Bcl-X(L). However, inactivation of both Mcl-1 and Bcl-X(L) was required for cells to undergo apoptosis. While inactivation of Mcl-1 was due to inhibition of its expression, inactivation of Bcl-X(L) indicates a role for one or more BH3-only Bcl-2 family members. VSV-induced apoptosis was inhibited by transfection with siRNA against Bid, a BH3-only protein that is normally activated by the cleavage of caspase-8, the initiator caspase associated with the death receptor pathway. Similarly, treatment with an inhibitor of caspase-8 inhibited VSV-induced apoptosis. These results indicate a role for cross talk from the death receptor pathway in the activation of the mitochondrial pathway by VSV.","['Pearce, Alicia F', 'Lyles, Douglas S']","['Pearce AF', 'Lyles DS']","['Department of Biochemistry, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090708,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC2738225,2009/07/10 09:00,2009/10/03 06:00,['2009/07/10 09:00'],"['2009/07/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/03 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00436-09 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00436-09 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2009 Sep;83(18):9102-12. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00436-09.

This suppression leads to incomplete virus clearance and the establishment of virus persistence. We now show that Treg-mediated suppression of CD8(+) T cells is tissue specific, occurring in the spleen but not the liver. Regardless of infection status, there was a 5-fold lower proportion of Tregs in the liver than in the spleen, much lower absolute cell numbers, and the relatively few Tregs present expressed less CD25. Results indicated that reduced expression of CD25 on liver Tregs was due to microenvironmental factors including low levels of IL-2 production by CD4(+) Th cells in that tissue. Low CD25 expression on liver Tregs did not impair their ability to suppress CD8(+) T cells in vitro. Correlating with the decreased proportion of Tregs in the liver was a significantly increased proportion of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells compared with the spleen. The virus-specific CD8(+) T cells from the liver did not appear suppressed given that they produced both IFN-gamma and granzyme B, and they also showed evidence of recent cytolytic activity (CD107a(+)). The functional phenotype of the virus-specific CD8(+) T cells correlated with a 10-fold reduction of chronic Friend virus levels in the liver compared with the spleen. Thus, suppression of CD8(+) T cells by virus-induced Tregs occurs in a tissue-specific manner and correlates with profound effects on localized levels of chronic infection.","['Myers, Lara', 'Messer, Ronald J', 'Carmody, Aaron B', 'Hasenkrug, Kim J']","['Myers L', 'Messer RJ', 'Carmody AB', 'Hasenkrug KJ']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT 59840, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20090708,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,PMC2775420,2009/07/10 09:00,2009/08/07 09:00,['2009/07/10 09:00'],"['2009/07/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/07 09:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.0900350 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0900350 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2009 Aug 1;183(3):1636-43. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0900350.

From an initial cohort of 58 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with this translocation, breakpoint mapping with fluorescence in situ hybridization on 26 of them revealed breakpoint heterogeneity of both chromosomes. PAX5 has been proposed to be the target gene on 9p, while for 20q, FISH analysis implicated the involvement of the ASXL1 gene, either by a breakpoint within (n=4) or centromeric (deletion, n=12) of the gene. Molecular copy-number counting, long-distance inverse PCR and direct sequence analysis identified six dic(9;20) breakpoint sequences.

In leukemia, the resistant cells remaining in the bone marrow and/or peripheral blood constitute minimal residual disease and are detectable by highly sensitive assays when the patient appears to be in complete remission. Early detection of the expansion of residual cells permits clinical intervention with the aim of reversing the proliferation of resistant leukemic cells. Therefore, accurate and precise measurement of minimal residual disease can greatly enhance optimization of oncology patients' clinical management. This notion is supported by a large body of data among chronic myeloid leukemia patients, but minimal residual disease detection and monitoring is increasingly applied to other types of leukemia, and is starting to be a factor in decision-making for some therapeutic trials in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here, from the solid ground of minimal residual disease detection in chronic myeloid leukemia, the current state of the art and development of molecular techniques in other leukemias and the growing field of multiparameter flow cytometry are reviewed in two separate parts reporting on the respective advances, advantages and pitfalls of these emerging methods.","['Bene, Marie C', 'Kaeda, Jaspal S']","['Bene MC', 'Kaeda JS']","['Immunology, CHU & Nancy Universite, France. marie-christine.bene@medecine.uhp-nancy.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090707,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC2719036,2009/07/10 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/10 09:00'],"['2009/07/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2008.004267 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2008.004267 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Aug;94(8):1135-50. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2008.004267.

SETTING: Italy, Taranto province (581,508 inhabitants). DESIGN: incidence data in 29 municipalities of the Taranto province were extracted from the Jonico Salentino Cancer Registry (RTJS) for the following cancer sites: lung (ICDX C33-C34); pleura, pleuric mesothelioma (ICDX C45.0); bladder, malignancies only (ICDX C67); brain (ICDX C70-72); non-Hodgkin lymphoma (ICDX C82-85, C96); leukaemia (ICDX C91-5). Age standardized incidence rates for the whole province were computed. High-level risk areas were classified using a Poisson model, computing area-specific p-values associated to the null hypothesis of no increased risk (i.e. relative risk equal to 1). A hierarchical spatial Bayesian model was estimated to strengthen results: specifically two additional variance components, accounting for relative risk spatial autocorrelation and excess heterogeneity respectively, were considered in the model specification. Bayesian mapping of disease incidence allows for the drawing of regularized (smoothed) maps. To adjust for the effect of socio-economic deprivation, a five-variable index was introduced into the model as an ecological covariate. RESULTS: an increased risk of lung, pleura and bladder cancer was observed among male residents in the city of Taranto (respectively: SIR 1.24, p-value < 0.01; SIR: 2.21, p-value < 0.01; SIR 1.28, p-value < 0.01). For non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a significant value was observed in the city of Taranto for males (SIR 1.46, p-value < 0.01), as well as in the neighbouring area of Pulsano for females (SIR 3.88, p-value < 0.01). An unexpected increased risk of brain cancer was found in both sexe risk (especially among males) of lung, pleura and bladder cancer is likely related to the chemical pollutants and asbestos, due to the presence of many industries and shipyards in the city of Taranto.","['Graziano, Giusi', 'Bilancia, Massimo', 'Bisceglia, Lucia', 'de Nichilo, Gigliola', 'Pollice, Alessio', 'Assennato, Giorgio']","['Graziano G', 'Bilancia M', 'Bisceglia L', 'de Nichilo G', 'Pollice A', 'Assennato G']","['Osservatorio epidemiologico regionale, Regione Puglia. graziano@dss.uniba.it']",['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Italy,Epidemiol Prev,Epidemiologia e prevenzione,8902507,,2009/07/10 09:00,2009/08/15 09:00,['2009/07/10 09:00'],"['2009/07/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/15 09:00 [medline]']",['2009/E&P1-2/E&P1-2_037_art3.pdf [pii]'],ppublish,Epidemiol Prev. 2009 Jan-Apr;33(1-2):37-44.,"['0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', '0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Medical Records', 'Mesothelioma/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Pleural Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical/toxicity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Analisi statistica dell'incidenza di alcune patologie tumorali nella provincia di Taranto 1999-2001.,,,,

Median interval between last administration of GO and allo-HSCT was 4.2 (range, 0.8-26.3) months. At time of allo-HSCT, 33 patients were in CR. The majority of patients (n=36) received a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen before allo-HSCT. All but one patient received low-dose heparin for veno-occlusive disease (VOD) prophylaxis. With a median follow-up of 15 (range, 1.1-63) months, overall survival and disease-free survival after allo-HSCT were 45% (95% confidence interval (CI), 30-61%) and 38% (95% CI, 24-54%) at 2 years, respectively. The cumulative incidence of grade 3-4 hyperbilirubinemia was 13.5% (n=6), with this being 21% in patients with a short (< or =3.5 months) GO-allo-HSCT interval (n=4/19) vs 8% in all others (P=NS).

Overexpression of the mTOR signaling pathway has been described in several tumor cells, including the majority of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases. The anti-tumor efficacy of mTOR inhibitors was shown in several preclinical and clinical studies. In AML, however, the potential antineoplastic effect of mTOR inhibitors has received little attention thus far. In this in-vitro study of the human AML cell line, HL-60, we aimed to assess the antileukemic activity of rapamycin (RAPA), an mTOR inhibitor, alone and in combination with cytarabine (Ara-C). The study showed that RAPA in concentrations of 1-10 nmol/l arrested the cell cycle progression of Hl-60 cells in the G1 phase, without evident cytotoxic effect. This effect was associated with significant inhibition of cyclin E expression. At concentrations higher than 10 nmol/l, RAPA exerted a significant proapoptotic effect, with the collapse of mitochondrial potential and caspase-3 activation. The most prominent proapoptotic effect was observed for a combination of 1 nmol/l of RAPA and 50 nmol/l of Ara-C, especially when Ara-C was added at a 24-h interval after RAPA. In conclusion, these data indicate that RAPA might be effective in the treatment of acute leukemia patients, especially in combination with Ara-C, the drug routinely used in AML treatment. On the basis of these results, attempts to combine classical induction chemotherapy with an inhibitor of the mTOR kinase in AML treatment could be warranted.","['Janus, Agnieszka', 'Linke, Anna', 'Cebula, Barbara', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Smolewski, Piotr']","['Janus A', 'Linke A', 'Cebula B', 'Robak T', 'Smolewski P']","['Departments of aHematology bExperimental Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,,2009/07/09 09:00,2009/10/17 06:00,['2009/07/09 09:00'],"['2009/07/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0b013e32832e89b4 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2009 Sep;20(8):693-701. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e32832e89b4.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (EIF4EBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/metabolism', 'Sirolimus/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using retroviral mutagenesis, we identified genes that generate LSCs in collaboration with genetic disruption of the gene encoding interferon response factor 8 (Irf8), which induces a myeloproliferation in vivo. Among the targeted genes, we identified Mef2c, encoding a MCM1-agamous-deficiens-serum response factor transcription factor, and confirmed that overexpression induced a myelomonocytic leukemia in cooperation with Irf8 deficiency. Strikingly, several of the genes identified in our screen have been reported to be up-regulated in the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) subtype. High MEF2C expression levels were confirmed in acute myelogenous leukemia patient samples with MLL gene disruptions, prompting an investigation of the causal interplay. Using a conditional mouse strain, we demonstrated that Mef2c deficiency does not impair the establishment or maintenance of LSCs generated in vitro by MLL/ENL fusion proteins; however, its loss led to compromised homing and invasiveness of the tumor cells. Mef2c-dependent targets included several genes encoding matrix metalloproteinases and chemokine ligands and receptors, providing a mechanistic link to increased homing and motility. Thus, MEF2C up-regulation may be responsible for the aggressive nature of this leukemia subtype.","['Schwieger, Maike', 'Schuler, Andrea', 'Forster, Martin', 'Engelmann, Afra', 'Arnold, Michael A', 'Delwel, Ruud', 'Valk, Peter J', 'Lohler, Jurgen', 'Slany, Robert K', 'Olson, Eric N', 'Stocking, Carol']","['Schwieger M', 'Schuler A', 'Forster M', 'Engelmann A', 'Arnold MA', 'Delwel R', 'Valk PJ', 'Lohler J', 'Slany RK', 'Olson EN', 'Stocking C']","['Heinrich-Pette-Institute, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090707,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/07/09 09:00,2009/10/23 06:00,['2009/07/09 09:00'],"['2009/07/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36917-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-05-158196 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Sep 17;114(12):2476-88. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-05-158196.

In ATL, chemotherapeutic responses are generally poor, which has suggested the existence of chemotherapy-resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs). To identify CSC candidates in ATL, we have focused on a Tax transgenic mouse (Tax-Tg) model, which reproduces ATL-like disease both in Tax-Tg animals and also after transfer of Tax-Tg splenic lymphomatous cells (SLCs) to nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice. Using a limiting dilution transplantation, it was estimated that one CSC existed per 10(4) SLCs (0.01%). In agreement with this, we have successfully identified candidate CSCs in a side population (0.06%), which overlapped with a minor population of CD38(-)/CD71(-)/CD117(+) cells (0.03%). Whereas lymphoma did not develop after transplantation of 10(2) SLCs, 10(2) CSCs could consistently regenerate the original lymphoma. In addition, lymphoma and CSCs could also be demonstrated in the bone marrow and CD117(+) CSCs were observed in both osteoblastic and vascular niches. In the CSCs, Tax, Notch1, and Bmi1 expression was down-regulated, suggesting that the CSCs were derived from Pro-T cells or early hematopoietic progenitor cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that CSCs certainly exist and have the potential to regenerate lymphoma in our mouse model.","['Yamazaki, Jumpei', 'Mizukami, Takuo', 'Takizawa, Kazuya', 'Kuramitsu, Madoka', 'Momose, Haruka', 'Masumi, Atsuko', 'Ami, Yasushi', 'Hasegawa, Hideki', 'Hall, William W', 'Tsujimoto, Hajime', 'Hamaguchi, Isao', 'Yamaguchi, Kazunari']","['Yamazaki J', 'Mizukami T', 'Takizawa K', 'Kuramitsu M', 'Momose H', 'Masumi A', 'Ami Y', 'Hasegawa H', 'Hall WW', 'Tsujimoto H', 'Hamaguchi I', 'Yamaguchi K']","['Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biologics, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Musashimurayama, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090707,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/07/09 09:00,2009/10/29 06:00,['2009/07/09 09:00'],"['2009/07/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36880-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-08-174425 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Sep 24;114(13):2709-20. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-08-174425.

However, despite this aberrant proliferation, the incidence of erythroleukemia is paradoxically rare in PV patients. In this study, we show that the progression of Friend virus-induced erythroleukemia is delayed in a mouse model of primary familial congenital polycythemia in which the wild-type Epo-receptor (EpoR) gene is replaced with a truncated human EPOR gene. Herein, we show that these mice exhibit enrichment of Sca1(+)/cKit(-) progenitors and several mature immune cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages. In cotransplantation experiments, Sca1(+)/cKit(-) progenitors inhibit the tumorigenicity of Sca1(-)/cKit(+) erythroleukemic cells. A cell line established from Sca1(+)/cKit(-) progenitors is also capable of inhibiting leukemic proliferation in culture and in mice. This phenomenon of leukemic inhibition, also detected in the serum of PV patients, is partially attributed to increased nitric oxide secretion. In addition, the administration of erythropoietin into leukemic mice induces a polycythemia-like state associated with the expansion of Sca1(+)/cKit(-) progenitors and derivative immune cells, thereby inhibiting leukemia progression. This study indicates that a combination therapy incorporating the enrichment of Sca1(+)/cKit(-) progenitors may serve as a novel approach for the treatment of leukemia.","['Usenko, Tatiana', 'Li, You-Jun', 'Haeri, Mehran', 'Li, Yanmei', 'Vecchiarelli-Federico, Laura M', 'Zhao, Xiaojun', 'Prchal, Josef T', 'Ben-David, Yaacov']","['Usenko T', 'Li YJ', 'Haeri M', 'Li Y', 'Vecchiarelli-Federico LM', 'Zhao X', 'Prchal JT', 'Ben-David Y']","['Molecular and Cellular Biology, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090707,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/07/09 09:00,2009/09/23 06:00,['2009/07/09 09:00'],"['2009/07/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37009-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-11-187419 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Aug 27;114(9):1831-41. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-11-187419.

Enforced expression of miR-34a in K562 cells inhibits cell proliferation, induces cell-cycle arrest in G(1) phase, and promotes megakaryocyte differentiation as measured by CD41 induction. miR-34a expression is also up-regulated during thrombopoietin-induced differentiation of CD34(+) hematopoietic precursors, and its enforced expression in these cells significantly increases the number of megakaryocyte colonies. miR-34a directly regulates expression of MYB, facilitating megakaryocyte differentiation, and of CDK4 and CDK6, to inhibit the G(1)/S transition. However, these miR-34a target genes are down-regulated rapidly after inducing megakaryocyte differentiation before miR-34a is induced. This suggests that miR-34a is not responsible for the initial down-regulation but may contribute to maintaining their suppression later on. Previous studies have implicated miR-34a as a tumor suppressor gene whose transcription is activated by p53. However, in p53-null K562 cells, phorbol esters induce miR-34a expression independently of p53 by activating an alternative phorbol ester-responsive promoter to produce a longer pri-miR-34a transcript.","['Navarro, Francisco', 'Gutman, David', 'Meire, Eti', 'Caceres, Mario', 'Rigoutsos, Isidore', 'Bentwich, Zvi', 'Lieberman, Judy']","['Navarro F', 'Gutman D', 'Meire E', 'Caceres M', 'Rigoutsos I', 'Bentwich Z', 'Lieberman J']","['Immune Disease Institute and Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, 200 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090707,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/07/09 09:00,2009/09/23 06:00,['2009/07/09 09:00'],"['2009/07/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36987-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-02-205062 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Sep 3;114(10):2181-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-02-205062.

However, it is unclear if survival differences persist after adjusting for clinical, demographic, and treatment variables. Our objective was to determine whether racial disparities in survival exist among patients enrolled in consecutive trials conducted by the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG). METHODS: We identified 19 457 adult cancer patients (6676 with breast, 2699 with lung, 1244 with colon, 1429 with ovarian, and 1843 with prostate cancers; 1291 with lymphoma; 2067 with leukemia; and 2208 with multiple myeloma) who were treated on 35 SWOG randomized phase III clinical trials from October 1, 1974, through November 29, 2001. Patients were grouped according to studies of diseases with similar histology and stage. Cox regression was used to evaluate the association between race and overall survival within each disease site grouping, controlling for available prognostic factors plus education and income, which are surrogates for socioeconomic status. Median and ten-year overall survival estimates were derived by the Kaplan-Meier method. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Of 19 457 patients registered, 2308 (11.9%, range = 3.9%-21.6%) were African American. After adjustment for prognostic factors, African American race was associated with increased mortality in patients with early-stage premenopausal breast cancer (hazard ratio [HR] for death = 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10 to 1.82; P = .007), early-stage postmenopausal breast cancer (HR for death = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.28 to 1.73; P < .001), advanced-stage ovarian cancer (HR for death = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.18 to 2.18; P = .002), and advanced-stage prostate cancer (HR for death = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.37; P = .001). No statistically significant association between race and survival for lung cancer, colon cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, or myeloma was observed. Additional adjustments for socioeconomic status did not substantially change these observations. Ten-year (and median) overall survival rates for African American vs all other patients were 68% (not reached) vs 77% (not reached), respectively, for early-stage, premenopausal breast cancer; 52% (10.2 years) vs 62% (13.5 years) for early-stage, postmenopausal breast cancer; 13% (1.3 years) vs 17% (2.3 years) for advanced ovarian cancer; and 6% (2.2 years) vs 9% (2.7 years) for advanced prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: African American patients with sex-specific cancers had worse survival than white patients, despite enrollment on phase III SWOG trials with uniform stage, treatment, and follow-up.","['Albain, Kathy S', 'Unger, Joseph M', 'Crowley, John J', 'Coltman, Charles A Jr', 'Hershman, Dawn L']","['Albain KS', 'Unger JM', 'Crowley JJ', 'Coltman CA Jr', 'Hershman DL']","['Department of Medicine, Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, IL, USA. kalbain@lumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090707,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,PMC2724852,2009/07/09 09:00,2009/07/28 09:00,['2009/07/09 09:00'],"['2009/07/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [medline]']","['djp175 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djp175 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2009 Jul 15;101(14):984-92. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djp175.

In this study, we report the development and validation of a two-site enzyme chemiluminescent immunoassay for Top1, which we used to measure Top1 levels in the NCI-60 cancer cell line panel. Top1 levels ranged from 0.9 to 9.8 ng/mL/microg protein extract in these cell lines. Levels varied both within and between cancer types but were generally highest in colon cancer and leukemia cell lines and lowest in central nervous system and renal cancer cell lines. Top1 mRNA levels in the NCI-60 cell lines were also measured by microarray; mRNA values generally showed a good correlation with protein levels (Pearson correlation = 0.8). When these expression levels were compared with the activity of the indenoisoquinoline class of Top1 inhibitors across the NCI-60 cell panel, low levels of Top1 were associated with increased resistance to these drugs. The results of our studies indicate that our Top1 assay can be used to quantify Top1 levels in untreated cells as well as cells treated with Top1 inhibitors and that the assay has the potential to be adapted for use in predicting clinical response to Top1-active antineoplastic agents.","['Pfister, Thomas D', 'Reinhold, William C', 'Agama, Keli', 'Gupta, Shalu', 'Khin, Sonny A', 'Kinders, Robert J', 'Parchment, Ralph E', 'Tomaszewski, Joseph E', 'Doroshow, James H', 'Pommier, Yves']","['Pfister TD', 'Reinhold WC', 'Agama K', 'Gupta S', 'Khin SA', 'Kinders RJ', 'Parchment RE', 'Tomaszewski JE', 'Doroshow JH', 'Pommier Y']","['Laboratory of Human Toxicology and Pharmacology, Applied/Developmental Research Support Directorate, Science Applications International Corporation-Frederick Inc, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Validation Study']",20090707,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,PMC2728499,2009/07/09 09:00,2009/10/20 06:00,['2009/07/09 09:00'],"['2009/07/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-09-0016 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0016 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2009 Jul;8(7):1878-84. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0016.

Several cellular and genetic mechanisms of imatinib resistance have been proposed, including amplification and overexpression of the BCR/ABL gene, the tyrosine kinase domain point mutations, and MDR1 gene overexpression. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated the impact of 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in five genes potentially associated with pharmacogenetics of IM, namely ABCB1, multidrug resistance 1; ABCG2, breast-cancer resistance protein; CYP3A5, cytochrome P450-3A5; SLC22A1, human organic cation transporter 1; and AGP, alpha1-acid glycoprotein. The DNAs from peripheral blood samples in 229 patients were genotyped. RESULTS: The GG genotype in ABCG2 (rs2231137), AA genotype in CYP3A5 (rs776746), and advanced stage were significantly associated with poor response to IM especially for major or complete cytogenetic response, whereas the GG genotype at SLC22A1 (rs683369) and advanced stage correlated with high rate of loss of response or treatment failure to IM therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that the treatment outcomes of imatinib therapy could be predicted using a novel, multiple candidate gene approach based on the pharmacogenetics of IM.","['Kim, Dong Hwan Dennis', 'Sriharsha, Lakshmi', 'Xu, Wei', 'Kamel-Reid, Suzanne', 'Liu, Xiangdong', 'Siminovitch, Katherine', 'Messner, Hans A', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H']","['Kim DH', 'Sriharsha L', 'Xu W', 'Kamel-Reid S', 'Liu X', 'Siminovitch K', 'Messner HA', 'Lipton JH']","['Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Group, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul 135-710, Korea. drkiim@medimail.co.kr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090707,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,2009/07/09 09:00,2009/09/29 06:00,['2009/07/09 09:00'],"['2009/07/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-09-0145 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-0145 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Jul 15;15(14):4750-8. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-0145.

This restriction is reproduced in ferret cells expressing M. dunni dCAT-1, but not in cells expressing NIH 3T3 mCAT-1. Virus binding assays, pseudotype assays, and the use of glycosylation inhibitors further suggest that restriction is primarily due to receptor polymorphism and, in M. dunni cells, to glycosylation of cellular proteins.

Thus, host range variation due to N-glycan deletion is receptor variant-specific, cell-specific, virus type-specific, and glycan site-specific.","['Knoper, Ryan C', 'Ferrarone, John', 'Yan, Yuhe', 'Lafont, Bernard A P', 'Kozak, Christine A']","['Knoper RC', 'Ferrarone J', 'Yan Y', 'Lafont BA', 'Kozak CA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892-0460, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20090707,United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,PMC2732407,2009/07/09 09:00,2009/09/01 06:00,['2009/07/09 09:00'],"['2009/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0042-6822(09)00362-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2009.06.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2009 Sep 1;391(2):232-9. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2009.06.015.

The signal constellation on metaphases with the tri-colour dual fusion system was defined. The knowledge of various signal patterns obtained from the different genetic rearrangements was further applied to the analysis of hybridization signals on interphase nuclei. METHODS: BCR-ABL1 dual colour, dual fusion FISH (D-FISH) was performed on diagnostic samples of 22 CML patients. The tri-colour FISH system was performed on cases that showed aberrant signal patterns other than the classical 1 green (G) 1 orange (O) 2 fusions (F). Using the aqua band-pass filter, random signal overlap in interphase nuclei would be indicated by the presence of an aqua signal (ASS1), while genuine fusion was represented by the absence of the ASS1 signal. RESULTS: Using the D-FISH system, the signal patterns could be categorized into 4 groups: group 1 (n = 17) showed the classical 1G1O2F; group 2 (n = 2) showed 2G1O1F indicating ABL1 deletion; group 3 (n = 1) showed 1G2O1F indicating BCR deletion; group 4 (n = 2) with 1G1O1F indicating reciprocal ABL1-BCR deletion. The tri-colour dual fusion system correlated with the D-FISH system for cases with der(9) deletion. The added aqua-labelled ASS1 probe was useful in differentiating random signal overlap from genuine BCR-ABL1 fusion in the interphase cells (group 4). CONCLUSION: Although the D-FISH probe was valuable in establishing the different patterns of aberrant signals and monitoring patients with the classic 2-fusion signals in CML, the tri-colour dual fusion probe should be used for patients with der(9) deletion to monitor response to treatment.","['Siu, Lisa Lp', 'Ma, Edmond Sk', 'Wong, Wai Shan', 'Chan, Man Hong', 'Wong, Kit Fai']","['Siu LL', 'Ma ES', 'Wong WS', 'Chan MH', 'Wong KF']","['Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, PR China.', 'Division of Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, PR China.', 'Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, PR China.', 'Department of Medicine, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, PR China.', 'Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090707,England,BMC Blood Disord,BMC blood disorders,100968550,PMC2715371,2009/07/09 09:00,2009/07/09 09:01,['2009/07/09 09:00'],"['2009/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/09 09:01 [medline]']","['1471-2326-9-4 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2326-9-4 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Blood Disord. 2009 Jul 7;9:4. doi: 10.1186/1471-2326-9-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The synergistic effect of dicoumarol with chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin, doxorubicin and paclitaxel was evaluated in RT112 urothelial cancer cells. Then, dicoumarol-mediated enhancement of doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity was screened in urothelial cancer cell lines with different p53 statuses or RT112 stable transfectants with a dominant-negative mutant of p53 (p53DN). To clarify the importance of the modification of p53 function by dicoumarol to enhance doxorubicin toxicity, the change in the p53-p21 pathway and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mitochondria pathway by the combined treatment were elucidated by Western blot analysis. Finally, the effect of p21 knockdown in the susceptibility to doxorubicin was examined with RT112 stable transfectants with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) of p21. RESULTS: Dicoumarol significantly increased the susceptibility of RT112 cells to cisplatin and doxorubicin, but not to paclitaxel in RT112 cells. Dicoumarol (100 microm) also enhanced the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in other bladder cancer cell lines with wild-type p53 (wt-p53; three times in 253J and 13 times in KK47), but not in those with mutant-type p53 (TCCsup, J82 and EJ) or in RT112 p53DN. The combined treatment with dicoumarol suppressed p53/p21 induction by doxorubicin and resulted in sequential p38 MAPK activation, myeloid cell leukaemia 1 suppression and caspase cleavage. The synergistic effect of doxorubicin/dicoumarol was suppressed by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 and, furthermore, p21 knockdown with shRNA transfection made RT112 cells six times more susceptible to doxorubicin with p38 MAPK activation. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that concomitant use of dicoumarol could enhance the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in urothelial cancer cells with wt-p53 through the p53/p21/p38 MAPK pathways. This combined treatment may provide a new therapeutic option to overcome chemoresistance in bladder cancer.","['Matsui, Yoshiyuki', 'Watanabe, Jun', 'Ding, Sentai', 'Nishizawa, Koji', 'Kajita, Yoichiro', 'Ichioka, Kentaro', 'Saito, Ryoichi', 'Kobayashi, Takashi', 'Ogawa, Osamu', 'Nishiyama, Hiroyuki']","['Matsui Y', 'Watanabe J', 'Ding S', 'Nishizawa K', 'Kajita Y', 'Ichioka K', 'Saito R', 'Kobayashi T', 'Ogawa O', 'Nishiyama H']","['Department of Urology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090706,England,BJU Int,BJU international,100886721,,2009/07/09 09:00,2010/03/27 06:00,['2009/07/09 09:00'],"['2009/07/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['BJU8732 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1464-410X.2009.08732.x [doi]']",ppublish,BJU Int. 2010 Feb;105(4):558-64. doi: 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2009.08732.x.

Parallel cultures of peripheral blood or bone marrow were set up with the addition of either the conventional B-cell mitogen 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or a combination of CpG oligonucleotide (CpG) and interleukin-2 (IL-2). Cytogenetic analyses were performed on both cultures. Clonal abnormalities were identified in 116 cases (53%). In 78 cases (36%), the aberrant clone was detected in both cultures. Among these, the percentages of aberrant metaphases were similar in both conditions in 17 cases, higher in the CpG/IL-2 culture in 43 cases, and higher in the TPA culture in 18 cases. Clonal aberrations were detected in only one culture, either in CpG/IL-2 or TPA in 33 (15%) and 5 (2%) cases, respectively. Taken together, abnormal karyotypes were observed in 51% with CpG/IL-2 and 38% with TPA (P < 0.0001).

The purpose of this study was to establish the prognostic value of Mcl-1 expression in human gastric cancer. METHODS: Western blot assay was performed to detect the expression of Mcl-1 protein in human gastric cancer cell lines and tissues, while Mcl-1 expression in resected gastric cancer tissue samples was analysed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The level of Mcl-1 protein expression in gastric cancer cell lines was significantly higher than that in gastric mucosa epithelial cell line. Moreover, the expression level of Mcl-1 protein was significantly higher in gastric cancer tissues than corresponding noncancerous tissues. Expression was correlated with T classification (P = 0.003), metastasis (P = 0.001), clinical stage (P = 0.010), and venous invasion (P = 0.004). Patients with high Mcl-1 expression showed poorer 5-year overall survival than patients with low Mcl-1 expression (P = 0.012; log-rank test). Further univariate and multivariate analysis suggested that high Mcl-1 expression was an independent prognostic marker for the disease. CONCLUSION: Mcl-1 is highly upregulated in gastric cancer and high Mcl-1 expression is correlated with a poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients. Thus, Mcl-1 can be utilized as an independent prognostic factor.","['Likui, Wang', 'Qun, Liu', 'Wanqing, Zhou', 'Haifeng, Shao', 'Fangqiu, Li', 'Xiaojun, Li']","['Likui W', 'Qun L', 'Wanqing Z', 'Haifeng S', 'Fangqiu L', 'Xiaojun L']","['Department of Microbiology, Nanjing General Hospital of Nanjing Military Command, PLA, Nanjing, China. kui_li2008@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Surg Oncol,Journal of surgical oncology,0222643,,2009/07/08 09:00,2009/10/09 06:00,['2009/07/08 09:00'],"['2009/07/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jso.21344 [doi]'],ppublish,J Surg Oncol. 2009 Oct 1;100(5):396-400. doi: 10.1002/jso.21344.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gastric Mucosa/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*metabolism/*mortality/pathology', 'Survival Rate']",,,,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,

In human cell culture it is important to obtain large numbers of cells for use in therapy. In this study, we attempted to prolong life span of a marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell using a combination of growth factors and hormones. Furthermore we tested whether chemically defined culture conditions are sufficient for maintenance of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells. Epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF), basic FGF, and leukemia inhibitory factor were found to be key factors for the mesenchymal stem cell proliferation. The combination of these growth factors showed extremely strong mitogenic activity, and simultaneously induced the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16ink4a protein and premature senescence more rapidly than serum-supported culture conditions. The induction of p16ink4a by growth factors was mediated through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. Excess growth stimulation by growth factors was thus one of the culture stress signals and a trigger of premature senescence at least in human cells.","['Takahashi, Hidekazu', 'Toyoda, Masashi', 'Birumachi, Jun-Ichi', 'Horie, Akane', 'Uyama, Taro', 'Miyado, Kenji', 'Matsumoto, Kenji', 'Saito, Hirohisa', 'Umezawa, Akihiro']","['Takahashi H', 'Toyoda M', 'Birumachi J', 'Horie A', 'Uyama T', 'Miyado K', 'Matsumoto K', 'Saito H', 'Umezawa A']","['Department of Reproductive Biology, National Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,,2009/07/08 09:00,2009/09/10 06:00,['2009/07/08 09:00'],"['2009/07/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.21860 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2009 Nov;221(2):335-42. doi: 10.1002/jcp.21860.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis)', '1B56C968OA (Becaplermin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Becaplermin', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Cellular Senescence/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/pharmacology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In a large health care program we identified 105 commonly used drugs, not previously screened. Recipients were followed for up to 12(1/2) years for incident cancer. Nested case-control analyses of 55 cancer sites and all combined included up to ten matched controls per case, with lag of at least 2 years between drug dispensing and cancer. Positive associations entailed a relative risk of 1.50, with p </= 0.01 and higher risk for three or more, than for one prescription. Evaluation included further analyses, searches of the literature, and clinical judgment. RESULTS: There were 101 associations of interest for 61 drugs. Sixty-six associations were judged to have involved substantial confounding. We found evidence that of the remaining 35, the following associations may not be due to chance: sulindac with gallbladder cancer and leukemia, hyoscyamine with nonHodgkin lymphoma, nortriptyline with esophageal and hepatic cancer, oxazepam with lung cancer, both fluoxetine and paroxetine with testicular cancer, hydrochlorothiazide with renal and lip cancer, and nifedipine with lip cancer.

We explored the association between education and the incidence of lymphoma in the prospective EPIC study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Within 3,567,410 person-years of follow-up, 1,319 lymphoma cases [1,253 non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) and 66 Hodgkin lymphomas (HL)] were identified. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to examine the association between highest educational level (primary school or less, technical/professional school, secondary school, university) and lymphoma risk. RESULTS: Overall, no consistent associations between educational level and lymphoma risk were observed; however, associations were found for sub-groups of the cohort. We observed a higher risk of B-NHL (HR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.02-1.68; n = 583) in women with the highest education level (university) but not in men. Concerning sub-classes of B-NHL, a positive association between education and risk of B cell chronic lymphatic leukaemia (BCLL) was observed only in women. In both genders, the risk of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was significantly lower for subjects with university degree (HR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.27-0.79) versus lowest educational level. No association was found for HL. CONCLUSION: We could not confirm an overall consistent association of education and risk of HL or NHL in this large prospective study; although, education was positively related to the incidence of BCLL and B-NHL (in women) but inversely to incidence of DLBCL. Due to limited number of cases in sub-classes and the large number of comparisons, the possibility of chance findings can not be excluded.","['Hermann, Silke', 'Rohrmann, Sabine', 'Linseisen, Jakob', 'Nieters, Alexandra', 'Khan, Aneire', 'Gallo, Valentina', 'Overvad, Kim', 'Tjonneland, Anne', 'Raaschou-Nielsen, Ole', 'Bergmann, Manuela M', 'Boeing, Heiner', 'Becker, Nikolaus', 'Kaaks, Rudolf', 'Bueno-de-Mesquita, H Bas', 'May, Anne M', 'Vermeulen, Roel C H', 'Bingham, Sheila', 'Khaw, Kay-Tee', 'Key, Timothy J', 'Travis, Ruth C', 'Trichopoulou, Antonia', 'Georgila, Christina', 'Triantafylou, Dimitra', 'Celentano, Egidio', 'Krogh, Vittorio', 'Masala, Giovanna', 'Tumino, Rosario', 'Agudo, Antonio', 'Altzibar, Jone M', 'Ardanaz, Eva', 'Martinez-Garcia, Carmen', 'Suarez, Marcial Vicente Arguelles', 'Tormo, Maria Jose', 'Braaten, Tonje', 'Lund, Eiliv', 'Manjer, Jonas', 'Zackrisson, Sophia', 'Hallmans, Goran', 'Malmer, Beatrice', 'Boffetta, Paolo', 'Brennan, Paul', 'Slimani, Nadia', 'Vineis, Paolo', 'Riboli, Elio']","['Hermann S', 'Rohrmann S', 'Linseisen J', 'Nieters A', 'Khan A', 'Gallo V', 'Overvad K', 'Tjonneland A', 'Raaschou-Nielsen O', 'Bergmann MM', 'Boeing H', 'Becker N', 'Kaaks R', 'Bueno-de-Mesquita HB', 'May AM', 'Vermeulen RC', 'Bingham S', 'Khaw KT', 'Key TJ', 'Travis RC', 'Trichopoulou A', 'Georgila C', 'Triantafylou D', 'Celentano E', 'Krogh V', 'Masala G', 'Tumino R', 'Agudo A', 'Altzibar JM', 'Ardanaz E', 'Martinez-Garcia C', 'Suarez MV', 'Tormo MJ', 'Braaten T', 'Lund E', 'Manjer J', 'Zackrisson S', 'Hallmans G', 'Malmer B', 'Boffetta P', 'Brennan P', 'Slimani N', 'Vineis P', 'Riboli E']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology (C020), German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,,2009/07/08 09:00,2011/05/06 06:00,['2009/07/08 09:00'],"['2009/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-009-0638-9 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2010 Jan;136(1):71-7. doi: 10.1007/s00432-009-0638-9.,,IM,"['Adult', 'Diet', '*Educational Status', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,['G0401527/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reports have been published on the identification of tumor cells with stem cells characteristics in different types of tumors (acute myelogenic leukemia, breast cancer, prostate cancer, bone sarcomas, liver cancer, and melanomas). We and other groups have previously reported the isolation of cancer stem cells from adult glioblastoma multiforme. These cells express stem cell markers, and when differentiated they express glial and neuronal markers. In vivo they give a tumor that recapitulates the characteristics of the tumor in the patient. More recently we have isolated tumor stem-like cells also from benign tumors like pituitary adenomas. Cells derived from pituitary adenomas are able to grow as floating aggregates resembling the neurospheres (typical of normal stem cells) in a medium supplemented by growth factors (EGF and bFGF). The immunocytochemical analysis revealed that pituitary tumor stem-like cells are positives for nestin and, when grown for ten days in differentiation medium they express GFAP, BIII tubulin, and S-100. In vitro tumor stem-like cells derived from a patient with a somatotroph adenoma showed high production of growth hormone and prolactin, while cells derived from the same patient but grown in presence of fetal bovine serum showed no production of hormones.","['Tunici, Patrizia', 'Yu, John S']","['Tunici P', 'Yu JS']","['Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,,2009/07/08 09:00,2009/11/13 06:00,['2009/07/08 09:00'],"['2009/07/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-59745-280-9_12 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2009;568:195-201. doi: 10.1007/978-1-59745-280-9_12.,"['12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)']",IM,"['Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Human Growth Hormone/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Pituitary Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Prolactin/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the top of this tumor hierarchy are the cancer stem cells (CSCs) which are critical for tumor growth and maintenance as they constantly replenish the tumor bulk and are believed to be resistant to most conventional chemotherapies. The first evidence for both malignant hierarchy and CSCs came from studies on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) followed by mounting evidence in other types of cancer. Murine models of leukemia have been the proving ground for the elucidation of key novel concepts in this nascent field of CSC research. A spate of recent studies highlighting the importance of CSCs in cancer has accentuated the need for identifying and characterizing these cells. The frequency of CSCs in the leukemic bulk (LSCs) is usually estimated by in vivo limiting-dilution transplantation assays of leukemic cells into recipient animal hosts in which identical leukemias can be regenerated. Each cell that is capable of propagating the leukemia in secondary recipients is termed a leukemia-propagating cell (LPC). LSC candidates have been typically identified by the systematic dissection of compartments within a heterogeneous tumor to determine the subpopulation which shows maximal enrichment for LPCs. This is performed by determining the frequency of LPCs in each of those purified subpopulations, as has been described in both human and murine models of leukemia. It is important to mention that even though leukemia repopulation is often used as a surrogate for LSC estimation, the term LPCs can be equated with LSCs only if the phenotypic heterogeneity of the original tumor mass is regenerated upon tumor propagation into secondary recipients. The first part of the chapter deals with the estimation of LPCs in syngenic or congenic murine-murine models. In the second part, murine xenograft models for the estimation of LSCs in human leukemias are described.","['Deshpande, Aniruddha J', 'Ahmed, Farid', 'Buske, Christian']","['Deshpande AJ', 'Ahmed F', 'Buske C']","['GSF National Research Center for Environment and Health and the Clinical Cooperative Group - Leukemia, Department of Medicine III, Klinikum Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,,2009/07/08 09:00,2009/11/13 06:00,['2009/07/08 09:00'],"['2009/07/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-59745-280-9_3 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2009;568:21-35. doi: 10.1007/978-1-59745-280-9_3.,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Software']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies implicate extensive apoptosis as the explanation of the paradoxical observation of marrow hyperplasia, but peripheral blood cytopenia. The clonal nature of MDS places it also at continual risk for transformation to acute leukemia. Predicting overall survival as well as the risk of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) transformation has been improved by the development of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). Management of MDS can now be based on the patients respective prognostic subgrouping. Low-risk patients should be considered for hematopoietic growth factor singly or in combination, while high-risk patients should be offered AML-induction therapy or novel therapeutic agents.

The disease results mainly from a failure of cells to undergo apoptosis, a process largely influenced by the existence of constitutively activated components of B-cell receptor signaling and the deregulated expression of anti-apoptotic molecules. Recent evidence pointing to a critical role of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) in ligand-independent BCR signaling prompted us to examine its role in primary B-CLL cell survival. We demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of constitutive Syk activity and silencing by siRNA led to a dramatic decrease of cell viability in CLL samples (n=44), regardless of clinical and biological status and induced typical apoptotic cell death with mitochondrial failure followed by caspase 3-dependent cell death. We also provide functional and biochemical evidence that Syk regulated B-CLL cell survival through a novel pathway involving PKCdelta and a proteasome-dependent regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. Together, our observations are consistent with a model wherein PKCdelta downstream of Syk stabilizes Mcl-1 through inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3 by Akt. We conclude that Syk constitutes a key regulator of B-CLL cell survival, emphasizing the clinical utility of Syk inhibition in hematopoietic malignancies.","['Baudot, A D', 'Jeandel, P Y', 'Mouska, X', 'Maurer, U', 'Tartare-Deckert, S', 'Raynaud, S D', 'Cassuto, J P', 'Ticchioni, M', 'Deckert, M']","['Baudot AD', 'Jeandel PY', 'Mouska X', 'Maurer U', 'Tartare-Deckert S', 'Raynaud SD', 'Cassuto JP', 'Ticchioni M', 'Deckert M']","['INSERM UMR576, Nice, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090706,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,2009/07/08 09:00,2009/10/09 06:00,['2009/07/08 09:00'],"['2009/07/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2009179 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.179 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2009 Sep 17;28(37):3261-73. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.179.

The erythroleukemia induced by Friend virus is a multistage disease characterized by an early proliferative stage driven by the interaction of the viral glycoprotein, gp55, with Sf-Stk and the EpoR, and a late block to differentiation resulting from retroviral insertion in the Pu.1 locus. We demonstrate here that activation of Stat3 by Sf-Stk in the early stage of disease is essential for the progression of erythroleukemia in the presence of differentiation signals induced by the EpoR, but is dispensable in the late stages of the disease. Furthermore, we identify Pu.1 as a Stat3 target gene in the early stages of erythroleukemia development. Our results support a model whereby the activation of Stat3 in the early stage of disease plays a pivotal role in regulating differentiation through the upregulation of Pu.1, thus inhibiting differentiation and favoring the expansion of infected erythroblasts and enhancing the pool of progenitors available for the acquisition of additional mutations, including insertional activation of Pu.1, resulting in full leukemic transformation.","['Hegde, S', 'Ni, S', 'He, S', 'Yoon, D', 'Feng, G S', 'Watowich, S S', 'Paulson, R F', 'Hankey, P A']","['Hegde S', 'Ni S', 'He S', 'Yoon D', 'Feng GS', 'Watowich SS', 'Paulson RF', 'Hankey PA']","['Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, 16802-3500, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090706,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,PMC3086737,2009/07/08 09:00,2009/10/07 06:00,['2009/07/08 09:00'],"['2009/07/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2009202 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.202 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2009 Sep 24;28(38):3349-59. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.202.

METHODS: A total of 537 patients underwent allo-HSCT for the treatment of leukemia, malignant lymphoma, and solid tumor. HBV serologic markers were examined in both recipients and donors prior to and following the transplantation. The mean follow-up period was 36.6 months (range 3-80 months). RESULTS: Of the 537 patients who underwent allo-HSCT, 45 recipients were positive for HBsAg prior to transplantation. Of these 45 patients, 21 were transplanted from anti-HBs-positive donors and the remaining 24 were transplanted from anti-HBs-negative donors. In the former cases, seroconversion was noted in 4 of the 21 patients (19%). In the latter cases, however, no seroconversion was noted following the transplantation. Thirty patients who were negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBs were transplanted from anti-HBs-positive donors, and 15 out of 30 patients (50%) acquired anti-HBs. Four hundred and seven patients who were positive for anti-HBs were transplanted from anti-HBs-positive or HbsAg-negative donors; 8 of these proved HBsAg-positive following the transplantation. There were no changes in HBV serological markers following transplantation in 41 patients who were transplanted from HbsAg-positive donors. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the adoptive immunity that was transferred from anti-HBs-positive donors, a seroconversion of HBsAg could occur in some HBsAg-positive recipients. HBsAg-positive donors had a lesser effect on the HBV serologic markers of recipients. However, a reactivation of HBV can occur following hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation in the cases of recipients or donors with a history of HBV, infection by an accompanying immune suppression. Therefore, prevention should be instigated.","['Woo, Seong Yong', 'Cho, Se Hyun', 'Lee, Se Min', 'Koh, Myoung Beom', 'Noh, Chee Ho', 'Kim, Chang Wook', 'Choi, Jong Young', 'Yang, Jin Mo', 'Han, Joon-Yeol', 'Lee, Young Sok']","['Woo SY', 'Cho SH', 'Lee SM', 'Koh MB', 'Noh CH', 'Kim CW', 'Choi JY', 'Yang JM', 'Han JY', 'Lee YS']","['Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['kor'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Korea (South),Korean J Hepatol,The Korean journal of hepatology,101211947,,2009/07/08 09:00,2009/10/23 06:00,['2009/07/08 09:00'],"['2009/07/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['200906131 [pii]', '10.3350/kjhep.2009.15.2.131 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Hepatol. 2009 Jun;15(2):131-9. doi: 10.3350/kjhep.2009.15.2.131.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Hepatitis B Antibodies)', '0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hepatitis B/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Hepatitis B Antibodies/blood', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/blood', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Virus Activation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML1-ETO, the product of this translocation, fuses the N-terminal portion of the RUNX transcription factor AML1 (also known as RUNX1), including its DNA-binding domain, to the almost entire transcriptional corepressor ETO (also known as MTG8 or RUNX1T1). This fusion protein acts primarily by interfering with endogenous AML1 function during myeloid differentiation, although relatively few genes are known that participate with AML1-ETO during leukemia progression. Here, we assessed the consequences of expressing this chimera in Drosophila blood cells. Reminiscent of what is observed in AML, AML1-ETO specifically inhibited the differentiation of the blood cell lineage whose development depends on the RUNX factor Lozenge (LZ) and induced increased numbers of LZ(+) progenitors. Using an in vivo RNAi-based screen for suppressors of AML1-ETO, we identified calpainB as required for AML1-ETO-induced blood cell disorders in Drosophila. Remarkably, calpain inhibition triggered AML1-ETO degradation and impaired the clonogenic potential of the human t(8;21) leukemic blood cell line Kasumi-1. Therefore Drosophila provides a promising genetically tractable model to investigate the conserved basis of leukemogenesis and to open avenues in AML therapy.","['Osman, Dani', 'Gobert, Vanessa', 'Ponthan, Frida', 'Heidenreich, Olaf', 'Haenlin, Marc', 'Waltzer, Lucas']","['Osman D', 'Gobert V', 'Ponthan F', 'Heidenreich O', 'Haenlin M', 'Waltzer L']","['Unite Mixte de Recherche 5547, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique, Centre de Biologie du Developpement, Universite de Toulouse, Bat4R3, 1118 route de Narbonne, 31062 Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090706,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC2715513,2009/07/08 09:00,2009/08/26 09:00,['2009/07/08 09:00'],"['2009/07/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [medline]']","['0902449106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0902449106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Jul 21;106(29):12043-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0902449106.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 623 consecutive ALL myeloablative HCT (1980 to 2005). Donors were autologous (n = 209), related (RD; n = 245), unrelated (URD; n = 100), and umbilical cord blood (UCB; n = 69). RESULTS: After median of 8.3 years of follow-up, 5-year overall survival (OS), leukemia-free survival (LFS), and relapse were 29% (95% CI, 26% to 32%), 26% (95% CI, 23% to 29%), and 43% (95% CI, 39% to 47%), respectively. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) at 2 years was 28% (95% CI, 25% to 31%). Mismatched URD sources yielded higher TRM (relative risk [RR], 2.2; P < .01) and lower OS (RR, 1.5; P = .05) than RD or UCB HCT. Autografting yielded significantly more relapse (68%; 95% CI, 59% to 77%; P < .01) and poorer LFS (14%; 95% CI, 10% to 18%; P = .01). HCT in first complete remission (CR1) yielded significantly better outcomes than later HCT. In a 1990 to 2005 allogeneic CR1/second complete response cohort, 5-year OS, LFS, and relapse rates were 41% (95% CI, 35% to 47%), 38% (95% CI, 32% to 44%), and 25% (95% CI, 19% to 31%), respectively; 2-year TRM was 34% (95% CI, 28% to 40%). With RD, well-matched URD and UCB sources, 5-year LFS was 40% (95% CI, 31% to 49%), 42% (95% CI, 14% to 70%), and 49% (95% CI, 34% to 64%), respectively, while relapse was 31% (95% CI, 22% to 40%), 17% (95% CI, 0% to 37%), and 27% (95% CI, 13% to 41%). Acute graft-versus-host disease was associated with fewer relapses. Since 1995, we noted progressive improvements in OS, LFS, and TRM. CONCLUSION: Allogeneic, but not autologous, HCT for ALL results in durable LFS. Importantly, HCT using UCB led to similar outcomes as either RD or well-matched URD. HCT in early remission can best exploit the potent antileukemic efficacy of allografting from UCB, RD, or URD sources.","['Tomblyn, Michael B', 'Arora, Mukta', 'Baker, K Scott', 'Blazar, Bruce R', 'Brunstein, Claudio G', 'Burns, Linda J', 'DeFor, Todd E', 'Dusenbery, Kathryn E', 'Kaufman, Dan S', 'Kersey, John H', 'MacMillan, Margaret L', 'McGlave, Philip B', 'Miller, Jeffrey S', 'Orchard, Paul J', 'Slungaard, Arne', 'Tomblyn, Marcie R', 'Vercellotti, Gregory M', 'Verneris, Michael R', 'Wagner, John E', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J']","['Tomblyn MB', 'Arora M', 'Baker KS', 'Blazar BR', 'Brunstein CG', 'Burns LJ', 'DeFor TE', 'Dusenbery KE', 'Kaufman DS', 'Kersey JH', 'MacMillan ML', 'McGlave PB', 'Miller JS', 'Orchard PJ', 'Slungaard A', 'Tomblyn MR', 'Vercellotti GM', 'Verneris MR', 'Wagner JE', 'Weisdorf DJ']","['Department of Therapeutic Radiology and Radiation Oncology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20090706,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,PMC2720079,2009/07/08 09:00,2009/08/21 09:00,['2009/07/08 09:00'],"['2009/07/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/21 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.20.2960 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.20.2960 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Aug 1;27(22):3634-41. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.20.2960.

A multicenter study by the Polish Adult Leukemia Group (PALG).,e132-40,10.1016/j.ijid.2009.02.021 [doi],"OBJECTIVES: The addition of cladribine to the standard regimen consisting of daunorubicin and cytarabine has been reported to increase the efficacy of induction therapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The goal of this study was to determine the effect of this modification on the incidence and spectrum of infectious complications. METHODS: Case report forms of 309 patients with newly diagnosed AML who had been enrolled in the prospective, randomized 'DAC-7 vs. DA-7' trial were reviewed. The frequency, etiology, localization, severity, and outcome of infections were compared for patients receiving only daunorubicin and cytarabine (DA-7) and those additionally treated with cladribine (DAC-7). RESULTS: A total of 443 febrile episodes were reported with no significant difference between the treatment groups. A trend towards a higher frequency of bacteremias was observed among DA-7 patients compared to those in the DAC-7 group (31% vs. 21%; p=0.08). The treatment arms did not differ in terms of the distribution of the isolated Gram-positive, Gram-negative, fungal, and viral organisms. However, when bacteremias were considered, Gram-positive blood cultures tended to be more frequent in the DA-7 compared to the DAC-7 group (16% vs. 8.5%; p=0.07).

In this study, we analyze whether, in NK-lymphoproliferative disease of granular lymphocytes (LDGL) patients, this function could be altered and contribute to the persistence of the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Freshly isolated peripheral blood NK granular lymphocytes (GL) and NK cell lines derived from 13 different NK-LDGL patients were analyzed in coculture experiments to evaluate their ability to interact with monocyte-derived DCs (Mo-DC). RESULTS: As compared to NK cells isolated from healthy donors, NK-GLs displayed, in most cases, a reduced capability of promoting Mo-DC maturation and of killing iDC. These findings could be explained, at least in part, by the low expression levels of NKp30: an activating receptor involved in the molecular interactions occurring between NK cells and DC. We also show that, in the presence of DC-derived cytokines such as interleukin-12, in both patients and healthy individuals, DNAM-1 can cooperate with NKp30 to induce NK cells to kill DC, release tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and promote DC maturation. This contribution, however, is not sufficient to compensate for the defect in patients' NK cells. CONCLUSION: Besides expanding knowledge of the molecular basis of the NK/DC cross-talk, our study demonstrates that NK cells from NK-LDGL patients are impaired in their ability to interact with Mo-DC. The possible relationship between such abnormal NK cell/DC interactions and chronic NK cell proliferation are discussed.","['Balsamo, Mirna', 'Zambello, Renato', 'Teramo, Antonella', 'Pedrazzi, Marco', 'Sparatore, Bianca', 'Scordamaglia, Francesca', 'Pende, Daniela', 'Mingari, Maria Cristina', 'Moretta, Lorenzo', 'Moretta, Alessandro', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Vitale, Massimo']","['Balsamo M', 'Zambello R', 'Teramo A', 'Pedrazzi M', 'Sparatore B', 'Scordamaglia F', 'Pende D', 'Mingari MC', 'Moretta L', 'Moretta A', 'Semenzato G', 'Vitale M']","['DI.ME.S.

Unsupervised methods have the ability to discover new classes by grouping data into clusters or tree structures without using the class labels, but they carry the risk of producing noninterpretable results. On the other hand, supervised methods always find decision rules that discriminate samples with different class labels. However, the class label information plays such an important role that it confines supervised methods by defining the possible classes. Consequently, supervised methods do not have the ability to discover new classes. To overcome the limitations of unsupervised and supervised methods, we propose a new method, which utilizes the class labels to a less important role so as to perform class discovery and classification simultaneously. The proposed method is called SPACC (SPectral Analysis for Class discovery and Classification). In SPACC, the training samples are nodes of an undirected weighted network. Using spectral analysis, SPACC iteratively partitions the network into a top-down binary tree. Each partitioning step is unsupervised, and the class labels are only used to define the stopping criterion. When the partitioning ends, the training samples have been divided into several subsets, each corresponding to one class label. Because multiple subsets can correspond to the same class label, SPACC may identify biologically meaningful subclasses, and minimize the impact of outliers and mislabeled data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SPACC for class discovery and classification on microarray data of lymphomas and leukemias.

The discovery of the BCR-ABL fusion oncogene is an example of a remarkable bench-to-bedside story. It has provided a comprehensive explanation of the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia, and has resulted in the development of excellent treatment strategies. It has led to the use of advanced diagnostic techniques, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization and PCRs that allow for more effective means to monitor disease treatment, including the detection of minimal residual disease, early relapse and drug resistance. Unlike chronic myelogenous leukemia, the exact molecular pathways for the BCR-ABL-negative MPNs have not been completely elucidated. The discoveries of the JAK2 and the MPL mutations have set the ball rolling in trying to achieve this target. The JAK2 mutational screen has provided us with a relatively simple screening assay to establish clonality in the setting of MPNs. In patients with clonal eosinophilic disorders and mast cell disease, the use of molecular diagnostics to identify novel mutations and gene rearrangements, has resulted in superior diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.","['Patnaik, Mrinal M', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Patnaik MM', 'Tefferi A']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Rev Mol Diagn,Expert review of molecular diagnostics,101120777,,2009/07/08 09:00,2009/09/23 06:00,['2009/07/08 09:00'],"['2009/07/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/erm.09.29 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Mol Diagn. 2009 Jul;9(5):481-92. doi: 10.1586/erm.09.29.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', '*DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Exons', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/genetics', '*Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*diagnosis/genetics']",,,,,129,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells are ineffective antigen presenting cells, but as shown by many authors including results from our laboratory, stimulation with CD40L restores their antigen expressing capacity. The development of T-cell therapies for leukemic patients can be based on discovery of leukemia-associated antigens (LAA) which could be recognized by the host immune system. The aim of our present study was to test the hypothesis that leukemia-derived dendritic cells maintain the expression of tumor associated antigens. Twenty five children with B-cell precursor ALL were prospectively enrolled into the study. The mononuclear cells from peripheral blood or bone marrow were cultured and stimulated (or not) with CD40L and IL-4. The assessment of costimulatory/adhesion molecules with the use of flow cytometry and real-time RT PCR were used to confirm the possibility of turning ALL cells into dendritic-like cells. Additionally 22 tumor associated antigens mRNA levels were determined by real-time PCR technique with the TaqMan chemistry using ready-to-use Low Density Arrays for Gene Expression. The results of the study showed maintained expression and even up-regulation of some (PNPT1, PMPCB, HMMR/RHAMM, BSG and ERCC1) tumor associated antigens in CD40-activated leukemic cells. CD40L stimulation leading to the differentiation of leukemic cells into DCs which combine both antigen presenting function and expression of tumor associated antigens represents an interesting approach in cancer immunotherapy.","['Luczynski, W', 'Kowalczuk, O', 'Stasiak-Barmuta, A', 'Ilendo, E', 'Krawczuk-Rybak, M', 'Chyczewski, L']","['Luczynski W', 'Kowalczuk O', 'Stasiak-Barmuta A', 'Ilendo E', 'Krawczuk-Rybak M', 'Chyczewski L']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland. w.luczynski@wp.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,,2009/07/08 09:00,2009/09/09 06:00,['2009/07/08 09:00'],"['2009/07/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/neo_2009_05_428 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasma. 2009;56(5):428-34. doi: 10.4149/neo_2009_05_428.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (BSG protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor)', '136894-56-9 (Basigin)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 3.1.- (ERCC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.13.- (PNPT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.64 (mitochondrial processing peptidase)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Basigin/*genetics', 'CD40 Ligand/pharmacology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dendritic Cells/*metabolism', 'Endonucleases/*genetics', 'Exoribonucleases/*genetics', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*genetics', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Metalloendopeptidases/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/therapy', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the lymphoblastoid cell line CD138- ARH-77, multiple myeloma CD138+ MOLP-8 cells, and the CD138+ bone marrow fraction of patients diagnosed with MM. In this experimental system, we observed that gamma-radiation and selected cytostatic drugs such as melphalan and dexamethasone did not significantly alter the nuclear radial arrangement of the 1q21 region and other relevant regions of chromosome 1. Similarly, conserved nuclear radial positioning after cytostatic treatment was observed for the c-myc, TP53, CCND1, and IgH loci. When analyzed Mcl-1, a protein encoded by a gene mapped to the 1q21 region, we found that the variant Mcl1S is highly expressed in multiple myeloma MOLP-8 cells, but not in peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy donors or lymphoblastoid ARH-77 cells; this is in contrast to the expression pattern of the Mcl-1L variant. On the basis of these observations we suggest that the 1q21 region is an important diagnostic marker of MM, particularly the gene encoding the Mcl-1S variant, which can be easily detected by western analysis.","['Legartova, S', 'Krejci, J', 'Harnicarova, A', 'Hajek, R', 'Kozubek, S', 'Bartova, E']","['Legartova S', 'Krejci J', 'Harnicarova A', 'Hajek R', 'Kozubek S', 'Bartova E']","['Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,,2009/07/08 09:00,2009/09/09 06:00,['2009/07/08 09:00'],"['2009/07/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/neo_2009_05_404 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasma. 2009;56(5):404-13. doi: 10.4149/neo_2009_05_404.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CCND1 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Cyclin D1/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Interphase', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of undifferentiated, ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm markers were compared with relative RT-PCR method and statistically analyzed. The expression of an undifferentiating marker; Nanog was increased in the Activin A treated groups of stage one. The expression of OCT4 reduced in Activin A treated groups in stage two. In the stage one, the expression of Nodal increased by Activin A. expression of sonic hedgehog (Shh) was suppressed in Activin A treated groups of both stages. In stage two, there were significant decrease for the expression of mesoderm (Brachyury) and Nodal and visceral endoderm (GATA4) markers (p < 0.01). The expression of definitive endoderm markers (PDX1, TAT) showed significantly increased in Activin A treated groups (p < 0.01). Activin A induced differentiation in high concentration by imbalance in undifferentiating markers. Nodal has a dual role, undifferentiating effect and regulation of visceral endoderm towards definitive endoderm. Overexpression of Nanog, alteration in the expression of Nodal and Shh inhibition are three mechanisms for explanation of differentiation induced by activin A in ES cells. These mechanisms induces cascade of gene expression that commits ESCs towards definitive endodermal cells.","['Hashemi-Tabar, Mahmoud', 'Orazizadeh, Mahmoud', 'Ghanbari, Ali', 'Dehbashi, Fereshteh Negad']","['Hashemi-Tabar M', 'Orazizadeh M', 'Ghanbari A', 'Dehbashi FN']","['Cell and Molecular Research Centre, School of Medicine, Jondishapour University of Medical Sciences, Ahwaz, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Pakistan,Pak J Biol Sci,Pakistan journal of biological sciences : PJBS,101247723,,2009/07/08 09:00,2009/07/28 09:00,['2009/07/08 09:00'],"['2009/07/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [medline]']",['10.3923/pjbs.2009.324.331 [doi]'],ppublish,Pak J Biol Sci. 2009 Feb 15;12(4):324-31. doi: 10.3923/pjbs.2009.324.331.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (activin A)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)']",IM,"['Activins/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Mice', '*Stem Cells/drug effects/physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we found for the first time that Serenoa repens induced growth arrest of a variety of human leukemia cells including U266 and RPMI 8226 multiple myeloma cells as measured by mitochondrial-dependent conversion of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. TUNEL assays showed that Serenoa repens induced apoptosis of U266 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Serenoa repens also increased the expression of cleaved-PARP or p27 protein in different human leukemia cell lines. In addition, we found that Serenoa repens down-regulated basal level of phosphorylated form of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3) and Interleukin-6 induced level of phosphorylated form of STAT 3 and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) were also reduced after Serenoa repens treatment in U266 cells. Furthermore, we found that inhibition of STAT 3 signaling by Serenoa repens or Janus family of tyrosine kinase (JAK) inhibitor of AG490 enhanced the ability of docetaxel to inhibit the growth of U266 and RPMI 8226 cells, as measured by trypan blue exclusion test.

Here, we try to reveal how PRC2, PRC2-mediated repressive histone marker H3K27me3, and active histone marker histone H4 acetylation (acH4) regulate the CD11b transcription during alltrans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced HL-60 leukemia cell differentiation. By using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot analysis, we found that the mRNA and protein expression levels of two members of PRC2 were decreased during ATRA-induced HL-60 differentiation, respectively. When treated with ATRA for 72 h, the EZH2 and SUZ12 mRNA levels were decreased to 35% and 38% of the control group, respectively. At the same time, the granulocytic mature surface marker CD11b expression was increased significantly at mRNA level detected by qPCR and protein level detected by flow cytometry. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we compared the local changes in SUZ12 binding and PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 at the promoter of CD11b during ATRA-induced HL-60 differentiation. Both the levels of SUZ12 binding and PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 at the promoter of CD11b were decreased for 4.1 and 3.8 folds, respectively. And we also found the increase in the acH4 level up to 4 folds after 72 h of ATRA treatment. These results suggested that the histone modification including PRC2-mediated repressive histone marker H3K27me3 and active histone marker acH4 may involve in CD11b transcription during HL-60 leukemia cells reprogramming to terminal differentiation.","['Tang, Huarong', 'Chen, Fangping', 'Tan, Qian', 'Tan, Sanqin', 'Liu, Linxin', 'Zhang, Fan']","['Tang H', 'Chen F', 'Tan Q', 'Tan S', 'Liu L', 'Zhang F']","['Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai),Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,101206716,,2009/07/07 09:00,2009/09/22 06:00,['2009/07/07 09:00'],"['2009/07/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1093/abbs/gmp046 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai). 2009 Jul;41(7):588-93. doi: 10.1093/abbs/gmp046.,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SUZ12 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'CD11b Antigen/*genetics/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IDH is a chronic and severe form of childhood exudative and infective dermatitis involving mainly the scalp, neck and ears.

The replication of HTLV-1 has been reported to be greater in adult HAM/TSP patients than in asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers. In the current study, the proviral load of 28 children and adolescents with IDH not associated with HAM/TSP was determined and the results were compared to those obtained in 28 HTLV-1 adult carriers and 28 adult patients with HAM/TSP. The proviral load in IDH patients was similar to that of patients with HAM/TSP and much higher than that found in HTLV-1 carriers. The high levels of proviral load in IDH patients were not associated with age, duration of illness, duration of breast-feeding, or activity status of the skin disease. Since proviral load is associated with neurological disability, these data support the view that IDH patients are at high risk of developing HAM/TSP.","['Primo, J', 'Siqueira, I', 'Nascimento, M C F', 'Oliveira, M F', 'Farre, L', 'Carvalho, E M', 'Bittencourt, A L']","['Primo J', 'Siqueira I', 'Nascimento MC', 'Oliveira MF', 'Farre L', 'Carvalho EM', 'Bittencourt AL']","['Departamento de Medicina Interna, Complexo Hospitalar Universitario Prof. Edgard Santos, Universidade Federal da Bahia, Salvador, BA, Brasil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090703,Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,PMC2963476,2009/07/07 09:00,2010/03/03 06:00,['2009/07/07 09:00'],"['2009/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0100-879X2009005000008 [pii]', '10.1590/s0100-879x2009005000008 [doi]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2009 Aug;42(8):761-4. doi: 10.1590/s0100-879x2009005000008.

Targeting Bcl-2 proteins by small molecules or activating alternative pathways to bypass Bcl-2-mediated protection to promote apoptosis are two approaches to overcoming therapeutic resistance. Here, we show that cisplatin triggers a Bak-dependent pathway to induce apoptosis in Bcl-2-overexpressing MCF-7 cells. p53-mediated induction of Noxa expression, generation of lipid peroxidation end products and induction of Noxa-Mcl-1 interaction are necessary for this pathway to function. Although Puma is also induced by cisplatin treatment, it is not required for apoptosis. Similarly, reactive oxygen species production by cisplatin did not have any effect on cisplatin-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 Bcl-2 cells. Furthermore, p53 promotes cisplatin-induced apoptosis by directly binding and counteracting Bcl-x(L) antiapoptotic function. In conclusion, our findings suggest a novel mode of action for cisplatin to overcome Bcl-2-mediated protection against apoptosis, which requires preferential activation of Bak and p53-mediated upregulation of Noxa protein levels and lipid peroxidation.","['Kutuk, Ozgur', 'Arisan, Elif Damla', 'Tezil, Tugsan', 'Shoshan, Maria C', 'Basaga, Huveyda']","['Kutuk O', 'Arisan ED', 'Tezil T', 'Shoshan MC', 'Basaga H']","['Biological Sciences and Bioengineering Program, Sabanci University, 34956 Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090703,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,,2009/07/07 09:00,2009/09/16 06:00,['2009/07/07 09:00'],"['2009/07/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['bgp165 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgp165 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2009 Sep;30(9):1517-27. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgp165.

In addition, it is abnormally expressed in subsets of breast, prostate, liver, pancreatic, and kidney cancer as well as leukemia. Strikingly, it is often associated with the most aggressive cases, and it is likely involved in metastasis. Thus, a thorough investigation of the normal activities of podocalyxin may facilitate the development of new cancer treatment strategies.","['Nielsen, Julie S', 'McNagny, Kelly M']","['Nielsen JS', 'McNagny KM']","['The Biomedical Research Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090702,United States,J Am Soc Nephrol,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,9013836,,2009/07/07 09:00,2009/09/02 06:00,['2009/07/07 09:00'],"['2009/07/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['ASN.2008070782 [pii]', '10.1681/ASN.2008070782 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Soc Nephrol. 2009 Aug;20(8):1669-76. doi: 10.1681/ASN.2008070782.

We analyzed the CT scan data from the prospective Combistrat trial. DESIGN AND METHODS: Volumes of aspergillosis lesions from 30 patients (including 24 acute myeloid leukaemia) with probable (n=26) or proven (n=4) IPA according to the EORTC-MSG modified criteria, were measured prospectively on the thoracic CT scans at the enrolment in the study on day 0 (D0), D7, D14 and end of treatment (EOT). RESULTS: For the overall population, the volume of pulmonary aspergillosis lesions increased significantly from D0 to D7 (1.6 fold; p=0.003). Then this volume decreased significantly from D7 to D14 (1.36 fold at D14 with p=0.003 for D14 vs. D7, but with p=0.56 for D14 vs. D0). At EOT (= D17, median value), the volume of lesions was significantly lower than D14 (0.76 fold the initial volume; p<0.001) but it was not significantly different when compared to D0 (p=0.11). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this prospective study suggest that the sequential analysis of CT scan in neutropenic patients with IPA depicts more precisely the evolution of lesion volumes than comparison to baseline images. Moreover, the systematic use of chest CT appears to be a useful tool for diagnosis and outcome evaluation of IPA in clinical trials.","['Caillot, Denis', 'Latrabe, Valerie', 'Thiebaut, Anne', 'Herbrecht, Raoul', 'De Botton, Stephane', 'Pigneux, Arnaud', 'Monchecourt, Francoise', 'Mahi, Lamine', 'Alfandari, Serge', 'Couaillier, Jean-Francois']","['Caillot D', 'Latrabe V', 'Thiebaut A', 'Herbrecht R', 'De Botton S', 'Pigneux A', 'Monchecourt F', 'Mahi L', 'Alfandari S', 'Couaillier JF']","['Dijon University Hospital Center, Dijon, France. denis.caillot@chu-dijon.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090704,Ireland,Eur J Radiol,European journal of radiology,8106411,,2009/07/07 09:00,2011/01/12 06:00,['2009/07/07 09:00'],"['2008/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0720-048X(09)00344-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejrad.2009.05.058 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Radiol. 2010 Jun;74(3):e172-5. doi: 10.1016/j.ejrad.2009.05.058.

Multiple interactions between the vasculature and surrounding tissues are involved in this process. Retinal vascular development is controlled by interactions between ganglion cells, astrocytes, and endothelial cells. In particular, reciprocal feedback between endothelial cells and astrocytes is crucial for proper vascular patterning. Hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor expression in astrocytes plays a key role in retinal vascular growth. Recently, leukemia inhibitory factor secreted from endothelial cells was shown to act cooperatively with oxygen as a negative feedback signal. This reciprocal feedback mechanism provides a promising target for novel antiangiogenic strategies against ocular neovascular diseases and cancers. Here, we briefly review what is currently known about the molecular events involved in the cellular interactions between ganglion cells, astrocytes, and endothelial cells that control retinal vascular patterning.","['Kubota, Yoshiaki', 'Suda, Toshio']","['Kubota Y', 'Suda T']","['Department of Cell Differentiation, The Sakaguchi Laboratory, School of Medicine, Keio University, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan. ykubo33@sc.itc.keio.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Trends Cardiovasc Med,Trends in cardiovascular medicine,9108337,,2009/07/07 09:00,2009/09/11 06:00,['2009/07/07 09:00'],"['2009/07/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S1050-1738(09)00062-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tcm.2009.04.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Trends Cardiovasc Med. 2009 Feb;19(2):38-43. doi: 10.1016/j.tcm.2009.04.004.,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Astrocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Feedback, Physiological', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', '*Neovascularization, Physiologic/drug effects', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells/metabolism', 'Retinal Neovascularization/*metabolism/physiopathology/prevention & control', 'Retinal Vessels/drug effects/growth & development/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism']",,,,,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike existing methods that perturbs RBC membranes, we introduce a novel method of RBC-incorporation of proteins using the membrane-translocating low molecular weight protamine (LMWP). Confocal study of fluorescence-labeled LMWP-ovalbumin, as a model protein conjugate, has shown significant fluorescence inside RBCs. Surface morphology by scanning electron microscopy of the RBCs loaded with LMWP-ASNase was indistinguishable with normal RBCs. These drug loaded RBCs also closely resembled the profile of the native erythrocytes in terms of osmotic fragility, oxygen dissociation and hematological parameters. The in vivo half-life of enzyme activity after administering 8 units of RBC/LMWP-ASNase in DBA/2 mice was prolonged to 4.5+/-0.5 days whereas that of RBCs loaded with ASNase via a hypotonic method was 2.4+/-0.7 days. Furthermore, the mean survival time of DBA/2 mice bearing mouse lymphoma cell L5178Y was improved by approximately 44% compared to the saline control group after treatment with the RBC loaded enzymes. From these data, an innovative, novel method for encapsulating proteins into intact and fully functional erythrocytes was established for potential treatment of ALL.","['Kwon, Young Min', 'Chung, Hee Sun', 'Moon, Cheol', 'Yockman, James', 'Park, Yoon Jeong', 'Gitlin, Scott D', 'David, Allan E', 'Yang, Victor C']","['Kwon YM', 'Chung HS', 'Moon C', 'Yockman J', 'Park YJ', 'Gitlin SD', 'David AE', 'Yang VC']","['Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery and High Efficiency, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090703,Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,PMC2755588,2009/07/07 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/07 09:00'],"['2009/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0168-3659(09)00445-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jconrel.2009.06.027 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2009 Nov 3;139(3):182-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2009.06.027.

It has a significant tendency to develop both metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy. The tumor cells show abnormal redox regulation, and although the molecular mechanisms involved are not well characterized, they seem to be related to oxidative stress. In a previous study, we showed the antitumoral properties of gallic acid ester derivatives in leukemia cells. Here, we show the effect of octyl, decyl, dodecyl and tetradecyl gallates on B16F10 cells, a melanoma cell line. All compounds induced cytotoxic effects, and the IC(50) values obtained were between 7microM and 17microM after 48h of incubation. Cell death occurred through apoptosis, as demonstrated by the genomic DNA fragmentation pattern. The gallates were able to induce significant production of free radicals, deplete both glutathione and ATP, activate NF-kappaB and promote the inhibition of cell adhesion under the experimental conditions. The glutathione depletion induced by these compounds was related to the inhibition of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthase activity. These results suggest that gallates induce tumoral cell death through apoptosis as a consequence of oxidative stress, though they use different mechanisms to do so. These findings are important since melanoma cells are resistant to death because of their high level of antioxidant defense, adhesion capability and propensity to metastasize.","['Locatelli, Claudriana', 'Leal, Paulo C', 'Yunes, Rosendo A', 'Nunes, Ricardo J', 'Creczynski-Pasa, Tania B']","['Locatelli C', 'Leal PC', 'Yunes RA', 'Nunes RJ', 'Creczynski-Pasa TB']","['Departamento de Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090703,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,,2009/07/07 09:00,2009/09/04 06:00,['2009/07/07 09:00'],"['2009/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/23 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(09)00263-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2009.06.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2009 Oct 7;181(2):175-84. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2009.06.019.

We invesigated which compound from the crude extract is responsible for the cytotoxic effect on HL-60 cells. We identified 29 compounds from the crude extract using high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS). Two of the compounds, baicalin and wogonoside, are converted to baicalein and wogonin, respectively, after treatment with beta-glucuronidase. We observed a dose-dependent reduction in cell viability when cells with either wogonin or aqueous extract of S. baicalensis. Several of the apoptotic features including deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragmentation and increased caspase-3 activity were found in cells treated with wogonin and aqueous extract. The changes were associated with down-regulation of Bcl-2, and not Bax. Furthermore, treatment of HL-60 cells with wogonin or S. baicalensis led to the inhibition of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), human telomerase-associated protein 1 (hTP1) and c-myc messenger ribonucleic acid (m-RNA) expression. Wogonin and S. baicaleisis down-regulated the telomerase activity. Our findings suggest that wogonin may be the major compound in S. baicalensis responsible for HL-60 growth inhibition in vitro. The inhibition of HL-60 cell growth is mediated partly through the induction of Bax/Bcl-2 apoptosis and by telomerase inhibition through suppression of c-myc, which is a promoter of hTERT.","['Huang, Sheng-Teng', 'Wang, Chen-Yu', 'Yang, Rong-Chi', 'Chu, Chih-Ju', 'Wu, Hsiao-Ting', 'Pang, Jong-Hwei S']","['Huang ST', 'Wang CY', 'Yang RC', 'Chu CJ', 'Wu HT', 'Pang JH']","['Department of Chinese Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Kaohsiung Medical Center, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Taiwan. shenteng@adm.cgmh.org.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090703,Germany,Phytomedicine,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,9438794,,2009/07/07 09:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2009/07/07 09:00'],"['2009/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/21 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0944-7113(09)00161-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.phymed.2009.06.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Phytomedicine. 2010 Jan;17(1):47-54. doi: 10.1016/j.phymed.2009.06.005.

This lack of information on T cells at the time of presentation with disease is due in part to the difficulty in isolating sufficiently pure T cells from these specimens for further study. Negative immunomagnetic selection has been the method of choice for isolating immune cells for functional studies due to concerns that binding antibodies to the cell surface may induce cellular activation, block ligand-receptor interactions or result in immune clearance. In order specifically to study T cells in presentation AML specimens, we set out to develop a method of isolating highly pure CD4 and CD8 T cells by negative selection from the peripheral blood (PB) of newly diagnosed AML patients. This technique, unlike T cell selection from PB from normal individuals or from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, was extremely problematic due to properties of the leukaemic myeloblasts. A successful method was eventually optimized requiring the use of a custom antibody cocktail consisting of CD33, CD34, CD123, CD11c and CD36, to deplete myeloblasts.","['Le Dieu, Rifca', 'Taussig, David', 'Lister, T Andrew', 'Gribben, John G']","['Le Dieu R', 'Taussig D', 'Lister TA', 'Gribben JG']","['Institute of Cancer, Centre for Medical Oncology, Barts and The London School of Medicine, Queen Mary University of London, Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6BQ UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090701,Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,,2009/07/07 09:00,2009/09/22 06:00,['2009/07/07 09:00'],"['2009/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-1759(09)00197-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jim.2009.06.010 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2009 Aug 31;348(1-2):95-100. doi: 10.1016/j.jim.2009.06.010.

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) uses S. baicalensis (Labiatae) to treat various inflammatory conditions. The root shows strong anticancer properties in vitro and was suggested for clinical trials against multiple myeloma. Further, S. barbata was successfully tested against metastatic breast cancer in a phase I/II trial. Therefore, we investigated the anti-cancer properties of S. orientalis L. ssp. carica Edmondson, an endemic subspecies from the traditional medicinal plant S. orientalis L. in Turkey, which is used to promote wound healing and to stop haemorrhage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Freeze-dried plant material was extracted with petroleum ether, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and methanol and the bioactivity of these extracts was analysed by proliferation assay, cell death determination, and by investigating protein expression profiles specific for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. RESULTS: The strongest anti-leukemic activity was shown by the methanol extract, which contained apigenin, baicalein, chrysin, luteolin and wogonin, with an IpC50 of 43 microg/ml (corresponding to 1.3mg/ml of dried plant material) which correlated with cyclin D1- and Cdc25A suppression and p21 induction. At 132 microg/ml (=4 mg/ml of the drug) this extract caused genotoxic stress indicated by substantial phosphorylation of the core histone H2AX (gamma-H2AX) followed by activation of caspase 3 and signature-type cleavage of PARP resulting in a 55% apoptosis rate after 48 hours of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we report for the first time that S. orientalis L. ssp. carica Edmondson exhibited potent anti-leukaemic properties likely through the anti-proliferative effect of baicalein and the genotoxic property of wogonin.","['Ozmen, Ali', 'Madlener, Sibylle', 'Bauer, Sabine', 'Krasteva, Stanimira', 'Vonach, Caroline', 'Giessrigl, Benedikt', 'Gridling, Manuela', 'Viola, Katharina', 'Stark, Nicole', 'Saiko, Philipp', 'Michel, Barbara', 'Fritzer-Szekeres, Monika', 'Szekeres, Thomas', 'Askin-Celik, Tulay', 'Krenn, Liselotte', 'Krupitza, Georg']","['Ozmen A', 'Madlener S', 'Bauer S', 'Krasteva S', 'Vonach C', 'Giessrigl B', 'Gridling M', 'Viola K', 'Stark N', 'Saiko P', 'Michel B', 'Fritzer-Szekeres M', 'Szekeres T', 'Askin-Celik T', 'Krenn L', 'Krupitza G']","['Institute of Biology, Fen-Edebiyat Fakultesi, Adnan Menderes Universitesi, Aydin, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090702,Germany,Phytomedicine,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,9438794,,2009/07/07 09:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2009/07/07 09:00'],"['2008/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/19 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0944-7113(09)00166-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.phymed.2009.06.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Phytomedicine. 2010 Jan;17(1):55-62. doi: 10.1016/j.phymed.2009.06.001.

Mislocalization of tumor suppressors, oncogenes, or factors involved in apoptosis results in aberrant functioning of these proteins, leading to disease. In the case of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), cytoplasmic Bcr-Abl causes oncogenesis/proliferation. On the other hand, nuclear entrapment of endogenous Bcr-Abl (in K562 human leukemia cells) causes apoptosis. The goal of this study was to determine whether ectopically expressed Bcr-Abl could cause apoptosis of K562 cells when specifically directed to the nucleus via strong nuclear localization signals (NLSs). A single NLS from SV40 large T-antigen or four NLSs were subcloned to Bcr-Abl (1NLS-Bcr-Abl or 4NLS-Bcr-Abl). When transfected into K562 cells, only 4NLS-Bcr-Abl translocated to the nucleus. Bcr-Abl alone was found to localize in the cell cytoplasm, colocalizing with actin due to its actin binding domain. 1NLS-Bcr-Abl also localized with actin. Apoptosis induced by 4NLS-Bcr-Abl was evaluated 24h post-transfection by morphologic determination, DNA staining, and caspase-3 assay. This is the first demonstration that altering the location of ectopically expressed Bcr-Abl can kill leukemia cells. Multiple NLSs are required to overcome Bcr-Abl binding to actin, thus driving it into the nucleus and causing apoptosis.","['Dixon, Andrew S', 'Kakar, Mudit', 'Schneider, Korbinian M H', 'Constance, Jonathan E', 'Paullin, Blake C', 'Lim, Carol S']","['Dixon AS', 'Kakar M', 'Schneider KM', 'Constance JE', 'Paullin BC', 'Lim CS']","['Department of Pharmaceutics and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84108, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090701,Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,PMC2787801,2009/07/07 09:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/07/07 09:00'],"['2009/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/22 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0168-3659(09)00444-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jconrel.2009.06.026 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2009 Dec 16;140(3):245-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2009.06.026.

We have evaluated the cytotoxic effects of methoctramine and related symmetrical analogues differing in polymethylene chain length between the inner nitrogens against a panel of cell lines. Methoctramine caused cell death only at high micromolar concentrations, whereas its pharmacological action is exerted at nanomolar level. Increasing the spacing between the inner nitrogen atoms resulted in a significative increase in cytotoxicity. In particular, an elevated cytotoxicity is associated to a methylene chain length of 12 units dividing the inner amine functions (compound 5). H9c2 cardiomyoblasts were the most sensitive cells, followed by SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma, whereas HL60 leukaemia cells were much more resistant. Methoctramine and related compounds down-regulated ornithine decarboxylase, the first enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis even at non-toxic concentration. Further, methoctramine and compound 5 caused a limited up-regulation of spermine/spermidine N-acetyltransferase, suggesting that interference in polyamine metabolism is not a primary mechanism of toxicity. Methoctramine and its analogues bound to DNA with a higher affinity than spermine, but the correlation with their toxic effect was poor. The highly toxic compound 5 killed the cells in the absence of caspase activation and caused an increase in p53 expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Compound 5 was directly oxidized by cell homogenates producing hydrogen peroxide and its toxic effect was partially subdued by the inhibition of its uptake, by the NMDA ligand MK-801, and by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, suggesting that compound 5 can act at different cellular levels and lead to oxidative stress.","['Zini, Maddalena', 'Passariello, Catherine L', 'Gottardi, Davide', 'Cetrullo, Silvia', 'Flamigni, Flavio', 'Pignatti, Carla', 'Minarini, Anna', 'Tumiatti, Vincenzo', 'Milelli, Andrea', 'Melchiorre, Carlo', 'Stefanelli, Claudio']","['Zini M', 'Passariello CL', 'Gottardi D', 'Cetrullo S', 'Flamigni F', 'Pignatti C', 'Minarini A', 'Tumiatti V', 'Milelli A', 'Melchiorre C', 'Stefanelli C']","['Department of Biochemistry ""G.

During the past decade this is the only drug granted approval for treatment of pediatric acute leukemia. Recent clinical studies have established the efficacy of clofarabine in treating malignancies with a poor prognosis, such as adult, elderly, and relapsed pediatric leukemia. The mechanisms of its anti-cancer activity involve a combination of direct inhibition of DNA synthesis and ribonucleotide reductase and induction of apoptosis. Due to this broad cytotoxicity, this drug is effective against various subtypes of leukemia and is currently being tested as an oral formulation and for combination therapy of both leukemias and solid tumors. In this review we summarize current knowledge pertaining to the molecular mechanisms of action and pharmacological properties of clofarabine, as well as clinical experiences with this drug with the purpose of facilitating the evaluation of its efficacy and the development of future therapies.","['Zhenchuk, Anna', 'Lotfi, Koroush', 'Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Albertioni, Freidoun']","['Zhenchuk A', 'Lotfi K', 'Juliusson G', 'Albertioni F']","['Department of Oncology-Pathology, Cancer Center Karolinska, Karolinska Institute, Karolinska Hospital, SE-17176 Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090701,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,,2009/07/07 09:00,2009/10/27 06:00,['2009/07/07 09:00'],"['2009/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(09)00564-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2009.06.094 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2009 Dec 1;78(11):1351-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2009.06.094.

To refine AML risk-stratification by combining the percentage of residual blast cells (T1 or/and T2) with cytogenetic data based the South West Oncology Group (SWOG) criteria. METHODS: The data of 105 de novo AML (non M(3)) patients hospitalized between January 1st 1999 and February 1st 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. Results were analyzed with SPSS15.0 software. RESULTS: (1) Patients were divided into two subgroups by a cutoff of 5% residual bone marrow blasts at T1 or T2 time point. Patients with percentage of residual bone marrow blast cells < 5% had better complete remission (CR) rate, relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) than the patients with percentage > or = 5% at T1 or T2. The percentage of residual bone marrow blast cells at T1 was correlated with that at T2. (2) The prognosis of patients with intermediate karyotypes with percentage < 5% at T1 or T2 was similar to that of the patients with favorable karyotypes. The patients with intermediate karyotypes and percentage of residual bone marrow blasts > or = 5% at T1 or T2 are defined as a subgroup with prognosis similar to that of patients with unfavorable karyotypes. (3) COX regression analysis showed that the percentage of residual bone marrow blasts at T1 or T2 is an independent prognostic factor of AML. The percentage of residual bone marrow blasts at T1 may be more helpful in prognostication than that at T2. CONCLUSION: AML patients with percentage of residual bone marrow blasts < 5% after induction chemotherapy (T1 or T2) have better CR rate, RFS, OS than the patients with percentage > or = 5% at the same time point. Combination of cytogenetics and percentage of residual bone marrow blasts at T1 or T2 is helpful to divide patients with intermediate karyotypes into two subgroups with different prognosis.

METHODS: The histologic features of 52 cases of CLL/SLL with lymph node and/or bone marrow biopsies performed were retrospectively reviewed. Immunohistochemical study using EliVision for ZAP-70 protein was adopted. RESULTS: The lymph nodes of the 12 cases studied showed effacement of the nodal architecture and was replaced by a monotonous infiltration of small lymphoid cells. Among them, proliferation centers were identified in 6 cases. Similar morphologic pattern was seen in the 40 bone marrow biopsy samples, but no proliferation center formation obtained. The infiltration pattern of tumor cells in the bone marrow were further subdivided into nodular (n = 9), interstitial (n = 3), mixed (n = 9) and diffuse types (n = 19). There was no significant difference found on survival rates between the diffuse infiltration and non-diffuse infiltration groups (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.199). ZAP-70 protein was mainly located in the cytoplasm and nuclei of lymphoma cells. There were 21 cases (40.4%) positive for ZAP-70 and among them, 11 died of this disease or the related infections. On the other hand, ZAP-70 was negative in 31 cases (59.6%) and only 4 of them died of this disease or related infections. The overall survival in ZAP-70-negative group was higher than that of the ZAP-70-positive group (59 months versus 39 months, chi(2) = 6.991, P = 0.008). Follow-up information was available in 51 patients. Among the 21 dead cases, 15 died of CLL/SLL or the related infection.

METHODS: Primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons were pretreated with liquiritigenin (0.02, 0.2, and 2 micromol/L) prior to Abeta(25-35) exposure. Following treatment, viability of the cells was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide analysis and by a lactate dehydrogenase activity-based cytotoxicity assay. Intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as apoptotic rates, were determined. Our studies were extended in tests of whether liquiritigenin treatment could inhibit the secretion of Abeta(1-40) as measured using an ELISA method. In order to analyze which genes may be involved, we used a microarray assay to compare gene expression patterns. Finally, the levels of specific proteins related to neurotrophy and neurodenegeration were detected by Western blotting. RESULTS: Pretreated neurons with liquiritigenin in the presence of Abeta(25-35) increased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. Liquiritigenin treatment also attenuated Abeta(25-35)-induced increases in [Ca(2+)](i) and ROS level and decreased the apoptotic rate of neurons. Some genes, including B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), neurotrophin 3 (Ntf-3) and amyloid beta (A4) precursor protein-binding, family B, member 1 (Apbb-1) were regulated by liquiritigenin; similar results were shown at the protein level by Western blotting. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that liquiritigenin exhibits neuroprotective effects against Abeta(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity and that it can decrease the secretion of Abeta(1-40). Therefore, liquiritigenin may be useful for further study as a prodrug for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.Acta Pharmacologica Sinica (2009) 30: 899-906; doi: 10.1038/aps.2009.74.","['Liu, Rui-Ting', 'Zou, Li-Bo', 'Lu, Qiu-Jun']","['Liu RT', 'Zou LB', 'Lu QJ']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Institute of Radiation Medicine, Academy of Military Medical Science, Beijing 100850, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,PMC4006661,2009/07/04 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/04 09:00'],"['2009/07/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['aps200974 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2009.74 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2009 Jul;30(7):899-906. doi: 10.1038/aps.2009.74.,"['0 (Amyloid beta-Peptides)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (amyloid beta-protein (1-40))', '0 (amyloid beta-protein (25-35))', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'T194LKP9W6 (liquiritigenin)']",IM,"['Amyloid beta-Peptides/*metabolism/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flavanones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hippocampus/*cytology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neurons/cytology/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Neuroprotective Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Peptide Fragments/*metabolism/*toxicity', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To investigated if As2O3 could induce cell death and apoptosis of Hep-2 cells, a laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) cell line. METHODS: Trypan blue exclusion assay, LDH release assay and cytometric method were used for the measurements of cell death and apoptosis. We measured intracellular GSH, ROS and mitochondrial membrane potential to explore the mechanisms of cell death and apoptosis induced by As2O3 in Hep-2 cells. RESULTS: Trypan-blue-positive cells and the release of LDH into medium induced by As2O3 increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The rates of apoptosis increased induced by As2O3 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In order to elucidate the mechanisms of cell death and apoptosis induced by As2O3 in Hep-2 cells through GSH, we found that As2O3 induced the decrease of intracellular GSH, increase of ROS and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. And pretreatment of BSO, an inhibitor of GSH biosynthesis, depleted partly intracellular GSH and increased trypan-blue-positive cells, the release of LDH, apoptosis, ROS and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. However, pretreatment of GSH had resistance to the changes to some extent as described above. CONCLUSION: As2O3-induced apoptosis of Hep-2 cell line through modulating intracellular GSH level.","['Cheng, Baohua', 'Yang, Xinxin', 'An, Liangxiang', 'Gao, Bo', 'Liu, Xia']","['Cheng B', 'Yang X', 'An L', 'Gao B', 'Liu X']","['Jining Medical College, Jining City, Shandong Province, China. apple9red@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090702,Netherlands,Auris Nasus Larynx,"Auris, nasus, larynx",7708170,,2009/07/04 09:00,2010/03/20 06:00,['2009/07/04 09:00'],"['2008/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0385-8146(09)00126-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.anl.2009.04.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Auris Nasus Larynx. 2010 Feb;37(1):89-94. doi: 10.1016/j.anl.2009.04.016.

We have now investigated the consequence of BLM-A2 deglycosylation in terms of the involvement of apoptotic pathways in HEp-2 cells. Apoptosis induced by bleomycin-A2 and deglyco-BLM-A2 is associated with the release of cytochrome c and AIF. Only Bax was oligomerized with BLM-A2-induced HEp-2 cell death. BLM-A2 and deglyco-BLM-A2-induced apoptosis depended on JNK activation but was independent of death receptors expression. In contrast, both of these drugs would sensitize HEp-2 cells to death receptor ligand-induced cell death. These observations indicate that the deglycosylation of BLM does not impair the ability of the drug to trigger cell death through activation of the intrinsic pathway by the release of AIF responsible for mitochondrial permeability and chromatin condensation independent of caspases activation.","['Brahim, Souhir', 'Aroui, Sonia', 'Abid, Kaouthar', 'Kenani, Abderraouf']","['Brahim S', 'Aroui S', 'Abid K', 'Kenani A']","['Department of Science, Laboratory of Biochemistry UR09/09.

Since kinases inhibited by midostaurin are involved in megakaryocytic differentiation, we hypothesized that this novel target therapeutic might have a role in the treatment of human leukemia cells. Hence, we examined the effect of midostaurin on human erythroleukemia cells and evaluated potential mechanisms. Midostaurin inhibited the growth of both K562 and HEL cells in dose- and time-dependent manner. Morphological changes such as enlarged contours, multipolarity of mitotic spindles, and multinucleation of megakaryocytes were noted in both cell lines treated by midostaurin. A smaller population of apoptotic cells was also observed. DNA histogram revealed polyploid and hypoploid populations of midostaurin-treated cells. Midostaurin treatment enhanced the surface expression of the megakaryocytic marker CD61; in contrast, the erythroid marker glycophorin A expression was decreased. At optimal conditions for inducing megakaryocytic differentiation, midostaurin upregulated the expression and signaling of c-Mpl, a thrombopoietin receptor-encoding gene, in HEL cells. These results indicate that midostaurin can inhibit growth; induce megakaryocytic differentiation; and to a lesser extent, cause apoptosis in HEL cells. This effect might involve the expression and signaling of c-Mpl.","['Huang, Yu-Chuen', 'Chao, David K', 'Clifford Chao, K S', 'Chen, Yu-Jen']","['Huang YC', 'Chao DK', 'Clifford Chao KS', 'Chen YJ']","['Department of Medical Research, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Section 2, Taipei 104, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090630,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,,2009/07/04 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/04 09:00'],"['2009/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/17 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0887-2333(09)00167-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2009.06.027 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2009 Sep;23(6):979-85. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2009.06.027.

METHODS: Among the 327 B-ALL children enrolled in our study, 289 cases were identified with at least one antigen combination as MRD marker. Their bone marrow samples were monitored by using 9 combinations with 4 antigens each, analyzed the occurrence rates and compared them with international reports. Also the differences in the distribution of each antibody combination in the different clinical-biologic groups were compared by the chi-square test and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: (1) Totally 327 cases of childhood B-ALL were screened for antibody combinations of interest and 88.4 percent of them (289 cases) were identified with effective antibody combinations. (2) The occurrence frequencies of antigen combinations were different. The highest frequency was seen with TdT/CD10/CD34/CD19 combination which was 70.59 percent. Expressions of antigen combinations in Chinese children were different from those in western countries. (3) Some antibody combinations presented different frequency among different clinical groups. CD38/CD10/CD34/CD19 was expressed more often in samples of relapsed patients (P = 0.045). CD66c/CD10/CD34/CD19 expression was significantly higher in BCR/ABL positive group (P = 0.037) and relapsed patients group (P = 0.047). TdT/CD10/CD34/CD19 was expressed more in MLL-AF4 negative group (P = 0.005) and Prednisone Good Response group (P = 0.002). CD58/CD10/CD34/CD19 was correlated with low relapse rate (P = 0.032). CONCLUSION: (1) The coverage rate of 9 antigen combinations in our study was 88.4%. The occurrences of frequency of different antibody combinations in B-ALL were different, and also different from that of western countries. The occurrence frequencies of antibody combinations CD21/CD10/CD34/CD19, CD22/CD10/CD34/CD19, CD10/CD56/CD34/-CD19 and TdT/Cu/CD34/CD19 were lower than those of the western report, while CD38/CD10/-CD34/CD19, CD45/CD19/CD10/CD34, CD58/CD10/CD34/CD19 and CD66c/CD10/CD34/CD19 were similar to those of the reports from western countries. (2) TdT/CD10/CD34/CD19 may work as a simplified method to detect MRD in Chinese population. (3) The occurrence frequency of CD38/CD10/CD34/CD19, CD45/CD19/CD10/CD34, CD58/CD10/CD34/CD19, TdT/CD10/CD34/CD19 could be effective remediation and evidence to evaluate the remission quality and guide the therapy, especially for those with no original MRD marker record. (4) CD58/CD10/CD34/CD19 and TdT/CD10/CD34/CD19 may correlate with good prognosis, but CD66c/CD10/CD34/CD19 and CD38/CD10/CD34/CD19 may predict poor prognosis. These results might contribute to individual risk evaluation and guide the therapy selection.","['Liu, Yin', 'Tang, Jing-yan', 'Xu, Chong', 'Gu, Long-jun', 'Xue, Hui-liang', 'Chen, Jing', 'Pan, Ci', 'Dong, Lu', 'Zhou, Min']","['Liu Y', 'Tang JY', 'Xu C', 'Gu LJ', 'Xue HL', 'Chen J', 'Pan C', 'Dong L', 'Zhou M']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai 200127, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,,2009/07/04 09:00,2011/01/12 06:00,['2009/07/04 09:00'],"['2009/07/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2009 May;47(5):366-70.,['EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)'],IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neprilysin/immunology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/*therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemotherapy is currently the primary modality of treatment for this fatal disease. Although chemotherapy is very effective in terms of cell killing, severe side effects such as severe infections, intracranial hemorrhage etc. are frequently encountered due to its poor selective damage between normal and malignant cells or tissues. Thus, a new therapy with highly selective killing of malignant cells which leaves the normal cells unaffected is desperately desired. The aim of this study was to investigate the targeting efficacy in vitro with a new clone of anti-human CD19 antibody immunotoxin 2E8-Genistein on B lineage leukemia cell line Nalm-6 cells and its mechanisms in order to provide the evidence of target therapy on B lineage leukemia and lymphoma. METHODS: 2E8-Genistein immunotoxin was generated by conjugating Mab 2E8 with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Genistein (Gen) via the Sulfo-SANPAH, an ultra-violet sensitive reagent. Nalm-6, a CD19+ B cell leukemia cell line, was used as target cells, while Molt-3, a CD19-T cell leukemia cell line, was taken as the negative control. The morphology of the cells was observed under the reverted reversed light microscope and the viability was checked with either trypan blue exclusion or MTT methods. Two-color flow cytometry was applied to study the mechanism of cell killing. RESULTS: After 24 hours of culture, 2E8-Genistein showed marked target killing on Nalm-6 cells at nine different concentrations from 20 nmol/L through 100 nmol/L with cell survival rates from (71.8 +/- 7.9)% down to (16.6 +/- 12.9)%, respectively (n = 3), which were all significantly lower than that of control group (100 +/- 13.9)% (P < 0.05). The killing effect was even more significant when the concentration was over 80 nmol/L. The growth inhibition rates of this immunotoxin on Nalm-6 cells were 82%, 84% and 94%, respectively at 24, 48 and 72 hours of culture in a time dependent manner. Significant difference was observed between the cell growth curve of Nalm-6 cultured with 100 nmol/L of 2E8-Gen and those of Nalm-6 cultured with medium (blank), PBS (negative control) or the same concentration of pure 2E8 antibody (negative control) groups (F = 152.15, P = 2.15 x 10(-7)), but there was no significant difference among the three control groups (F = 1.51, P = 0.29). When Molt-3 cells were used as target cells, the cell growth curves of Molt-3 cultured with 2E8-Gen (100 nmol/L) and with negative control of blank did not show any significant difference (F = 0.34, P = 0.59). PI/FITC Annexin V double staining analysis with flow cytometry showed that the positive rate (33.45 +/- 8.77)% of early apoptosis on Nalm-6 cells induced by 100 nmol/L of 2E8-Genistein was significantly higher than that of negative control of blank (10.44% +/- 1.28%, t = -4.39, P = 0.001) at 24 hours of culture. CONCLUSION: 2E8-Genistein immunotoxin can significantly target the Nalm-6 cells in vitro in a time response manner and the apoptosis induction is involved in the course of this killing effect.","['Chen, Ying-hu', 'Tang, Yong-min', 'Shen, Hong-qiang', 'Song, Hua', 'Yang, Shi-long', 'Shi, Shu-wen', 'Qian, Bai-qin', 'Xu, Wei-qun', 'Ning, Bo-tao']","['Chen YH', 'Tang YM', 'Shen HQ', 'Song H', 'Yang SL', 'Shi SW', 'Qian BQ', 'Xu WQ', 'Ning BT']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,,2009/07/04 09:00,2011/01/12 06:00,['2009/07/04 09:00'],"['2009/07/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2009 Jan;47(1):57-61.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genistein/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested the hypothesis that targeted calicheamicin theta (theta) using an anti-CD19-immunoconjugate may provide an effective treatment strategy for CD19(+) ALL. Calicheamicin theta is a rationally designed prodrug of the natural enediyene calicheamicin gamma, obtained by total synthesis. It offers the advantage of increased in vivo stability and 1000-fold higher antitumor potency over calicheamicin gamma. First, we demonstrate efficacy of calicheamicin theta against primary pre-B leukemic cells and multidrug-resistant leukemia cell lines (IC(50) = 10(-9) to 10(-12) M). Second, conjugation of calicheamicin theta to an internalizing murine anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody was demonstrated to affect neither calicheamicin theta mediated cytotoxicity nor binding of the antibody to the target molecule. Third, anti-CD19-calicheamicin theta immunoconjugate revealed a maximum tolerated dose of 10 mug/kg and CD19-specific and long-lasting eradication of established leukemia was demonstrated in a xenograft model. Finally, we show that the antileukemic effect of anti-CD19-calicheamicin theta is mediated by induction of apoptosis proceeding through the caspase-mediated mitochondrial pathway. On the basis of these results, we conclude that anti-CD19-calicheamicin theta immunoconjugates may offer a novel and effective approach for the treatment of relapsed CD19(+) ALL.","['Bernt, Kathrin M', 'Prokop, Aram', 'Huebener, Nicole', 'Gaedicke, Gerhard', 'Wrasidlo, Wolfgang', 'Lode, Holger N']","['Bernt KM', 'Prokop A', 'Huebener N', 'Gaedicke G', 'Wrasidlo W', 'Lode HN']","['Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Department of Pediatrics, Experimental Oncology, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090702,United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,,2009/07/04 09:00,2011/04/05 06:00,['2009/07/04 09:00'],"['2009/07/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bc900128h [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2009 Aug 19;20(8):1587-94. doi: 10.1021/bc900128h.

To achieve this, we have combined the selectivity and affinity of aptamers with the spectroscopic advantages of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) nanoparticles (NPs). This has produced an aptamer-conjugated FRET NP assay that performs simultaneous multiplexed monitoring of cancer cells with the desired degree of sensitivity and selectivity. First, by changing the doping ratio of three different dyes, the FRET-mediated emission signatures could be tuned such that the nanoparticles would exhibit multiple colors upon excitation with a single wavelength. These FRET nanoparticles were then modified by a few aptamers specific for different cancer cell lines, in this case, T-cell leukemia and B-cell lymphoma. As a result, simultaneous and sensitive detection of multiple cancer cell targets was achieved. Therefore, our aptamer-conjugated FRET NPs are highly promising for potential applications in the sensitive monitoring of multiple cancer cells for biomedical research and medical diagnostics.","['Chen, Xiaolan', 'Estevez, M-Carmen', 'Zhu, Zhi', 'Huang, Yu-Fen', 'Chen, Yan', 'Wang, Lin', 'Tan, Weihong']","['Chen X', 'Estevez MC', 'Zhu Z', 'Huang YF', 'Chen Y', 'Wang L', 'Tan W']","['Center for Research at the Bio/Nano Interface, Department of Chemistry, UF Genetics Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611-7200, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,,2009/07/04 09:00,2010/06/25 06:00,['2009/07/04 09:00'],"['2009/07/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ac9011073 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2009 Aug 15;81(16):7009-14. doi: 10.1021/ac9011073.,"['0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)']",IM,"['*Aptamers, Nucleotide', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Confocal', '*Nanoparticles', 'Neoplasms/*pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the Jak-Stat3 pathway is essential and sufficient to mediate LIF signals, it is still unclear how these signals are linked to the core circuitry of pluripotency-associated transcription factors, consisting of Oct3/4 (also called Pou5f1), Sox2 and Nanog. Here we show that two LIF signalling pathways are each connected to the core circuitry via different transcription factors. In mouse ES cells, Klf4 is mainly activated by the Jak-Stat3 pathway and preferentially activates Sox2, whereas Tbx3 is preferentially regulated by the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase-Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and predominantly stimulates Nanog. In the absence of LIF, artificial expression of Klf4 or Tbx3 is sufficient to maintain pluripotency while maintaining the expression of Oct3/4. Notably, overexpression of Nanog supports LIF-independent self-renewal of mouse ES cells in the absence of Klf4 and Tbx3 activity. Therefore, Klf4 and Tbx3 are involved in mediating LIF signalling to the core circuitry but are not directly associated with the maintenance of pluripotency, because ES cells keep pluripotency without their expression in the particular context.","['Niwa, Hitoshi', 'Ogawa, Kazuya', 'Shimosato, Daisuke', 'Adachi, Kenjiro']","['Niwa H', 'Ogawa K', 'Shimosato D', 'Adachi K']","['Laboratory for Pluripotent Cell Studies, RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, 2-2-3 Minatojima-minamimachi, Chuo-ku, Kobe 6500047, Japan. niwa@cdb.riken.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,,2009/07/03 09:00,2009/08/21 09:00,['2009/07/03 09:00'],"['2009/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/21 09:00 [medline]']","['nature08113 [pii]', '10.1038/nature08113 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2009 Jul 2;460(7251):118-22. doi: 10.1038/nature08113.,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', '0 (Tbx3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Box Domain Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cases and controls were matched for age, sex, and county of residence. Environmental exposures were determined by questionnaire and by urinalysis of pesticide metabolites using isotope dilution gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. We found that more case mothers (33%) than controls (14%) reported using insecticides in the home (P < 0.02). Other environmental exposures to toxic substances were not significantly associated with the risk of ALL. Pesticide levels were higher in cases than in controls (P < 0.05). Statistically significant differences were found between children with ALL and controls for the organophosphate metabolites diethylthiophosphate (P < 0.03) and diethyldithiophosphate (P < 0.05).

Lcn2 has been shown to induce the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancer cells and to promote breast tumor invasion. Estrogen receptor alpha may participate in the pathway that leads to Lcn2-induced EMT. Preliminary evidence also suggests that Lcn2 may be useful as a potential non-invasive urinary biomarker of breast cancer. Elevated levels of Lcn2 have also been reported in other human cancers.

The incidence and the causes of eosinophilia might have been changed according to the changes in the incidence of diseases such as cancer, chronic degenerative diseases, etc. We have conducted a retrospective study to investigate the incidence and causes of eosinophilia. METHODS: Eosinophilia and hypereosinophilia were defined when absolute eosinophil count was greater than 500/microL and 1,500/microL, respectively. Patient's clinical records were reviewed to find out the underlying clinical conditions responsible for causes of hypereosinophilia. Conventional chromosomal analysis, reverse transcriptase PCR and FISH for gene rearrangement were performed to check the presence of clonal eosinophilia. RESULTS: Out of 41,137 patients who had a hematology profile performed, 5,019 (12.2%) and 373 patients (0.9%) were found to have eosinophilia and hypereosinophilia, respectively. Among patients with hypereosinophilia, 227 patients (60.9%) had identifiable and/or possible causes. The major causes of hypereosinophilia were malignancy (35.2%), allergy and skin diseases (18.1%), infectious diseases (15.4%), hepatobiliary diseases (7.5%), bone marrow clonal diseases (6.6%) and parasite infections (6.6%). We also found a rare case of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha positive chronic eosinophilic leukemia combined with light chain multiple myeloma. CONCLUSIONS: We found a difference in the distribution of causes of hypereosinophilia in comparison with previous Korean studies, and the most common cause of hypereosinophilia in the current study was malignancy. A rare case of clonal eosinophilia (chronic eosinophilic leukemia) associated with multiple myeloma was confirmed using molecular studies.","['Kim, Da Woon', 'Shin, Myung Geun', 'Yun, Hyeong Kee', 'Kim, Soo Hyun', 'Shin, Jong Hee', 'Suh, Soon Pal', 'Ryang, Dong Wook']","['Kim DW', 'Shin MG', 'Yun HK', 'Kim SH', 'Shin JH', 'Suh SP', 'Ryang DW']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Dong-Gu, Gwangju, Korea.']",['kor'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Korea (South),Korean J Lab Med,The Korean journal of laboratory medicine,101322822,,2009/07/03 09:00,2009/09/26 06:00,['2009/07/03 09:00'],"['2009/07/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['200906185 [pii]', '10.3343/kjlm.2009.29.3.185 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Lab Med. 2009 Jun;29(3):185-93. doi: 10.3343/kjlm.2009.29.3.185.,"['0 (FIP1L1 protein, human)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Eosinophilia/epidemiology/*etiology/genetics', 'Female', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/epidemiology/*etiology/genetics', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors', 'Young Adult', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/genetics/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,['Korean J Lab Med. 2010 Apr;30(2):202'],,,,,,,

A high level expression of Mcl-1 was observed in tumor cells of human primary SCC, lymph node metastasis tissues, and SCC cell lines. We manipulated expression of Mcl-1 protein in SCC cells by small interfering RNA (siRNA) for Mcl-1 and observed that Mcl-1 siRNA inhibited the growth of SCCs accompanied with apoptosis. Combination therapy of Mcl-1 siRNA and anti-tumor drug drastically inhibited the cell growth in comparison to that in each single treatment. In addition, phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was decreased by treatment with Mcl-1 siRNA, resulting in decreases in phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and MAPK. The cell growth inhibition caused by knockdown of Mcl-1 was suggested to be mainly a result of suppression of proliferation via the inhibition of intracellular FAK/MAPK signaling pathways.

Therefore, the search for mHags has implications not only for preventing GvHD, but also for therapeutic applications involving leukemia-specific T cells. We have created a web-based system, named PeptideCheck, which aims to augment the experimental discovery of mHags using bioinformatic means. Analyzing peptide elution data to search for mHags and predicting mHags from polymorphism and protein databases are the core features. RESULTS: Comparison with known mHag data reveals that some but not all of the previously known mHags can be reproduced. By applying a system of filtering and ranking, we were able to produce an ordered list of potential mHag candidates in which HA-1, HA-3 and HA-8 occur in the best 0.25%. By combining single nucleotide polymorphism, protein, tissue expression and genotypic frequency data, together with antigen presentation prediction algorithms, we propose a list of the best peptide candidates which could potentially induce the GvL effect without causing GvFD.

The TEL-AML1 gene fusion, the hallmark translocation in Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and the first hit, occurs years before the clinical disease, most often in utero. We have generated mice in which TEL-AML1 expression is driven from the endogenous promoter and can be targeted to specific populations. TEL-AML1 renders mice prone to malignancy after chemical mutagenesis when expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), but not in early lymphoid progenitors. We reveal that TEL-AML1 markedly increases the number of HSCs and predominantly maintains them in the quiescent (G(0)) stage of the cell cycle. TEL-AML1(+) HSCs retain self-renewal properties and contribute to hematopoiesis, but fail to out-compete normal HSCs. Our work shows that stem cells are susceptible to subversion by weak oncogenes that can subtly alter their molecular program to provide a latent reservoir for the accumulation of further mutations.","['Schindler, Jeffrey W', 'Van Buren, Denille', 'Foudi, Adlen', 'Krejci, Ondrej', 'Qin, Jinzhong', 'Orkin, Stuart H', 'Hock, Hanno']","['Schindler JW', 'Van Buren D', 'Foudi A', 'Krejci O', 'Qin J', 'Orkin SH', 'Hock H']","['Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Stem Cell,Cell stem cell,101311472,,2009/07/03 09:00,2009/08/29 09:00,['2009/07/03 09:00'],"['2008/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/16 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/29 09:00 [medline]']","['S1934-5909(09)00208-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.stem.2009.04.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Stem Cell. 2009 Jul 2;5(1):43-53. doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2009.04.019.,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Core Binding Factors/metabolism', 'Embryonic Development', 'Gene Targeting', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Hepatocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-7/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Animal', 'Oncogene Fusion', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', '*Oncogenes']",,,['P01 CA68486/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,['Cell Stem Cell. 2009 Jul 2;5(1):5-6.

Several members of the RASSF family are frequently epigenetically inactivated in cancer, however, their role in leukaemia has remained largely uninvestigated. Also, RASSF10 is a predicted gene yet to be experimentally verified. Here we cloned, characterised and demonstrated expression of RASSF10 in normal human bone marrow. We also determined the methylation status of CpG islands associated with RASSF1-10 in a series of childhood acute lymphocytic leukaemias (ALL) and normal blood and bone marrow samples. RESULTS: COBRA and bisulphite sequencing revealed RASSF6 and RASSF10 were the only RASSF members with a high frequency of leukaemia-specific methylation. RASSF6 was methylated in 94% (48/51) B-ALL and 41% (12/29) T-ALL, whilst RASSF10 was methylated in 16% (8/51) B-ALL and 88% (23/26) T-ALL. RASSF6 and RASSF10 expression inversely correlated with methylation which was restored by treatment with 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (5azaDC). CONCLUSION: This study shows the hypermethylation profile of RASSF genes in leukaemias is distinct from that of solid tumours and represents the first report of inactivation of RASSF6 or RASSF10 in cancer. These data show epigenetic inactivation of the candidate TSGs RASSF6 and RASSF10 is an extremely frequent event in the pathogenesis of childhood leukaemia. This study also warrants further investigation of the newly identified RASSF member RASSF10 and its potential role in leukaemia.","['Hesson, Luke B', 'Dunwell, Thomas L', 'Cooper, Wendy N', 'Catchpoole, Daniel', 'Brini, Anna T', 'Chiaramonte, Raffaella', 'Griffiths, Mike', 'Chalmers, Andrew D', 'Maher, Eamonn R', 'Latif, Farida']","['Hesson LB', 'Dunwell TL', 'Cooper WN', 'Catchpoole D', 'Brini AT', 'Chiaramonte R', 'Griffiths M', 'Chalmers AD', 'Maher ER', 'Latif F']","['Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Institute of Biomedical Research, Medical School, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, B15 2TT, UK. l.hesson@unsw.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090701,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,PMC2711046,2009/07/03 09:00,2009/10/21 06:00,['2009/07/03 09:00'],"['2009/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-8-42 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-8-42 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2009 Jul 1;8:42. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-8-42.,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (RASSF6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Silencing', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Sequence Alignment']",,,['G120/844/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the end replication problem, each cell division results in a loss of telomeric repeats in normal somatic cells. In germ line and stem cells, the multicomponent enzyme telomerase maintains the length of telomere repeats. However, elevated telomerase activity has also been reported in the majority of solid tumours as well as in acute and chronic leukaemia. Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) serves as a model disease to study telomere biology in clonal myeloproliferative disorders. In CML, telomere shortening correlates with disease stage, duration of chronic phase (CP), prognosis measured by the Hasford risk score and the response to disease-modifying therapeutics such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Imatinib. In addition, telomerase activity (TA) is already increased in CP CML and further upregulated with disease progression to accelerated phase and blast crisis (BC). Furthermore, a correlation of TA with increased genetic instability as well as a shorter survival of the patients has been reported.

It plays key roles in ribosome biogenesis, centrosome duplication, genomic stability, cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Somatic mutations in exon 12 of the NPM gene (NPM1) are the most frequent genetic abnormality in adult acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), found in approximately 35% of all cases and up to 60% of patients with normal karyotype (NK) AML. In children, NPM1 mutations are far less frequent, occurring in 8-10% of all AML cases, and in approximately 25% of those with a NK. NPM1 mutations lead to aberrant localization of the NPM protein into the cytoplasm, thus the designation, NPMc+ AML. NPMc+ AML is seen predominantly in patients with a NK and is essentially mutually exclusive of recurrent chromosomal translocations. Patients with NPM1 mutations are twice as likely as those who lack an NPM1 mutation to also have a FMS-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3) internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation. NPMc+ AML is also characterized by a unique gene expression signature and microRNA signature. NPMc+ AML has important prognostic significance, as NPMc+ AML, in the absence of a coexisting FLT3-ITD mutation, is associated with a favourable outcome. NPM1 mutations have also shown great stability during disease evolution, and therefore represent a possible marker for minimal residual disease detection. Given its distinctive biologic and clinical features and its clear clinical relevance, NPMc+ AML is included as a provisional entity in the 2008 WHO classifications. There is still much to be learned about this genetic alteration, including its exact role in leukaemogenesis, how it interacts with other mutations and why it confers a more favourable prognosis. Further, it represents a potential therapeutic target warranting research aimed at identifying novel small molecules with activity in NPMc+ AML.","['Rau, Rachel', 'Brown, Patrick']","['Rau R', 'Brown P']","['Departments of Oncology and Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,PMC3069851,2009/07/02 09:00,2009/12/22 06:00,['2009/07/02 09:00'],"['2009/07/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.904 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2009 Dec;27(4):171-81. doi: 10.1002/hon.904.,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis']",,,"['K23 CA111728/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA111728-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA060441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS234930'],102,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,

In 659 of 1055 cases (62.4%) with suspected initial MDS, cytomorphology and immunophenotyping were concordant in the categorization of MDS/non-MDS. Cytogenetics, available in 951 of 1055 patients, revealed the highest frequency of aberrant karyotypes when both cytomorphology and immunophenotyping proposed MDS (63 of 227; 27.8%). But also in the groups where either cytomorphology or immunophenotyping showed evidence of MDS, aberrant karyotypes were found in 6% to 14% of patients. Even when both morphology and immunophenotyping showed no MDS, 11 of 208 (5.3%) had cytogenetic aberrations. RUNX1/AML1 mutation screening was positive in 15% in the latter group. NRAS, MLL-PTD, NPM1, and JAK2V617F were detected in low frequencies, confirming MDS diagnosis in the respective cases. CONCLUSIONS: This report outlines the power of a combined diagnostic approach for suspected initial cases of MDS including immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, and molecular genetics with selected markers in addition to cytomorphology. Diagnostic algorithms should be developed, and immunophenotyping should be further validated for this specific indication.","['Bacher, Ulrike', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Weiss, Tamara', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Haferlach, Claudia']","['Bacher U', 'Haferlach T', 'Kern W', 'Weiss T', 'Schnittger S', 'Haferlach C']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Cancer Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,2009/07/02 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/02 09:00'],"['2009/07/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.24501 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2009 Oct 1;115(19):4524-32. doi: 10.1002/cncr.24501.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,,,,,,,,['2009 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,

The expression of many proteins would have been changed during the differentiation process, and some proteins may have played key roles in the differentiation of HL60 cell line induced by this drug. Therefore, we treated HL60 cells with NSC67657 and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) to identify the differentially expressed proteins and determine their functions in cellular differentiation. Of the 45 differentially expressed protein spots investigated, 24 were either elevated or decreased in both the monocytic and granulocytic differentiating HL60 cells, 8 showed significant changes only when induced by NSC67657, and 13 showed significant changes only when induced by ATRA. After verification by RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunocytochemistry, only the protein ICAT was found to be elevated by NSC67657 treatment alone. Although the over-expression of ICAT is not sufficient to induce the differentiation of HL60 cells into monocytes, it did increase the proportion of CD14+ cells in cells pretreated with NSC67657. Successful application of multiple techniques including two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, Western blotting, and eukaryotic electroporation revealed that proteomic and molecular biological analyses provide valuable tools in drug development research.","['Wang, Weijia', 'Zhang, Xiuming', 'Deng, Kaiying', 'Huang, Shifeng', 'Mao, Xiaoqin', 'Fu, Yurong', 'Yi, Zhengjun', 'Yan, Yurong', 'Qiu, Zongyin']","['Wang W', 'Zhang X', 'Deng K', 'Huang S', 'Mao X', 'Fu Y', 'Yi Z', 'Yan Y', 'Qiu Z']","[""Zhongshan People's Hospital, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Zhongshan University, Zhongshan, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Cell Biochem Funct,Cell biochemistry and function,8305874,,2009/07/02 09:00,2009/10/14 06:00,['2009/07/02 09:00'],"['2009/07/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cbf.1576 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biochem Funct. 2009 Aug;27(6):329-37. doi: 10.1002/cbf.1576.,"['0 ((4-(10, 13-dimethyl-3-methylsulfonyloxy-2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,14,15,16,', '17-tetradecahydro-1H-cyclopenta(a)phenanthren-17-yl)pentyl) methanesulfonate)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (CTNNBIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mesylates)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Steroids)', '0 (Sterols)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/agonists', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatin/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mesylates', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proteome/analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Steroids', 'Sterols/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,

Pure edelfosine can be dispersed in aqueous media in the form of micelles. One important, negative side effect of edelfosine is that it is highly haemolytic. In this paper, we show that edelfosine can be co-dispersed in water with certain lipids (particularly cholesterol, campesterol or beta-sitosterol) so that it gives rise to liposomes. Surface pressure measurements demonstrate that edelfosine is slowly released from these liposomes. In liposomal form, edelfosine remains apoptogenic for a variety of leukemia cell lines, while its haemolytic effect is abolished. The phenomenon is explained on the basis of the complementarity of the molecular geometries of sterols and edelfosine.","['Busto, Jon V', 'Del Canto-Janez, Esther', 'Goni, Felix M', 'Mollinedo, Faustino', 'Alonso, Alicia']","['Busto JV', 'Del Canto-Janez E', 'Goni FM', 'Mollinedo F', 'Alonso A']","['Unidad de Biofisica (Centro Mixto CSIC-UPV/EHU), Universidad del Pais Vasco, P.O.

METHODS: Forty AML patients hospitalized at the authors hospital were treated with Chinese drugs and chemotherapy. The routine examination, immunophenotype and karyotype analyses were carried out. The clinical efficacy was observed and the prognostic factors were analyzed. RESULTS: (1) Clinical efficacy: Twenty patients had complete remission (CR), with the CR rate being 50.0%. Among these patients, the CR rate was 73.9% (17/23) in de novo AML and 17.6% (3/17) in secondary or refractory AML, respectively. The median disease free survival (DFS) was 6 months (2-32 months) and median overall survival (OS) was 7 months (1-36 months). (2) Analysis of prognostic factors: Aging (> 60 years) and hepatosplenomegaly or extramedullary leukemia did not affect the treatment outcome. Patients with lower white blood cell (WBC) counts (<4.0x10(9)/L) had a significantly higher CR rate (P<0.01). Secondary or refractory AML was associated with a lower CR rate and shorter OS (P<0.01,P<0.05). Expression of CD34 was an adverse factor for obtaining CR (P<0.05) and survival in both DFS and OS (P<0.05,P<0.01). The expression of CD56 was significantly associated with a lower CR rate (P<0.05), but did not affect DFS and OS. Twenty-three (57.5%) out of 40 cases had chromosomal abnormalities. The CR rate was decreased and both DFS and OS shortened stepwise from the cases with favorable cytogenetics to those with intermediate and unfavorable cytogenetics (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The combined treatment of Chinese drugs with chemotherapy has a predominant effect in de novo AML. Secondary or refractory AML, expression of CD34 and CD56, and unfavorable cytogenetics were the main factors of poor prognosis in AML.","['Hu, Xiao-mei', 'Liu, Feng', 'Zheng, Chun-mei', 'Li, Liu', 'Liu, Chi', 'Zhang, Shan-shan', 'Xiao, Hai-yan', 'Yang, Xiao-hong', 'Wang, Hong-zhi', 'Xu, Yong-gang', 'Hu, Nai-ping', 'Ma, Rou']","['Hu XM', 'Liu F', 'Zheng CM', 'Li L', 'Liu C', 'Zhang SS', 'Xiao HY', 'Yang XH', 'Wang HZ', 'Xu YG', 'Hu NP', 'Ma R']","['Department of Hematology, Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100091, China.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20090702,China,Chin J Integr Med,Chinese journal of integrative medicine,101181180,,2009/07/02 09:00,2009/08/01 09:00,['2009/07/02 09:00'],"['2008/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/01 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11655-009-0193-x [doi]'],ppublish,Chin J Integr Med. 2009 Jun;15(3):193-7. doi: 10.1007/s11655-009-0193-x.

Most of the studies about resistance have focused on point mutations on BCR/ABL. However, other types of resistance that do not imply mutations in BCR/ABL have been also described. In the present report we aim to study the role of several MAPK in IM resistance not associate to BCR/ABL mutations. Therefore we used an experimental system of resistant cell lines generated by co-culturing with IM (K562, Lama 84) as well as primary material from resistant and responder patient without BCR/ABL mutations. Here we demonstrate that Erk5 and p38MAPK signaling pathways are not implicated in the acquired resistance phenotype. However, Erk2, but not Erk1, is critical for the acquired resistance to IM. In fact, Bcr/Abl activates preferentially Erk2 in transient transfection in a dose dependent fashion through the c-Abl part of the chimeric protein. Finally, we present evidences demonstrating how constitutive activation of Erk2 is a de novo mechanism of resistance to IM. In summary our data support the use of therapeutic approaches based on Erk2 inhibition, which could be added to the therapeutic armamentarium to fight CML, especially when IM resistance develops secondary to Erk2 activation.","['Aceves-Luquero, Clara I', 'Agarwal, Anupriya', 'Callejas-Valera, Juan L', 'Arias-Gonzalez, Laura', 'Esparis-Ogando, Azucena', 'del Peso Ovalle, Luis', 'Bellon-Echeverria, Itxaso', 'de la Cruz-Morcillo, Miguel A', 'Galan Moya, Eva M', 'Moreno Gimeno, Inmaculada', 'Gomez, Juan C', 'Deininger, Michael W', 'Pandiella, Atanasio', 'Sanchez Prieto, Ricardo']","['Aceves-Luquero CI', 'Agarwal A', 'Callejas-Valera JL', 'Arias-Gonzalez L', 'Esparis-Ogando A', 'del Peso Ovalle L', 'Bellon-Echeverria I', 'de la Cruz-Morcillo MA', 'Galan Moya EM', 'Moreno Gimeno I', 'Gomez JC', 'Deininger MW', 'Pandiella A', 'Sanchez Prieto R']","['CRIB/Facultad de Medicina, UCLM, Albacete, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090701,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC2699476,2009/07/02 09:00,2009/11/11 06:00,['2009/07/02 09:00'],"['2009/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0006124 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Jul 1;4(7):e6124. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0006124.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Point Mutation', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assess here whether scoring mutation based on in vitro inhibitory concentration of each TKI-mutation pair can predict long-term clinical outcome. Among 169 patients with CML after imatinib failure, mutations were detected before TKI switch in 41 (48%) treated with dasatinib and 45 (52%) treated with nilotinib. Inhibitory concentration values for each TKI-mutation pair were stratified into high (n = 42), intermediate (n = 25), low (T315I, n = 9), or unknown sensitivity (n = 10). Hematologic and cytogenetic response rates were similar for patients with or without mutations. For patients in chronic phase, hematologic and cytogenetic responses correlated with mutation score; tumors with low and intermediate scores had lower response rates than those with highly sensitive mutations, and worse event-free and overall survival. These correlations with overall survival were not seen for advanced phases. Mutation scoring can predict outcome in CML-chronic phase with imatinib failure treated with second-generation TKIs and can help in therapy selection.

Nanoparticulate forms of As(2)O(3) encapsulated in 100-nm-scale, folate-targeted liposomes have been developed to lower systematic toxicity and provide a platform for targeting this agent. The resultant arsenic ""nanobins"" are stable under physiologic conditions but undergo triggered drug release when the pH is lowered to endosomal/lysosomal levels. Cellular uptake and antitumor efficacy of these arsenic liposomes have been evaluated in folate receptor (FR)-positive human nasopharyngeal (KB) and cervix (HeLa) cells, as well as FR-negative human breast (MCF-7) tumor cells through confocal microscopy, inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, and cytotoxicity studies. Uptake of folate-targeted liposomal arsenic by KB cells was three to six times higher than that of free As(2)O(3) or nontargeted liposomal arsenic; the enhanced uptake occurs through folate-mediated endocytosis, leading to a 28-fold increase in cytotoxicity. In contrast, tumor cells with lower FR density on the surface (HeLa and MCF-7) showed much less uptake of the folate-targeted drug and lower efficacy. In cocultures of KB and MCF-7 cells, the folate-targeted arsenic liposomes were exclusively internalized by KB cells, showing high targeting specificity. Our studies further indicate that folate-targeted delivery of As(2)O(3) with coencapsulated nickel(II) ions (as a nontoxic adjuvant) potentiates the As(2)O(3) efficacy in relatively insensitive solid tumor-derived cells and holds the promise of improving drug therapeutic index.","['Chen, Haimei', 'Ahn, Richard', 'Van den Bossche, Jeroen', 'Thompson, David H', ""O'Halloran, Thomas V""]","['Chen H', 'Ahn R', 'Van den Bossche J', 'Thompson DH', ""O'Halloran TV""]","['Department of Chemistry, Chemistry of Life Processes Institute, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090630,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,PMC3098497,2009/07/02 09:00,2009/10/20 06:00,['2009/07/02 09:00'],"['2009/07/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-09-0045 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0045 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2009 Jul;8(7):1955-63. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0045.

Moreover, GSK1070916 inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells with EC(50) values of <10 nmol/L in over 100 cell lines spanning a broad range of tumor types. Although GSK1070916 has potent activity against proliferating cells, a dramatic shift in potency is observed in primary, nondividing, normal human vein endothelial cells, consistent with the proposed mechanism. We further determined that treated cells do not arrest in mitosis but instead fail to divide and become polyploid, ultimately leading to apoptosis. GSK1070916 shows dose-dependent inhibition of phosphorylation of an Aurora B-specific substrate in mice and consistent with its broad cellular activity, has antitumor effects in 10 human tumor xenograft models including breast, colon, lung, and two leukemia models. These results show that GSK1070916 is a potent Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor that has the potential for antitumor activity in a wide range of human cancers.","['Hardwicke, Mary Ann', 'Oleykowski, Catherine A', 'Plant, Ramona', 'Wang, Jamin', 'Liao, Qiaoyin', 'Moss, Katherine', 'Newlander, Ken', 'Adams, Jerry L', 'Dhanak, Dashyant', 'Yang, Jingsong', 'Lai, Zhihong', 'Sutton, David', 'Patrick, Denis']","['Hardwicke MA', 'Oleykowski CA', 'Plant R', 'Wang J', 'Liao Q', 'Moss K', 'Newlander K', 'Adams JL', 'Dhanak D', 'Yang J', 'Lai Z', 'Sutton D', 'Patrick D']","['Oncology Biology, GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA 19426, USA.

The purpose of the present study was to identify the mode of resistance of newly derived imatinib-resistant (IM-R) and PD166326-resistant (PD-R) CML cells. IM-R and PD-R clones exhibited an increase in viability and a decrease in caspase activation in response to various doses of imatinib and PD166326, respectively, as compared with parental K562 cells. Resistance involved neither mutations in BCR-ABL nor increased BCR-ABL, MDR1 or Lyn expression, all known modes of resistance. To gain insight into the resistance mechanisms, we used pangenomic microarrays and identified 281 genes modulated in parental versus IM-R and PD-R cells. The gene signature was similar for IM-R and PD-R cells, accordingly with the cross-sensitivity observed for both inhibitors. These genes were functionally associated with pathways linked to development, cell adhesion, cell growth, and the JAK-STAT cascade. Especially relevant were the increased expression of the tyrosine kinases AXL and Fyn as well as CD44 and HMGA2. Small interfering RNA experiments and pharmacologic approaches identified FYN as a candidate for resistance to imatinib. Our findings provide a comprehensive picture of the transcriptional events associated with imatinib and PD166326 resistance and identify Fyn as a new potential target for therapeutic intervention in CML.","['Grosso, Sebastien', 'Puissant, Alexandre', 'Dufies, Maeva', 'Colosetti, Pascal', 'Jacquel, Arnaud', 'Lebrigand, Kevin', 'Barbry, Pascal', 'Deckert, Marcel', 'Cassuto, Jill Patrice', 'Mari, Bernard', 'Auberger, Patrick']","['Grosso S', 'Puissant A', 'Dufies M', 'Colosetti P', 'Jacquel A', 'Lebrigand K', 'Barbry P', 'Deckert M', 'Cassuto JP', 'Mari B', 'Auberger P']","['INSERM U895, Cell Death, Differentiation and Cancer Team, Faculte de Medecine de Nice, Nice Cedex 2, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090630,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,,2009/07/02 09:00,2009/10/20 06:00,['2009/07/02 09:00'],"['2009/07/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-09-0168 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0168 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2009 Jul;8(7):1924-33. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0168.

It is thought that the efficacy of NM-HSCT is mediated by recognition of tumor cells by T cells in the donor stem cell graft. We evaluated the development of CTLs specific for CLL after NM-HSCT to determine if their presence correlated with antitumor efficacy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 12 transplant recipients at intervals after NM-HSCT were stimulated in vitro with CLL cells. Polyclonal T-cell lines and CD8(+) T-cell clones were derived from these cultures and evaluated for lysis of donor and recipient target cells including CLL. The presence and specificity of responses was correlated with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Eight of the 12 patients achieved remission or a major antitumor response and all 8 developed CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells specific for antigens expressed by CLL. A clonal analysis of the CD8(+) T-cell response identified T cells specific for multiple minor histocompatibility (H) antigens expressed on CLL in six of the responding patients. A significant fraction of the CD8(+) T-cell response in some patients was also directed against nonshared tumor-specific antigens. By contrast, CLL-reactive T cells were not detected in the four patients who had persistent CLL after NM-HSCT, despite the development of graft-versus-host disease. CONCLUSIONS: The development of a diverse T-cell response specific for minor H and tumor-associated antigens expressed by CLL predicts an effective graft-versus-leukemia response after NM-HSCT.","['Nishida, Tetsuya', 'Hudecek, Michael', 'Kostic, Ana', 'Bleakley, Marie', 'Warren, Edus H', 'Maloney, David', 'Storb, Rainer', 'Riddell, Stanley R']","['Nishida T', 'Hudecek M', 'Kostic A', 'Bleakley M', 'Warren EH', 'Maloney D', 'Storb R', 'Riddell SR']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090630,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,PMC2785487,2009/07/02 09:00,2009/09/29 06:00,['2009/07/02 09:00'],"['2009/07/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-09-0199 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-0199 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Jul 15;15(14):4759-68. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-0199.

Here we show that telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), a catalytic component of telomerase, is recruited to promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies through its interaction with PML-IV. Treatment of interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) in H1299 cells resulted in the increase of PML proteins with a concurrent decrease of telomerase activity, as previously reported. PML depletion, however, stimulated telomerase activity that had been inhibited by IFNalpha with no changes in TERT mRNA levels. Upon treatment with IFNalpha, exogenous TERT localized to PML nuclear bodies and binding between TERT and PML increased. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analyses showed that TERT specifically bound to PML-IV. Residues 553-633 of the C-terminal region of PML-IV were required for its interaction with the TERT region spanning residues 1-350 and 595-946. The expression of PML-IV and its deletion mutant, 553-633, suppressed intrinsic telomerase activity in H1299. TERT-mediated immunoprecipitation of PML or the 553-633 fragment demonstrated that these interactions inhibited telomerase activity. H1299 cell lines stably expressing PML-IV displayed decreased telomerase activity with no change of TERT mRNA levels. Accordingly, telomere length of PML-IV stable cell lines was shortened. These results indicate that PML-IV is a negative regulator of telomerase in the post-translational state.","['Oh, Wonkyung', 'Ghim, Jaewang', 'Lee, Eun-Woo', 'Yang, Mi-Ran', 'Kim, Eui Tae', 'Ahn, Jin-Hyun', 'Song, Jaewhan']","['Oh W', 'Ghim J', 'Lee EW', 'Yang MR', 'Kim ET', 'Ahn JH', 'Song J']","['Department of Biotechnology and Bioengineering, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Suwon, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090630,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,,2009/07/02 09:00,2009/10/17 06:00,['2009/07/02 09:00'],"['2009/07/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/17 06:00 [medline]']","['jcs.048066 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.048066 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2009 Aug 1;122(Pt 15):2613-22. doi: 10.1242/jcs.048066.

The manufacturer's decision-analytic Markov model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of treatment with fludarabine monotherapy, fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil was considered to be the most relevant source for informing this STA;it was appropriate for the decision problem and the data sources used to inform the model were appropriate from a UK NHS perspective.The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide compared with chlorambucil from the revised model presented in the manufacturer's addendum was pounds 3244 per additional quality-adjusted life-year.The results were robust to a range of subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Additional sensitivity and survival analyses were carried by the ERG to investigate possible bias in the results. This brought into question the validity of the assumptions underpinning the extrapolation of data over a lifetime time horizon and showed that the ICER estimates submitted by the manufacturer were notcalculated correctly and uncertainty surrounding the decision problems was not expressed fully.Based on these analyses the ERG suggests that further evidence is needed to enable an accurate assessment to be made of the clinical and cost effectiveness of fludarabine as first-line treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The guidance issued by NICE in December 2006 as a result of the STA states that fludarabine monotherapy,within its licensed indication, is not recommended for the first-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia; no recommendations have been made with respect to fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide combination therapy because the current marketing authorisation does not specifically provide a recommendation that fludarabine should be used concurrently with other drugs for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.","['Walker, S', 'Palmer, S', 'Erhorn, S', 'Brent, S', 'Dyker, A', 'Ferrie, L', 'Horsley, W', 'Macfarlane, K', 'White, S', 'Thomas, S']","['Walker S', 'Palmer S', 'Erhorn S', 'Brent S', 'Dyker A', 'Ferrie L', 'Horsley W', 'Macfarlane K', 'White S', 'Thomas S']","['Centre for Health Economics, University of York and NHS Northern and Yorkshire Regional Drug and Therapeutics Centre, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Health Technol Assess,"Health technology assessment (Winchester, England)",9706284,,2009/07/11 09:00,2009/09/23 06:00,['2009/07/02 09:00'],"['2009/07/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3310/hta13suppl1/06 [doi]'],ppublish,Health Technol Assess. 2009 Jun;13 Suppl 1:35-40. doi: 10.3310/hta13suppl1/06.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/economics', 'Quality of Life', 'Survival Analysis', 'Technology Assessment, Biomedical', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/economics/therapeutic use']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combined use of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and IL-4 promoted the internalization of CCR9 and therefore attenuated leukemia cell infiltration and metastasis. In this study, we preliminarily investigated the mechanism of internalization of CCR9 on MOLT4 cell model (a human leukemia T-cell line, naturally expresses CCR9) and found that IL-2 upregulated the cell surface expression of IL-4Ralpha (CD124) greatly, whereas IL-4 had no significant influence on alpha (CD25) and beta subunits (CD122) of IL-2R. Moreover, specific inhibitors, such as staurosporine, H89 and heparin, inhibited internalization of CCR9, which indicated a role of protein kinase C (PKC) and G protein-coupled kinase 2 (GRK2), respectively. Furthermore, GRK2 was upregulated and translocated to cell membrane in IL-2 and IL-4 treated cells which indicated that PKC could be a prerequisite for GRK2 activity.","['Tong, Xiaoling', 'Zhang, Lijun', 'Zhang, Li', 'Hu, Meng', 'Leng, Jun', 'Yu, Beibei', 'Zhou, Beibei', 'Hu, Yi', 'Zhang, Qiuping']","['Tong X', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang L', 'Hu M', 'Leng J', 'Yu B', 'Zhou B', 'Hu Y', 'Zhang Q']","['Department of Immunology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Donghu Road 185, Wuchang, Wuhan 430071, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Cell Mol Immunol,Cellular & molecular immunology,101242872,PMC4003061,2009/07/02 09:00,2009/09/29 06:00,['2009/07/02 09:00'],"['2009/07/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1038/cmi.2009.25 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Mol Immunol. 2009 Jun;6(3):181-9. doi: 10.1038/cmi.2009.25.,"['0 (CC chemokine receptor 9)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor beta Subunit)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, CCR)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.15 (G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.15 (GRK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.15 (GRK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.16 (G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.16 (G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 5)', 'EC 2.7.11.16 (G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.16 (G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 6)', 'EC 2.7.11.16 (GRK5 protein, human)', 'M876330O56 (N-(2-(4-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Endocytosis/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 5/genetics/metabolism', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor beta Subunit/metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, CCR/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-4/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long term efficacy and toxicity profiles of low dose HHT were evaluated in this study. METHODS: One hundred and six patients with CML received 1.5 mg/m(2) of HHT alone by continuous daily infusion for seven to nine days every four weeks. Of 79 patients in the control group, 31 were treated with interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) and 48 with hydroxycarbamide. For 17 patients who failed to achieve cytogenetic response within 12 months' treatment of IFN-alpha, HHT was administered. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the BCR-ABL mRNA expression in 36 Philadelphia positive CML patients enrolled after 2007. Haematological and cytogenetic responses were evaluated in all patients at the 12th month of follow-up. Long term efficacy was assessed in a follow-up with a median time of 54 months (12 months-98 months). RESULTS: After 12 months of therapy, cytogenetic response rate of the HHT, IFN-alpha and hydroxycarbamide groups were 39/106, 14/31 and 3/48, and corresponding molecular cytogenetic response rates 6/18, 3/8 and 0. Of the 17 patients who received HHT as salvage treatment, 6 achieved cytogenetic response (3 major). At the 48 months' follow-up, cytogenetic response was maintained in 32/39 patients treated with HHT. Patients who had cytogenetic response in HHT group or treated with IFN-alpha also showed longer median chronic durations, which were 45 months (12 months-98 months) and 49 months (12 months-92 months) respectively, indicating a longer survival time. CONCLUSIONS: Low dose HHT alone showed considerable short term and long term efficacy in the treatment of late stage CML. It may also be a good choice for patients who have failed imatinib, IFN-alpha treatment or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation or cannot afford these treatments.","['Li, Yu-Feng', 'Deng, Zhi-Kui', 'Xuan, Heng-Bao', 'Zhu, Jia-Bin', 'Ding, Bang-He', 'Liu, Xiao-Ning', 'Chen, Bao-An']","['Li YF', 'Deng ZK', 'Xuan HB', 'Zhu JB', 'Ding BH', 'Liu XN', 'Chen BA']","['Department of Haematology, Zhongda Hospital of Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210000, China. liyufeng99@netease.com']",['eng'],"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,,2009/07/02 09:00,2009/10/16 06:00,['2009/07/02 09:00'],"['2009/07/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2009 Jun 20;122(12):1413-7.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Harringtonines/*therapeutic use', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Specimens of aseptically loosened tissue were obtained at revision surgery, and the expression of SUMO-1 was analyzed by in situ hybridization. SUMO-1 levels in FLS were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were used to study the subcellular localization of SUMO-1. The functional role of SUMO-1 in Fas-induced apoptosis of prosthesis-loosening FLS was investigated by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of SUMO-1 and by gene transfer of the nuclear SUMO-specific protease SENP1. RESULTS: SUMO-1 was expressed strongly in aseptically loosened tissue and was found prominently at sites adjacent to bone. Prosthesis-loosening FLS expressed levels of SUMO-1 similar to the levels expressed by rheumatoid arthritis (RA) FLS, with SUMO-1 being found mainly in promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies. Knockdown of SUMO-1 had no effect on spontaneous apoptosis but significantly increased the susceptibility of prosthesis-loosening FLS to Fas-induced apoptosis. Gene transfer of the nuclear SUMO-specific protease SENP1 reverted the apoptosis-inhibiting effects of SUMO-1. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that SUMO-1 is involved in the activation of both RA FLS and prosthesis-loosening FLS by preventing these cells from undergoing apoptosis. Modification of nuclear proteins by SUMO-1 contributes to the antiapoptotic effects of SUMO-1 in prosthesis-loosening FLS, providing evidence for the specific activation of sumoylation during their differentiation. Therefore, SUMO-1 may be an interesting target for novel strategies to prevent aseptic prosthesis loosening.","['Meinecke, Ingmar', 'Pap, Geza', 'Mendoza, Heidi', 'Drange, Steffen', 'Ender, Stephan', 'Strietholt, Simon', 'Gay, Renate E', 'Seyfert, Christine', 'Ink, Barbara', 'Gay, Steffen', 'Pap, Thomas', 'Peters, Marvin A']","['Meinecke I', 'Pap G', 'Mendoza H', 'Drange S', 'Ender S', 'Strietholt S', 'Gay RE', 'Seyfert C', 'Ink B', 'Gay S', 'Pap T', 'Peters MA']","['University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,,2009/07/01 09:00,2009/09/15 06:00,['2009/07/01 09:00'],"['2009/07/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/art.24633 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 2009 Jul;60(7):2065-70. doi: 10.1002/art.24633.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.- (SENP1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/metabolism/pathology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Endopeptidases/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Hip Joint/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Knee Joint/metabolism/pathology', '*Prosthesis Failure', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'SUMO-1 Protein/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Synovial Membrane/*metabolism/*pathology', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,['Arthritis Rheum. 2009 Aug;60(8):2540'],,,,,,,

Here, we report that TRAIL induces apoptosis in Jurkat and SUPT1 T cell lines and in human T-ALL blasts but not in healthy subject-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In parallel, the treatment with TRAIL and Tyrphostin (AG-490), a selective Janus kinase 2 inhibitor, produces an evident enhancement of cytotoxicity, characterized by a significant inhibition of Stat3 phosphorylation compared to controls or to TRAIL alone-treated samples, and associated with a dramatic decrease of both cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 mRNA levels. Downregulation of cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 by specific small interference RNAs significantly amplifies TRAIL-reduced cytotoxicity. All together, these findings strongly indicate that cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 downregulation is a fundamental step in the signaling pathways mediating the combinatorial effect of TRAIL and AG-490 on T cell leukemia. These findings may help to open new routes for the development of less toxic pharmacological strategies in the treatment of patients affected by TRAIL-sensitive leukemias.","['Lanuti, Paola', 'Bertagnolo, Valeria', 'Pierdomenico, Laura', 'Bascelli, Adriana', 'Santavenere, Eugenio', 'Alinari, Lapo', 'Capitani, Silvano', 'Miscia, Sebastiano', 'Marchisio, Marco']","['Lanuti P', 'Bertagnolo V', 'Pierdomenico L', 'Bascelli A', 'Santavenere E', 'Alinari L', 'Capitani S', 'Miscia S', 'Marchisio M']","[""Cell Signalling Unit, Department of Biomorphology, University G. d'Annunzio of Chieti-Pescara, Via dei Vestini 13, 66013 Chieti, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090630,England,Cell Res,Cell research,9425763,,2009/07/01 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/07/01 09:00'],"['2009/07/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['cr200980 [pii]', '10.1038/cr.2009.80 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Res. 2009 Sep;19(9):1079-89. doi: 10.1038/cr.2009.80.

We report 16 multitransfused FA patients who underwent peripheral stem cell transplantation from 13 related and 3 unrelated donors. Although the first 6 patients received thoraco-abdominal irradiation + cyclophosphamide + antithymocyte globulin (regimen A) for conditioning, fludarabine (FLU) + cyclophosphamide + antithymocyte globulin (regimen B) were used in the last 10 patients in which 3 of them received unrelated graft. Cyclosporin A was given alone for the related allografts but also included mycophenolate mofetil for the unrelated allograft as graft versus host disease prophylaxis. We observed a lower risk of peritransplant morbidity and mortality with fewer and milder graft versus host disease in FLU based group. We lost 3 patients in regimen A group and 1 of them from secondary acute myeloid leukemia. Three patients are alive with transfusion independent. In regimen B group, 9 of 10 patients are alive with normal hematologic parameters and full donor chimerism. The longest follow-up durations are 90 and 60 months in regimen A and B, respectively. In conclusion, FLU based conditioning is more effective and successful with lower toxicity in multitransfused FA patients. However, it needs more experience and longer follow up duration.","['Yesilipek, Mehmet Akif', 'Karasu, Gulsun Tezcan', 'Kupesiz, Alphan', 'Uygun, Vedat', 'Hazar, Volkan']","['Yesilipek MA', 'Karasu GT', 'Kupesiz A', 'Uygun V', 'Hazar V']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Akdeniz University School of Medicine, Antalya, Turkiye. yesilipek@akdeniz.edu.tr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,2009/07/01 09:00,2009/07/16 09:00,['2009/07/01 09:00'],"['2009/07/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181a1c27a [doi]', '00043426-200907000-00011 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2009 Jul;31(7):512-5. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181a1c27a.,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Fanconi Anemia/*therapy', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Radiotherapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PRES is a rare central nervous system complication in childhood hematologic-oncologic patients and shows very different neurologic symptoms between patients, from numbness on extremities to generalized seizure. The etiology of PRES was not well known until these days. In this study, 8 patients with PRES were reviewed, retrospectively. There were 4 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia, 1 with aplastic anemia, and 3 with solid tumors (1 patient each for neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, and osteosarcoma). Allogeneic stem cell transplantation was performed in 2 patients. Immunosuppressive agents such as tacrolimus and cyclosporine A were used in 3 patients. One neuroblastoma patient was in immediate postoperative status. All patients experienced seizure attacks of different types and showed typical MRI findings. Follow-up MRIs revealed significant improvements. From this review, we might consider chemotherapy and surgery as additive causes for PRES other than immunosuppressive agents. Therefore, careful examination of the patients receiving chemotherapy and surgery was needed to find out this uncommon but good prognostic complication.","['Won, Sung Chul', 'Kwon, Seung Yeon', 'Han, Jung Woo', 'Choi, Seong Yeol', 'Lyu, Chuhl Joo']","['Won SC', 'Kwon SY', 'Han JW', 'Choi SY', 'Lyu CJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,2009/07/01 09:00,2009/07/16 09:00,['2009/07/01 09:00'],"['2009/07/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181a71868 [doi]', '00043426-200907000-00009 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2009 Jul;31(7):505-8. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181a71868.,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Diseases/*etiology/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*complications/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications/therapy', 'Seizures/etiology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Syndrome']",,,,,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluated the frequency and severity of complications of bone marrow aspiration biopsy and lumbar puncture/intrathecal chemotherapy under general anesthesia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective observational study was performed from November 2003 to August 2005. Patients with cancer younger than 21 years old, receiving treatment at the Pediatric Oncology Unity of Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, undergoing diagnostic and/or therapeutic short duration procedures carried out under general anesthesia in the outpatient surgery unit. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-seven patients were submitted to 423 procedures under general anesthesia. There were 61% boys, mean age of 7.5 years (0.2 to 21) and ASA II 98%. Eighty seven percent of the procedures were carried out in patients with leukemia or lymphoma. The majority of the procedures had no adverse events during intraoperative and postoperative periods. No procedure had to be suspended after it had begun. One patient had lumbar pain after the procedure and was admitted to the ward with suspected subdural bleeding, but this was not confirmed. No patient needed cardiopulmonary reanimation or treatment in the intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: General anesthesia for short duration painful procedures in children undergoing treatment for malignancies is safe when carried out by trained professionals in outpatient clinical surgery unit.","['Meneses, Clarice F', 'de Freitas, Julio Cesar', 'Castro, Claudio G Jr', 'Copetti, Felipe', 'Brunetto, Algemir L']","['Meneses CF', 'de Freitas JC', 'Castro CG Jr', 'Copetti F', 'Brunetto AL']","['Pediatric Oncology Unit daggerAnesthesiology, Perioperative Medicine Unit, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. cmeneses@hcpa.ufrgs.br']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,2009/07/01 09:00,2009/07/16 09:00,['2009/07/01 09:00'],"['2009/07/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181a974a1 [doi]', '00043426-200907000-00001 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2009 Jul;31(7):465-70. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181a974a1.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anesthesia, General/*adverse effects', 'Biopsy, Needle/*adverse effects/methods', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination/adverse effects/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis', 'Pain, Postoperative/epidemiology/etiology', 'Spinal Puncture/*adverse effects/methods']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study analyzed the TET2 gene in 61 MPN cases from 42 families. Fifteen distinct mutations were identified in 12 (20%) JAK2(V617F)-positive or -negative patients. In a patient with 2 TET2 mutations, the analysis of 5 blood samples at different phases of her disease showed the sequential occurrence of JAK2(V617F) and TET2 mutations concomitantly to the disease evolution. Analysis of familial segregation confirmed that TET2 mutations were not inherited but somatically acquired. TET2 mutations were mainly observed (10 of 12) in patients with primary myelofibrosis or patients with polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia who secondarily evolved toward myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia.","['Saint-Martin, Cecile', 'Leroy, Gwendoline', 'Delhommeau, Francois', 'Panelatti, Gerard', 'Dupont, Sabrina', 'James, Chloe', 'Plo, Isabelle', 'Bordessoule, Dominique', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Delannoy, Andre', 'Devidas, Alain', 'Gardembas-Pain, Martine', 'Isnard, Francoise', 'Plumelle, Yves', 'Bernard, Olivier', 'Vainchenker, William', 'Najman, Albert', 'Bellanne-Chantelot, Christine']","['Saint-Martin C', 'Leroy G', 'Delhommeau F', 'Panelatti G', 'Dupont S', 'James C', 'Plo I', 'Bordessoule D', 'Chomienne C', 'Delannoy A', 'Devidas A', 'Gardembas-Pain M', 'Isnard F', 'Plumelle Y', 'Bernard O', 'Vainchenker W', 'Najman A', 'Bellanne-Chantelot C']","['Department of Genetics, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP) Groupe Hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090629,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/07/01 09:00,2009/10/01 06:00,['2009/07/01 09:00'],"['2009/07/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37188-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-01-197525 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Aug 20;114(8):1628-32. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-01-197525.

The response rates in the EPO versus SC alone arms were 36% versus 9.6%, respectively, at the initial treatment step, 47% in the EPO arm, including subsequent steps. Responding patients had significantly lower serum EPO levels (45% vs 5% responses for levels < 200 mU/mL vs > or = 200 mU/mL) and improvement in multiple quality-of-life domains. With prolonged follow-up (median, 5.8 years), no differences were found in overall survival of patients in the EPO versus SC arms (median, 3.1 vs 2.6 years) or in the incidence of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (7.5% and 10.5% patients, respectively). Increased survival was demonstrated for erythroid responders versus nonresponders (median, 5.5 vs 2.3 years). Flow cytometric analysis showed that the percentage of P-glycoprotein(+) CD34(+) marrow blasts was positively correlated with longer overall survival.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional evaluation of 118 survivors of childhood ALL (median age, 23.0 years; range, 18 to 37 years), insulin resistance was estimated using the homeostasis model for assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Sex-specific comparisons were made with a cohort of 30- to 37-year-old individuals from the same region participating in the Dallas Heart Study (DHS, N = 782). ALL survivors were stratified by treatment with and without cranial radiotherapy (CRT). RESULTS: Female ALL survivors had a significantly higher HOMA-IR (CRT, mean 4.6, 95% CI, 3.6 to 5.7; no CRT, mean 3.3, 95% CI, 2.8 to 3.8) in comparison with DHS women (mean 2.4, 95% CI, 2.2 to 2.7). Eighty percent of women treated with CRT had at least three of six CVD risk factors, and they were significantly more likely to have three or more risk factors compared with DHS women (odds ratio [OR], 5.96; 95% CI, 2.15 to 16.47). Male ALL survivors had a significantly higher HOMA-IR (CRT, mean 4.0, 95% CI, 2.8 to 5.6; no CRT, mean 3.4, 95% CI, 2.9 to 3.9) in comparison with DHS men (mean 2.3, 95% CI, 2.1 to 2.6), but were not more likely to have multiple CVD risk factors. CONCLUSION: ALL survivors had an increased prevalence of insulin resistance in comparison with a cohort of older individuals from the same community. Importantly, women treated with CRT seem to have an increased prevalence of multiple CVD risk factors, warranting close monitoring and risk-reducing strategies.","['Oeffinger, Kevin C', 'Adams-Huet, Beverley', 'Victor, Ronald G', 'Church, Timothy S', 'Snell, Peter G', 'Dunn, Andrea L', 'Eshelman-Kent, Debra A', 'Ross, Robert', 'Janiszewski, Peter M', 'Turoff, Alicia J', 'Brooks, Sandra', 'Vega, Gloria Lena']","['Oeffinger KC', 'Adams-Huet B', 'Victor RG', 'Church TS', 'Snell PG', 'Dunn AL', 'Eshelman-Kent DA', 'Ross R', 'Janiszewski PM', 'Turoff AJ', 'Brooks S', 'Vega GL']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021, USA. oeffingk@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090629,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,PMC2720083,2009/07/01 09:00,2009/08/21 09:00,['2009/07/01 09:00'],"['2009/07/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/21 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.19.7251 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.19.7251 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Aug 1;27(22):3698-704. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.19.7251.

Feather shafts were collected from 7 FGV-positive chickens and stored at room temperature for 30 days. DNA and RNA were extracted from these dried materials. All DNA and complementary DNA (cDNA) prepared from the RNA showed positive results for chicken beta-actin and FGV, respectively. Screening for FGV was performed on Japanese fowls kept in zoological garden N. Of the feather shafts collected from 57 birds, 1 sample tested positive for FGV according to PCR of DNA and cDNA samples from the dried feather shafts. This positive bird originated from zoological garden A and had brain lesions suggestive of fowl glioma.

Leukemia inhibitory factor has been utilized to maintain the symmetrical self-renewal and pluripotency of mESCs in culture. It has been suggested that molecules with significant cellular effects on retinoblastoma protein (pRb) or its related pathways should have functional impact on mESC proliferation and differentiation. However, the involvement of pRb in pluripotent differentiation of mESCs has not been extensively elaborated. In this paper, we present novel experimental data indicating that Cdk2ap1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2-associating protein 1), an inhibitor of G(1)/S transition through down-regulation of CDK2 and an essential gene for early embryonic development, confers competency for mESC differentiation. Targeted disruption of Cdk2ap1 in mESCs resulted in abrogation of leukemia inhibitory factor withdrawal-induced differentiation, along with altered pRb phosphorylation. The differentiation competency of the Cdk2ap1(-/-) mESCs was restored upon the ectopic expression of Cdk2ap1 or a nonphosphorylatable pRb mutant (mouse Ser(788) --> Ala), suggesting that the CDK2AP1-mediated differentiation of mESCs was elicited through the regulation of pRb. Further analysis on mESC maintenance or differentiation-related gene expression supports the phosphorylation at serine 788 in pRb plays a significant role for the CDK2AP1-mediated differentiation of mESCs. These data clearly demonstrate that CDK2AP1 is a competency factor in the proper differentiation of mESCs by modulating the phosphorylation level of pRb. This sheds light on the role of the establishment of the proper somatic cell type cell cycle regulation for mESCs to enter into the differentiation process.","['Kim, Yong', 'Deshpande, Amit', 'Dai, Yanshan', 'Kim, Jeffrey J', 'Lindgren, Anne', 'Conway, Anne', 'Clark, Amander T', 'Wong, David T']","['Kim Y', 'Deshpande A', 'Dai Y', 'Kim JJ', 'Lindgren A', 'Conway A', 'Clark AT', 'Wong DT']","['School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA. thadyk@ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090629,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC2749114,2009/07/01 09:00,2009/10/20 06:00,['2009/07/01 09:00'],"['2009/07/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(18)60769-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.026088 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Aug 28;284(35):23405-14. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.026088.

METHODS: Childhood cancer survivors (N = 103) identified as having attention and learning problems completed a randomized, double-blind, 3-week, home-crossover trial of placebo, low-dose methylphenidate (0.3 mg/kg; 10 mg twice daily maximum) and moderate-dose methylphenidate (0.6 mg/kg; 20 mg twice daily maximum). Caregivers completed the Barkley Side Effects Rating Scale (SERS) at baseline and each week during the medication trial. Siblings of cancer survivors (N = 49) were recruited as a healthy comparison group. RESULTS: There was a significantly higher number and severity of symptoms endorsed on the SERS when patients were taking moderate dose compared with placebo or low dose, but not low dose compared with placebo. The number of side effects endorsed on the SERS was significantly lower during all 3 home-crossover weeks (placebo, low dose, moderate dose) when compared with baseline symptom scores. The severity of side effects was also significantly lower, compared with baseline screening, during placebo and low-dose weeks but not moderate-dose weeks. Both the number and severity of symptoms endorsed at baseline were significantly higher for patients compared with siblings. Female gender and lower IQ were associated with higher adverse effect levels. CONCLUSIONS: Methylphenidate is generally well tolerated by childhood cancer survivors. There is a subgroup at increased risk for side effects that may need to be closely monitored or prescribed a lower medication dose. The seemingly paradoxical findings of increased ""side effects"" at baseline must be considered when monitoring side effects and designing clinical trials.","['Conklin, Heather M', 'Lawford, Joanne', 'Jasper, Bruce W', 'Morris, E Brannon', 'Howard, Scott C', 'Ogg, Susan W', 'Wu, Shengjie', 'Xiong, Xiaoping', 'Khan, Raja B']","['Conklin HM', 'Lawford J', 'Jasper BW', 'Morris EB', 'Howard SC', 'Ogg SW', 'Wu S', 'Xiong X', 'Khan RB']","[""Divisionsof Behavioral Medicine, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105-2794, USA. heather.conklin@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,PMC2705008,2009/07/01 09:00,2009/09/23 06:00,['2009/07/01 09:00'],"['2009/07/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['124/1/226 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2008-1855 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2009 Jul;124(1):226-33. doi: 10.1542/peds.2008-1855.,"['0 (Central Nervous System Stimulants)', '207ZZ9QZ49 (Methylphenidate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Central Nervous System Stimulants/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Cognition Disorders/*drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Comorbidity', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methylphenidate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Survivors']",,,"['R01 CA078957-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765-30/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA081445-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA078957/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA81445/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA078957/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS78776'],,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00576472'],,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the clinical and pathological features as well as the treatment results of a series of patients with acute leukemia/myelodysplasia arising after adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients referred to our institution during a 5-year period for treatment of acute leukemia/myelodysplasia and who had received adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer are included. Leukemia-free survival for the whole group and for patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was estimated. RESULTS: Fifteen women (14 with acute leukemia and one with myelodysplasia) were identified. Seven of 15 patients had received an anthracycline, cyclophosphamide and a taxane. Ten patients developed acute leukemia/myelodysplasia with a latency period of 2 years or less from initiation of chemotherapy. Although mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) rearrangement was the commonest chromosomal abnormality (8 of 15 patients), various other chromosomal abnormalities were also detected. Twelve of 15 patients underwent HSCT (11 allogeneic and one autologous). Eleven of these 12 patients who underwent HSCT were in remission at a median follow-up of 20.4 months (range 4.4-53.3 months). CONCLUSION: Durable remissions can be achieved in patients who develop acute leukemia/myelodysplasia secondary to adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer and are able to undergo allogeneic HSCT.

It has been proved that disruption of phase 1 of the GVHD cascade is effective in prophylaxis of acute GVHD. Intestinal trefoil factor (ITF), a member of trefoil factor family (TFF) domain peptides, was proved to be very effective in prevention and healing of acute dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis, and was also involved in protection against and recovery from intestinal mucositis induced by radiation and chemotherapy. So we hypothesise that ITF protects the intestinal tract mucosa from lesions and that it maybe useful in prophylaxis of acute GVHD. ITF can block GI tract damage in phase 1, preventing the amplification of the cascade.

Rac1 protein is overexpressed in primary acute myeloid leukemia cells as compared to normal bone marrow mononuclear cells. siRNA-mediated silencing of Rac1 in leukemia cell lines induced inhibition of cell migration, proliferation, and colony formation. Additionally, blocking Rac1 activity by an inhibitor of Rac1-GTPase, NSC23766, suppressed cell migration and growth.

Given that Meis1 is a co-factor for Hox genes, we hypothesized that the combined expression of HOXA4 and MEIS1 might add prognostic information in these patients. When diagnostic samples from 246 AML patients were divided into three main groups based on gene expression levels of HOXA4 combined with MEIS1 we found that within the group of patients exhibiting low levels of HOXA4, those with a high expression of MEIS1 had a significantly worse outcome than those exhibiting low MEIS1 expression (P = 0.025). Moreover, this prediction was independent of cytogenetics, mutational status of the NPM1 and FLT3 genes as well as upon WBC and age. To evaluate the possible contribution of regulatory events underlying these observations, 157 patient samples were subjected to promoter hypermethylation analysis. We observed that 77% were HOXA4- and 15%MEIS1 hypermethylated and that this epigenetic alteration was highly correlated to the gene expression level (MEIS1: P = 0.001; HOXA4: P = 0.007). Finally, we found a higher expression level and a higher frequency of hypermethylation of HOXA4 among patients with NPM1 mutations.

Centrosomes are regulators of mitotic spindle orientation and can act as scaffolds for centrosome-associated regulators of the cell cycle. This study showed, for the first time, that p210(BCR-ABL1) and p145(ABL1) are both centrosome-associated proteins, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation with the pericentriolar protein, pericentrin. Furthermore, when CML cells were treated with imatinib there was a 55% and 20% reduction of p210(BCR-ABL1) and p145(ABL1) binding to pericentrin, respectively. Cell lines expressing p210(BCR-ABL1) and primary CD34(+) cells from CML patients exhibited more numerical and structural centrosomal abnormalities than p210(BCR-ABL1) negative cells. Primary cells from CML blast crisis (BC) patients exhibited a distinctive amorphous staining pattern of pericentrin compared to normal and CML chronic phase (CP) patients, suggesting a possible defect in pericentrin localisation at the centrosomes. Proteins, such as aurora kinases, pericentrin, survivin and separase, regulate centrosome structure and function, cell cycle and mitotic spindle formation. Levels of the protease, separase are abnormally high in CML CP and BC cells in comparison to normal CD34(+) cells.

The eight-year event-free survival (EFS), relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were (40.2 +/- 10.1)%, (51.4 +/- 11.6)% and (49.8 +/- 9.9)% for T-ALL, and (72.1-3.0)%, (83.2 +/- 2.7)%, and (76.6 +/- 2.9)% for B-ALL, respectively, being differed significantly between the two types of ALL (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: There were statistic differences between T-cell and B-cell childhood ALLs in age, initial WBC count, early response to therapy, and eight-year EFS and RFS. Childhood T-ALL was associated with a worse prognosis than other sub-types of childhood ALL.","['Ye, Qi-dong', 'Gu, Long-jun', 'Tang, Jing-yan', 'Xue, Hui-liang', 'Chen, Jing', 'Pan, Ci', 'Chen, Jing', 'Dong, Lu', 'Zhou, Min']","['Ye QD', 'Gu LJ', 'Tang JY', 'Xue HL', 'Chen J', 'Pan C', 'Chen J', 'Dong L', 'Zhou M']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200127, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,2009/07/01 09:00,2010/05/28 06:00,['2009/07/01 09:00'],"['2009/07/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Jan;30(1):26-8.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/pathology/therapy', '*Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 23 previously untreated de novo AML patients were enrolled. Thirteen patients were male, and 10 female, with ages ranging from 14 to 54 (median: 41) years. Cytogenetic analysis was performed for all patients. The IA regimen contained idarubicin (12 mg x m(-2) x d(-1), days 1 to 3) and cytarabine (100 mg x m(-2) x d(-1), days 1 to 7), and the FLAG regimen contained'fludarabine (50 mg/d, days 1 to 5), cytarabine (2 g x m(-2) x d(-1), days 1 to 5) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, 300 microg/d, days 0 to 5). RESULTS: After one course of induction therapy, the CR rate was 91.3%. The CR rate for patients with favourable and intermediate prognostic karyotypes was 100% and 91.3%, respectively. Nineteen patients in CR were consolidated with FLAG regimen, of which 6/9 (66.7%) patients were able to mobilize a sufficient number of CD34+ cells and successfully performed autologous stem cell transplantation. Four patients relapsed. The median survival duration was 19.5 months and median disease-free survival was 14 months. Myelosuppression and infections due to neutropenia were the most frequent adverse effects, severe nonhematologic toxicity and the early death were not observed in all patients. CONCLUSION: IA followed by FLAG regimen is effective and well tolerable in AML patients especially in those with favourable and intermediate prognostic karyotypes, and 1 to 2 courses of this therapy shows no influence on peripheral stem cell mobilization and subsequent autologous stem cell transplantation.","['Qian, Si-Xuan', 'Li, Jian-Yong', 'Hong, Ming', 'Lu, Hua', 'Wu, Han-Xin', 'Qiu, Hong-Xia', 'Zhang, Su-Jiang', 'Chen, Li-Juan', 'Xu, Wei', 'Sheng, Rui-Lan']","['Qian SX', 'Li JY', 'Hong M', 'Lu H', 'Wu HX', 'Qiu HX', 'Zhang SJ', 'Chen LJ', 'Xu W', 'Sheng RL']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,2009/07/01 09:00,2010/05/28 06:00,['2009/07/01 09:00'],"['2009/07/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Jan;30(1):22-5.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: LPL expression level in peripheral blood samples of 58 CLL patients was detected by semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Serum TK1 level in 39 CLL patients was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) and TK monoclonal antibody (Anti-TK mAb). IgVH mutation status was detected by multiplex PCR and sequencing of purified PCR products. The expression of ZAP-70 protein and CD38 were determined by flow cytometry . Panel probes and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to detect cytogenetic aberrations. RESULTS: The median LPL expression level in CLL was 0.26 (0 -6.29), while undetectable in normal controls. LPL expression level was significantly correlated with IgVH mutation status, Binet stages, CD38 and cytogenetic aberrations. Patients with unmutated IgVH genes had higher LPL than those with IgVH mutations (P = 0.010). Patients in Binet stage B and C had higher LPL than those in stage A (P = 0.011). LPL level was higher in patients with CD38 > or = 30% (P = 0.001). Higher LPL level was found in patients with unfavorable cytogenetic aberrations (deletion in 17p13 or 11q22) than those with favorable cytogenetics (deletion in 13q as the sole abnormality) (P = 0.002). LPL level was not significantly correlated with sex, age, and ZAP-70 protein (P > 0.05). The level of TK1 was higher in CLL patients than that in normal control (P < 0.05).

METHODS: Forty-seven patients with relapsed/refractory ALL received allo-HSCT, which containing 19/47 from HLA-identical sibling donors (sib-HSCT), 18/47 from HLA-identical unrelated donors (URD-HSCT) and 10/47 from haplo-identical donors (Hi-HSCT). Conditioning regimens included ""TBI plus Cyclophosphamide (Cy) (42/ 47)"" or ""busulfan (Bu) plus Cy (5/47)"". Cyclosporine (CsA) combined with a short-course Methotrexate (MTX) were used for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. In addition, patients receiving URD-HSCT or Hi-HSCT were given mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and anti-thymocyte immunoglobulin (ATG). Patients with molecular or cytogenetic relapse tendency on minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring received donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). RESULTS: All patients tolerated the therapy well except for mucositis. Renal dysfunction occurred in 2 patients on CsA therapy. Epilepsy occurred in 1 patient, fatal infectious complications in 9 (including 3 interstitial pneumonia), grade III-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) in 7, chronic GVHD (cGVHD) in 22 and hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) in 4 patients. Thirteen patients relapsed after transplantation. The median time of hematopoietic reconstitution was + 17 ds. Nineteen patients received DLI, and 6 of them had no disease progression. With a median follow-up duration of 43 (10-77) months, the estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) rates were 49.65% and 46.55%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Allo-HSCT is an effective therapy for relapsed/refractory ALL. Relapse after transplantation, fatal infection, and severe acute GVHD are the main causes for failure. DLI might decrease the relapse rate after transplantation.","['Ma, Xiao', 'Wu, De-pei', 'Sun, Ai-ning', 'Fu, Zheng-zheng', 'Tang, Xiao-wen', 'Wu, Xiao-jin', 'Liu, Yue-jun', 'Qiu, Hui-ying', 'Miao, Miao', 'Han, Yue', 'Jin, Zheng-ming', 'Zhao, Ye', 'Xue, Sheng-li', 'Wang, Ying', 'Chen, Su-ning', 'He, Guang-sheng', 'Zhou, Hai-xia', 'Chang, Hui-rong']","['Ma X', 'Wu DP', 'Sun AN', 'Fu ZZ', 'Tang XW', 'Wu XJ', 'Liu YJ', 'Qiu HY', 'Miao M', 'Han Y', 'Jin ZM', 'Zhao Y', 'Xue SL', 'Wang Y', 'Chen SN', 'He GS', 'Zhou HX', 'Chang HR']","['Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Ministry of Health, Suzhou 215006, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,2009/07/01 09:00,2010/05/28 06:00,['2009/07/01 09:00'],"['2009/07/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Feb;30(2):73-6.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interest in the RUNX genes emerged principally as a result of the finding that chromosomal translocations disrupting RUNX protein function are observed in a large number of patients suffering with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In the 20 years that RUNX genes have been under investigation, they have emerged as central players in the control of developmental decisions between proliferation and differentiation in a wide variety of biological situations. This review focuses on recent data highlighting the roles of RUNX genes in stem cells and illustrates the diversity of processes in which the RUNX proteins play a critical role. In particular, we focus on the role of RUNX1 in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) and the importance of the solo C. elegans RUNX factor rnt-1 in stem cell proliferation in the worm. Observations in a variety of stem cell systems have developed to the point where useful comparisons can be made, from which guiding principles may emerge.","['Appleford, Peter J', 'Woollard, Alison']","['Appleford PJ', 'Woollard A']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3QU, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,,2009/06/30 09:00,2010/02/13 06:00,['2009/06/30 09:00'],"['2009/06/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.22249 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2009 Sep 1;108(1):14-21. doi: 10.1002/jcb.22249.,['0 (Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Caenorhabditis elegans/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans']",,,"['08-0458/AICR_/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom', 'G0001282/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'C20933/A7636/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,50,,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,

Here, we attempted to study the stage specific expression of CD13 on ALL-B blasts and understand its role in leukemogenesis as pertaining to stage of B-cell ontogeny. A total of 355 cases of different hematological malignancies were diagnosed by immunophenotyping. Among 68 cases of early B-cell ALL, 22 cases with distinct immunophenotype was identified as immature B-cell ALL. Blasts from these ALL-B patients demonstrated prominent expression of CD10, CD19, CD22, but neither cytoplasmic nor surface IgM receptors. This strongly indicates leukemogenesis at an early stage of B-cell development. We also identified, the existence of a subpopulation of cells with remarkably similar phenotype in non-leukemic marrow from healthy subjects (expressing CD10, CD19, CD22, CD24, Tdt together with the co-expression of CD13). This sub-population of B cells concomitantly expressing CD13 appeared to be a highly proliferating group. By blocking their cell surface CD13 in leukemic blasts with monoclonal antibody we were able to inhibit their proliferation. We hypothesized that neoplastic transformation at this stage may be facilitated by CD13. CD13 may thus be an important target for novel molecular therapy of early stage acute B-cell leukemia.","['Saxena, Ankit', 'Rai, Ambak', 'Raina, Vinod', 'Seth, Tulika', 'Mitra, Dipendra Kumar']","['Saxena A', 'Rai A', 'Raina V', 'Seth T', 'Mitra DK']","['Cellular Immunology Division, Department of Transplant Immunology and Immunogenetics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Room No. 92, Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090628,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,,2009/06/30 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/06/30 09:00'],"['2008/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-009-0731-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2010 Jan;59(1):125-35. doi: 10.1007/s00262-009-0731-6.

However, case reports over the past 20 years show that a growing number of cases of mucormycosis are occurring during treatment following bone marrow transplants (BMT) and hematological malignancies (HM) such as leukemia and lymphoma. This is due to the prolonged treatment of these patients with steroids and immunosuppressive agents. Liposomal amphotericin B treatment and posaconazole are two pharmacologic agents that seem to be effective against mucormycosis, but the inherently rapid onset and course of the disease, in conjunction with the difficulty in correctly identifying it, hinder prompt institution of appropriate antifungal therapy.

Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptors, Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD), procaspase-8, procaspase-10, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase and Bid were also recruited into lipid rafts on resveratrol incubation with MM and T-cell leukemia cells. Raft disruption inhibited resveratrol-induced apoptosis. Bcl-XL overexpression prevented resveratrol-induced disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) and apoptosis. A FADD dominant-negative mutant, that blocked Fas/CD95 downstream signaling, precluded resveratrol-induced DeltaPsi(m) loss and apoptosis, indicating a sequence of Fas/CD95 signaling-->mitochondrion in the apoptotic response triggered by resveratrol. Cells deficient in Fas/CD95 did not undergo resveratrol-induced apoptosis. Pretreatment of MM cells with interferon-gamma upregulated Fas/CD95 and caspase-8, and potentiated resveratrol-induced apoptosis. Our data indicate that recruitment of Fas/CD95 death receptor and downstream signaling molecules into lipid rafts, followed by DeltaPsi(m) disruption, underlies the apoptotic action of resveratrol in MM and T-cell leukemic cells. Combination of resveratrol with perifosine or bortezomib potentiated the apoptotic response induced by each single drug. These results also highlight the role of recruitment of Fas/CD95 signaling in lipid rafts in antimyeloma and antileukemia chemotherapy.","['Reis-Sobreiro, M', 'Gajate, C', 'Mollinedo, F']","['Reis-Sobreiro M', 'Gajate C', 'Mollinedo F']","['Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca, Campus Miguel de Unamuno, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090629,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,2009/06/30 09:00,2009/09/26 06:00,['2009/06/30 09:00'],"['2009/06/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2009183 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.183 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2009 Sep 10;28(36):3221-34. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.183.

We selected the CAR that did not contain the 4-1BB moiety for further preclinical development. We demonstrated that gammaretroviruses encoding this receptor could transduce human T cells. Anti-CD19-CAR-transduced CD8+ and CD4+ T cells produced interferon-gamma and interleukin-2 specifically in response to CD19+ target cells. The transduced T cells specifically killed primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. We transduced T cells from CLL patients that had been previously treated with chemotherapy. We induced these T cells to proliferate sufficiently to provide enough cells for clinical adoptive T cell transfer with a protocol consisting of an initial stimulation with an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3) before transduction followed by a second OKT3 stimulation 7 days after transduction. This protocol was successfully adapted for use in CLL patients with high peripheral blood leukemia cell counts by depleting CD19+ cells before the initial OKT3 stimulation. In preparation for a clinical trial that will enroll patients with advanced B cell malignancies, we generated a producer cell clone that produces retroviruses encoding the anti-CD19 CAR, and we produced sufficient retroviral supernatant for the proposed clinical trial under good manufacturing practice conditions.","['Kochenderfer, James N', 'Feldman, Steven A', 'Zhao, Yangbing', 'Xu, Hui', 'Black, Mary A', 'Morgan, Richard A', 'Wilson, Wyndham H', 'Rosenberg, Steven A']","['Kochenderfer JN', 'Feldman SA', 'Zhao Y', 'Xu H', 'Black MA', 'Morgan RA', 'Wilson WH', 'Rosenberg SA']","['Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. kochendj@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,PMC2747302,2009/06/30 09:00,2009/09/26 06:00,['2009/06/30 09:00'],"['2009/06/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CJI.0b013e3181ac6138 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother. 2009 Sep;32(7):689-702. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0b013e3181ac6138.,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Muromonab-CD3)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gammaretrovirus/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Muromonab-CD3/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,,['Z99 CA999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS126418'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukin (IL)-21 synergizes with other gamma-chain cytokines to enhance the frequency and cytotoxicity of antigen-specific CTL. As T cells themselves may serve as effective antigen-presenting cells (T antigen-presenting cells; TAPC) and may be useful in vivo as cellular vaccines, we examined whether CD8(+) T cells genetically modified to produce IL-21 could induce immune responses to tumor associated antigen peptides in healthy human leukocyte antigen-A2(+) donors. We found that IL-21 modified TAPC enhanced both the proliferation and survival of MART-1 specific CD8(+) T cells, which were enriched by >8-fold over cultures with control nontransgenic TAPC. MART-1-specific CTL produced interferon-gamma in response to cognate peptide antigen and killed primary tumor cells expressing MART-1 in a major histocompatibility complex restricted manner. IL-21 modified TAPC similarly enhanced generation of functional CTL against melanoma antigen gp100 and the B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia associated RHAMM antigen. Antigen-specific CTL generated using IL-21 gene-modified TAPC had a central memory phenotype characterized by CD45RA(-), CD44(high), CD27(high), CD28(high), CD62L(high), and IL-7 receptor-alpha(high), contrasting with the terminal effector phenotype of CTL generated in the absence of IL-21. Thus, TAPC stimulation in the presences of IL-21 enhances proliferation of tumor antigen-specific T cells and favors induction of a central memory phenotype, which may improve proliferation, survival, and efficacy of T-cell based therapies for the treatment of cancer.","['Kaka, Anjum S', 'Shaffer, Donald R', 'Hartmaier, Ryan', 'Leen, Ann M', 'Lu, An', 'Bear, Adham', 'Rooney, Cliona M', 'Foster, Aaron E']","['Kaka AS', 'Shaffer DR', 'Hartmaier R', 'Leen AM', 'Lu A', 'Bear A', 'Rooney CM', 'Foster AE']","[""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, The Methodist Hospital and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,PMC2790367,2009/06/30 09:00,2009/09/26 06:00,['2009/06/30 09:00'],"['2009/06/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CJI.0b013e3181ad4071 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother. 2009 Sep;32(7):726-36. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0b013e3181ad4071.,"['0 (Interleukins)', '0 (LEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (T Cell Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (TCF7 protein, human)', 'MKM3CA6LT1 (interleukin-21)']",IM,"['Antigen Presentation/*immunology', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory/immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukins/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T Cell Transcription Factor 1/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transfection']",,,"['T32 HL092332-06/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA094237-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL092332/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32AI055413-03/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI055413/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA094237/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS159545'],,,,,,,"['J Immunother. 2009 Nov-Dec;32(9):919.

The introduction of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) alloSCT led to their increasing use in these patients because of their reduced toxicity. Significant disadvantages remain, however, including the late establishment of a posttransplant graft-versus-leukemia effect and an overrepresentation of poor prognostic factors in elderly patients, resulting in the risk of early relapse/progression before the graft-versus-leukemia effect being disproportionally large. Preliminary results suggest that DIC with maximum prophylaxis and support is safe for elderly patients up to age 70 years. We hypothesize that DIC may be important for the early control of leukemia in elderly patients, and that prospective, randomized trials comparing DIC and RIC-based transplants should be carried out, with the expectation that early transplant-related mortality will be no different.","['Petersen, Finn B', 'Ford, Clyde D']","['Petersen FB', 'Ford CD']","['Intermountain Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.

Treatment outcome with imatinib-based regimens has improved compared with historic controls, but most patients who do not undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) eventually relapse. Second-generation TKI, e.g. dasatinib and nilotinib, show activity against most of the bcr-abl tyrosine kinase domain mutations involved in acquired imatinib resistance, but clinical benefit is generally short lived. Accordingly, SCT in first complete response is considered to be the best curative option. Strategies to improve outcome in patients ineligible for transplantation as well as after SCT include front-line treatment with more effective TKI to increase molecular response rates. Following SCT, the pre-emptive use of imatinib appears to reduce the relapse rate.

The incidence of acute GvHD after RIC seems lower than after myeloablative conditioning (MAC), whereas the incidence of chronic GvHD after RIC seems similar to after MAC. The results of RIC for acute myeloid leukaemia show a non-relapse mortality of approximately 15% at one year, a relapse incidence of approximately 40% after a median of 4-6 months, translating into overall and disease-free survival rates of 40-60%. The factors associated with improved outcome in most studies are the stage of the disease at transplantation, age and the development of chronic GvHD (and thus GvT). In a recent report, chronic GvHD was the most important factor associated with prolonged survival. Future efforts should be directed at aiming to decrease relapse rates. For this purpose, an adequate identification of high-risk patients, close monitoring of minimal residual disease after the procedure, and the use of antineoplastic drugs or immunotherapy may be of help.","['Valcarcel, David', 'Martino, Rodrigo', 'Pinana, Jose L', 'Sierra, Jorge']","['Valcarcel D', 'Martino R', 'Pinana JL', 'Sierra J']","['Division of Clinical Hematology, Hospital de la Sant Creu i Sant Pau, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. dvalcarce@santpau.cat']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,,2009/07/09 09:00,2009/09/17 06:00,['2009/06/30 09:00'],"['2009/06/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/01.cco.0000357474.66035.9b [doi]', '00001622-200906001-00009 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2009 Jun;21 Suppl 1:S35-7. doi: 10.1097/01.cco.0000357474.66035.9b.,,IM,"['Chronic Disease', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inclusion of alemtuzumab added to the graft ('Campath in the bag') for donor T-cell depletion offers an easy procedure to diminish the incidence of GvHD. Good engraftment is observed in most patients, whereas almost no GvHD is observed after transplantation. Most patients become mixed chimeric after transplantation, requiring donor lymphocyte infusion for conversion to full donor chimerism. Although subsequent acute and chronic GvHD is observed in 50-60% of patients, it is responsive to therapy in many patients, resulting in a low incidence of persisting chronic GvHD.

In particular, the treatment of elderly patients with AML remains one of the major challenges in haematology. Despite increases in complete remission rates, relapse remains a major obstacle and the major determinant of overall survival. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is the most efficient antileukaemic treatment for patients with AML, but eligibility for the treatment was confined for a long time to younger patients. More than 10 years ago, SCT protocols were initiated with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) rather than ablative chemoradiotherapy, with the intention of inducing a graft-versus-leukaemia effect also in elderly patients and patients with concomitant diseases. Operationally, all protocols below the conventional preparative regimens are referred to as RIC. Low-dose total body irradiation-based protocols result in minimal myelosuppression and are among the most popular. After extensive phase I and phase II studies, associated problems of graft rejection have been largely resolved and transplant-related mortality (TRM) evaluated in more than 3000 patients. TRM does not currently exceed 10-12% in related and 20% in unrelated SCT even in patients up to the age of 75 years, so that relapse after transplantation remains the major problem. A number of strategies for decreasing relapse rates has been developed. The most promising approach consists of monitoring CD34+ donor cell chimerism after transplantation. This has led to decreases in the relapse rate over the past few years. Randomized studies are now being initiated to define the role of SCT in the treatment of elderly patients with AML.","['Al-Ali, Haifa', 'Cross, Michael', 'Lange, Thoralf', 'Freund, Matthias', 'Dolken, Gottfried', 'Niederwieser, Dietger']","['Al-Ali H', 'Cross M', 'Lange T', 'Freund M', 'Dolken G', 'Niederwieser D']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,,2009/07/09 09:00,2009/09/17 06:00,['2009/06/30 09:00'],"['2009/06/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/01.cco.0000357470.91584.62 [doi]', '00001622-200906001-00005 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2009 Jun;21 Suppl 1:S17-22. doi: 10.1097/01.cco.0000357470.91584.62.,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chimerism', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*radiotherapy/surgery', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*methods']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore developed an intravenous busulfan formulation and combined it with fludarabine instead of cyclophosphamide in preparation for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). We used a Bayesian method to compare the outcomes of 67 acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients who received intravenous busulfan-cyclophosphamide (BuCy2) with 148 subsequent AML/MDS patients who received busulfan-fludarabine (Bu-Flu). The groups had comparable pretreatment characteristics, except that the Bu-Flu patients were older, more often had unrelated donors and had a shorter follow-up. A greatly improved outcome in the Bu-Flu group is unlikely to be explained by improved supportive care during this time period. Overall, the data support replacing BuCy2 with or without antithymocyte globulin (ATG) with Bu-Flu with or without rabbit-ATG for AML or MDS. We further suggest that the high level of safety and fast recovery from conditioning therapy-related side effects after the Bu-Flu regimen makes it a suitable platform technology for testing additional adjuncts for improved posttransplant immune recovery and long-term disease control in patients who are at high risk of rapidly recurrent disease after alloSCT. The extremely low one-year treatment-related mortality as well as high overall and event-free survival of patients in the Bu-Flu group indicate that it is time to revisit the value of alloSCT compared with conventional maintenance chemotherapy for patients in first complete remission of AML/MDS.","['Andersson, Borje S', 'de Lima, Marcos', 'Thall, Peter F', 'Madden, Timothy', 'Russell, James A', 'Champlin, Richard E']","['Andersson BS', 'de Lima M', 'Thall PF', 'Madden T', 'Russell JA', 'Champlin RE']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. bandersson@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,PMC4037323,2009/07/09 09:00,2009/09/17 06:00,['2009/06/30 09:00'],"['2009/06/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/01.cco.0000357469.83960.12 [doi]', '00001622-200906001-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2009 Jun;21 Suppl 1:S11-5. doi: 10.1097/01.cco.0000357469.83960.12.,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Middle Aged', 'Rabbits', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",,,"['P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2P01 CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2P30CA16672-26/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS588342'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that exogenous MN1 stimulated the growth of CD34(+) cells, which was accompanied by enhanced survival and increased cell cycle traverse in cultures supporting progenitor cell growth. Forced MN1 expression impaired both granulocytic and monocytic differentiation in vitro in primary hematopoietic cells and acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. Endogenous MN1 expression was higher in human CD34(+) cells compared with both primary and in vitro-differentiated monocytes and granulocytes. Microarray and real-time reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction analysis of MN1-overexpressing CD34(+) cells showed down-regulation of CEBPA and its downstream target genes. Reintroduction of conditional and constitutive CEBPA overcame the effects of MN1 on myeloid differentiation and inhibited MN1-induced proliferation in vitro.

Historical dioxin levels were estimated by a serum survey of workers. Vital status was followed from 1942 to 2003, and cause-specific death rates and trends with exposure were evaluated. All cancers combined (standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 1.0, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.8, 1.1), lung cancers (SMR = 0.7, 95% CI: 0.5, 0.9), and nonmalignant respiratory disease (SMR = 0.8, 95% CI: 0.6, 1.0) were at or below expected levels. Observed deaths for leukemia (SMR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.0, 3.2), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SMR = 1.3, 95% CI: 0.6, 2.5), diabetes (SMR = 1.1, 95% CI: 0.6, 1.8), and ischemic heart disease (SMR = 1.1, 95% CI: 0.9, 1.2) were slightly greater than expected. No trend was observed with exposure for these causes of death. However, for 4 deaths of soft tissue sarcoma (SMR = 4.1, 95% CI: 1.1, 10.5), the mortality rates increased with exposure. The small number of deaths and the uncertainty in both diagnosis and nosology coding make interpretation of this finding tenuous. With the exception of soft tissue sarcoma, the authors found little evidence of increased disease risk from exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin.","['Collins, James J', 'Bodner, Kenneth', 'Aylward, Lesa L', 'Wilken, Michael', 'Bodnar, Catherine M']","['Collins JJ', 'Bodner K', 'Aylward LL', 'Wilken M', 'Bodnar CM']","['Epidemiology Department, The Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Michigan 48674, USA. jjcollins@dow.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090626,United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,PMC2717168,2009/06/30 09:00,2009/08/12 09:00,['2009/06/30 09:00'],"['2009/06/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [medline]']","['kwp153 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kwp153 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2009 Aug 15;170(4):501-6. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwp153.

Unfortunately, not all error control procedures perform the same. Our problem is to choose an error control procedure to determine a P-value threshold for identifying differentially expressed pathways in high-throughput gene expression studies. Pathway analysis involves fewer tests than differential gene expression analysis, on the order of a few hundred. We discuss and compare methods for error control for pathway analysis with gene expression data. RESULTS: In consideration of the variability in test results, we find that the widely used Benjamini and Hochberg's (BH) false discovery rate (FDR) analysis is less robust than alternative procedures. BH's error control requires a large number of hypothesis tests, a reasonable assumption for differential gene expression analysis, though not the case with pathway-based analysis. Therefore, we advocate through a series of simulations and applications to real gene expression data that researchers control the number of false positives rather than the FDR.","['Gold, David L', 'Miecznikowski, Jeffrey C', 'Liu, Song']","['Gold DL', 'Miecznikowski JC', 'Liu S']","['Department of Biostatistics, Roswell Park Cancer, Buffalo, NY, USA. dlgold@buffalo.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090626,England,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,PMC2734315,2009/06/30 09:00,2009/10/21 06:00,['2009/06/30 09:00'],"['2009/06/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['btp385 [pii]', '10.1093/bioinformatics/btp385 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioinformatics. 2009 Sep 1;25(17):2216-21. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btp385.

The polyphenol, butein, has potent effects against various types of cancer cells, but its effects on telomerase activity have not been well characterized. In this study, we show that butein causes a down-regulation of hTERT gene expression and a concomitant decrease of telomerase activity. Butein also suppresses expression of c-Myc at the transcriptional level and down-regulates DNA-binding activity, regardless of cell type specificity, in leukemia cells. DNA-binding activities of c-Myc to the hTERT core promoter were decreased in butein-treated cells, as seen by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Treatment with butein also suppressed the activation of Akt, thereby inhibiting hTERT phosphorylation and translocation into the nucleus. In this process, butein also up-regulated the surface expression of CD11b in leukemia cells. Inhibition of telomerase activity by butein was followed by loss of proliferative capacity, induction of apoptosis, and differentiation. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of butein at inhibiting telomerase activity by down-regulating hTERT gene expression in human leukemia cells.","['Moon, Dong-Oh', 'Kim, Mun-Ock', 'Lee, Jae-Dong', 'Choi, Yung Hyun', 'Kim, Gi-Young']","['Moon DO', 'Kim MO', 'Lee JD', 'Choi YH', 'Kim GY']","['Department of Marine Life Science, Jeju National University and Jeju Regional Cancer Center, Jeju 690-756, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090627,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,,2009/06/30 09:00,2010/01/08 06:00,['2009/06/30 09:00'],"['2008/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/12 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(09)00382-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2009.05.028 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2009 Dec 28;286(2):172-9. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2009.05.028.

However, in addition to these cytokines, other factors expressed in synovial tissues may play a role in resorbing bone. Here, our objective was to identify novel proteins expressed in synovial tissues of RA that regulate human osteoclastogenesis. Proteins were purified from synovial tissues of patients with RA, using gel filtration chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, reverse-aspect HPLC, and mass spectrometry. We evaluated the effects of the purified fractions on human osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL and M-CSF. We determined the amino acid sequences showing inhibitory activity on human osteoclastogenesis. In addition, we synthesized novel peptides from the molecule including the amino acid sequences. Then, we evaluated the effects of the peptides and antibodies against the molecule on human osteoclastogenesis from monocytes and mature osteoclasts, and on pit formation by mature osteoclasts using Osteologic discs. We examined the effect of the peptide on the expression of both mRNA and protein of NFATc1. We also examined the effect of RANKL on the expression of mRNA of the molecule on osteoclasts and macrophages. We identified a small peptide including Gly-Gln-Asn (GQN) with inhibitory activity on human osteoclastogenesis. We then found that GQN is included in the amino acid sequence of the extra-cellular domain of TCTA protein, which is expressed ubiquitously in normal human tissues, but whose function has not been clarified. We designed novel peptides, including GQN, from the sequence of TCTA protein. One of these peptides (29-mer), but not a scrambled peptide for the 29-mer peptide, potently inhibited RANKL-induced human osteoclastogenesis. The peptide also inhibited pit formation of mature human osteoclasts and suppressed the formation of large osteoclasts in the culture of mature osteoclasts. Furthermore, polyclonal antibodies against TCTA protein suppressed the formation of large osteoclasts in the cultures of both monocytes and mature osteoclasts, supporting our hypothesis. Peptide A did not significantly inhibit the expression of both mRNA and protein of NFATc1 in osteoclasts. Our novel peptide and polyclonal antibodies against the peptide inhibited human osteoclastogenesis and the function of mature osteoclasts, preventing cellular fusion by TCTA protein and a putative counterpart molecule.","['Kotake, Shigeru', 'Nanke, Yuki', 'Kawamoto, Manabu', 'Yago, Toru', 'Udagawa, Nobuyuki', 'Ichikawa, Naomi', 'Kobashigawa, Tsuyoshi', 'Saito, Seiji', 'Momohara, Shigeki', 'Kamatani, Naoyuki', 'Yamanaka, Hisashi']","['Kotake S', 'Nanke Y', 'Kawamoto M', 'Yago T', 'Udagawa N', 'Ichikawa N', 'Kobashigawa T', 'Saito S', 'Momohara S', 'Kamatani N', 'Yamanaka H']","[""Institute of Rheumatology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, 10-22 Kawada-cho, Shinjuku, Tokyo 162-0054, Japan. skotake@ior.twmu.ac.jp""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090625,United States,Bone,Bone,8504048,,2009/06/30 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/06/30 09:00'],"['2009/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/16 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S8756-3282(09)01667-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bone.2009.06.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone. 2009 Oct;45(4):627-39. doi: 10.1016/j.bone.2009.06.019.

The catalytic core of LARG is a Dbl homology (DH) domain whose activity is modulated by an adjacent pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. In this study, we used a transcriptional assay and confocal microscopy to examine the roles of several novel structural features of the LARG DH/PH domains, including a conserved and exposed hydrophobic patch on the PH domain that mediates protein-protein interactions in crystal structures of LARG and its close homolog PDZ-RhoGEF. Mutation of the hydrophobic patch has no effect on nucleotide exchange activity in vitro, but abolished the ability of LARG to activate RhoA and to induce stress fiber formation in cultured cells. The activity of these mutants could be rescued by fusion with exogenous membrane-targeting domains. However, because membrane recruitment by activated G alpha(13) subunits was not sufficient to rescue activity of a hydrophobic patch mutant, the LARG PH domain cannot solely contribute to membrane targeting. Instead, it seems likely that the domain is involved in regulatory interactions with other proteins near the membrane surface. We also show that the hydrophobic patch of the PH domain is likely important for the activity of all Lbc subfamily RhoGEFs.","['Aittaleb, Mohamed', 'Gao, Guang', 'Evelyn, Chris R', 'Neubig, Richard R', 'Tesmer, John J G']","['Aittaleb M', 'Gao G', 'Evelyn CR', 'Neubig RR', 'Tesmer JJ']","['Life Sciences Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2216, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090626,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,PMC2735620,2009/06/30 09:00,2009/11/07 06:00,['2009/06/30 09:00'],"['2009/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(09)00188-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2009.06.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2009 Nov;21(11):1569-78. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2009.06.003.

Here, we report that TLX1 and MEIS proteins both interact and are co-expressed in T-ALL, and suggest that co-operation between TLX1 and MEIS proteins may have a significant role in T-cell leukemogenesis.","['Milech, Nadia', 'Gottardo, Nicholas G', 'Ford, Jette', ""D'Souza, Darryl"", 'Greene, Wayne K', 'Kees, Ursula R', 'Watt, Paul M']","['Milech N', 'Gottardo NG', 'Ford J', ""D'Souza D"", 'Greene WK', 'Kees UR', 'Watt PM']","[""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Institute for Child Health Research and Centre for Child Health Research, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA 6008, Australia.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090625,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,2009/06/30 09:00,2010/03/24 06:00,['2009/06/30 09:00'],"['2009/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00279-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.06.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Mar;34(3):358-63. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.06.003.

However, the underlying therapeutic mechanism remains unclear. Hepatic stellate cells (SC) activation is a pivotal event in the development of liver fibrosis. MAIN METHODS: We hypothesized that MSC play an important role in regulating SC proliferation and apoptosis through paracrine mechanisms. To investigate the paracrine interactions between MSC and SC, a co-culture experimental model was developed using human MSC (hMSC) and human SC (hSC). KEY FINDINGS: We demonstrate that hMSC and hSC both express nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor p75. Results acquired from transwell co-culture experiments using hSC and hMSC showed that hMSC secrete NGF, which enhances hSC apoptosis. Transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-KappaB) and B cell leukemia-xl (Bcl-xl) take part in the process. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrated that hMSC indirectly modulate activated hSC in vitro via NGF-mediated signaling cascades and provide a potential mechanism of how transplanted MSC are effective in treating liver fibrosis.","['Lin, Nan', 'Hu, Kunpeng', 'Chen, Si', 'Xie, Shujie', 'Tang, Zhaofeng', 'Lin, Jizong', 'Xu, Ruiyun']","['Lin N', 'Hu K', 'Chen S', 'Xie S', 'Tang Z', 'Lin J', 'Xu R']","['Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, 3rd Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, GuangZhou 510630, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090624,Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,,2009/06/30 09:00,2009/08/14 09:00,['2009/06/30 09:00'],"['2009/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/12 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/14 09:00 [medline]']","['S0024-3205(09)00278-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.lfs.2009.06.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2009 Aug 12;85(7-8):291-5. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2009.06.007.

However, the establishment of specific and robust gene signatures from microarray data sets requires the analysis of large numbers of patients and the application of complex biostatistical algorithms. Especially in case of rare diseases and due to these constrains, diagnostic centers with limited access to patients or bioinformatic resources are excluded from implementing these new technologies. METHOD: In our study we sought to overcome these limitations and for proof of principle, we analyzed the rare t(4;11) leukemia disease entity. First, gene expression data of each t(4;11) leukemia patient were normalized by pairwise subtraction against normal bone marrow (n = 3) to identify significantly deregulated gene sets for each patient. RESULT: A 'core signature' of 186 commonly deregulated genes present in each investigated t(4;11) leukemia patient was defined. Linking the obtained gene sets to four biological discriminators (HOXA gene expression, age at diagnosis, fusion gene transcripts and chromosomal breakpoints) divided patients into two distinct subgroups: the first one comprised infant patients with low HOXA genes expression and the MLL breakpoints within introns 11/12. The second one comprised non-infant patients with high HOXA expression and MLL breakpoints within introns 9/10. CONCLUSION: A yet homogeneous leukemia entity was further subdivided, based on distinct genetic properties. This approach provided a simplified way to obtain robust and disease-specific gene signatures even in smaller cohorts.","['Trentin, Luca', 'Giordan, Marco', 'Dingermann, Theo', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Te Kronnie, Geertruy', 'Marschalek, Rolf']","['Trentin L', 'Giordan M', 'Dingermann T', 'Basso G', 'Te Kronnie G', 'Marschalek R']","['Hemato-Oncology, Dept. of Pediatrics, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090625,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,2009/06/30 09:00,2009/11/07 06:00,['2009/06/30 09:00'],"['2009/06/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/07 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1305 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01305.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2009 Nov;83(5):406-19. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01305.x.

Interviewed by Richardson, Michael K.",725-31,10.1387/ijdb.072575mr [doi],"Clifford J. Tabin has made pioneering contributions to several fields in biology, including retroviruses, oncogenes, developmental biology and evolution. His father, a physicist who worked in the Manhattan project, kindled his interest in science. Cliff later chose to study biology and started his research career when the world of recombinant DNA was opening up. In Robert Weinbergs lab, he constructed the Moloney leukaemia virus (MLV-tk), the first recombinant retrovirus that could be used as a eukaryotic vector. He also discovered the amino acid changes leading to the activation of Ras, the first human oncogene discovered. As an independent researcher, he began in the field of urodele limb regeneration, and described the expression of retinoic acid receptor and Hox genes in the blastema. Moving to the chick model, his was one of the labs that simultaneously cloned the first vertebrate hedgehog cognates and showed that sonic hedgehog functions as a morphogen in certain developmental contexts, in particular as an organizing activity during limb development. Comparative studies by Ann Burke in his lab showed that differences in boundaries of Hox gene expression across vertebrate phylogeny correlated with differences in skeletal morphology. The Tabin lab also discovered a genetic pathway responsible for mediating left-right asymmetry in vertebrates; helped uncover the pathways leading to dorsoventral limb patterning; made contributions to our understanding of skeletal morphogenesis and identified developmental mechanisms that might underpin the diversification of the beak in Darwins finches. Despite being a professor of genetics at Harvard, Tabin says: ""I have never done a genetics experiment in my life!"". This is changing with his latest project: the genetics of Mexican cavefish.

Retinoid signals are mediated by retinoic acid (RA) receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). Retinoic acid receptors consist of RARalpha, RARbeta and RARgamma isotypes. Among these components, RARalpha is preferentially bound to ATRA, which is used to treat acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia, yet the conditions and mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we have demonstrated that, in human acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia Molt3 cells, inhibition of RA-induced proliferation results from massive cell death characterised by apoptosis. The effect of ATRA:RARalpha binding on apoptosis in Molt3 cells has been investigated. Consequently, it has been shown that, in RA-treated Molt3 cells, upregulation of p21 due to RA accompanies caspase 3/PARP activation which precedes the occurrence of apoptosis.","['Luo, Peihua', 'Lin, Meili', 'Lin, Meihua', 'Chen, Yiyu', 'Yang, Bo', 'He, Qiaojun']","['Luo P', 'Lin M', 'Lin M', 'Chen Y', 'Yang B', 'He Q']","[""Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2009/06/27 09:00,2009/09/03 06:00,['2009/06/27 09:00'],"['2009/06/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['912711107 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190902934936 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Jul;50(7):1183-9. doi: 10.1080/10428190902934936.,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*physiology', 'Densitometry/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2016 May;57(5):1243.

T315I (Treonine-->Isoleucine) is a mutation in the exon 6 of BCR-ABL gene that makes the protein resistant to kinase inhibitors currently used for treating CML. Denaturing High-performance liquid chromatography (D-HPLC) allows for high throughput mutation screening. In this study, we screened mutations in exon 6 of the BCR-ABL gene in patients presenting failure or sub optimal response according to Leukemia Net criteria and correlated the presence of mutations with clinical outcome. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples from 93 patients with CML (5 intolerant and 88 resistant). The PCR product was analysed by D-HPLC, and the patients samples with abnormal D-HLPC profiles were submitted to automated sequencing, using specific primers. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of mutation analysis, for the whole group and for both groups (mutation versus no mutation). We screened mutations in exon 6 of the BCR-ABL gene in 93 CML TKI - resistant patients. Twenty-three out of 93 samples (25%) showed an abnormal elution profile. Automated sequencing confirmed the presence of a nucleotide change in 19 out of 23 cases: one polymorphism, T315T, seven known point mutations: T315I, F317L, V339L, M351T, E355G and F359V and three novel mutations: C305R, D325D and I360S. OS for the whole group was 80% in a median observation time of 30 months. OS for patients without the mutation was 87% and with the mutation was 56%, in a median observation time of 37 and 10 months, respectively (p < 0.0001, RR = 68). D-HPLC is a practical and sensitive method for routine clinical monitoring for emergence of kinase domain mutations and may be useful for optimising therapy in CML. The screening of mutations in exon 6 is clinically relevant, once the presence of mutations confers a poor outcome. Early detection of emerging mutant clones may help in decision-making for alternative treatment.","['Mascarenhas, Cintia C', 'Cunha, Anderson F', 'Miranda, Eliana C', 'Zulli, Roberto', 'Silveira, Rosana A', 'Costa, Fernando F', 'Pagnano, Katia B B', 'De Souza, Carmino A']","['Mascarenhas CC', 'Cunha AF', 'Miranda EC', 'Zulli R', 'Silveira RA', 'Costa FF', 'Pagnano KB', 'De Souza CA']","['Hematology and Hemotherapy Center, University of Campinas, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2009/06/27 09:00,2009/09/03 06:00,['2009/06/27 09:00'],"['2009/06/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['912709136 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190902930496 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Jul;50(7):1148-54. doi: 10.1080/10428190902930496.,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', '*Exons', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objectives were to determine the distribution and incidence of adult AL in UAE (nationals and non-nationals). This epidemiological survey recovered 263 adult patients with AL diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2006 with a median age of 34 years. Twenty-four percent were UAE nationals and 63% were males. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was more frequently diagnosed (32%) than in western countries. This clearly reflects the population structure of the UAE which consists of predominantly young males. There is a tendency for lower crude and age-specific incidence rates of AL, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and ALL in the UAE when compared with those in western countries. We found a statistically significant higher incidence of AML among national females than in national males (p = 0.04). This is reflected in a significantly higher incidence of AL (p = 0.02) and AML (p = 0.02) among the females when compared with the males in the total population of the UAE. This result contradicts the generally known finding that AML and ALL are more common in males. The implication of cumulative risk factors to which females could be exposed, such as vitamin D deficiency as a result of sunlight deprivation and direct exposure to benzene and color enhancement chemicals in henna, could not be excluded and warrant further investigation.","['Hassan, Inaam Bashir', 'Islam, Sherief I A M', 'Alizadeh, Hussain', 'Kristensen, Jorgen', 'Kambal, Amr', 'Sonday, Shanaaz', 'Bernseen, Roos M D']","['Hassan IB', 'Islam SI', 'Alizadeh H', 'Kristensen J', 'Kambal A', 'Sonday S', 'Bernseen RM']","['Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Department of Internal Medicine, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, UAE. inaambh@uaeu.ac.ae']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2009/06/27 09:00,2009/09/03 06:00,['2009/06/27 09:00'],"['2009/06/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['912709183 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190902919184 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Jul;50(7):1138-47. doi: 10.1080/10428190902919184.,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Population Groups', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Sex Factors', 'United Arab Emirates/epidemiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification of mechanisms linking neoplasia to the autoimmune defects is important for a better understanding and improving the treatment of these conditions. Among such mechanisms, the B cell activator factor (BAFF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), two members of the tumor necrosis factor family, play an important role. BAFF and APRIL have both been associated with autoimmunity, with their underlying mechanism of action most likely being related to the rescue of autoreactive B cells.

Their significance in pediatric AML is still unclear. In this study we evaluated the frequency of FLT3 and NPM1 mutations in childhood AML. We also examined clinical features and outcome of these patients. FLT3 and NPM1 mutations were analysed in 42 and 37 childhood AML patients, respectively, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. FLT3 mutations were detected in 4/42 patients (9.5%). The frequencies of FLT3/ITD and FLT3/D835 were the same, 2/42 (4.7%). NMP1 mutations were found in 1/37 patients (2.7%). FLT3 gene mutations were correlated with induction failure. Here we report the results of the study of FLT3 and NPM1 gene mutations in childhood AML patients in Serbia. Low frequencies of these molecular markers point out that these abnormalities are rare in this cohort of patients. Comparative study of data on NPM1 mutations in childhood AML revealed that various NPM1 gene mutation types are associated with childhood AML. Our findings as well as previously reported data, contributes to a hypothesis of different biology and etiology of adult and childhood AML.

Many indirubin derivatives have been studied for their potential anti-solid tumor activity. We have synthesized and evaluated many indirubin derivatives. In order to compare and confirm the potential of our major derivatives as anti-solid tumor agents, we examined their anti-proliferative activity in monolayers, as well as in multicellular spheroids (MCS) cultures of human colorectal cancer cells, DLD-1 and HT-29. The MCS model is an in vitro solid tumor model that is increasingly used for the evaluation of anti-solid tumor activity. 5-nitro-indirubin-3'-oxime (4c) and 5'-bromo-5-nitro-indirubin-3'-oxime (4l), compared to 5-trimethylacetamido-indirubin-3'-oxime (11) and 5-diphenylacetamido-indirubin-3'-oxime (33) showed greater anti-proliferative effects in monolayers, but lower anti-proliferative effects in MCS. Overall, our data suggest that compounds 11 and 33 may exert a significant anti-solid tumor activity via a mechanism other than CDK inhibition, different from that of 4c and 4l.

Furthermore, in order to evaluate the role of the immune system in controlling the infection during latency, we induced immunosuppression in the infected monkeys. We first showed that the STLV-1 proviral load was higher in males than in females and increased significantly with the duration of infection: mandrills infected for 10-6 years had a significantly higher proviral load than those infected for 2-4 years. Curiously, this observation was associated with a clear reduction in CD4+ T-cell number with age. We also found that the percentage of CD4(+) T cells co-expressing the activation marker HLA-DR and the mean percentage of CD25(+) in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were significantly higher in infected than in uninfected animals. Furthermore, the STLV-1 proviral load correlated positively with T-cell activation but not with the frequency of T cells secreting interferon gamma in response to Tax peptides. Lastly, we showed that, during immunosuppression in infected monkeys, the percentages of CD8(+) T cells expressing HLA-DR(+) and of CD4(+) T cells expressing the proliferation marker Ki67 decreased significantly, although the percentage of CD8(+) T cells expressing HLA-DR(+) and Ki67 increased significantly by the end of treatment. Interestingly, the proviral load increased significantly after immunosuppression in the monkey with the highest load. Our study demonstrates that mandrills naturally infected with STLV-1 could be a suitable model for studying the relations between host and virus. Further studies are needed to determine whether the different compartments of the immune response during infection induce the long latency by controlling viral replication over time. Such studies would provide important information for the development of immune-based therapeutic strategies.","['Souquiere, Sandrine', 'Mouinga-Ondeme, Augustin', 'Makuwa, Maria', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Kazanji, Mirdad']","['Souquiere S', 'Mouinga-Ondeme A', 'Makuwa M', 'Hermine O', 'Kazanji M']","['Unite de Retrovirologie, Centre International de Recherches Medicales de Franceville (CIRMF), Franceville, Gabon.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090625,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC2698465,2009/06/27 09:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/06/27 09:00'],"['2009/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0006050 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Jun 25;4(6):e6050. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0006050.,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/virology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/virology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'HLA-DR Antigens/metabolism', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Mandrillus', 'Simian Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology/*virology', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*virology', 'Tacrolimus/therapeutic use', '*Viral Load']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report for the first time that REGgamma interacts with the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), accumulates in PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), but it does not play any role in normal or arsenic-induced PML degradation. However, REGgamma seems to regulate PML-NBs number, since its deficiency causes an increase in PML-NBs, which can be overcome by increased levels of SUMO1, and its overexpression has the opposite effect. We additionally found that REGgamma interacts with the DNA damage checkpoint kinase Chk2, whose presence is necessary for the increase of PML-NBs induced by REGgamma deficiency, and that REGgamma depletion resulted in a partial restoration of PML-NBs in APL derived cells. Altogether, these results underline a new role for REGgamma in the control and regulation of PML subnuclear structures.","['Zannini, Laura', 'Buscemi, Giacomo', 'Fontanella, Enrico', 'Lisanti, Sofia', 'Delia, Domenico']","['Zannini L', 'Buscemi G', 'Fontanella E', 'Lisanti S', 'Delia D']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milano 20133, Italy. laura.zannini@istitutotumori.mi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090821,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,,2009/06/27 09:00,2009/10/31 06:00,['2009/06/27 09:00'],"['2009/06/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['9084 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.8.15.9084 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2009 Aug;8(15):2399-407. doi: 10.4161/cc.8.15.9084.

The majority of known fusion genes are the consequence of reciprocal (balanced) translocations. However, most translocations described in human cancer are unbalanced, suggesting that other cancer genes remain to be identified. Historically, it was assumed that these unbalanced rearrangements affected gene function through the loss or gain of chromosomal material. However, emerging data supports direct disruption of genes located at or close to the unbalanced translocation breakpoints. New approaches are required for the identification of those gene loci underlying unbalanced translocations in cancer, as traditional methods have had limited success. This review focuses on one such strategy, using traditional and innovative molecular technologies to characterize breakpoint heterogeneity within a series of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients with dicentric chromosomes. This approach has shown that in ALL, specific gene loci can be targeted by heterogeneous translocation breakpoints involving multiple partner chromosomes. Carcinomas have a high proportion of unbalanced rearrangements and relatively few significant genes have been identified. The application of the same strategy to their analysis will lead to the discovery of novel cancer genes and improve our understanding of the genetic basis of tumorigenesis.","['Strefford, Jonathan C', 'An, Qian', 'Harrison, Christine J']","['Strefford JC', 'An Q', 'Harrison CJ']","['Cancer Genomics Group, Cancer Sciences Division, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.

The pro-survival Bcl2 homology (BH) proteins critically regulate apoptosis, and may represent important therapeutic targets for restoring drug sensitivity in NB. We used a human NB tumor tissue microarray to survey the expression of pro-survival BH proteins Mcl1 and Bcl2, and correlated expression to clinical prognostic factors and survival. Primary NB tumors heterogeneously expressed Mcl1 or Bcl2, with high expression correlating to high-risk phenotype. Co-expression is infrequent (11%), but correlates to reduced survival. Using RNA interference, we investigated the functional relevance of Mcl1 and Bcl2 in high-risk NB cell lines (SK-N-AS, IMR-5, NLF). Mcl1 knockdown induced apoptosis in all NB cell lines, while Bcl2 knockdown inhibited only NLF, suggesting functional heterogeneity. Finally, we determined the relevance of Mcl1 in resistance to conventional chemotherapy (etoposide, doxorubicin) and small molecule Bcl2-family antagonists (ABT-737 and AT-101). Mcl1 silencing augmented sensitivity to chemotherapeutics 2- to 300-fold, while Bcl2 silencing did not, even in Bcl2-sensitive NLF cells. Resistance to ABT-737, which targets Bcl2/-w/-x, was overcome by Mcl1 knockdown. AT-101, which also neutralizes Mcl1, had single-agent cytotoxicity, further augmented by Mcl1 knockdown. In conclusion, Mcl1 appears a predominant pro-survival protein contributing to chemoresistance in NB, and Mcl1 inactivation may represent a novel therapeutic strategy. Optimization of compounds with higher Mcl1 affinity, or combination with additional Mcl1 antagonists, may enhance the clinical utility of this approach.","['Lestini, Brian J', 'Goldsmith, Kelly C', 'Fluchel, Mark N', 'Liu, Xueyuan', 'Chen, Niel L', 'Goyal, Bella', 'Pawel, Bruce R', 'Hogarty, Michael D']","['Lestini BJ', 'Goldsmith KC', 'Fluchel MN', 'Liu X', 'Chen NL', 'Goyal B', 'Pawel BR', 'Hogarty MD']","[""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104-4318, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090808,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,PMC3770183,2009/06/27 09:00,2010/02/13 06:00,['2009/06/27 09:00'],"['2009/06/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['8964 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.8.16.8964 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2009 Aug;8(16):1587-95. doi: 10.4161/cbt.8.16.8964.

The mucins, MUC5AC and MUC5B, contribute to the viscoelastic properties of mucus, and are found at elevated levels in the airways of individuals with chronic respiratory diseases. The T helper type 2 cell cytokine, IL-13, is known to regulate MUC5AC expression in goblet cells of the airways, although much less is known about the regulation of MUC5B expression. In a study to further understand the mediators of MUC5AC and MUC5B expression, neuregulin (NRG) 1beta1 was identified as novel regulator of goblet cell formation in primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs). NRG1beta1 increased expression of MUCAC and MUC5B proteins in a time- and dose-dependent fashion in HBEC cultures. NRG1beta1-induced expression of MU5AC and MUC5B was shown to involve v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ErbB) and ErbB3 receptors, but not ErbB4 receptors. Treatment of HBECs with inhibitors of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase indicated that these kinases were involved in NRG1beta1-induced MUC5AC and MUC5B expression. Additionally, NRG1beta1 was shown to induce the phosphorylation of the ErbB2 receptor, AKT, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. NRG1beta1 protein was found increased in the airways of antigen-challenged mice, together with increases in MUC5AC and MUC5B message. Together, these data indicate that NRG1beta1 is a novel mediator of MUC5AC and MUC5B expression in HBECs, and may represent a novel therapeutic target for mucus hypersecretion in respiratory diseases.","['Kettle, Rachel', 'Simmons, Jennifer', 'Schindler, Francis', 'Jones, Peter', 'Dicker, Tina', 'Dubois, Gerald', 'Giddings, June', 'Van Heeke, Gino', 'Jones, Carol E']","['Kettle R', 'Simmons J', 'Schindler F', 'Jones P', 'Dicker T', 'Dubois G', 'Giddings J', 'Van Heeke G', 'Jones CE']","['Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Respiratory Disease Area, Wimblehurst Road, Horsham, West Sussex RH125AB, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090625,United States,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,8917225,,2009/06/27 09:00,2010/04/07 06:00,['2009/06/27 09:00'],"['2009/06/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['2009-0018OC [pii]', '10.1165/rcmb.2009-0018OC [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2010 Apr;42(4):472-81. doi: 10.1165/rcmb.2009-0018OC.

We demonstrate that down-modulation of BMI1 in cord blood CD34(+) cells impaired long-term expansion and progenitor-forming capacity, both in cytokine-driven liquid cultures as well as in bone marrow stromal cocultures. In addition, long-term culture-initiating cell frequencies were dramatically decreased upon knockdown of BMI1, indicating an impaired maintenance of stem and progenitor cells. The reduced progenitor and stem cell frequencies were associated with increased expression of p14ARF and p16INK4A and enhanced apoptosis, which coincided with increased levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species and reduced FOXO3A expression. In AML CD34(+) cells, down-modulation of BMI1 impaired long-term expansion, whereby self-renewal capacity was lost, as determined by the loss of replating capacity of the cultures. These phenotypes were also associated with increased expression levels of p14ARF and p16INK4A. Together our data indicate that BMI1 expression is required for maintenance and self-renewal of normal and leukemic stem and progenitor cells, and that expression of BMI1 protects cells against oxidative stress.","['Rizo, Aleksandra', 'Olthof, Sandra', 'Han, Lina', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'de Haan, Gerald', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob']","['Rizo A', 'Olthof S', 'Han L', 'Vellenga E', 'de Haan G', 'Schuringa JJ']","['Department of Cell Biology, Section Stem Cell Biology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090625,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/06/27 09:00,2009/10/01 06:00,['2009/06/27 09:00'],"['2009/06/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37175-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-03-209734 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Aug 20;114(8):1498-505. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-03-209734.

We investigated the mechanisms responsible for TNF-alpha secretion from monocytic cells induced by the auto-antibodies that are purified from the sera of AA patients. TNF-alpha induction by anti-moesin antibodies depended on the amount of cell surface moesin expressed by THP-1 cells. F(ab')(2) fragments prepared from the anti-moesin antibodies were able to stimulate THP-1 cells to secrete TNF-alpha and this stimulatory effect was enhanced by cross-linking of moesins with anti-human IgG F(ab')(2) fragment antibodies. Anti-moesin antibodies as well as their F(ab')(2) fragments induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in monocytic cells and this effect was suppressed by the addition of an ERK1/2 inhibitor. Moreover, anti-moesin antibody treatment induced the phosphorylation of moesin proteins in the monocytes and THP-1 cells within 30 min. These results indicate that anti-moesin antibodies induce TNF-alpha secretion from monocytes through the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway provoked by direct binding to moesin on the cells.","['Espinoza, J Luis', 'Takamatsu, Hiroyuki', 'Lu, Xuzhang', 'Qi, Zhirong', 'Nakao, Shinji']","['Espinoza JL', 'Takamatsu H', 'Lu X', 'Qi Z', 'Nakao S']","['Cellular Transplantation Biology, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Science, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090625,England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,,2009/06/27 09:00,2009/10/23 06:00,['2009/06/27 09:00'],"['2009/06/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['dxp058 [pii]', '10.1093/intimm/dxp058 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 2009 Aug;21(8):913-23. doi: 10.1093/intimm/dxp058.

The mixed lineage leukemia protein-1 (MLL1) is a member of the SET1 family of H3K4 methyltransferases and is frequently rearranged in acute leukemias. Despite sequence comparisons that predict that SET1 family enzymes should only monomethylate their substrates, mono-, di-, and trimethylation of H3K4 has been attributed to SET1 family complexes in vivo and in vitro. To better understand this paradox, we have biochemically reconstituted and characterized a five-component 200-kDa MLL1 core complex containing human MLL1, WDR5, RbBP5, Ash2L, and DPY-30. We demonstrate that the isolated MLL1 SET domain is a slow monomethyltransferase and that tyrosine 3942 of MLL1 prevents di- and trimethylation of H3K4. In contrast, a complex containing the MLL1 SET domain, WDR5, RbBP5, Ash2L, and DPY-30, displays a marked approximately 600-fold increase in enzymatic activity but only to the dimethyl form of H3K4. Single turnover kinetic experiments reveal that the reaction leading to H3K4 dimethylation involves the transient accumulation of a monomethylated species, suggesting that the MLL1 core complex uses a non-processive mechanism to catalyze multiple lysine methylation. We have also discovered that the non-SET domain components of the MLL1 core complex possess a previously unrecognized methyltransferase activity that catalyzes H3K4 dimethylation within the MLL1 core complex. Our results suggest that the mechanism of multiple lysine methylation by the MLL1 core complex involves the sequential addition of two methyl groups at two distinct active sites within the complex.","['Patel, Anamika', 'Dharmarajan, Venkatasubramanian', 'Vought, Valarie E', 'Cosgrove, Michael S']","['Patel A', 'Dharmarajan V', 'Vought VE', 'Cosgrove MS']","['Department of Biology, Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York 13244, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090625,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC2782018,2009/06/27 09:00,2009/10/06 06:00,['2009/06/27 09:00'],"['2009/06/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)54793-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.014498 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Sep 4;284(36):24242-56. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.014498.

METHODS: (1) The concentration of DNR in plasma of children with acute leukemia was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-fluorescence detection method. Plasma was sampled frequently from the start of the infusion till the end of 24 h. DNR pharmacokinetics was studied by determination of the concentrations. (2) Efficacy and toxicity were monitored in each period after chemotherapy. Laboratory studies included examination of bone marrow, white blood cell count, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, myocardial enzymogram, the liver and kidney function. RESULTS: (1) DNR was eliminated from plasma in a two-compartment manner. The maximum concentration was seen 1 - 3 h after infusion. Cmax was 63.50 microg/L. Tmax was 1.45 h. The concentration decreased quickly to a low level of about 11.52 microg/L from the end of 2 hours infusion. There was a large inter-individual difference in pharmacokinetic parameters of DNR. The difference of CL was 9-fold, AUC was 8-fold, Cmax was 5-fold. (2) CL of male patients [57.99 L/(h.m(2))] was significantly lower than that of female patients [93.71 L/(h.m(2))] (P < 0.05). Tmax of children older than 6 years was 1.1 h, and that of children younger than 6 years was 1.8 h (P < 0.05); Cmax of children older than 6 years was 90.77 microg/L, younger than 6 years was 57.44 microg/L (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: (1) There is a large inter-individual difference in pharmacokinetic parameters of DNR in children. It may predict individual variety of efficacy and toxicity. Therapeutic drug monitoring is important. (2) Male patients and children older than 6 years had a higher bioavailability and lower metabolism, toxicity may easily occur in such children, therefore they may need lower dose.","['Sun, Yi-Na', 'Chai, Yi-Huan', 'Xu, Yu-Jie', 'Lu, Hui']","['Sun YN', 'Chai YH', 'Xu YJ', 'Lu H']","[""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215003, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,,2009/06/27 09:00,2011/01/05 06:00,['2009/06/27 09:00'],"['2009/06/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2009 Apr;47(4):296-300.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Daunorubicin/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have revealed CD26 expression in T cell leukemia/lymphoma and malignant mesothelioma, and an inhibitory effect of anti-CD26 monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the growth of CD26+ cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The function of CD26 in tumor development is unknown and the machinery with which the CD26 mAb induces its anti-tumor effect remains uncharacterized. RESULTS: The localization of CD26 in the nucleus of T cell leukemia/lymphoma cells and mesothelioma cells was shown by biochemical and immuno-electron microscopic analysis. The DPPIV enzyme activity was revealed in the nuclear fraction of T cell leukemia/lymphoma cells. These expressions of intra-nuclear CD26 were augmented by treatment with the CD26 mAb, 1F7, with anti-tumor effect against the CD26+ T cell leukemia/lymphoma cells. In contrast, the CD26 mAb, 5F8, without anti-tumor effect, did not augment CD26 expressions in the nucleus. Biotin-labeled, cell surface CD26 translocated into the nucleus constantly, and this translocation was enhanced with 1F7 treatment but not with 5F8. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the intra-nuclear CD26 which moves from plasma membrane may play certain roles in cell growth of human cancer cells.","['Yamada, Kohji', 'Hayashi, Mutsumi', 'Du, Wenlin', 'Ohnuma, Kei', 'Sakamoto, Michiie', 'Morimoto, Chikao', 'Yamada, Taketo']","['Yamada K', 'Hayashi M', 'Du W', 'Ohnuma K', 'Sakamoto M', 'Morimoto C', 'Yamada T']","['Department of Pathology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. kohji@z8.keio.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090626,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,PMC2709605,2009/06/27 09:00,2009/06/27 09:01,['2009/06/27 09:00'],"['2009/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/27 09:01 [medline]']","['1475-2867-9-17 [pii]', '10.1186/1475-2867-9-17 [doi]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2009 Jun 26;9:17. doi: 10.1186/1475-2867-9-17.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These include a subset of hem-endothelial progenitor cells that play a vital role in vascular growth and repair. The presence and clinical implications of circulating RNA levels as an expression for hematopoietic and endothelial-specific markers have not been previously evaluated in preterm infants. This study aims to determine circulating RNA levels of hem-endothelial marker genes in peripheral blood of preterm infants and begin to correlate these findings with prenatal complications. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples from seventeen preterm neonates were analyzed at three consecutive post-delivery time points (day 3-5, 10-15 and 30). Using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction we studied the expression patterns of previously established hem-endothelial-specific progenitor-associated genes (AC133, Tie-2, Flk-1 (VEGFR2) and Scl/Tal1) in association with characteristics of prematurity and preterm morbidity. RESULTS: Circulating Tie-2 and SCL/Tal1 RNA levels displayed an inverse correlation to gestational age (GA). We observed significantly elevated Tie-2 levels in preterm infants born to mothers with amnionitis, and in infants with sustained brain echogenicity on brain sonography. Other markers showed similar expression patterns yet we could not demonstrate statistically significant correlations. CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings suggest that circulating RNA levels especially Tie2 and SCL decline with maturation and might relate to some preterm complication. Further prospective follow up of larger cohorts are required to establish this association.","['Strauss, Tzipora', 'Metsuyanim, Sally', 'Pessach, Itai', 'Shuchan-Eisen, Irit', 'Kuint, Jacob', 'Dekel, Benjamin']","['Strauss T', 'Metsuyanim S', 'Pessach I', 'Shuchan-Eisen I', 'Kuint J', 'Dekel B']","['Neonatal Department, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel. t.tzipi@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090625,England,BMC Pediatr,BMC pediatrics,100967804,PMC2709108,2009/06/27 09:00,2009/10/03 06:00,['2009/06/27 09:00'],"['2009/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2431-9-42 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2431-9-42 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Pediatr. 2009 Jun 25;9:42. doi: 10.1186/1471-2431-9-42.,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, TIE-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Antigens, CD/blood/genetics', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/blood/genetics', 'Birth Weight', 'Echoencephalography', 'Endothelial Cells/*cytology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gestational Age', 'Glycoproteins/blood/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Premature/*blood', 'Male', '*Neovascularization, Physiologic', 'Peptides/blood/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/blood/genetics', 'RNA/*blood', 'Receptor, TIE-2/blood/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cells/*cytology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/blood/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, melatonin was shown to possess proapoptotic action by increasing reactive oxygen species in certain cancer cells. The modification of radiation-induced apoptosis by melatonin and the expression of apoptosis-associated upstream regulators were studied in normal mice splenocytes and Jurkat T leukemia cells. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to a single whole body X-ray radiation dose of 2 Gy with or without 250 mg/kg melatonin pretreatment. The Jurkat cells were divided into four groups of control, 1 mm melatonin alone, 4 Gy irradiation-only and melatonin pretreatment before irradiation. The highest level of apoptosis in the normal splenic white pulp was detected by TUNEL assay at 8 hr after irradiation. At this time, the apoptotic index of irradiation-only and melatonin pretreatment groups were 35.6% and 20.7%, respectively. This reduced apoptosis by melatonin was associated with the increase of Bcl-2 expression and a reduction of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio through a relative decrease of p53 mRNA and protein. In the Jurkat cells treated with a combination of melatonin and radiation, both Annexin V-FITC(+)/PI(-) and Annexin V-FITC(+) cells were increased at 48 hr after irradiation when compared with irradiation-only or melatonin alone. The expressions of p53 between groups were well correlated with the results of Annexin V binding. The irradiation or melatonin did not influence the JNK1 expression in Jurkat cells. The present results suggest that melatonin enhances radiation-induced apoptosis in Jurkat leukemia cells, while reducing radiation-induced apoptosis in normal mice splenocytes. These differential effects on radiation-induced apoptosis by melatonin might involve the regulation of p53 expression.","['Jang, Seong Soon', 'Kim, Won Dong', 'Park, Woo-Yoon']","['Jang SS', 'Kim WD', 'Park WY']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Chungbuk National University College of Medicine, Cheongju, Korea.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Chungbuk National University College of Medicine, Cheongju, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090623,England,J Pineal Res,Journal of pineal research,8504412,,2009/06/27 09:00,2009/11/17 06:00,['2009/06/27 09:00'],"['2009/06/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-079X.2009.00694.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Pineal Res. 2009 Sep;47(2):147-155. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-079X.2009.00694.x.

About 45% of de novo AML lack cytogenetic abnormalities, so identification of predictive molecular markers might improve therapy. We studied the prognostic impact of brain and acute leukemia, cytoplasmic (BAALC) and ETS-related gene (ERG) expression in AML with normal karyotype. Pretreatment bone marrow samples from 30 cytogenetically normal AML patients were analysed for BAALC and ERG expression using real time RT-PCR. The patients were dichotomized at BAALC and ERG mean expression into low and high expression. BAALC showed high expression in 70% of patients and its expression did not correlate with the clinical parameters of patients. ERG was high in 33.3% of patients and its expression was associated with lower ages and higher white cell counts. With follow-up for 2 years, patients with high BAALC and high ERG had low rates of clinical remission (P < 0.005) and inferior overall survival (OS) (P < 0.001 and <0.002 for BAALC and ERG respectively). No significant association was observed between the increase in BAALC and ERG expression (P = 0.398). Multivariable analysis confirmed high BAALC expression as an independent risk factor for OS. Overexpression of BAALC and ERG either separate or concomitant predict adverse clinical outcome and may define important risk factor in cytogenetically normal AML.","['Eid, M A', 'Attia, M', 'Abdou, S', 'El-Shazly, S F', 'Elahwal, L', 'Farrag, W', 'Mahmoud, L']","['Eid MA', 'Attia M', 'Abdou S', 'El-Shazly SF', 'Elahwal L', 'Farrag W', 'Mahmoud L']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt. manaleid@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090623,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,2009/06/27 09:00,2010/08/25 06:00,['2009/06/27 09:00'],"['2009/06/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['CLH1168 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-553X.2009.01168.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2010 Apr;32(2):197-205. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2009.01168.x.

In the present study, it was found that the methylated status of ERalpha-A might serve as an epigenetic biomarker of leukaemias. In this study, the protein expression and cell apoptosis, cycle, proliferation and viability with and without 5-aza-dC (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) were evaluated with Western blotting, 3H-TdR (3H-thymidine) incorporation, propidium iodide staining and Trypan Blue staining respectively. The protein expression of ERalpha was significantly enhanced in all leukaemic cell lines using treatment with the DNA demethylation reagent 5-aza-dC. However, no obvious change in the protein expression of ERbeta takes place with 5-aza-dC. And with 5-aza-dC, cell apoptosis, cell cycle, cell proliferation and viability were all inhibited significantly. We also tracked 40 cases of leukaemias with ERalpha-A methylation (95%; 38 of 40) to observe the prognosis 1 year after chemotherapy treatment. The patients with ERalpha-A methylation have no obvious symptomatic relief; however, two patients without ERalpha-A methylation have obtained effective relief. This result suggested that ERalpha plays a significant role in leukaemogenesis, and the methylated status of ERalpha-A not only might serve as an epigenetic biomarker of leukaemias for diagnosis, but also has the potential to serve as a predictor of prognosis in leukaemias.","['Yao, Jie', 'Zhang, Xiao-Bing', 'Zhang, Xiao-li', 'Fu, Wei-Ling']","['Yao J', 'Zhang XB', 'Zhang XL', 'Fu WL']","[""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100312,England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,,2009/06/27 09:00,2010/06/23 06:00,['2009/06/27 09:00'],"['2009/06/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['BSR20090044 [pii]', '10.1042/BSR20090044 [doi]']",epublish,Biosci Rep. 2010 Mar 12;30(4):217-22. doi: 10.1042/BSR20090044.,['0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Methylation', 'Prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report the activity of ispinesib against the in vitro and in vivo panels of the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP). PROCEDURES: Ispinesib was tested against the PPTP in vitro panel cell lines at concentrations from 0.1 nM to 1 microM and against the in vivo tumor panel xenografts by intraperitoneal administration (5 or 10 mg/kg) every 4 days for 3 doses repeated at day 21. RESULTS: Ispinesib was highly potent against the PPTP's in vitro cell lines with a median IC(50) of 4.1 nM. Ispinesib (10 mg/kg) induced unexplained toxicity in mice bearing osteosarcoma xenografts and exceeded the MTD in 12 of 40 non-osteosarcoma xenografts. Ispinesib induced significant tumor growth delay in 88% (23/26) of evaluable xenografts. Using a time to event measure of efficacy, ispinesib had intermediate and high levels of activity against 4 (21%) and 5 (26%) of the 19 evaluable solid tumor xenografts, respectively. Ispinesib induced maintained complete responses (CR) in a rhabdoid tumor, a Wilms tumor and a Ewing sarcoma xenograft. Ispinesib (5 mg/kg) produced 2 complete and 2 partial responses among 6 evaluable xenografts in the ALL panel. The in vivo pattern of activity was distinctive from that previously reported for vincristine. CONCLUSIONS: Ispinesib demonstrated broad in vivo antitumor activity, including maintained complete responses for several xenografts, although with high toxicity rates at the doses studied.","['Carol, Hernan', 'Lock, Richard', 'Houghton, Peter J', 'Morton, Christopher L', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'Gorlick, Richard', 'Reynolds, C Patrick', 'Maris, John M', 'Keir, Stephen T', 'Billups, Catherine A', 'Smith, Malcolm A']","['Carol H', 'Lock R', 'Houghton PJ', 'Morton CL', 'Kolb EA', 'Gorlick R', 'Reynolds CP', 'Maris JM', 'Keir ST', 'Billups CA', 'Smith MA']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,PMC2763980,2009/06/26 09:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/06/26 09:00'],"['2009/06/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22056 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Dec 15;53(7):1255-63. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22056.,"['0 (Antimitotic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'BKT5F9C2NI (ispinesib)', 'EC 3.6.4.4 (Kinesins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimitotic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Female', 'Glioblastoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Kinesins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, SCID', 'Osteosarcoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Rhabdoid Tumor/drug therapy/pathology', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/drug therapy/pathology', 'Single-Blind Method', 'Spindle Apparatus/*drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Wilms Tumor/drug therapy/pathology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,"['P50 CA108786/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA108786/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01CM42216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CM042216/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-42216/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS123095'],,,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,

The expression of ABI1 and its role in cancer progression and prognosis are largely unknown in the majority of solid tumors, including gastric cancer. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between ABI1 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics, tumor progression, and prognosis of patients with gastric carcinoma. Tissue specimens were from 103 gastric cancer patients who underwent gastrectomy in our hospital between January 2000 and December 2007. Among them 59 tumor tissue samples were matched with normal tissue samples. The expression of ABI1 protein was measured using immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded tissue specimens. Meanwhile, quantitative real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to identify the expression of ABI1 in human gastric normal mucosal cell line (GES-1) and gastric cancer cell lines (N87, AGS). We performed a statistical analysis of the potential correlation between ABI1 expression and the patients' clinicopathological characteristics, 5-year survival, and median survival time. The immunohistochemical staining results of 59 patients showed that ABI1 was expressed in 28.8% (17/59) of gastric cancer tissues, compared to 91.5% (54/59) of normal samples. ABI1 expression in 103 patients was strongly correlated with tumor differentiation, clinical stage, and lymph node status (P < 0.01). The 5-year survival rate was 15.3% in the ABI1-negative group and 63.7% in the ABI1-positive group. Median survival time in the ABI1-negative and ABI1-positive groups was 25.0 months (95% CI: 19.7-30.3) and 74.0 months (95% CI: 54.6-93.3), respectively. There was a significant difference between the two groups (chi(2) = 10.888, P = 0.001). Furthermore, we found that ABI1 expressed lowly in poor differentiated AGS, whereas highly in GES-1 and well-differentiated N87.

We have previously demonstrated induction of apoptosis by nelfinavir even in chemo-resistant ovarian cancer cells. In contrast to the pro-apoptotic effect of nelfinavir on human cancer cells, we noticed a significant upregulation of the anti-apoptotic mitochondrial membrane protein mcl-1 by nelfinavir, resulting in a mitochondria-independent induction of apoptosis. Upregulation of mcl-1 was associated with enhanced phosphorylation of both mcl-1 and of ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2). ERK1/2 enhanced stability of mcl-1 protein expression by serine-163 phosphorylation. The combination of nelfinavir with sorafenib, a clinically applied inhibitor of the RAS/RAF/ERK1/2 pathway, inhibited nelfinavir-induced ERK1/2 activation and mcl-1 protein upregulation. Further, the combination of nelfinavir with sorafenib induced mitochondrial membrane potential disruption and resulted in an improved activity of nelfinavir on ovarian cancer cells. Thus, a combination of these two investigational anti-cancer drugs could be of interest especially because of their unique mechanism of apoptosis induction even in otherwise chemo-resistant human cancer cells.","['Bruning, Ansgar', 'Burger, Petra', 'Vogel, Marianne', 'Gingelmaier, Andrea', 'Friese, Klaus', 'Burges, Alexander']","['Bruning A', 'Burger P', 'Vogel M', 'Gingelmaier A', 'Friese K', 'Burges A']","['Department of Obstetrics/Gynaecology, Molecular Biology Laboratory, Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich, Munich, Germany. ansgar231@web.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090626,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,,2009/06/26 09:00,2010/10/22 06:00,['2009/06/26 09:00'],"['2009/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-009-9281-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2010 Oct;28(5):535-42. doi: 10.1007/s10637-009-9281-1.

METHODS: The Offshore Cohort was comprised of >25,000 men who were employed at installations in the North Sea in the period 1965-1999, and who responded to a questionnaire that included work history offshore, other occupational experience, education, leisure-time activities, and lifestyle factors. Calculating standardized incidence ratios (SIR), we compared the number of prospective incident cancers diagnosed between 1999 and 2005 with those expected for age-, gender- and period-specific rates in the general Norwegian population. RESULTS: The overall cancer incidence did not differ from that of the reference population [SIR=1.0, 95% -confidence interval (95% CI) 1.0-1.1, N=695]. There were indications of excess risks of acute myeloid leukemia (SIR=2.0, 95% CI 1.0-3.7) and cancer of the pleura (SIR=2.2, 95% CI 0.9-4.6). No data on occupational history was used in these preliminary analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The cohort was relatively young and an extended observation period would be important for in-depth analyses. The suggested excess of leukemia and cancer of the pleura may be linked to occupational exposure during employment offshore; this issue needs to be addressed in further studies.","['Aas, Gjoril Bergva', 'Aagnes, Bjarte', 'Strand, Leif Age', 'Grimsrud, Tom K']","['Aas GB', 'Aagnes B', 'Strand LA', 'Grimsrud TK']","['Cancer Registry of Norway, Oslo, Norway. gjoril.bergva.aas@kreftregisteret.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090625,Finland,Scand J Work Environ Health,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",7511540,,2009/06/26 09:00,2009/10/15 06:00,['2009/06/26 09:00'],"['2009/06/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1341 [pii]', '10.5271/sjweh.1341 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Work Environ Health. 2009 Oct;35(5):397-9. doi: 10.5271/sjweh.1341.

Rapamycin (Rapa), which targets mTOR (mammalian target of Rapa), is currently evaluated as a treatment for PEL, but the recent development of PEL in Rapa-treated post-transplant recipients questions the drug's use in PEL. Here, we used a murine model of PEL effusion that mimics the human disease to investigate the anti-PEL activity of Rapa. We found that Rapa reduces ascites accumulation and extends mouse survival. Initially, Rapa reduced PEL load compared with control mice, but most mice rapidly showed PEL progression. Levels of VEGF, which promotes vascular permeability contributing to effusion formation, were significantly reduced in ascites of Rapa-treated mice compared with controls. Expression of IL-10, the principal autocrine growth factor for PEL, was initially reduced in PEL from Rapa-treated mice but rapidly increased despite treatment. We found that the hypoxic environment of ascites and Rapa cooperate in stimulating IL-10 expression in PEL, which likely contributes to the emergence of drug resistance. These results identify Rapa an effective drug to reduce PEL effusions but illustrate the rapid development of drug resistance, which likely limits the efficacy of Rapa in PEL.","['Gasperini, P', 'Tosato, G']","['Gasperini P', 'Tosato G']","['Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. gasperinip@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090625,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC2940422,2009/06/26 09:00,2009/11/06 06:00,['2009/06/26 09:00'],"['2009/06/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009117 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.117 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Oct;23(10):1867-74. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.117.

Stem cell procurement for ASCT has most commonly been performed with stem cell mobilization using colony-stimulating factors with or without prior chemotherapy. The target CD34+ cell dose to be collected as well as the number of apheresis performed varies throughout the country, but a minimum of 2 million CD34+ cells/kg has been traditionally used for the support of one cycle of high-dose therapy. With the advent of plerixafor (AMD3100) (a novel stem cell mobilization agent), it is pertinent to review the current status of stem cell mobilization for myeloma as well as the role of autologous stem cell transplantation in this disease. On June 1, 2008, a panel of experts was convened by the International Myeloma Foundation to address issues regarding stem cell mobilization and autologous transplantation in myeloma in the context of new therapies.

METHODS: We conducted a clinical trial to test whether prophylactic cranial irradiation could be omitted from treatment in all children with newly diagnosed ALL. A total of 498 patients who could be evaluated were enrolled. Treatment intensity was based on presenting features and the level of minimal residual disease after remission-induction treatment. The duration of continuous complete remission in the 71 patients who previously would have received prophylactic cranial irradiation was compared with that of 56 historical controls who received it. RESULTS: The 5-year event-free and overall survival probabilities for all 498 patients were 85.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 79.9 to 91.3) and 93.5% (95% CI, 89.8 to 97.2), respectively. The 5-year cumulative risk of isolated CNS relapse was 2.7% (95% CI, 1.1 to 4.3), and that of any CNS relapse (including isolated relapse and combined relapse) was 3.9% (95% CI, 1.9 to 5.9). The 71 patients had significantly longer continuous complete remission than the 56 historical controls (P=0.04). All 11 patients with isolated CNS relapse remained in second remission for 0.4 to 5.5 years. CNS leukemia (CNS-3 status) or a traumatic lumbar puncture with blast cells at diagnosis and a high level of minimal residual disease (> or = 1%) after 6 weeks of remission induction were significantly associated with poorer event-free survival. Risk factors for CNS relapse included the genetic abnormality t(1;19)(TCF3-PBX1), any CNS involvement at diagnosis, and T-cell immunophenotype.

Lack of KIR-HLA class I interactions has been associated with potent NK-mediated antitumor efficacy and increased survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients upon haploidentical stem cell transplantation from KIR-mismatched donors. To exploit this pathway pharmacologically, we generated a fully human monoclonal antibody, 1-7F9, which cross-reacts with KIR2DL1, -2, and -3 receptors, and prevents their inhibitory signaling. The 1-7F9 monoclonal antibody augmented NK cell-mediated lysis of HLA-C-expressing tumor cells, including autologous AML blasts, but did not induce killing of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting a therapeutic window for preferential enhancement of NK-cell cytotoxicity against malignant target cells. Administration of 1-7F9 to KIR2DL3-transgenic mice resulted in dose-dependent rejection of HLA-Cw3-positive target cells. In an immunodeficient mouse model in which inoculation of human NK cells alone was unable to protect against lethal, autologous AML, preadministration of 1-7F9 resulted in long-term survival. These data show that 1-7F9 confers specific, stable blockade of KIR, boosting NK-mediated killing of HLA-matched AML blasts in vitro and in vivo, providing a preclinical basis for initiating phase 1 clinical trials with this candidate therapeutic antibody.","['Romagne, Francois', 'Andre, Pascale', 'Spee, Pieter', 'Zahn, Stefan', 'Anfossi, Nicolas', 'Gauthier, Laurent', 'Capanni, Marusca', 'Ruggeri, Loredana', 'Benson, Don M Jr', 'Blaser, Bradley W', 'Della Chiesa, Mariella', 'Moretta, Alessandro', 'Vivier, Eric', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Velardi, Andrea', 'Wagtmann, Nicolai']","['Romagne F', 'Andre P', 'Spee P', 'Zahn S', 'Anfossi N', 'Gauthier L', 'Capanni M', 'Ruggeri L', 'Benson DM Jr', 'Blaser BW', 'Della Chiesa M', 'Moretta A', 'Vivier E', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Velardi A', 'Wagtmann N']","['Innate-Pharma SA, Marseille, France.

We analyzed presentation patterns and survival over time in 929 patients followed from 1980 to 2008 at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona. The 5- and 10-year relative survival (adjusted for the expected survival in the general population) was estimated in patients seen in 2 periods of time: 1980-1994 (n = 451) and 1995-2004 (n = 365). We found that CLL shortens life expectancy in all age groups independently of clinical features at diagnosis. Nevertheless, survival is improving, particularly in some groups of patients. Thus, relative survival was significantly higher in the 1995-2004 cohort than in the 1980-1994 group both at 5 years (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.46; P = .004) and 10 years (IRR = 0.65; P = .007) from diagnosis. The improved survival was largely due to a decrease in CLL-attributable mortality in patients younger than 70 years in Binet stage B or C at diagnosis (IRR = 0.40; P = .001 at 5 years; IRR = 0.33; P < .001 at 10 years).

In this study we demonstrate that despite normal expression, c-Maf binds poorly to the IL-4 promoter (IL-4p) in NOD CD4 cells. Immunoblotting demonstrates that c-Maf can be modified at lysine 33 by SUMO-1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier 1). Sumoylation is facilitated by direct interaction with the E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and increases following T cell stimulation. In transfected cells, sumoylation decreases c-Maf transactivation of IL-4p-driven luciferase reporter activity, reduces c-Maf binding to the IL-4p in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, and enhances c-Maf localization into promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies. Sumoylation of c-Maf is increased in NOD CD4 cells as compared with CD4 cells from diabetes-resistant B10.D2 mice, suggesting that increased c-Maf sumoylation contributes to immune deviation in T1D by reducing c-Maf access to and transactivation of the IL-4 gene.","['Leavenworth, Jianmei W', 'Ma, Xiaojing', 'Mo, Yin-yuan', 'Pauza, Mary E']","['Leavenworth JW', 'Ma X', 'Mo YY', 'Pauza ME']","['Department of Medical Microbiology, Immunology, and Cell Biology, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL 62702, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090624,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,PMC2965337,2009/06/26 09:00,2009/09/16 06:00,['2009/06/26 09:00'],"['2009/06/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.0803671 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0803671 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2009 Jul 15;183(2):1110-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0803671.

Several proteins from Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) have been tested as putative POD-disrupting factors with negative results. Here, we show that LANA2, a viral protein that is absolutely required for the viability and proliferation of KSHV-infected primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells, increases the levels of SUMO2-ubiquitin-modified PML and induces the disruption of PODs by a proteasome-mediated mechanism. In addition, we demonstrate that this disruption is largely dependent on both the integrity of a SUMO interaction motif in LANA2 and the lysine 160 from PML. Moreover, silencing of LANA2 expression in PEL cells by RNA interference led to an increase in the PML levels. Finally, we demonstrate that LANA2 relieves PML-mediated transcriptional repression of survivin, a protein that directly contributes to malignant progression of PEL. This represents the first example of inactivation of these important antiviral structures by KSHV.","['Marcos-Villar, Laura', 'Lopitz-Otsoa, Fernando', 'Gallego, Pedro', 'Munoz-Fontela, Cesar', 'Gonzalez-Santamaria, Jose', 'Campagna, Michela', 'Shou-Jiang, Gao', 'Rodriguez, Manuel S', 'Rivas, Carmen']","['Marcos-Villar L', 'Lopitz-Otsoa F', 'Gallego P', 'Munoz-Fontela C', 'Gonzalez-Santamaria J', 'Campagna M', 'Shou-Jiang G', 'Rodriguez MS', 'Rivas C']","['Departamento Microbiologia II, Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Plaza Ramon y Cajal, 28040 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090624,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC2738140,2009/06/26 09:00,2009/09/01 06:00,['2009/06/26 09:00'],"['2009/06/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00339-09 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00339-09 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2009 Sep;83(17):8849-58. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00339-09.

Previously, it was demonstrated that phosphorylation of Rex-2, predominantly on serine residues, is correlated with an altered conformation, as observed by a gel mobility shift and the detection of two related protein species (p24(Rex) and p26(Rex)). Rex-2 phosphorylation is required for specific binding to its viral-mRNA target sequence and inhibition of mRNA splicing and may be linked to subcellular compartmentalization. Thus, the phosphorylation-induced structural state of Rex in the infected cell may be a switch that determines whether HTLV exists in a latent or productive state. We conducted a phosphoryl and functional mapping of both structural forms of mammalian-cell-expressed Rex 2 using affinity purification, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and site-directed substitutional mutational analysis. We identified two phosphorylation sites in p24(Rex) at Ser-117 and Thr-164. We also identified six phosphorylation sites in p26(Rex) at Thr-19, Ser-117, Ser-125, Ser-151, Ser-153, and Thr-164. We evaluated the functional significance of these phosphorylation events and found that phosphorylation on Thr-164, Ser-151, and Ser-153 is critical for Rex-2 function in vivo and that phosphorylation of Ser-151 is correlated with nuclear/nucleolar subcellular localization. Overall, this work is the first to completely map the phosphorylation sites in Rex-2 and provides important insight into the phosphorylation continuum that tightly regulates Rex-2 structure, cellular localization, and function.","['Kesic, Matthew', 'Ward, Michael', 'Semmes, O John', 'Green, Patrick L']","['Kesic M', 'Ward M', 'Semmes OJ', 'Green PL']","['Center for Retrovirus Research, Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090624,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC2738208,2009/06/26 09:00,2009/09/01 06:00,['2009/06/26 09:00'],"['2009/06/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00908-09 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00908-09 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2009 Sep;83(17):8859-68. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00908-09.

METHODS: Specimens of peripheral blood and bone marrow were obtained. By using several detect protocols, we found a novel BCR/ABL transcript in a patient with Ph-positive AMLL. The patient was treated with Imatinib and the aberrant BCR/ABL was quantitatively monitored to evaluate the clinical response. RESULTS: On admission, cytogenetic analysis showed Philadelphia-chromosome (Ph) positive in the specimens, but BCR/ABL e1a2, b2a2, and b3a2 were negative. Morphological analysis of the bone marrow showed the myeloid blast cells accounted for 66%, and immunophenotyping analysis showed 2 groups of aberrant blast cells: myeloid and B lineage. Chemical therapy and bone marrow transplantation failed to control the disease, and a novel BCR/ABL transcript (GenBank: EF423615) was found by using several detection protocols. The novel fusion protein showed a deletion of 10 amino acids and H893Q compared with the common BCR/ABL b2a2 fusion protein. The patient was then treated with imatinib and hematological remission was soon achieved, and 5 months after the imatinib treatment the quantity of the aberrant BCR/ABL was gradually decreased to negative. During the treatment the patient had discontinued the drug once and just then the aberrant BCR/ABL became positive soon. Imatinib was administered again and molecular remission was soon achieved for the second time. By continued therapy with imatinib, the patient got sustained and complete molecular remission lasting 12 months so far. CONCLUSION: The aberrant BCR/ABL may contribute to the clinical features of AMLL and the AMLL patients that have aberrant BCR/ABL may be sensitive to Imatinib.","['Liu, Hong-xing', 'Cao, Xing-yu', 'Tong, Chun-rong', 'Wu, Tong', 'Wang, Tong', 'Fan, Qiao-zhen', 'Wu, Ping', 'Zhang, Xian', 'Cai, Peng', 'Zhu, Ping']","['Liu HX', 'Cao XY', 'Tong CR', 'Wu T', 'Wang T', 'Fan QZ', 'Wu P', 'Zhang X', 'Cai P', 'Zhu P']","['Special Diagnosis Center, Daopei Hospital, Beijing 100049, China.']",['chi'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,,2009/06/26 09:00,2009/10/07 06:00,['2009/06/26 09:00'],"['2009/06/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/07 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Feb 3;89(4):220-3.,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Benzamides', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/blood/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we have evaluated the effect of melatonin on apoptosis in the human leukemia cell line HL-60. Melatonin treatment (1 mm) induced a significant increase in caspase-3 and -9 activities. The effect of melatonin on the activation of caspases was time dependent, reaching a maximum after 12 hr of stimulation, and then decreasing to a minimum after 72 hr. Treatment with melatonin also evoked mitochondrial membrane depolarization and permeability transition pore induction, which caused loss of mitochondrial staining by calcein, and increased cell death by apoptosis/necrosis as demonstrated by propidium iodide positive-staining of cells after 72 hr of stimulation. In addition, the exposure of cells to melatonin resulted in an activation and association of the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bid, as well as promoting detectable increases in the expression of both proteins. We conclude that melatonin has proapoptotic and/or oncostatic effects in the human myeloid cell line HL-60.","['Bejarano, Ignacio', 'Redondo, Pedro C', 'Espino, Javier', 'Rosado, Juan A', 'Paredes, Sergio D', 'Barriga, Carmen', 'Reiter, Russel J', 'Pariente, Jose A', 'Rodriguez, Ana B']","['Bejarano I', 'Redondo PC', 'Espino J', 'Rosado JA', 'Paredes SD', 'Barriga C', 'Reiter RJ', 'Pariente JA', 'Rodriguez AB']","['Department of Physiology, University of Extremadura, Badajoz, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090409,England,J Pineal Res,Journal of pineal research,8504412,,2009/06/26 09:00,2009/09/18 06:00,['2009/06/26 09:00'],"['2009/06/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['JPI675 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-079X.2009.00675.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Pineal Res. 2009 May;46(4):392-400. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-079X.2009.00675.x.

We describe here an improved test and report its use with samples from the Leukaemia Research Fund CLL4 randomised clinical trial and previously treated patients. ITRT was performed by the tumour response to anti-neoplastic compounds (TRAC) assay, a modification of the differential staining cytotoxicity (DiSC) assay. Improvements included drying drugs into wells before assay and using the Octospot system to cytocentrifuge eight spots of cells onto one microscope slide. We successfully tested 765/782 (98%) cellular blood samples received within 48 h of phlebotomy. Cross-resistance (Pearson's r > 0.7) in untreated CLL was found between similar drugs. Mitoxantrone (r = 0.31), cyclophosphamide (r = 0.35) and pentostatin (r = 0.29) had low cross-resistance with fludarabine. Treatment resulted in increased resistance to chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, corticosteroids, cladribine and fludarabine (P < 0.01) but not to pentostatin. These results provide further rationale for standard drug combinations such as fludarabine-mitoxantrone and fludarabine-mitoxantrone-cyclophosphamide and suggest possible pentostatin salvage in fludarabine-resistant patients. ITRT results could assist both in determining the best treatment for individual patients and in the design and rationale of future clinical trials.","['Bosanquet, Andrew G', 'Richards, Sue M', 'Wade, Rachel', 'Else, Monica', 'Matutes, Estella', 'Dyer, Martin J S', 'Rassam, Saad M B', 'Durant, Justin', 'Scadding, Sheila M', 'Raper, Steve L', 'Dearden, Claire E', 'Catovsky, Daniel']","['Bosanquet AG', 'Richards SM', 'Wade R', 'Else M', 'Matutes E', 'Dyer MJ', 'Rassam SM', 'Durant J', 'Scadding SM', 'Raper SL', 'Dearden CE', 'Catovsky D']","['Bath Cancer Research, Royal United Hospital, Bath BA1 3NG, UK. agbjh@scientist.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090622,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,2009/06/26 09:00,2009/09/11 06:00,['2009/06/26 09:00'],"['2009/06/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH7741 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07741.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Aug;146(4):384-95. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07741.x.

The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare neurocognitive changes in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after allogeneic HSCT or other therapies. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, serial evaluations of attention, concentration, memory, mood, and quality of life were used in a consecutive sample of 106 eligible patients who had CML (n = 91) or MDS (n = 15) at enrollment and then 12 months and 18 months after HSCT or other therapy. RESULTS: The 3 evaluations at enrollment, 12 months, and 18 months were completed by 98%, 95%, and 89% of surviving participants, respectively. Among all patients, there was significant improvement in memory over 18 months. For example, the 45 patients who underwent HSCT (42 patients with CML and 3 patients with MDS) compared favorably with the patients who received other treatment on most measures of neuropsychological function, except they had improved mental health (P = .034), worse physical function (P = .049), and more difficulty with coordination and fine motor speed bilaterally (dominant hand, P = .005; nondominant hand, P = .0019). Patients with CML overall had improved phonemic fluency (P = .014). CONCLUSIONS: The current study indicated that time and diagnosis may be important factors when assessing neurocognitive and other changes. Complaints regarding ""chemobrain"" after HSCT merit further study, because deficits actually may predate the initiation of treatment and subsequently may improve. The study results could reassure prospective HSCT recipients, because HSCT compared favorably with other treatments when mental status side effects were considered.","['Chang, Grace', 'Meadows, Mary-Ellen', 'Orav, E John', 'Antin, Joseph H']","['Chang G', 'Meadows ME', 'Orav EJ', 'Antin JH']","['Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. gchang@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,PMC2749960,2009/06/25 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/06/25 09:00'],"['2009/06/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.24496 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2009 Oct 1;115(19):4625-35. doi: 10.1002/cncr.24496.,,IM,"['Affect', 'Attention', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders/etiology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*psychology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Memory', '*Mental Health', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*psychology/*therapy', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Quality of Life', 'Time Factors']",,,"['K24 AA000289/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 AA000289-08/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS140680'],,,,,,,,['2009 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 3770 consecutive solid tumor patients with a white blood cell count>40,000/microL were retrospectively identified over a 3-year period (2005-2008). Those patients without a secondary cause of their leukocytosis were defined as having a paraneoplastic leukemoid reaction. RESULTS: A total of 758 (20%) patients with solid tumors and extreme leukocytosis were identified. The etiology of the leukocytosis was hematopoietic growth factors in 522 (69%) patients, infection in 112 (15%) patients, high-dose corticosteroids in 38 (5%) patients, newly diagnosed leukemia in 9 (1%) patients, and paraneoplastic leukemoid reaction in 77 (10%) patients. The patients diagnosed with a paraneoplastic leukemoid reaction typically had neutrophil predominance (96%) and radiographic evidence of metastatic disease (78%), were clinically stable, and had a poor prognosis; 78% either died or were discharged to hospice within 12 weeks of their initial extreme leukocyte count. All of the 8 (10%) patients who survived>1 year received effective antineoplastic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Infection was an uncommon cause of extreme leukocytosis in patients with solid tumors. Patients with paraneoplastic leukemoid reactions typically were clinically stable despite having large tumor burdens. However, clinical outcomes were poor unless effective antineoplastic treatment was received.","['Granger, John M', 'Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P']","['Granger JM', 'Kontoyiannis DP']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas M.

Although cell engineering strategies utilizing the overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) potently inhibit apoptosis, no studies have examined the use of the Bcl-2 family protein, Mcl-1, in commercial mammalian cell culture processes. Here, we overexpress both the wild type Mcl-1 protein and a Mcl-1 mutant protein that is not degraded by the proteasome in a serum-free Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line producing a therapeutic antibody. The expression of Mcl-1 led to increased viabilities in fed-batch culture, with cell lines expressing the Mcl-1 mutant maintaining approximately 90% viability after 14 days when compared with 65% for control cells. In addition to enhanced culture viability, Mcl-1-expressing cell lines were isolated that consistently showed increases in antibody production of 20-35% when compared with control cultures. The quality of the antibody product was not affected in the Mcl-1-expressing cell lines, and Mcl-1-expressing cells exhibited 3-fold lower caspase-3 activation when compared with the control cell lines. Altogether, the expression of Mcl-1 represents a promising alternative cell engineering strategy to delay apoptosis and increase recombinant protein production in CHO cells.","['Majors, Brian S', 'Betenbaugh, Michael J', 'Pederson, Nels E', 'Chiang, Gisela G']","['Majors BS', 'Betenbaugh MJ', 'Pederson NE', 'Chiang GG']","['Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Biotechnol Prog,Biotechnology progress,8506292,,2009/06/25 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/06/25 09:00'],"['2009/06/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/btpr.192 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Prog. 2009 Jul-Aug;25(4):1161-8. doi: 10.1002/btpr.192.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/genetics/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Survival', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

Studies suggesting similar associations in leukaemia have been small and underpowered. We have conducted a large population-based case-control study to determine whether the use of NSAIDs is associated with a reduced risk of acute and chronic leukaemias, and whether their use has any impact on survival in these patients. METHODS: We identified all the incident cases of leukaemia in 'The Health Improvement Network' (THIN) general practice dataset, along with at least four matched controls per case. We used conditional logistic regression to determine odds ratios for NSAID prescription rates and the risk of developing several leukaemia sub-types. We then used Cox regression to determine the association between NSAID prescription rate and risk of death in leukaemia. Hazard ratios were adjusted for gender, age at diagnosis, smoking status and Townsend Score. RESULTS: The risk of leukaemia overall appears to increase marginally with increased use of NSAIDs prior to diagnosis. This is not seen when individual leukaemia sub-types are examined, however, except perhaps in CLL where patients who had received 2-5 prescriptions/year are 34% more likely to be diagnosed with CLL than those who had not had any NSAID prescriptions (O.R. 1.34, p = 0.03, 95% C.I. 1.02-1.74). There was no statistically significant association between exposure to NSAIDs prior to leukaemia diagnosis and survival. CONCLUSION: The use of NSAIDs does not reduce the risk of developing leukaemia, nor do they improve survival.","['Bhayat, F', 'Das-Gupta, E', 'Smith, C', 'Hubbard, R']","['Bhayat F', 'Das-Gupta E', 'Smith C', 'Hubbard R']","['Division of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Nottingham, UK. mcxfb1@exmail.nottingham.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf,Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,9208369,,2009/06/25 09:00,2009/11/11 06:00,['2009/06/25 09:00'],"['2009/06/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pds.1789 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf. 2009 Sep;18(9):833-6. doi: 10.1002/pds.1789.,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Risk Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dose-effect relationships for tumours of the brain, skin, thyroid, and other sites of the head region, leukaemia, and cataracts are taken from the literature. On the basis of estimates for Germany about the number of head scans, the annual rate of radiation-induced diseases is calculated. 1,000 annual paediatric CT investigations of the skull will lead to about 3 excess neoplasms in the head region, i.e., the probability of an induced late effect must be suspected in the range of some thousandths. Additionally, a relevant increase of cataracts must be considered. The radiation-induced occurrence of meningiomas and other brain tumours most probably contributes to the continuously increasing incidence of these diseases which is observed in several industrial nations, as well as the exposure of the bone marrow by CT to the increase of childhood leukaemia.","['Schmitz-Feuerhake, I', 'Pflugbeil, S', 'Pflugbeil, C']","['Schmitz-Feuerhake I', 'Pflugbeil S', 'Pflugbeil C']",['ingesf@uni-bremen.de'],['ger'],['Journal Article'],20090623,Germany,Gesundheitswesen,Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany)),9204210,,2009/06/25 09:00,2010/09/29 06:00,['2009/06/25 09:00'],"['2009/06/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0029-1215570 [doi]'],ppublish,Gesundheitswesen. 2010 Apr;72(4):246-54. doi: 10.1055/s-0029-1215570.

Investigation of the toxic potential of the alkaloids on HL-60 and HL-60/MX1 showed a significantly higher effect against HL-60/MX1, a multidrug-resistant cell line, compared with the control etoposide (p < 0.05). In all cytotoxicity experiments, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were used as a control for normal hematopoietic cells. Flow cytometry analysis of the compounds resulted in the arrest of cell cycle progression at the sub-G1 phase of the RAJI and Jurkat cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. According to computational analyses, the similar cytotoxic trend in the cell lines could be indicative of the fact that these compounds may act through parallel mechanisms.","['Varamini, Pegah', 'Javidnia, Katayoun', 'Soltani, Mohammad', 'Mehdipour, Ahmad Reza', 'Ghaderi, Abbas']","['Varamini P', 'Javidnia K', 'Soltani M', 'Mehdipour AR', 'Ghaderi A']","['Shiraz Institute for Cancer Research, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090623,Germany,Planta Med,Planta medica,0066751,,2009/06/25 09:00,2010/04/03 06:00,['2009/06/25 09:00'],"['2009/06/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0029-1185807 [doi]'],ppublish,Planta Med. 2009 Nov;75(14):1509-16. doi: 10.1055/s-0029-1185807.

In this study, a triple-regulated conditionally replicating adenoviruses (CRAd) carrying PDCD5 gene expression cassette, SG611-PDCD5, was engineered. In SG611-PDCD5, the E1a gene with a deletion of 24 nucleotides within CR2 region is controlled under the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter, the E1b gene expression is directed by the hypoxia response element (HRE), whereas the PDCD5 gene is controlled by the cytomegalovirus promoter. The tumor-selective replication of this virus and its antitumor efficacy were characterized in several leukemic cell lines in vitro and in xenograft models of human leukemic cell line in nude mice. It was found by RQ-RT-PCR assay that SG611-PDCD5 expressed PDCD5 efficiently in leukemic cells. In K562 tumor xenograft models, SG611-PDCD5 displayed a tumor killing capacity. At a dose of 1 x 10(9) plaque-forming units, SG611-PDCD5 alone could completely inhibit the tumor growth and more effective than replication-defective Ad-PDCD5. Histopathologic examination revealed that SG611-PDCD5 administration resulted in leukemic cell apoptosis. We concluded that the triple-regulated SG611-PDCD5, as a more potent and safer antitumor therapeutic, could provide a new strategy for leukemia biotherapy.","['Xie, Min', 'Niu, Ji-Hong', 'Chang, Yan', 'Qian, Qi-Jun', 'Wu, Hong-Ping', 'Li, Lin-Fang', 'Zhang, Yao', 'Li, Jin-Lan', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun', 'Ruan, Guo-Rui']","['Xie M', 'Niu JH', 'Chang Y', 'Qian QJ', 'Wu HP', 'Li LF', 'Zhang Y', 'Li JL', 'Huang XJ', 'Ruan GR']","[""Peking University People's Hospital and Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,,2009/06/25 09:00,2009/10/22 06:00,['2009/06/25 09:00'],"['2009/06/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-009-0373-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2009 Sep;14(9):1086-94. doi: 10.1007/s10495-009-0373-3.,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PDCD5 protein, human)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Oncolytic Virotherapy', 'Oncolytic Viruses/*genetics', 'Transgenes', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The predominant mechanisms are death ligand-induced signaling mainly by TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) mediated by CD4 T cells, monocytes and dendritic cells, and perforin/granzyme mediated apoptosis mediated by CD8 T cells and NK cells. Resistance against TRAIL involves loss of TRAIL death receptors and/or activation of the MEK and/or Akt signal pathways. Resistance to CD8 CTL responses also involves activation of the MEK and/or Akt pathways. Apoptosis induced by immune responses is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins. Many reagents have been developed against the Bcl-2 antiapoptotic proteins and clinical trials combining them with immunotherapy are awaited. The second group of agents that regulate the Bcl-2 family of proteins are the signal pathway inhibitors. Clinical trials with inhibitors of RAS, RAF or MEK are in progress and would appear an exciting combination with immunotherapy. One of the main drivers of resistance to apoptosis are adaptive mechanisms that allow cancer cells to overcome endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. These adaptive mechanisms inhibit practically all known apoptotic pathways and create an acidic environment that may reduce infiltration of lymphocytes against the tumor. The signal pathway inhibitors may be effective against these adaptive processes but additional agents that target ER stress pathways are in development. In conclusion, combination of immunotherapy with agents that target antiapoptotic mechanisms in cancer cells offers a new approach that requires evaluation in clinical trials.","['Hersey, Peter', 'Zhang, Xu Dong']","['Hersey P', 'Zhang XD']","['Oncology and Immunology Unit, Calvary Mater Newcastle Hospital, Room 443, David Maddison Clinical Sciences Building, Cnr.

The findings indicate that few of the women had biomedically accurate concepts of anemia, such as that it was due to lack of iron from poor eating. Others held folk medical beliefs including home remedies, for example drinking the milk of a mare or beet juice and eating certain foods such as bean soup. Most of the women did not know any symptoms of anemia and a few reported that it can develop into leukemia.

METHODS: A total of 26 adult acute leukemia patients (mean age 46.2 -/+ 12.4 years, 15 males) treated with 2-6 cycles of anthracycline-based chemotherapy (CT) were studied. Cardiac evaluation was performed at the baseline (before CT), after first CT, after last CT (cumulative anthracycline dose 464.3 -/+ 117.5 mg/m2) and circa 6 months after CT. Time ECG parameters, QRS voltage, presence of repolarization changes, arrhythmias and other abnormalities were evaluated. RESULTS: During treatment and follow-up, we found a statistical significant QTc interval prolongation - 414.7 -/+ 16.0 ms (before CT), 419.6 -/+ 21.6 ms (after first CT), 428.0 -/+ 16.2 ms (after last CT) and 430.1 -/+ 18.4 ms (6 months after CT). Significant QTc interval prolongation (> 450 ms) occurred in 3 patients after first CT, in 4 patients after last CT and in 5 patients within 6 months after CT. Significant total QRS voltage lowering in the limb leads (> 1.0 mV versus before CT) occurred in 3 patients after first CT, in 5 patients after last CT and in 6 patients within 6 months after CT. We found a statistically significant correlation between decreased QRS voltage, QTc interval prolongation and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction on ECHO. Repolarization changes associated with oncology treatment were present in 9 patients within 6 months after CT. CONCLUSION: Anthracycline treatment is associated with changes in electrical activity of the myocardium. Prolonged QTc interval represents a risk for development of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Decreased QRS voltage and prolonged QTc interval after anthracycline treatment could correlate with LV dysfunction on ECHO. Further studies will be needed to prove whether these ECG changes could serve as an accessible and non-invasive screening method indicating LV dysfunction after anthracycline treatment.","['Horacek, J M', 'Jakl, M', 'Horackova, J', 'Pudil, R', 'Jebavy, L', 'Maly, J']","['Horacek JM', 'Jakl M', 'Horackova J', 'Pudil R', 'Jebavy L', 'Maly J']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Military Health Sciences, University of Defence, Hradec Kralove 500 01, Czech Republic. jan.hor@post.cz']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,,2009/06/25 09:00,2009/08/20 09:00,['2009/06/25 09:00'],"['2009/06/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/20 09:00 [medline]']",['39/759 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2009 Jun;31(2):115-7.,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anthracyclines/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Arrhythmias, Cardiac/chemically induced/*diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', '*Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Individual-locus effects and their epistatic effects on susceptibility to VaD were simultaneously assessed by multifactor dimensionality reduction and entropy-based method. The 23 loci in 12 genes were studied in 207 VaD patients and age-matched and sex-matched 207 controls. RESULTS: The multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis revealed that the best single-locus candidate model included angiotensinogen (AGT) Thr235Met with testing accuracy (TA) of 58.31%, the best two-locus candidate model included AGT Thr235Met and transforming growth factor-beta1 Pro10Leu with TA of 58.06%, the best three-locus candidate model was not significant (P>0.05), and the best four-locus candidate model included transforming growth factor-beta1 Pro10Leu, AGT Thr235Met, sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 G34995T, and leukemia inhibitory factor T4524G with TA of 57.13% (P<0.05). The best four-locus model was, however, still in question because of the inconsistent best model selection by cross-validation. Synergistic epistatic effect of the best two-locus model was proven by entropy-based estimation. CONCLUSION: The best predictor for genetic susceptibility to VaD was the single-locus model of AGT. The best two-locus model reflecting epistasis would be also employed for predicting its susceptibility. Further studies on the epistasis are to elucidate their underlying mechanisms.","['Kim, Younyoung', 'Park, Jungdae', 'Lee, Chaeyoung']","['Kim Y', 'Park J', 'Lee C']","['Department of Bioinformatics and Life Science, Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Psychiatr Genet,Psychiatric genetics,9106748,,2009/06/25 09:00,2010/02/10 06:00,['2009/06/25 09:00'],"['2009/06/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/YPG.0b013e32832ceebd [doi]'],ppublish,Psychiatr Genet. 2009 Oct;19(5):253-8. doi: 10.1097/YPG.0b013e32832ceebd.,"['0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/genetics', 'Dementia, Vascular/*genetics', 'Entropy', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', '*Models, Genetic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia occurs most commonly in the first cycle of treatment. Older patients, patients with multiple comorbidities, and those receiving more myelotoxic drugs are prone to develop neutropenia and its complications. Current guidelines recommend the prophylactic use of the myeloid growth factors for the first cycle of chemotherapy for patients with more than a 20% risk of febrile neutropenia. Meta analysis from randomized trials shows that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor prophylaxis is associated with patients receiving more intensive chemotherapy, having better survival, but also having a higher risk of secondary acute myeloid leukemia. Antibiotics are standard treatment of febrile neutropenia and are increasingly used for prophylaxis in 'low-risk' patients. SUMMARY: The myeloid growth factor granulocyte colony-stimulating factor has radically changed our approach to the prevention of febrile neutropenia. Antibiotics remain the mainstay of treatment of febrile neutropenia.","['Dale, David C']",['Dale DC'],"['Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA. dcdale@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Support Palliat Care,Current opinion in supportive and palliative care,101297402,PMC3390973,2009/06/25 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/06/25 09:00'],"['2009/06/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/SPC.0b013e32832ea6ae [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Support Palliat Care. 2009 Sep;3(3):207-12. doi: 10.1097/SPC.0b013e32832ea6ae.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Comorbidity', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/complications/*drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/*chemically induced/drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Risk Factors']",,,"['R24 AI049393/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 AI049393-09/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS202938'],48,,,,,,,,,,,,,
