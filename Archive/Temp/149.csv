These IgMs were isolated and used to demonstrate a crossreactivity against both hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 antigen and the Fc portion of IgG. Epitopes were identified in a fraction of exemplary samples by using epitope excision approach (NS(31250-1334) and IgG Fc(345-355)). The same phenomenon of crossreactivity has been shown to occur in vivo after immunization of a mouse with the NS3(1251-1270) peptide. To verify if the same reaction was also present in MC samples characterized by an oligo/polyclonal B-cell proliferation, IgM crossreactivity was tested in 14 additional samples. Five out of the 14 were reactive against HCV NS3 and 11 out of 14 were reactive against IgG-Fc peptide. The data support the role of HCV NS3 antigen in a subset of patients with MC, whereas the high frequency of the IgG-Fc epitope suggests that these B cells originate from precursors strongly selected for auto-IgG specificity. We suggest that engagement of specific BCRs by NS3 (or NS3-immunocomplex) antigen could explain the prevalence of IgM cryoglobulins in these patients.","['De Re, V', 'Sansonno, D', 'Simula, M P', 'Caggiari, L', 'Gasparotto, D', 'Fabris, M', 'Tucci, F A', 'Racanelli, V', 'Talamini, R', 'Campagnolo, M', 'Geremia, S', 'Dammacco, F', 'De Vita, S']","['De Re V', 'Sansonno D', 'Simula MP', 'Caggiari L', 'Gasparotto D', 'Fabris M', 'Tucci FA', 'Racanelli V', 'Talamini R', 'Campagnolo M', 'Geremia S', 'Dammacco F', 'De Vita S']","['Division of Experimental Oncology I, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, IRCCS-National Cancer Institute, Aviano, Pordenone, Italy. vdere@cro.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (NS3 protein, hepatitis C virus)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Viral Nonstructural Proteins)', '9009-79-4 (Rheumatoid Factor)']",IM,"['Clone Cells', 'Cryoglobulinemia/*classification/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/drug effects/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology', 'Rheumatoid Factor/drug effects/immunology', 'Viral Nonstructural Proteins/*immunology/pharmacology']",2006/04/18 09:00,2006/10/31 09:00,['2006/04/18 09:00'],"['2006/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404201 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404201 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Jun;20(6):1145-54. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404201.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, several studies demonstrated the activation of PI3K in the nuclei of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) - differentiated HL-60 cells, raising the possibility that PI3K/Akt-inhibitors may block antitumor properties of retinoids. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible activation of nuclear Akt in ATRA-treated cells and to test the effects of Akt-inhibitors on ATRA-mediated differentiation. The Akt-activity was found to be increased in the nuclei and lysates of ATRA-differentiated HL-60 and NB4 cells. The down-modulation of the expression of Akt protein in HL-60 cells using siRNA reduces the CD11b expression in ATRA-treated cells. The treatment of both cell lines with the commercially available Akt inhibitors inhibited the growth of both control and ATRA-treated cells. Akt-inhibitors had no inhibitory effects on ATRA-mediated growth arrest and the expression of CD11b in HL-60 cells, but increased the percentage of control cells expressing CD11b. In contrast, the presence of Akt inhibitors reduced the expression of CD11b in ATRA-treated NB4 cells.","['Matkovic, K', 'Brugnoli, F', 'Bertagnolo, V', 'Banfic, H', 'Visnjic, D']","['Matkovic K', 'Brugnoli F', 'Bertagnolo V', 'Banfic H', 'Visnjic D']","['Department of Physiology and Croatian Institute for Brain Research, School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['CD11b Antigen/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tretinoin/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology']",2006/04/18 09:00,2006/10/31 09:00,['2006/04/18 09:00'],"['2006/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404204 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404204 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Jun;20(6):941-51. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404204.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 5/7 patients with unbalanced translocations, DNA sequences were overrepresented at band 6p21 as either cryptic duplications (three patients) or cryptic low-copy gains (two patients). In the eight patients with cytogenetic or cryptic 6p gains, we identified a common overrepresented region extending for 5-6 megabases from the TNF gene to the ETV-7 gene. 6p abnormalities were isolated karyotype changes in four patients.

The objective of this Phase I study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, biologic activity and pharmacologic profile of PTK/ZK administered orally, twice daily, on a continuous dosing schedule in patients with primary refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), secondary AML, poor-prognosis de novo AML or advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Acute myeloid leukemia patients for whom PTK/ZK monotherapy was ineffective could receive PTK/ZK combined with standard induction chemotherapy. Sixty-three patients received PTK/ZK at doses of 500-1000 mg orally b.i.d. Safety and pharmacokinetic data were collected. Responses were evaluated according to standard bone marrow and peripheral blood criteria. At 1000 mg b.i.d., dose-limiting toxicities of lethargy, hypertension, nausea, emesis and anorexia were observed. Other adverse events related to PTK/ZK were dizziness, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea and pruritus; these were generally mild and reversible. Pharmacokinetic data showed that steady state was reached by day 14, there was no accumulation with repeat dosing and there was no significant increase in exposure at steady state beyond the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Complete remission was observed in five of 17 AML patients treated with PTK/ZK combined with chemotherapy. In conclusion, the MTD of PTK/ZK is 750 mg orally b.i.d. The drug is generally well tolerated and can be given in combination with chemotherapy for patients with MDS and AML.","['Roboz, G J', 'Giles, F J', 'List, A F', 'Cortes, J E', 'Carlin, R', 'Kowalski, M', 'Bilic, S', 'Masson, E', 'Rosamilia, M', 'Schuster, M W', 'Laurent, D', 'Feldman, E J']","['Roboz GJ', 'Giles FJ', 'List AF', 'Cortes JE', 'Carlin R', 'Kowalski M', 'Bilic S', 'Masson E', 'Rosamilia M', 'Schuster MW', 'Laurent D', 'Feldman EJ']","['Leukemia Program, Weill Medical College of Cornell University/The New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA. gar2001@med.cornell.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Phthalazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '5DX9U76296 (vatalanib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Phthalazines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyridines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/antagonists & inhibitors']",2006/04/18 09:00,2006/10/31 09:00,['2006/04/18 09:00'],"['2006/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404213 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404213 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Jun;20(6):952-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404213.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are essential in the host defense against infections and today 10 human TLRs (TLR1-TLR10) and one TLR-homolog (RP105) have been characterized. B cells express several TLRs (mainly TLR1, 6, 7, 9, 10 and RP105) and TLR-initiated responses in B cells include proliferation, anti-apoptosis effect and plasma cell (PC) differentiation. The present study was designed to analyze the role of TLRs in MM. We show that frequent expressions of TLRs were detected in cell lines from MM patients (minimum six TLRs in each). In comparison, only few TLRs (mainly TLR1 and or RP105) were found expressed in PCs from BM of healthy donors. In addition, TLR-specific ligands induce increased proliferation and survival of the MM cell lines, partially due to an autocrine interleukin-6 production. Importantly, we demonstrate that also PC from MM patients proliferates in response to TLR-specific ligands. In conclusion, TLR-ligands may contribute to increased growth and survival of MM cells in MM patients.","['Bohnhorst, J', 'Rasmussen, T', 'Moen, S H', 'Flottum, M', 'Knudsen, L', 'Borset, M', 'Espevik, T', 'Sundan, A']","['Bohnhorst J', 'Rasmussen T', 'Moen SH', 'Flottum M', 'Knudsen L', 'Borset M', 'Espevik T', 'Sundan A']","['Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway. janne.bohnhorst@ntnu.no']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CPG-oligonucleotide)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Syndecans)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', '112208-00-1', '(N-palmitoyl-S-(2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)propyl)cysteinyl-seryl-lysyl-lysyl-lysyl-lys', 'ine)', '12777-81-0 (Flagellin)', '98598-79-9 (2,3-bis-(palmitoyloxy)-2-propyl-N-palmitoyl-cysteinylserine)', 'DZX5IUA94D (macrophage stimulatory lipopeptide 2)', 'O84C90HH2L (Poly I-C)', 'V3DMU7PVXF (resiquimod)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/immunology', 'Dipeptides/pharmacology', 'Flagellin/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Ligands', 'Lipopeptides', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lipoproteins/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/drug effects/immunology', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/*immunology', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Poly I-C/pharmacology', 'Proteoglycans/drug effects/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Syndecans', 'Toll-Like Receptors/drug effects/genetics/*immunology']",2006/04/18 09:00,2006/10/31 09:00,['2006/04/18 09:00'],"['2006/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404225 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404225 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Jun;20(6):1138-44. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404225.,,,['Leukemia. 2006 Jun;20(6):937-8.

The development of resistance upon continuous administration of imatinib mesylate is associated with poor prognosis pointing to the need for alternative therapeutic strategies and a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression. To identify transcriptional signatures that may explain pathological characteristics and aggressive behavior of BP blasts, we performed comparative gene expression profiling on CD34+ Ph+ cells purified from patients with untreated newly diagnosed chronic phase CML (CP, n=11) and from patients in BP (n=9) using Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays. Supervised microarray data analysis revealed 114 differentially expressed genes (P<10(-4)), 34 genes displaying more than two-fold transcriptional changes when comparing CP and BP groups. While 24 of these genes were downregulated, 10 genes, especially suppressor of cytokine signalling 2 (SOCS2), CAMPATH-1 antigen (CD52), and four human leukocyte antigen-related genes were strongly overexpressed in BP. Expression of selected genes was validated by real-time-polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry. Our data suggest the existence of a common gene expression profile of CML-BP and provide new insight into the molecular phenotype of blasts associated with disease progression and high malignancy.","['Zheng, C', 'Li, L', 'Haak, M', 'Brors, B', 'Frank, O', 'Giehl, M', 'Fabarius, A', 'Schatz, M', 'Weisser, A', 'Lorentz, C', 'Gretz, N', 'Hehlmann, R', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Seifarth, W']","['Zheng C', 'Li L', 'Haak M', 'Brors B', 'Frank O', 'Giehl M', 'Fabarius A', 'Schatz M', 'Weisser A', 'Lorentz C', 'Gretz N', 'Hehlmann R', 'Hochhaus A', 'Seifarth W']","['III.

A noteworthy feature of this virus (referred to as SRS MuLV here) induces tumors of multiple hematopoietic lineages, including myeloid, erythroid, T-lymphoid and B-lymphoid. To identify the determinants of disease specificity, chimeras between SRS and Moloney MuLV (M-MuLV) were generated by molecular cloning, and the pathogenic properties of the chimeras were investigated. The results indicated that, while the M-MuLV LTR can confer lymphoid specificity to SRS MuLV, the SRS LTR by itself was not sufficient to confer multiple lineage tumorigenesis to M-MuLV; additional sequences in gag or pol were also required. Thus, a secondary determinant for myeloid/erythroid leukemia in SRS MuLV is located in gag-pol. In these chimeras, an independent determinant for T-lymphoma was found in M-MuLV gag-pol. It was also interesting that insertion of M-MuLV env into SRS MuLV decreased the rate of leukemogenicity, while insertion of SRS env into M-MuLV (SEM) accelerated leukemogenesis. The enhanced pathogenicity of SEM was found to correlate with earlier formation of MCF recombinants. The basis for the accelerated MCF recombinant formation was investigated. The endogenous polytropic MuLV env sequences contributing to several SEM MCF recombinants were identified, and the cross-over points were identified. While no obvious differences in the relative homologies between SRS MuLV env and polytropic env vs. M-MuLV and polytropic envs suggested a reason for the more rapid MCF recombinant formation, an overlapping but different set of polytropic env proviruses were found to participate in MCF formation for M-MuLV vs. SEM. Thus, the mechanisms for MCF formation appear to differ for M-MuLV and SEM.","['Jahid, Sohail', 'Bundy, Linda M', 'Granger, Steven W', 'Fan, Hung']","['Jahid S', 'Bundy LM', 'Granger SW', 'Fan H']","['Cancer Research Institute, Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/virology', 'DNA, Recombinant/*genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Genes, Viral/*genetics', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/*physiology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*virology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Spleen/virology', 'Thymus Gland/virology', 'Time Factors']",2006/04/18 09:00,2006/09/07 09:00,['2006/04/18 09:00'],"['2005/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/19 00:00 [revised]', '2006/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(06)00166-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2006.03.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2006 Jul 20;351(1):7-17. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2006.03.010.

We have investigated podoplanin function in cultured human breast cancer cells, in a mouse model of pancreatic beta cell carcinogenesis, and in human cancer biopsies. Our results indicate that podoplanin promotes tumor cell invasion in vitro and in vivo. Notably, the expression and subcellular localization of epithelial markers are unaltered, and mesenchymal markers are not induced in invasive podoplanin-expressing tumor cells. Rather, podoplanin induces collective cell migration by filopodia formation via the downregulation of the activities of small Rho family GTPases. In conclusion, podoplanin induces an alternative pathway of tumor cell invasion in the absence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).","['Wicki, Andreas', 'Lehembre, Francois', 'Wick, Nikolaus', 'Hantusch, Brigitte', 'Kerjaschki, Dontscho', 'Christofori, Gerhard']","['Wicki A', 'Lehembre F', 'Wick N', 'Hantusch B', 'Kerjaschki D', 'Christofori G']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Genetics, Department of Clinical-Biological Sciences, Center of Biomedicine, University of Basel, 4058 Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Cell,Cancer cell,101130617,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETV5 protein, human)', '0 (Etv5 protein, mouse)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Gp38 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Organic Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (PDPN protein, human)', '0 (Ralbp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (solute carrier family 22 (organic cation transporter), member 3)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Actins/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cadherins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cytoskeleton/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mesoderm/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/genetics/pathology', 'Organic Cation Transport Proteins/metabolism', 'Pseudopodia/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",2006/04/18 09:00,2006/05/17 09:00,['2006/04/18 09:00'],"['2005/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2006/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1535-6108(06)00086-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ccr.2006.03.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Cell. 2006 Apr;9(4):261-72. doi: 10.1016/j.ccr.2006.03.010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LMO2 comprises two protein-binding LIM domains that allow LMO2 to interact with multiple protein partners, including LIM domain-binding protein 1 (Ldb1, also known as CLIM2 and NLI), an essential cofactor for LMO proteins. Sequestration of Ldb1 by LMO2 in T-cells may prevent it binding other key partners, such as LMO4. Here, we show using protein engineering and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methodologies that LMO2 binds Ldb1 with a twofold lower affinity than does LMO4. Thus, excess LMO2 rather than an intrinsically higher binding affinity would lead to sequestration of Ldb1. Both LIM domains of LMO2 are required for high-affinity binding to Ldb1 (K(D) = 2.0 x 10(-8) M). However, the first LIM domain of LMO2 is primarily responsible for binding to Ldb1 (K(D) = 2.3 x 10(-7) M), whereas the second LIM domain increases binding by an order of magnitude. We used mutagenesis in combination with yeast two-hybrid analysis, and phage display selection to identify LMO2-binding ""hot spots"" within Ldb1 that locate to the LIM1-binding region. The delineation of this region reveals some specific differences when compared to the equivalent LMO4:Ldb1 interaction that hold promise for the development of reagents to specifically bind LMO2 in the treatment of leukemia.","['Ryan, Daniel P', 'Sunde, Margaret', 'Kwan, Ann H-Y', 'Marianayagam, Neelan J', 'Nancarrow, Amy L', 'Vanden Hoven, Rachel N', 'Thompson, Lyndal S', 'Baca, Manuel', 'Mackay, Joel P', 'Visvader, Jane E', 'Matthews, Jacqueline M']","['Ryan DP', 'Sunde M', 'Kwan AH', 'Marianayagam NJ', 'Nancarrow AL', 'Vanden Hoven RN', 'Thompson LS', 'Baca M', 'Mackay JP', 'Visvader JE', 'Matthews JM']","['School of Molecular and Microbial Biosciences, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LDB1 protein, human)', '0 (LHX1 protein, human)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LIM-Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (LMO4 protein, human)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'LIM-Homeodomain Proteins', 'Metalloproteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Conformation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",2006/04/18 09:00,2006/07/14 09:00,['2006/04/18 09:00'],"['2006/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2006/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(06)00289-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2006.02.074 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2006 May 26;359(1):66-75. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2006.02.074.

METHODS: We performed a computer-assisted (MEDLINE, National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD) search of the literature from 1966 to 2003 to identify all cases of malignancies having aPL. RESULTS: One hundred twenty patients were found. The mean age was 56+/-17 years (range 5 to 88). Sixty-two (52%) patients were men and 58 (48%) were women. A heterogeneous group of malignancies were found. Regarding hematological malignancies, 10 (8%) patients suffered from B-cell lymphoma, 8 (7%) from spleen lymphoma, 7 (6%) from chronic myeloid leukemia, and 6 (5%) from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Regarding solid tumors, renal cell carcinoma was diagnosed in 7 (6%) patients, primary tumor with unknown origin in 7 (6%), lung adenocarcinoma in 6 (5%), breast carcinoma in 6 (5%), and melanoma in 6 (5%). The main aPL-related manifestations were thrombocytopenia (25%), cerebrovascular accidents (24%), deep vein thrombosis (19%), pulmonary embolism (15%), and heart valve lesions (9%). In 17 cases, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome was considered to be triggered by the malignancy. Seventy-one (63%) of 113 patients recovered or are still alive after cancer treatment. Twenty-three (35%) of 65 patients achieved aPL remission after proper treatment of the malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to bear in mind, especially in elderly patients, that thrombotic events associated with aPL can be the first manifestation of malignancy. At the same time, the presence of aPL in patients with malignancies has important implications in their treatment and prognosis.","['Gomez-Puerta, Jose A', 'Cervera, Ricard', 'Espinosa, Gerard', 'Aguilo, Sira', 'Bucciarelli, Silvia', 'Ramos-Casals, Manuel', 'Ingelmo, Miguel', 'Asherson, Ronald A', 'Font, Josep']","['Gomez-Puerta JA', 'Cervera R', 'Espinosa G', 'Aguilo S', 'Bucciarelli S', 'Ramos-Casals M', 'Ingelmo M', 'Asherson RA', 'Font J']","['Department of Autoimmune Diseases, Institut Clinic de Medicina i Dermatologia (ICMiD), Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Arthritis Rheum,Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism,1306053,"['0 (Antibodies, Antiphospholipid)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Antiphospholipid/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis']",2006/04/18 09:00,2006/09/28 09:00,['2006/04/18 09:00'],"['2006/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0049-0172(05)00130-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.semarthrit.2005.07.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Arthritis Rheum. 2006 Apr;35(5):322-32. doi: 10.1016/j.semarthrit.2005.07.003.,,,,,,,107,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sjogren's syndrome may not be diagnosed unless specifically looked for. We set to determine the prevalence of Sjogren's syndrome in LGL leukemia and its cytokine profile. METHODS: Every patient with a confirmed diagnosis of LGL leukemia diagnosed at a single academic medical center over the last 15 years was evaluated for Sjogren's syndrome by questioning about sicca symptoms. In symptomatic patients, Schirmer's test, rose bengal corneal staining, salivary flow rate measurement, autoantibody screening, and minor salivary gland biopsy were performed. Supernatants obtained from T-LGL leukemic cells following phytohemagglutinin (PHA) activation were analyzed for cytokine production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and patients with or without Sjogren's syndrome were compared with controls. RESULTS: Of 48 patients, 21 reported sicca symptoms and were enrolled in the study. In 8 patients Sjogren's syndrome was ruled out. Thirteen patients had clear evidence of Sjogren's syndrome according to accepted criteria (27%). None had rheumatoid arthritis, but 1 had limited scleroderma. Thus, 12/48 patients had primary Sjogren's syndrome. Other autoimmune diseases were frequently present, in particular, immune cytopenias (n=7) or thyroid autoimmunity (n=6). Supernatants of T-LGL leukemia cells incubated with PHA revealed markedly increased levels of multiple cytokines (especially soluble interleukin 2 receptor, tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-6, IL-8) compared with healthy controls. However, this increase was common to LGL leukemia patients with or without Sjogren's syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Sjogren's syndrome was commonly identified in the patients with T-cell LGL leukemia in this study. Upregulated cytokine production by the neoplastic cells may underlie some of the immune-mediated disorders common in these patients.","['Friedman, Joshua', 'Schattner, Ami', 'Shvidel, Lev', 'Berrebi, Alain']","['Friedman J', 'Schattner A', 'Shvidel L', 'Berrebi A']","['Kaplan Medical Center, Rehovot and Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel. as655@medschl.cam.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Semin Arthritis Rheum,Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism,1306053,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Autoantibodies/immunology', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*epidemiology/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', ""Sjogren's Syndrome/*epidemiology/immunology""]",2006/04/18 09:00,2006/09/28 09:00,['2006/04/18 09:00'],"['2006/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0049-0172(05)00128-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.semarthrit.2005.07.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Arthritis Rheum. 2006 Apr;35(5):306-11. doi: 10.1016/j.semarthrit.2005.07.001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FISH was performed using the LSI BCR/ABL dual-fusion translocation probe on bone marrow cells of 86 patients with CML. Of 86 patients, ABL deletion was detected in 13 (15.1%) patients and BCR deletion in 8 patients (9.3%). Patients with ABL deletion showed shorter event-free survival time (EFS) than those without ABL deletion (P = 0.020). Patients with BCR deletion showed significantly short overall survival time (OS; P = 0.039). Patients with ABL and/or BCR deletion (14/86 patients, 16.3%) showed significantly short OS and EFS (median OS, 43.0 months; median EFS, 40.0 months), compared to the patients without any BCR or ABL gene deletions (median OS, 94.0 months; median EFS, 90.0 months; P = 0.041 for OS, P = 0.008 for EFS). All the patients with BCR deletion, except for one, had a concomitant ABL deletion, suggesting that BCR deletion occurs in conjunction with ABL deletion. In patients with ABL deletion only, BCR/ABL rearrangement with b2a2 mRNA type tended to be more frequent than in patients without any deletion of the two genes (P = 0.073). Deletion of any of the BCR or ABL genes on derivative chromosome 9 was associated with both short OS and EFS.

Angiogenesis is crucial at this time. In this article we investigate the direct influence of the human embryo on in vitro endometrial angiogenesis. DESIGN: In vitro study. SETTING: Human endometrial microvascular endothelial cells (hEMVEC) grown on an in vitro angiogenesis model. INTERVENTION(S): Conditioned media (CM) of human embryos were used to stimulate in vitro angiogenesis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): In vitro angiogenesis of hEMVEC. RESULT(S): Conditioned media of human embryos, containing significant amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), caused an increase in hEMVEC tube formation. This effect was prevented by soluble VEGF receptor 1, which quenches VEGF-A activity. Recombinant EGF alone and leukemia inhibitory factor in combination with VEGF-A stimulated hEMVEC tube formation. None of the other tested recombinant mediators, which have been described as produced by the early embryo/trophoblast (interleukin (IL) 10, transforming growth factor (TGF) beta, placental growth factor, hCG, colony-stimulating factor 1, interferon-gamma, insulin-like growth factor I and II, IL-6, platelet-derived growth factor, and TGFalpha), had an effect on tube formation by hEMVEC. CONCLUSION(S): For the first time, it is shown that the human embryo is able to stimulate in vitro endometrial angiogenesis at the time of implantation, a process that is mediated by VEGF-A.","['Kapiteijn, Kitty', 'Koolwijk, Pieter', 'van der Weiden, Robin M F', 'van Nieuw Amerongen, Geerten', 'Plaisier, Margreet', 'van Hinsbergh, Victor W M', 'Helmerhorst, Frans M']","['Kapiteijn K', 'Koolwijk P', 'van der Weiden RM', 'van Nieuw Amerongen G', 'Plaisier M', 'van Hinsbergh VW', 'Helmerhorst FM']","['Division of Biomedical Research, TNO Quality of Life, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Fertil Steril,Fertility and sterility,0372772,"['0 (Angiogenic Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)']",IM,"['Angiogenic Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tissue Engineering/*methods']",2006/04/18 09:00,2006/05/11 09:00,['2006/04/18 09:00'],"['2005/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '2005/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0015-0282(05)04194-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.11.029 [doi]']",ppublish,Fertil Steril. 2006 Apr;85 Suppl 1:1232-9. doi: 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.11.029.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RS may be triggered by viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Trisomy 12 and chromosome 11 abnormalities, as well as multiple genetic defects, have been described in patients with RS. These abnormalities may cause CLL cells to proliferate and, by facilitating the acquisition of new genetic abnormalities, to transform into RS cells.

By far the most common manifestation is autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), followed by immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). It is not true to say that autoimmunity is confined to the formed elements of the blood since conditions such as paraneoplastic pemphigus and acquired angioedema do occur in CLL, but nonhematologic autoimmunity is very rare indeed. The pathogenesis of autoimmunity in CLL is unknown. It may be related to the ability of the CLL cells to act as antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and to process antigen (particularly the Rh protein) so as to reveal cryptic peptides that are seen as foreign by helper T cells. It is likely that a failure of regulatory T-cell function is also involved. Autoimmune episodes may be triggered by treatment, particularly with purine analogues. Such episodes are often severe and may be fatal. Treatment of CLL-associated autoimmunity follows conventional protocols, but non-response to primary treatments is not uncommon.

More recent studies have also demonstrated the importance of this biologic process in normal hematopoietic cell development and the pathophysiology of several hematologic malignancies. This review provides an overview of the clinical and biologic importance of angiogenesis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Patients with CLL have detectable levels of both plasma and cellular pro- and anti-angiogenic cytokines, as well as abnormal neovascularization in the marrow and lymph nodes. Recent evidence suggests a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-based autocrine pathway promotes the survival of CLL B cells in part through upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins. Additionally, interactions between CLL B cells and their microenvironment generate alterations in the secretion of angiogenic factors that result in enhanced leukemic B-cell resistance to apoptotic cell death. From a clinical standpoint, interpatient variation is observed in markers of angiogenesis and appears to have prognostic implications. Several clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of anti-angiogenic agents for treatment of patients with CLL are underway with promising preliminary results. Additional research is needed to identify the regulation of aberrant and critical angiogenic pathways in CLL B cells, to determine how angiogenic markers can be used to improve prognostication for CLL patients, and to explore how the angiogenic characteristics of CLL B cells can best be manipulated for therapeutic benefit.","['Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Kay, Neil E']","['Shanafelt TD', 'Kay NE']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. shanafelt.tait@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,['0 (Angiogenesis Inducing Agents)'],IM,"['Angiogenesis Inducing Agents/blood', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/blood supply/pathology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/blood supply/pathology', '*Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2006/04/18 09:00,2006/05/27 09:00,['2006/04/18 09:00'],"['2006/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0093-7754(06)00014-5 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminoncol.2006.01.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2006 Apr;33(2):174-85. doi: 10.1053/j.seminoncol.2006.01.008.,,,,,,,140,,,,,,,,,,,,

Significant familial aggregation with largely unknown mode of inheritance has been demonstrated. Until recently little else was known regarding the events leading to CLL initiation and progression. New findings support the view that CLL is a genetic disease where the main alterations occur at the level of transcriptional/post-transcriptional regulation of the malignant cells genome because of deregulations of a new class of genes named microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNA genes miR-15a and miR-16-1, located at 13q14.3, are frequently deleted and/or downregulated in patients with B-cell CLL. Both microRNAs negatively regulate Bcl2 at a post-transcriptional level and this repression is enough to induce apoptosis. Therefore, miR-15 and miR-16 are natural antisense Bcl2 interactors that could be used for therapy of Bcl2-overexpressing tumors. Furthermore, microRNA expression profiles can distinguish normal B cells from malignant B cells in CLL. A unique microRNA signature is associated with prognostic factors such as mutations in the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region gene (IgV(H)) or high expression of the 70-kd zeta-associated protein (ZAP-70+) and disease progression in CLL. Mutations in miRNA transcripts are frequent, some of them germ-line, and may have functional importance and may predispose to CLL and to a spectrum of associated malignancies.","['Calin, George Adrian', 'Croce, Carlo Maria']","['Calin GA', 'Croce CM']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomics/*trends', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', '*MicroRNAs', 'Mutation']",2006/04/18 09:00,2006/05/27 09:00,['2006/04/18 09:00'],"['2006/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0093-7754(06)00019-4 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminoncol.2006.01.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2006 Apr;33(2):167-73. doi: 10.1053/j.seminoncol.2006.01.010.,,,,,"['P01CA76259/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,54,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several questions remain unsolved and the definition of the cell origin of CLL is still prominent. The presence of somatic mutations of IGHV genes indicates that, at least in a portion of cases, CLL cells had encountered an antigen during the natural history of the disease. Unmutated (UM) cases show a remarkable skewing in IGHV gene usage. In addition, all CLL cases, both mutated (M) and UM, show a common surface phenotype which is significantly activated and similar to the surface phenotype of antigen (Ag)-experienced B cells. The properties of CLL B-cell receptors (BCR) resemble those observed in normal B cells upon Ag interaction, and gene profiling analyses revealed that both subsets share striking similarities with the so-called memory B cells. The detailed analyses of the complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences of the leukemic immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors showed that unrelated patients in different parts of the world express very similar if not identical BCR. Remarkably, similar V(H)DJ(H) rearrangements have been identified in both UM- and M-CLL, suggesting an antigenic selection in both subsets of the disease. From all this evidence, the concept has arisen that the cell of origin, regardless its mutational status, has to be ""an Ag-experienced"" B cell that gives rise to a malignant clone that appears to be more dynamic than previously appreciated and whose progression is favored by a number of molecular and cellular interactions that occur in tissues.","['Ghia, Paolo', 'Caligaris-Cappio, Federico']","['Ghia P', 'Caligaris-Cappio F']","['Department of Oncology, Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele and Istituto Scientifico San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*immunology', 'Mutation']",2006/04/18 09:00,2006/05/27 09:00,['2006/04/18 09:00'],"['2006/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0093-7754(06)00018-2 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminoncol.2006.01.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2006 Apr;33(2):150-6. doi: 10.1053/j.seminoncol.2006.01.009.,,,,,,,68,,,,,,,,,,,,

For a long time, natural killer (NK) cells have held promise for cancer immunotherapy because, unlike T lymphocytes, they can kill tumor cells without the need for tumor-specific antigen recognition. In the treatment of acute leukemia, NK cell-based therapies have focused on in vivo expansion and activation with cytokines with only modest success. However, recent understanding of the importance of NK receptors for the recognition and lysis of leukemia cells suggests novel therapeutic strategies. The balance of inhibitory and activating signals through surface receptors, recognizing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class I-like molecules on target cells, determines whether NK cells activate killing. In this review, we discuss the biologic rationale for therapeutic strategies harnessing NK cells and focus on novel directions for their future use in elderly patients with acute leukemia.","['Farag, Sherif S', 'Caligiuri, Michael A']","['Farag SS', 'Caligiuri MA']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine and The Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. sherif.farag@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Cytokines/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/transplantation', 'Leukemia/*therapy']",2006/04/18 09:00,2006/06/22 09:00,['2006/04/18 09:00'],"['2006/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0037-1963(06)00023-0 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2006.01.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2006 Apr;43(2):118-25. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2006.01.006.,,,,,,,84,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is clear that novel agents and new approaches must be used to improve the situation, and should include options for patients who are not fit for intensive treatment.

In particular, the >or=15% risk of death in the month following the start of treatment is difficult to justify given median survivals of less than 1 year in the patients who do not die early. Thus, investigational therapy should be recommended for most, if not all, older patients. In patients for whom such therapy is not feasible, low-dose ara-C is a reasonable alternative except for patients with de novo disease and a normal karyotype, who might benefit more from an anthracycline+ara-C combination, and patients with either a poor performance status, abnormal organ function, or age>or=80, for whom supportive/palliative care only is recommended. Distinctions are made between investigational therapies likely associated with lower and higher risks of treatment-related mortality (TRM). The former are preferable initial treatment in patients aged 70 and above, or with abnormal cytogenetics. Three topics are discussed that are likely to be relevant to future clinical research in older patients: the possibility of delaying therapy to gain information about prognosis with initial induction therapy, the clinical value of responses less than conventional complete remission (CR), and the possibility of looking for larger differences between treatments in randomized clinical trials.","['Estey, Elihu H']",['Estey EH'],"['Department of Leukemia, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. ehestey@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', '*Therapeutic Human Experimentation']",2006/04/18 09:00,2006/06/22 09:00,['2006/04/18 09:00'],"['2006/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0037-1963(06)00019-9 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2006.01.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2006 Apr;43(2):89-95. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2006.01.002.,,,,,,,30,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of our study was to determine if the induction of SOCS-3 correlated with increased IRS-1 degradation in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Interestingly, our studies have shown that there is little correlation between the induction in SOCS-3 expression and the degradation of IRS-1 in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our results clearly demonstrate that treatment with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or cardiotrophin (CT)-1 strongly induces the expression of SOCS-3 in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes, but does not affect the degradation of IRS-1.

More recently, treatment approaches have included purine nucleoside analogs (PNAs), fludarabine or cladribine (2-CdA), and monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). PNAs are highly active in patients with CLL, previously treated and untreated. Significantly higher overall response and complete response in patients treated initially with fludarabine or 2-CdA than in those treated with chlorambucil- or cyclophosphamide-based combination regimens have been recently confirmed in prospective, randomized trials. However, the median survival times do not differ among the patients treated with PNA and alkylating agents. The MoAbs directed against CD52 antigen (alemtuzumab) and CD20 antigen (rituximab) also demonstrate significant activity in CLL and should be used in patients with disease that is refractory to PNAs. Combination therapies with PNAs and cyclophosphamide, and especially with rituximab, are more active than monotherapy with PNAs in regard to response rate and possible survival. Because most patients are older and there is no survival time advantage for alkylating agents or PNA therapies, we recommend chlorambucil as the first-line treatment, with PNAs for consideration as the second-line therapy. PNAs alone or in combination with cyclophosphamide and rituximab as first-line treatment are an option in younger patients, who may be candidates for consolidation therapy with alemtuzumab and/or stem cell transplantation. Alemtuzumab may be an effective treatment for patients refractory to PNAs. Several biological parameters have been gaining increasing importance to evaluate the prognosis of patients with CLL and define optimal therapeutic strategy.

This is characterized by the dysregulated production of mature nonlymphoid cells with normal differentiation. Eventually, in spite of the term chronic, there is progression to acute leukemia, usually of the myeloid variety, which is highly resistant to current therapies. Despite recent improvements in the treatment of early-stage disease, CML blast crisis (CMLBC) remains a therapeutic challenge. CMLBC is highly refractory to standard induction chemotherapy, with a response rate in myeloid blast crisis of less than 30%. Conventional chemotherapy has been much less successful in this disease compared with de novo acute leukemia, with a mean survival after diagnosis of blast crisis of only 2 to 4 months for nonresponders. Many regimens of chemotherapies have been tried in CMLBC, with minor success. Although imatinib was evaluated in patients with CMLBC, most CMLBC cases today arise in patients already on imatinib-based therapy and developing blastic phase on that therapy; thus there is no standard therapy for patients with CMLBC. Further studies of the mechanisms of transformation of chronic-phase CMLBC at a molecular level, and methods to target these molecular abnormalities, will determine the future direction of new treatment modalities. The prognosis of CML in blast crisis remains disappointing, despite great efforts.

In this paper, a rapid, simple, and automatic immunophenotyping technique for acute leukemias has been initially proposed by incorporating immunomagnetic separation and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurement. Core-shell paramagnetic microspheres of silica-coated ZnFe2O4 were newly fabricated following a W/O microemulsion route and further functionalized for anchoring separately CD antibodies of lineage-different leukocytes. The resultant immunomagnetic microspheres were introduced, in turn, to capture target leukocytes from the samples and were magnetically accumulated onto the protein A-modified QCM to be analyzed. The response characteristics of the developed QCM system for immunophenotyping various lineage-defined leukocytes were investigated in detail. Results indicate that this new technique can allow for easy and clear identification of acute leukocytes of lymphoid and myeloid origins as well as their subsets. It may also permit the quantitative determination of acute leukocytes with cell concentration down to approximately 10(3) cells mL(-1).

Of the 32 patients treated with chemotherapy, 25.9% and 59.3% achieved complete or partial remissions respectively. Six patients were still alive after a follow up period of a mean +/- s.d of 39.3 +/- 24.4 months; five were lost to follow up after a mean +/- s.d period of 28.6 +/- 18.8 months and 16 were dead after a mean +/- s.d. period of 25.7 +/- 19.1 months. The main causes of death in the treated group were septicaemia in six, pneumonia in four and tuberculosis in three. In the untreated group of 43 patients, two refused therapy, four died shortly after diagnosis and 37 were lost to follow up. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Although the study has disclosed that CLL is not rare in central Africans and its presentations are similar to cases reported in the literature, the majority of patients seek medical treatment late. Optimal therapy is impossible due to lack of chemotherapy and supportive services..Therefore, it is recommended that tertiary referral centers in African health systems should be equipped for better management of CLL patients.","['Mukiibi, J M', 'Paul, B', 'Nyirenda, C M', 'Adewuyi, J O', 'Gwanzura, C', 'Mzulu, Elb', 'Mbvundula, E M', 'Magombo, E D', 'Malata, H N']","['Mukiibi JM', 'Paul B', 'Nyirenda CM', 'Adewuyi JO', 'Gwanzura C', 'Mzulu E', 'Mbvundula EM', 'Magombo ED', 'Malata HN']","['Department of Haematology University of Malawi College of Medicine Private Bag 360 Chichiri, Blantyre 3, Malawi. jmmukiibi@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Zimbabwe,Cent Afr J Med,The Central African journal of medicine,0372566,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology', 'Malawi/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Zimbabwe/epidemiology']",2006/04/18 09:00,2006/05/12 09:00,['2006/04/18 09:00'],"['2006/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cent Afr J Med. 2004 Nov-Dec;50(11-12):111-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Murine leukemia L1210 cells and human prostate Bax-deficient DU145 cells were examined after PDT-induced photodamage to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Phase contrast, fluorescence and electron microscopy were used to identify changes in cellular morphology, chromatin condensation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and formation of phagolysosomes. Western blots were used to assess the processing of LC3-I to LC3-II, a marker for autophagy. Inhibitors of apoptosis and/or autophagy were used to delineate the contributions of the two pathways to the effects of PDT. RESULTS: Both apoptosis and autophagy occurred in L1210 after ER photodamage with the latter predominating after 24 hours. In DU145 cells, PDT conditions causing comparable cytotoxicity only initiated autophagy. PI3-kinase inhibitors suppressed autophagy in both cell lines as indicated by inhibition of vacuolization and LC3 processing. CONCLUSIONS: Both autophagy and apoptosis were observed in L1210 cells following ER photodamage. In the Bax-deficient DU145 cell line only autophagy was observed. Current information suggests that autophagy can function as either a survival or death pathway. We propose that in the context of PDT, this may also be true.","['Kessel, David', 'Vicente, M Graca H', 'Reiners, John J Jr']","['Kessel D', 'Vicente MG', 'Reiners JJ Jr']","['Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit Michigan 48201, USA. dhkessel@med.wayne.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Lasers Surg Med,Lasers in surgery and medicine,8007168,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Porphyrins)', '0 (benzoylcarbonyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartyl-fluoromethyl ketone)', '100572-96-1 (porphycene)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (DEVDase)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', '*Autophagy', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/pharmacology', 'Porphyrins/pharmacology', 'Wortmannin']",2006/04/15 09:00,2007/01/06 09:00,['2006/04/15 09:00'],"['2006/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/lsm.20334 [doi]'],ppublish,Lasers Surg Med. 2006 Jun;38(5):482-8. doi: 10.1002/lsm.20334.,,,,,"['CA 23378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA023378-28/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES06639/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA082341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 82341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES006639/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA023378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES009392/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009392/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2749509,,"['Copyright 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['NIHMS141191'],,,,,,,,,,

This study explores this challenge from the perspectives of a sample of pediatric oncologists, interpreters, and Spanish-speaking parents of children with newly diagnosed leukemia. PROCEDURE: Thirty-seven oncologists and 17 professional language interpreters based at two non-profit pediatric hospitals in the US were surveyed on the topic of language barriers in pediatric care. Seventeen parents who communicated with their child's oncologist through an interpreter were also surveyed. RESULTS: All groups expressed considerable concern over the process of communicating across a language barrier. For oncologists, these concerns included the accuracy and completeness of interpretations, complexity of information, and loss of confidence and control over the communication process. For interpreters, they included complexity of information, information overload, and lack of clinician sensitivity toward the cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds of limited English proficiency (LEP) families. Parent concerns included difficulties comprehending information and anxiety over the possibility of missing out on important information. All groups provided multiple suggestions for improving communication across a language barrier. CONCLUSIONS: Oncologists, interpreters, and parents expressed considerable concern over the process of communicating across a language barrier. Some of these concerns could be minimized through efforts to boost interpreter accuracy and completeness, including the use of more simple, easy to understand language. Other issues, such as differences in culture and socioeconomic background, warrant consideration of the intercultural knowledge and skills of interpreters.","['Abbe, Marisa', 'Simon, Christian', 'Angiolillo, Anne', 'Ruccione, Kathy', 'Kodish, Eric D']","['Abbe M', 'Simon C', 'Angiolillo A', 'Ruccione K', 'Kodish ED']","['Department of Anthropology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106-4976, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Child', '*Communication Barriers', 'Education, Medical, Continuing', '*Health Care Surveys', 'Hispanic or Latino/*psychology', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', '*Language', 'Medical Oncology', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/ethnology', 'Parents/*psychology', '*Pediatrics', '*Physician-Patient Relations', '*Translating', 'United States']",2006/04/15 09:00,2007/02/14 09:00,['2006/04/15 09:00'],"['2006/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20841 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2006 Nov;47(6):819-24. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20841.,,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2006 Nov;47(6):747.

We analyzed the incidence, clinical course and prognosis of moyamoya syndrome (MoS) following childhood ALL. PROCEDURE: A total of 1,846 ALL patients were treated with four consecutive TCCSG ALL protocols (L84-11, L89-12, L92-13, and L95-14) between 1984 and 1999. We surveyed the MoS cases among these patients in the follow-up studies. RESULTS: Six patients with MoS were identified: four boys and two girls whose ages ranged from 2 years and 1 month (abbreviated as ""2y1m"") to 14y 1 m at diagnosis of ALL. None of the patients had central nervous system (CNS) leukemia. All six patients received prophylactic cranial irradiation with a dosage of 18 or 24 Gy. Although one patient died of brain infarction due to MoS, no leukemic relapse was observed in the group. The cumulative incidence of MoS in our series was 0.46 +/- 0.02% at 8 years. Among several clinical characteristics, use of cranial irradiation was the only factor that appeared to be significantly related to the development of MoS. CONCLUSIONS: MoS occurs with increased frequency in children treated for ALL, and might be associated with cranial irradiation. Prophylactic cranial irradiation should be used cautiously in ALL patients who can be cured by other CNS-directed therapies.","['Kikuchi, Akira', 'Maeda, Miho', 'Hanada, Ryoji', 'Okimoto, Yuri', 'Ishimoto, Koichi', 'Kaneko, Takashi', 'Ikuta, Koichiro', 'Tsuchida, Masahiro']","['Kikuchi A', 'Maeda M', 'Hanada R', 'Okimoto Y', 'Ishimoto K', 'Kaneko T', 'Ikuta K', 'Tsuchida M']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan. a1091069@pref.saitama.lg.jp""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Cerebral Infarction/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Moyamoya Disease/diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Quality of Life', 'Remission Induction', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2006/04/15 09:00,2007/04/04 09:00,['2006/04/15 09:00'],"['2006/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20837 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Mar;48(3):268-72. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20837.,,"[""Tokyo Children's Cancer Study Group (TCCSG)""]",,,,,,"['(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

FISH revealed loss of CCND1/BCL1 in five of nine Sezary syndrome (SS) cases but gain in two cases, and RB1 loss in four of seven SS cases. IHC showed absent CCND1/BCL1 expression in 18 of 30 SS, 10 of 23 mycosis fungoides (MF), and three of 10 primary cutaneous CD30+ anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (C-ALCL). Increased CCND1/BCL1 expression was seen in nine MF, seven C-ALCL, and six SS cases. Absent RB1 expression was detected in 8 of 12 MF and 7 of 9 SS cases, and raised RB1 expression in 7 of 8 C-ALCL. Affymetrix revealed increased gene expression of CCND2 in four of eight CTCL cases, CCND3 in three cases, and CDKN2C in two cases with a normal expression of CCND1 and RB1. These findings suggest heterogeneous abnormalities of CCND and RB in CTCL, in which dysregulated CCND and RB1 may lead to impaired cell cycle control.","['Mao, Xin', 'Orchard, Guy', 'Vonderheid, Eric C', 'Nowell, Peter C', 'Bagot, Martine', 'Bensussan, Armand', 'Russell-Jones, Robin', 'Young, Bryan D', 'Whittaker, Sean J']","['Mao X', 'Orchard G', 'Vonderheid EC', 'Nowell PC', 'Bagot M', 'Bensussan A', 'Russell-Jones R', 'Young BD', 'Whittaker SJ']","[""Skin Tumour Unit, St John's Institute of Dermatology, St Thomas' Hospital, King's College, London, UK. mxmayo@yahoo.co.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,"['0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus/chemistry/genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics', 'Cyclin D1/analysis/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/chemistry/genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/chemistry/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mycosis Fungoides/chemistry/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/analysis/*genetics', 'Sezary Syndrome/chemistry/genetics', 'Skin Neoplasms/chemistry/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",2006/04/15 09:00,2006/07/06 09:00,['2006/04/15 09:00'],"['2006/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-202X(15)32937-7 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.jid.5700224 [doi]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 2006 Jun;126(6):1388-95. doi: 10.1038/sj.jid.5700224.,,,,,"['A6438/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'A6789/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Precise diagnosis of the main forms of hematopoietic malignancies according to FAB classification and new WHO classification and comparison of these data with that in the general population will be helpful in estimating the relative contribution of the radiation factor to the overall incidence of such pathologies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The data on 218 consecutive cases of malignant diseases of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues in Chernobyl clean-up workers diagnosed in 1996-2005 are given in comparison with the data of 2697 consecutive patients of general population of the same age group. The morphology and cytochemistry of bone marrow and peripheral blood cells were studied. Immunocytochemical techniques (APAAP, LSAB-AP) and the broad panel of monoclonal antibodies to lineage specific and differentiation antigens of leukocytes were employed for immunophenotyping leukemic cells. RESULTS: Various types of oncohematological diseases developing 10-20 years after Chernobyl accident were registered in a group of clean-up workers under study including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute leukemias (ALL and AML), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and other chronic myeloproliferative diseases, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and other chronic lymphoproliferative diseases of B and T cell origin. MDS percentage among patients of clean-up workers group tended to exceed MDS percentage in the group of patients representing the general population examined at the same period (4.58 vs. 3.70%). Among 34 AML cases, leukemia was preceded by MDS in seven patients. The relative contribution of CML to the total number of clean-up workers with leukemia was higher than the corresponding percentage value in general population examined at the same period (9.17 vs. 6.59%). B-CLL was a predominant form of hematopoietic malignancies in clean-up workers under study (25.68%). Nevertheless, B-CLL percentage in patients of clean-up workers group did not differ significantly from that in the patients of general population. The multiple myeloma percentage (7.79%) in the group of patients belonging to clean-up workers in our study turned out to be twice as much as in the patients of general population (4.0%). CONCLUSION: The verified diagnosis of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue according to modern classification (EGIL, WHO) could be the prerequisite for further molecular genetic and analytical epidemiology study of leukemias that may be related to Chernobyl NPP accident consequences.","['Gluzman, D', 'Imamura, N', 'Sklyarenko, L', 'Nadgornaya, V', 'Zavelevich, M', 'Machilo, V']","['Gluzman D', 'Imamura N', 'Sklyarenko L', 'Nadgornaya V', 'Zavelevich M', 'Machilo V']","['RE Kavetsky Institute of Experimental Pathology, Oncology and Radiobiology, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv. vals@onconet.kiev.ua']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Radioactive Fallout)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', '*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology', '*Radioactive Fallout', 'Ukraine/epidemiology']",2006/04/15 09:00,2006/05/25 09:00,['2006/04/15 09:00'],"['2006/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['25/497 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2006 Mar;28(1):60-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of each of these genes was then expressed as a ratio in relation to beta-actin gene expression, and the three genes were categorized as being either 0, 1+, 2+ or 3+. MDR1, MRP and LRP mRNA expression was detected in 23.9%, 83.1% and 45.1 %, respectively. LRP mRNA expression was significantly associated with resistance to induction chemotherapy in acute leukemia patients, and in the AML proportion (p=0.02 and p=0.03, respectively). MRP and high MDR1 mRNA expression was associated with poorer 2-yr survival (p=0.049 and p=0.04, respectively). Patients expressing both MRP and LRP mRNA had poorer outcomes and had worse 2-yr survival. The present data suggest that MDR expression affects complete remission and survival rates in acute leukemia patients. Thus, determination of MDR gene expression at diagnosis appears likely to provide useful prognostic information for acute leukemia patients.","['Huh, Hee Jin', 'Park, Chan Jeoung', 'Jang, Seongsoo', 'Seo, Eul Ju', 'Chi, Hyun Sook', 'Lee, Je Hwan', 'Lee, Kyoo Hyung', 'Seo, Jong Jin', 'Moon, Hyung Nam', 'Ghim, Thad']","['Huh HJ', 'Park CJ', 'Jang S', 'Seo EJ', 'Chi HS', 'Lee JH', 'Lee KH', 'Seo JJ', 'Moon HN', 'Ghim T']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Ulsan and Asan Medical Center, Pungnap-dong, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),J Korean Med Sci,Journal of Korean medical science,8703518,"['0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, MDR', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles/*genetics']",2006/04/15 09:00,2006/07/01 09:00,['2006/04/15 09:00'],"['2006/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['200604253 [pii]', '10.3346/jkms.2006.21.2.253 [doi]']",ppublish,J Korean Med Sci. 2006 Apr;21(2):253-8. doi: 10.3346/jkms.2006.21.2.253.,,,,,,PMC2734000,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cocoa polyphenol (CP) was fractionated from commercial cocoa powder and contained 468 mg/g of gallic acid-equivalent phenolics and 413 mg/g epicatechin-equivalent flavonoids. CP exhibited a dose-dependent free radical-scavenging activity as determined by both 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) and 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging assays. CP also dose-dependently inhibited xanthine oxidase activity and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced superoxide-anion generation in cultured human promyeolcytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Oral administering of CP (4, 20, 40, and 200 mg/kg body weight) to ICR mice 1 h prior to TPA (10 nmol) inhibited ear edema at 5 h in a dose-dependent manner. The levels of COX-2 expression induced in mouse skin after 4-h treatment with topical TPA (10 nmol) was also diminished significantly by pretreating CP (40 or 200 mg/kg) for 30 min. CP at the same doses inhibited TPA-induced nuclear translocation of p65 and subsequent DNA binding of NF-kappaB at 1 h by blocking the degradation of IkappaBalpha in mouse skin. Moreover, phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in ICR mouse skin, measured 4 h after TPA treatment, was suppressed by oral pretreatment of CP (40 or 200 mg/kg). Although extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 phosphorylation was unaffected, CP inhibited the catalytic activity of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 in TPA-stimulated mouse skin. Since cellular proinflammatory and prooxidant states are closely linked to tumor promotion, the antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties of CP may constitute the basis of possible antitumor promoting effects of this phytochemical.","['Lee, Ki Won', 'Kundu, Joydeb Kumar', 'Kim, Sue Ok', 'Chun, Kyung-Soo', 'Lee, Hyong Joo', 'Surh, Young-Joon']","['Lee KW', 'Kundu JK', 'Kim SO', 'Chun KS', 'Lee HJ', 'Surh YJ']","['Department of Food Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Nutr,The Journal of nutrition,0404243,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Polyphenols)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cacao', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/*metabolism', 'Edema', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phenols/*pharmacology', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Polyphenols', 'Skin/drug effects', '*Skin Physiological Phenomena', 'Superoxides/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",2006/04/15 09:00,2006/06/24 09:00,['2006/04/15 09:00'],"['2006/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['136/5/1150 [pii]', '10.1093/jn/136.5.1150 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nutr. 2006 May;136(5):1150-5. doi: 10.1093/jn/136.5.1150.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study demonstrates that CCL22 and CCL17 stimulate pertussis toxin-sensitive elevation of intracellular calcium in the CEM leukemic T cell line and human peripheral blood-derived T helper type 2 (Th2) cells. Inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) resulted in the abrogation of chemokine-mediated calcium mobilization. Chemokine-stimulated calcium responses were also abrogated completely by the inhibition of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3] receptor-mediated calcium release. Chemotactic responses of CEM and human Th2 cells to CCL17 and CCL22 were similarly abrogated by inhibition of PLC and inhibition of novel, Ca2+-independent/diacylglycerol-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. Inhibition of Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor-mediated calcium release from intracellular stores had no effect on chemotactic responses to CCR4 ligands. Taken together, this study provides compelling evidence of an important role for PLC and diacylglycerol-dependent effector mechanisms (most likely involving novel PKC isoforms) in CCL17- and CCL22-stimulated, directional cell migration. In this regard, CCL22 stimulates phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-independent phosphorylation of the novel delta isoform of PKC at threonine 505, situated within its activation loop--an event closely associated with increased catalytic activity.","['Cronshaw, Darran G', 'Kouroumalis, Andreas', 'Parry, Richard', 'Webb, Adam', 'Brown, Zarin', 'Ward, Stephen G']","['Cronshaw DG', 'Kouroumalis A', 'Parry R', 'Webb A', 'Brown Z', 'Ward SG']","['Department of Pharmacy & Pharmacology, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath, Avon, UK BA2 7AY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (1,2-diacylglycerol)', '0 (Acetophenones)', '0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (CCL17 protein, human)', '0 (CCL22 protein, human)', '0 (CCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Chemokine CCL17)', '0 (Chemokine CCL22)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Estrenes)', '0 (ITPR1 protein, human)', '0 (ITPR2 protein, human)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Pyrrolidinones)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '1114-81-4 (Phosphothreonine)', '112648-68-7', '(1-(6-((3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl)amino)hexyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione)', '151342-35-7 (Ro 32-0432)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'E29LP3ZMUH (rottlerin)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 4.6.1.13 (Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Acetophenones/pharmacology', 'Benzopyrans/pharmacology', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Calcium Channels/physiology', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects/physiology', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell Line, Tumor/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Chemokine CCL17', 'Chemokine CCL22', 'Chemokines, CC/genetics/*physiology', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Diglycerides/physiology', 'Estrenes/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/physiology', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Pertussis Toxin/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphothreonine/chemistry', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects/*physiology', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'Pyrrolidinones/pharmacology', 'Receptors, CCR4', 'Receptors, Chemokine/*physiology', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Th2 Cells/cytology/drug effects']",2006/04/15 09:00,2006/08/11 09:00,['2006/04/15 09:00'],"['2006/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.0106035 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0106035 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2006 Jun;79(6):1369-80. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0106035.

The presence of NOTCH1 mutations was significantly correlated with a good prednisone response and favorable minimal residual disease (MRD) kinetics, which was independent from sex, age, white blood cell count, and T-cell immunophenotype at the time of diagnosis. Furthermore, activating NOTCH1 mutations specified a large subgroup of patients with an excellent prognosis.

A new generation of potent ABL kinase inhibitors is undergoing clinical evaluation. It is important to generate specific resistance profiles for each of these compounds, which could translate into combinatorial and sequential treatment strategies. Having characterized nilotinib (AMN107) against a large panel of imatinib mesylate-resistant Bcr-Abl mutants, we investigated which mutants might arise under nilotinib therapy using a cell-based resistance screen. In contrast to imatinib mesylate, resistance to nilotinib was associated with a limited spectrum of Bcr-Abl kinase mutations. Among these were mutations affecting the P-loop and T315I. Rarely emerging resistant colonies at a concentration of 400 nM nilotinib exclusively expressed the T315I mutation. With the exception of T315I, all of the mutations that were identified were effectively suppressed when the nilotinib concentration was increased to 2000 nM, which falls within the peak-trough range in plasma levels (3.6-1.7 microM) measured in patients treated with 400 mg twice daily. Our findings suggest that nilotinib might be superior to imatinib mesylate in terms of the development of resistance.

Since its description in African children, it has been recognized outside areas with endemic malaria, frequently also in children as well as among individuals with an underlying immunodeficiency. Since its initial designation as Burkitt's lymphoma, this type of lymphoma and lymphomas closely resembling it have received a variety of names in different classifications of lymphomas and leukemias: undifferentiated lymphoma, Burkitt's and non-Burkitt's type in the modified Rappaport Classification, malignant lymphoma, small non-cleaved cell, Burkitt's type in the Working Formulation, Burkitt's lymphoma and high-grade B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt-like in the REAL Classification, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, L3 type in the FAB Classification. With the publication of the WHO Classification of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tumors, the nomenclature of this lymphoma has come full circle, and it is once again known simply as Burkitt's lymphoma. In recent years, efforts have focused on improving therapy for this rapidly proliferating neoplasm while minimizing, to the extent possible, treatment-associated toxicity. These efforts have led to the development of high-intensity, short-duration combination chemotherapy that has proven extremely effective for a high proportion of Burkitt's lymphoma patients. The differential diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma is broad, and precise diagnosis based on histologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic features remains the critical first step in planning appropriate therapy.","['Ferry, Judith A']",['Ferry JA'],"['James Homer Wright Pathology Laboratories of the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, 02114, USA. jferry@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,,IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Staging']",2006/04/15 09:00,2006/09/29 09:00,['2006/04/15 09:00'],"['2006/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/4/375 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.11-4-375 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2006 Apr;11(4):375-83. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.11-4-375.,,,,,,,38,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the mechanism as well as genetic and molecular characteristics associated with sensitivity to arsenite-induced cell death is key to providing effective chemotherapeutic usage of arsenite. Arsenite sensitivity correlates with deficient p53 pathways in multiple cell lines. The role of p53 in preventing arsenite-induced mitotic arrest-associated apoptosis (MAAA), a form of mitotic catastrophe, was examined in TR9-7 cells, a model cell line with p53 exogenously regulated in a tetracycline-off expression system. Arsenite activated G1 and G2 cell cycle checkpoints independently of p53, but mitotic catastrophe occurred preferentially in p53- cells. Cyclin B/CDC2(CDK1) stabilization and caspase-3 activation persisted in arsenite-treated p53- cells consistent with MAAA/mitotic catastrophe. N-Benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone, a pan-caspase inhibitor, completely abolished arsenite-induced MAAA/mitotic catastrophe and greatly increased the mitotic index. WEE1 and p21CIP1/WAF1 inhibit cyclin B/CDC2 by CDC2 tyrosine-15 phosphorylation and direct binding, respectively. CDC2-Y15-P was transiently elevated in arsenite-treated p53+ cells but persisted in p53- cells. Arsenite induced p53-S15-P and p21CIP1/WAF1 only in p53+ cells. P21CIP1/WAF1-siRNA-treated p53+ cells were similar to p53- cells in mitotic index and cell cycle protein levels. p53-inducible proteins GADD45alpha and 14-3-3sigma are capable of inhibiting cyclin B/CDC2 but did not play a p53-dependent role in mitotic escape in TR9-7 cells.

Buccal samples, which are painless to take and relatively easily collected, are often the preferred source. There are several buccal cell collection methods: swabs, brushes, mouthwash, and treated cards, such as FTA or IsoCode cards. Few studies have systematically compared methods of buccal cell collection with respect to DNA yield and amplification success under similar conditions. We compared buccal DNA collection and amplification using buccal swabs and FTA cards in 122 control subjects from our Australian case-control study of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Buccal DNA was quantified using a real-time PCR for beta-actin and genotyped at the loci of three polymorphisms (MTHFR 677C>T, ACE I/D, and XPD 1012G>A). PCR was successful with DNA from buccal swabs for 62% to 89% of subjects and from FTA cards for 83% to 100% of subjects, depending on the locus. The matched pair odds ratios (95% confidence interval) comparing success of FTA cards with buccal swabs are as follows: MTHFR 677C>T using PCR-RFLP, 12.5 (11.6-13.5) and using real-time PCR, 130.0 (113.1-152.8); ACE I/D using PCR-amplified fragment length polymorphism, 3.36 (3.2-3.5); XPD 1012G>A using real-time PCR, 150.0 (132.7-172.3). FTA cards are a robust DNA collection method and generally produce DNA suitable for PCR more reliably than buccal swabs. There are, however, technical challenges in handling discs punched from FTA cards that intending users should be aware of.","['Milne, Elizabeth', 'van Bockxmeer, Frank M', 'Robertson, Laila', 'Brisbane, Joanna M', 'Ashton, Lesley J', 'Scott, Rodney J', 'Armstrong, Bruce K']","['Milne E', 'van Bockxmeer FM', 'Robertson L', 'Brisbane JM', 'Ashton LJ', 'Scott RJ', 'Armstrong BK']","['Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Centre for Child Health Research, The University of Western Australia. lizm@ichr.uwa.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,"['0 (Reagent Kits, Diagnostic)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Cheek', 'DNA/*analysis', 'DNA Fingerprinting/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mouth Mucosa/*cytology', '*Paper', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reagent Kits, Diagnostic', '*Specimen Handling/methods']",2006/04/15 09:00,2006/11/14 09:00,['2006/04/15 09:00'],"['2006/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['15/4/816 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-05-0753 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2006 Apr;15(4):816-9. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-05-0753.,,,,,,,,,,['Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2006 May;15(5):1056'],,,,,,,,,

However, because imatinib inhibits c-kit, the stem cell factor receptor, it could interfere with bone marrow engraftment. In this study, we examined the impact of imatinib on normal progenitor cell function. Imatinib decreased the colony-forming capacity of mobilized peripheral blood human CD133(+) cells but not that of long-term culture-initiating cells. Imatinib also decreased the proliferation of cytokine-stimulated CD133(+) cells but did not induce apoptosis of these cells. Expression of very late antigen (VLA)-4, VLA-5, and CXCR4 of CD133(+) cells was not modified by imatinib, but imatinib decreased the ability of CD133(+) cells to migrate. Finally, imatinib did not decrease engraftment of CD133(+) cells into irradiated nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient/beta2m(null) mice conditioned with 3 or 1 Gy total body irradiation. In summary, our results suggest that, despite inhibition of hematopoietic progenitor cell growth in vitro, imatinib does not interfere with hematopoietic stem cell engraftment.","['Pirson, Laurence', 'Baron, Frederic', 'Meuris, Nathalie', 'Giet, Olivier', 'Castermans, Emilie', 'Greimers, Roland', 'Di Stefano, Ivano', 'Gothot, Andre', 'Beguin, Yves']","['Pirson L', 'Baron F', 'Meuris N', 'Giet O', 'Castermans E', 'Greimers R', 'Di Stefano I', 'Gothot A', 'Beguin Y']","['Center for Cellular and Molecular Therapy, University of Liege, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrin alpha5beta1)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Prom1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Blood Cells/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fetal Blood/drug effects', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/drug effects', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/metabolism', 'Integrin alpha5beta1/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/physiology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2006/04/15 09:00,2006/09/28 09:00,['2006/04/15 09:00'],"['2006/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['2005-0290 [pii]', '10.1634/stemcells.2005-0290 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2006 Jul;24(7):1814-21. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.2005-0290.

The OCR strategy is based on the fusion of the self-associating coiled-coil (CC) domain of the nuclear factor promyelocytic leukemia (PML) to target proteins that are able to self-associate naturally or that form heterocomplexes. In the thyroid tissue, the transcription factor Pax8 is involved in the morphogenesis of the gland and in the transcriptional regulation of thyroid-expressed genes. We have recently demonstrated that in thyroid cells Pax8 interacts biochemically and functionally with the transcription factor TTF-1 (thyroid transcription factor 1), and that such interaction leads to the synergistic activation of thyroglobulin (Tg) gene expression. Fusion of the CC domain to Pax8 leads to the formation of aberrant, nonfunctional high-molecular mass complexes to which TTF-1 is also recruited. The CC-Pax8 chimera inhibits the transcriptional activity of Pax8 and of TTF-1 on both synthetic and physiological promoters and prevents the synergistic activation of the Tg promoter mediated by these two transcription factors. Furthermore, the expression of the CC-Pax8 chimera in differentiated thyroid cells leads to the down-regulation of the endogenous expression of several differentiation markers such as Tg, sodium/iodide symporter, Foxe1, TTF-1, and thyroid oxidase 2. These results demonstrate that the OCR is a useful tool to functionally inactivate a transcription factor. Moreover, by this approach, we identified Foxe1, TTF-1, and thyroid oxidase 2 as new direct targets of Pax8 or TTF-1.","[""D'Andrea, Barbara"", 'Iacone, Roberto', 'Di Palma, Tina', 'Nitsch, Roberto', 'Baratta, Maria Giuseppina', 'Nitsch, Lucio', 'Di Lauro, Roberto', 'Zannini, Mariastella']","[""D'Andrea B"", 'Iacone R', 'Di Palma T', 'Nitsch R', 'Baratta MG', 'Nitsch L', 'Di Lauro R', 'Zannini M']","['Istituto di Endocrinologia ed Oncologia Sperimentale-Consiglio Nazionale delie Ricerche and Dipartimento di Biologia e Patologia Cellulare e Molecolare, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FOXE1 protein, human)', '0 (Flavoproteins)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (PAX8 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX8 protein, human)', '0 (Paired Box Transcription Factors)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TTF1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Dual Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.3.1 (DUOX2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dual Oxidases', 'Flavoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Silencing', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'NADPH Oxidases/genetics/metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'PAX8 Transcription Factor', 'Paired Box Transcription Factors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Polymers/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Thyroid Gland/cytology', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transfection']",2006/04/15 09:00,2006/09/29 09:00,['2006/04/15 09:00'],"['2006/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['me.2005-0463 [pii]', '10.1210/me.2005-0463 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2006 Aug;20(8):1810-24. doi: 10.1210/me.2005-0463.

These proteins are thought to subvert normal gene expression in differentiating hematopoietic progenitor cells. We have previously shown that MOZ-TIF2 inhibits transcription by CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300-dependent activators such as nuclear receptors and p53. Here we have shown that MOZ-TIF2 associates with the RARbeta2 promoter in vivo, resulting in altered recruitment of CBP/p300, aberrant histone modification, and down-regulation of the RARbeta2 gene. In contrast, MOZ-TIF2 up-regulated transcription mediated by the MOZ/MYST3-dependent activator AML1/RUNX1. Both wild type MOZ and MOZ-TIF2 were found to colocalize with AML1, and MOZ-TIF2 was recruited to an AML1 target promoter. A MOZ-CBP fusion protein showed similar functions to MOZ-TIF2 in that it inhibited retinoic acid receptor-mediated transcription but enhanced AML1 reporter activation. Although it contains almost the entire CBP sequence, MOZ-CBP does not appear to associate with PML bodies. In summary, our results indicate that leukemogenic MOZ fusion proteins have differential effects on the activities of CBP-dependent and MOZ-dependent activators because of their ability to alter cofactor recruitment and chromatin modification at target promoters.","['Collins, Hilary M', 'Kindle, Karin B', 'Matsuda, Sachiko', 'Ryan, Colm', 'Troke, Philip J F', 'Kalkhoven, Eric', 'Heery, David M']","['Collins HM', 'Kindle KB', 'Matsuda S', 'Ryan C', 'Troke PJF', 'Kalkhoven E', 'Heery DM']","['School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, United Kingdom.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, United Kingdom.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, United Kingdom.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, United Kingdom.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Metabolic and Endocrine Diseases, University Medical Center Utrecht, Lundlaan 6, 3584 EA Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, United Kingdom.

Overexpression of survivin is associated with increased risk of recurrence and poor outcome in cancer patients. This study aimed to investigate the expression of survivin and its location as well as the relationship between cellular location and expression of survivin and the therapeutic efficacy at the cellular level. METHODS: The expression of survivin protein was detected by immunohistochemical assay in bone marrow cells from 62 children with acute leukemia and 40 hospitalized children who did not have leukemia (Control group), and in a human acute T lymphocytic leukemia cell line (Molt-4 cells) treated in vitro with daunorubicin (DNR). Cell apoptosis was detected using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Survivin protein was expressed in 41.9% of the 62 children with acute leukemia but in only 5.0% of the Control group (chi(2)=16.66; P < 0.01). The expression rate of survivin was 46.2% in cytoplasm and 53.9% in nucleus in the children with acute leukemia (chi(2)0.3077; P> 0.05). However, the remission rate of patients in whom survivin expression was seen in the nucleus was significantly higher than that in patients in whom survivin was expressed in cytoplasm after chemotherapy. The survivin expression in Molt-4 cells decreased remarkably by DNR treatment in a time and dosage-dependent manner. DNR treatment also induced survivin transllocation from cytoplasm to nucleus and cell apoptosis in a time and dosage-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Survivin may play an important role in the development and prognosis of childhood acute leukemia. The different expression pattern of survivin in the cytoplasm and the nucleus may be associated with therapeutic efficacy and prognosis in acute leukemia. DNR may reduce the survivin expression in leukemic cells and induce cell apoptosis.","['Hou, Yan', 'Hu, Qun', 'Liu, Ai-Guo', 'Zhang, Liu-Qing', 'Liu, Shuang-You']","['Hou Y', 'Hu Q', 'Liu AG', 'Zhang LQ', 'Liu SY']","['Research Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology, Tongji Hosipital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*chemistry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Survivin']",2006/04/15 09:00,2006/05/26 09:00,['2006/04/15 09:00'],"['2006/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['1008-8830(2006)02-0101-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2006 Apr;8(2):101-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of rituximab-containing regimens for patients with indolent B-cell lymphoma in China. METHODS: From Mar. 1999 to Jan. 2005, 34 patients with indolent B-cell lymphoma received rituximab-containing regimens with a median of 5 cycles (ranged from 3 to 8 cycles). Of the 34 patients, 2 received rituximab alone, and 32 received rituximab-based regimens, which including CHOP (16 cases), FMD (5 cases), CHOPE (4 cases), EPOCH (2 cases), DICE (2 cases), DAHP (2 cases), and FN (1 case). RESULTS: Of the 34 patients, 30 were evaluable for objective response. The overall response (OR) rate was 93.3%, and the complete response (CR) rate was 60.0%; the OR rate and CR rate of 22 evaluable naive patients were 95.4% and 66.7%, those of 18 evaluable follicular lymphoma patients were 88.9% and 66.7%. With a median follow-up of 17 months (4-68 months), the 1-year progression-freely survival rate was 85.3%. Myelosuppression was the major adverse event: 19 patients suffered from leukopenia with 4 cases of grade III-IV event, 5 suffered from thrombocytopenia with 4 cases of grade III-IV event, and 2 suffered from febrile neutropenia. Other adverse events included grade I-II nausea/vomiting, mild alopecia, and transient liver function abnormality. The infusional reaction of rituximab consisted of grade I-II rigor/febrile, skin rash, mild hypotension, and asymptomatic ventricular premature beat. CONCLUSION: Rituximab-containing chemotherapeutic regimens are effective for indolent B-cell lymphoma with mild toxicity.","['Xia, Zhong-Jun', 'Wang, Feng-Hua', 'Huang, Hui-Qiang', 'Luo, Hui-Yan', 'Li, Yu-Hong', 'Lin, Tong-Yu', 'Jiang, Wen-Qi', 'Guan, Zhong-Zhen']","['Xia ZJ', 'Wang FH', 'Huang HQ', 'Luo HY', 'Li YH', 'Lin TY', 'Jiang WQ', 'Guan ZZ']","['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510060, P.

By contrast, most solid tumor cells are only moderately sensitive to MC540-PDT. The limited activity against solid tumor cells has detracted from MC540's appeal as a broad-spectrum purging agent. We report here that noncytotoxic concentrations of amifostine (Ethyol, Ethiofos, WR-2721) and amphotericin B used either alone or in combination potentiate the MC540-sensitized photoinactivation of leukemia cells, wild-type small cell lung cancer cells and cisplatin-resistant small cell lung cancer cells. Amphotericin B also enhances the MC540-sensitized photoinactivation of normal CFU-GM, whereas amifostine protects CFU-GM against the cytotoxic action of MC540-PDT. The yield of CD34-positive normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells is only minimally diminished by pretreatment with amifostine, amphotericin B or combinations of amifostine plus amphotericin B. Purging protocols that combine MC540-PDT with amifostine or with amifostine plus amphotericin B could offer a simple and effective approach to the purging of autologous stem cell grafts that are contaminated with solid tumor cells or the purging of stem cell grafts from heavily pretreated leukemia patients that contain reduced numbers of normal stem and progenitor cells and, therefore, can ill afford additional losses caused by purging.","['Tsujino, Ichiro', 'Miyagi, Kiyoko', 'Sampson, Reynee W', 'Sieber, Fritz']","['Tsujino I', 'Miyagi K', 'Sampson RW', 'Sieber F']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (Pyrimidinones)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'M487QF2F4V (Amifostine)']",IM,"['Amifostine/*pharmacology', 'Amphotericin B/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', 'Lymphoma/pathology', '*Photochemotherapy/methods', 'Pyrimidinones/*pharmacology', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/04/15 09:00,2006/07/21 09:00,['2006/04/15 09:00'],"['2006/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['2005-09-02-RA-672R [pii]', '10.1562/2005-09-02-RA-672 [doi]']",ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 2006 Mar-Apr;82(2):458-65. doi: 10.1562/2005-09-02-RA-672.,,,,,"['R01 CA077387/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77387/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1626648,,,['NIHMS6429'],,,,,,,,,,

Recent research in cellular and molecular biology has led to the characterization of distinct underlying hematological disorders, primitively involving cells of the myeloid or lymphoid lineage. The ability to classify many hypereosinophilic syndrome patients on the basis of pathogenesis of hypereosinophilia has radically changed therapeutic perspectives. Indeed, imatinib mesylate has become first-line therapy for patients in whom the FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha fusion gene is detected, whereas corticosteroids remain the mainstay for management of patients in whom hypereosinophilia is secondary to the overproduction of interleukin 5 by abnormal T-cells. Use of monoclonal anti-interleukin-5 antibodies in the latter group of patients has a strong rationale and could decrease cumulative corticosteroid doses and toxicity. As far as prognosis of these disease variants is concerned, hypereosinophilic syndrome patients with the FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha fusion gene may develop acute myelogenous (eosinophilic) leukemia, whereas those with clonal interleukin-5-producing T-cells have an increased risk of developing T-cell lymphoma.

We investigated the effects of IFNgamma on native human AML cells. Normal T cells could be activated to release IFNgamma in the presence of AML cells. Furthermore, high levels of CD119 (IFNgamma receptor alpha chain) expression were observed for all 39 patients examined. Receptor expression was decreased after exposure to exogenous IFNgamma, and receptor ligation caused Stat1 phosphorylation but no phosphorylation of the alternative messengers Erk1/2. The effect of exogenous IFNgamma on AML blast proliferation was dependent on the local cytokine network and IFNgamma (1) inhibited proliferation in the presence of exogenous IL1beta, GM-CSF, G-CSF and SCF; (2) had divergent effects in the presence of IL3 and Flt3 (65 patients examined); (3) inhibited proliferation in the presence of endothelial cells but had divergent effects in the presence of fibroblasts, osteoblasts and normal stromal cells (65 patients examined). IFNgamma increased stress-induced (spontaneous) in vitro apoptosis as well as cytarabine-induced apoptosis only for a subset of patients.

We conclude that IFNgamma can be released in the presence of native human AML cells and affect AML cell proliferation, regulation of apoptosis and the balance between pro- and antiangiogenic chemokine release.","['Ersvaer, Elisabeth', 'Skavland, Jorn', 'Ulvestad, Elling', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Ersvaer E', 'Skavland J', 'Ulvestad E', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Bruserud O']","['Institute of Medicine, Section for Hematology, The University of Bergen and Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway. elisabeth.ersvar@med.uib.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (CXCL8 protein, human)', '0 (CXCL9 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL9)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '07MXG07O12 (interferon gamma receptor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Chemokine CXCL9', 'Chemokines, CXC/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1beta/metabolism', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Osteoblasts/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Interferon/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/metabolism']",2006/04/14 09:00,2007/01/17 09:00,['2006/04/14 09:00'],"['2005/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-006-0159-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2007 Jan;56(1):13-24. doi: 10.1007/s00262-006-0159-1.

They play a crucial role in cancer progression by inhibiting the effector function of CD4(+) or CD8(+) T lymphocytes. However, whether regulatory T lymphocytes that expand during tumor progression can modulate dendritic cell function is unclear. To address this issue, we have evaluated the inhibitory potential of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells from mice bearing a BCR-ABL(+) leukemia on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. We present data demonstrating that CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells from tumor-bearing animals impede dendritic cell function by down-regulating the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. The expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80, CD86 and CD40, the production of TNF-alpha, IL-12, and CCL5/RANTES by the suppressed DC is strongly down-regulated. The suppression mechanism requires TGF-beta and IL-10 and is associated with induction of the Smad signaling pathway and activation of the STAT3 transcription factor.","['Larmonier, Nicolas', 'Marron, Marilyn', 'Zeng, Yi', 'Cantrell, Jessica', 'Romanoski, Angela', 'Sepassi, Marjan', 'Thompson, Sylvia', 'Chen, Xinchun', 'Andreansky, Samita', 'Katsanis, Emmanuel']","['Larmonier N', 'Marron M', 'Zeng Y', 'Cantrell J', 'Romanoski A', 'Sepassi M', 'Thompson S', 'Chen X', 'Andreansky S', 'Katsanis E']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Steele Children's Research Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724-5073, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxp3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B7-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'B7-2 Antigen/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'CD4 Antigens/*immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/*physiology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Interleukin-10/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology/prevention & control', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism']",2006/04/14 09:00,2007/01/17 09:00,['2006/04/14 09:00'],"['2006/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-006-0160-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2007 Jan;56(1):48-59. doi: 10.1007/s00262-006-0160-8.

In Brazil, few studies have been published on this. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the high prevalence of French-American-British (FAB) M1 subtype in adults with de novo AML in Sao Jose dos Campos, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective analysis, at Hospital Pio XII in Sao Jose dos Campos, a public non-teaching institution. METHODS: Records from 39 consecutive adult patients with de novo AML referred to Hospital Pio XII between January 2002 and September 2004 were reviewed. Peripheral blood and blood marrow smears were reviewed blindly by five hematologists and classified according to FAB criteria. The rates of remission, relapse, mortality according treatment phase, survival and leukemia-free survival were calculated. RESULTS: The prevalence of each category as determined via a consensus among five observers was M0: 0%; M1: 43.6%; M2: 30.7%; M3: 12.8%; M4: 5.1%; M5: 2.6%: M6: 2.6%; and M7: 2.6%. The remission and the relapse rates were 82% and 41% respectively. The mortality rate was 69% (induction of remission: 7/39, 17.9%; post induction: 10/32, 31.2%; and relapse: 10/16, 62.5%). The survival rate was 30% and leukemia-free survival was 33%. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated a high prevalence of FAB M1 subtype in adults with de novo AML in Sao Jose dos Campos. Our data suggest the occurrence of different regional prevalences of FAB AML categories in Brazil.","['Callera, Fernando', 'Mulin, Carla Cecilia', 'Rosa, Evandro Secchi', 'Melo, Djanete Barbosa de', 'Melo, Claudio Marcelo Tavares Pessoa de']","['Callera F', 'Mulin CC', 'Rosa ES', 'Melo DB', 'Melo CM']","['Hospital Pio XII, Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo, Brazil. fcallera@shhsjc.com.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Brazil,Sao Paulo Med J,Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,100897261,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Distribution', 'Survival Rate']",2006/04/14 09:00,2006/10/13 09:00,['2006/04/14 09:00'],"['2006/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1516-31802006000100010 [pii]', '10.1590/s1516-31802006000100010 [doi]']",ppublish,Sao Paulo Med J. 2006 Jan 5;124(1):45-7. doi: 10.1590/s1516-31802006000100010.

Syncytium induction by TR1.3 has been mapped to a single tryptophan-to-glycine conversion at position 102 of the envelope glycoprotein (Env102). The mechanism of SI by TR1.3 was examined here in comparison to the non-syncytium-inducing, nonpathogenic MLV FB29, which displays an identical BCEC tropism. Envelope protein expression and stability on both infected cells and viral particles were not statistically different for TR1.3 and FB29. However, affinity measurements derived using purified envelope receptor binding domain (RBD) revealed a reduction of >1 log in the K(D) of TR1.3 RBD relative to FB29 RBD. Whole-virus particles pseudotyped with TR1.3 Env similarly displayed a markedly reduced binding avidity compared to FB29-pseudotyped viral particles. Lastly, decreased receptor affinity of TR1.3 Env correlated with the failure to block superinfection following acute and chronic infection by TR1.3. These results definitively show that acquisition of a SI phenotype can be directly linked to amino acid changes in retroviral Env that decrease receptor affinity, thereby emphasizing the importance of events downstream of receptor binding in the cell fusion process and pathology.","['Murphy, Samuel L', 'Chung-Landers, Maeran', 'Honczarenko, Marek', 'Gaulton, Glen N']","['Murphy SL', 'Chung-Landers M', 'Honczarenko M', 'Gaulton GN']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, 354 BRB II/III, 421 Curie Blvd., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-6142, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Cationic Amino Acid Transporter 1)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cationic Amino Acid Transporter 1/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/classification/*metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Superinfection/*virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*metabolism', 'Virion/metabolism']",2006/04/14 09:00,2006/05/23 09:00,['2006/04/14 09:00'],"['2006/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/9/4601 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.80.9.4601-4609.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 May;80(9):4601-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.80.9.4601-4609.2006.,,,,,"['NS-30606/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-GM007229/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 NS030606/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007324/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007229/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-AI007324/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1472024,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The retrovirus ts1, a mutant of Moloney murine leukemia virus, causes oxidative stress and progressive neuro- and immunopathology in mice infected soon after birth. These pathological changes include spongiform neurodegeneration, astrogliosis, thymic atrophy, and T-cell depletion. Astrocytes and thymocytes are directly infected and killed by ts1. Neurons are not infected, but they also die, most likely as an indirect result of local glial infection. Cytopathic effects of ts1 infection in cultured astrocytes are associated with accumulation of the viral envelope precursor protein gPr80env in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which triggers ER stress and oxidative stress. We have reported (i) that activation of the Nrf2 transcription factor and upregulation of antioxidative defenses occurs in astrocytes infected with ts1 in vitro and (ii) that some ts1-infected astrocytes survive infection by mobilization of these pathways. Here, we show that treatment with a refined monosodium alpha-luminol (Galavit; GVT) suppresses oxidative stress and Nrf2 activation in cultured ts1-infected astrocytes. GVT treatment also inhibits the development of spongiform encephalopathy and gliosis in the central nervous system (CNS) in ts1-infected mice, preserves normal cytoarchitecture in the thymus, and delays paralysis, thymic atrophy, wasting, and death. GVT treatment of infected mice reduces ts1-induced oxidative stress, cell death, and pathogenesis in both the CNS and thymus of treated animals. These studies suggest that oxidative stress mediates ts1-induced neurodegeneration and T-cell loss.","['Jiang, Yuhong', 'Scofield, Virginia L', 'Yan, Mingshan', 'Qiang, Wenan', 'Liu, Na', 'Reid, Amy J', 'Lynn, William S', 'Wong, Paul K Y']","['Jiang Y', 'Scofield VL', 'Yan M', 'Qiang W', 'Liu N', 'Reid AJ', 'Lynn WS', 'Wong PK']","['The University of Texas M.

The core IKK consists of two catalytic serine kinases, IKKalpha and IKKbeta, and a noncatalytic subunit, IKKgamma. IKKgamma is required for IKK activity by mediating kinase oligomerization and serving to couple the core catalytic subunits to upstream mitogen-activated protein 3-kinase cascades. We have discovered an alternatively spliced IKKgamma mRNA isoform, encoding an in-frame deletion of exon 5, termed IKKgamma-delta. Using a specific reverse transcription-PCR assay, we find that IKKgamma-delta is widely expressed in cultured human cells and normal human tissues. Because IKKgamma-Delta protein is lacking a critical coiled-coil domain important in protein-protein interactions, we sought to determine its signaling properties by examining its ability to self associate, couple to activators of the canonical pathway, and mediate human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax-induced NF-kappaB activity. Coimmunoprecipitation and confocal colocalization assays indicate IKKgamma-delta has strong homo- and heterotypic association with wild-type (WT) IKKgamma and, like IKKgamma WT, associates with the IKKbeta kinase. Similarly, IKKgamma-delta mediates IKK kinase activity and downstream NF-kappaB-dependent transcription in response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and the NF-kappaB-inducing kinase-IKKalpha signaling pathway. Surprisingly, however, in contrast to IKKgamma WT, IKKgamma-delta is not able to mediate HTLV-1 Tax-induced NF-kappaB-dependent transcription, even though IKKgamma-delta binds and colocalizes with Tax. These observations suggest that IKKgamma-delta is a functionally distinct alternatively spliced mRNA product differentially mediating TNF-induced, but not Tax-induced, signals converging on the IKK signalsome. Differing levels of IKKgamma-delta expression, therefore, may affect signal transduction cascades coupling to IKK.","['Hai, Tao', 'Yeung, Man-Lung', 'Wood, Thomas G', 'Wei, Yuanfen', 'Yamaoka, Shoji', 'Gatalica, Zoran', 'Jeang, Kuan-Teh', 'Brasier, Allan R']","['Hai T', 'Yeung ML', 'Wood TG', 'Wei Y', 'Yamaoka S', 'Gatalica Z', 'Jeang KT', 'Brasier AR']","['Department of Internal Medicine, The University of Texas Medical Branch, 301 University Blvd., Galveston, Texas 77555-1060, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (NF-kappa B kinase)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Exons/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/*genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",2006/04/14 09:00,2006/05/23 09:00,['2006/04/14 09:00'],"['2006/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/9/4227 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.80.9.4227-4241.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 May;80(9):4227-41. doi: 10.1128/JVI.80.9.4227-4241.2006.,,,,,"['N01HV28184/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AI062885/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HV-28184/HV/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '40218/PHS HHS/United States', 'P01 AI62885/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES06676/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES006676/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1472011,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The conditioning regimen for SCT consisted of busulfan (BU) 16 mg/kg and melfalan (MEL) 180 mg/m2 (BUMEL) in 17 (40%) patients and busulfan 16 mg/kg and VP-16 60 mg/kg (BUVP16) in 22 (52%) patients. Three patients received a different conditioning regimen with BCNU 300 mg/m2, VP16 2 g/m2 and melphalan 160 mg/m2 (BEM). Twenty five (60%) patients received bone marrow (BM), 11 (26%) patients received peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) and 6 patients (14%) received BM plus PBSC. With a median follow-up of 7 years, the 13 year overall survival (OS) and diseasefree survival (DFS) of all patients is 52% and 40%, respectively. In univariate analysis, males had a significantly superior DFS than females (55% vs 22%, p=0.003), and patients younger than 15 years of age had significantly superior OS and DFS than older patients (50% vs 35%, p=0.05; and 50% vs 28%, p=0.03, respectively). Patients with FAB M3 subtype also had a superior OS than the other FAB subtypes (100% vs 44%, p=0.05). There was a strong statistical correlation between risk group and survival. In fact, the patients with standard risk had a superior OS and DFS than those with high risk disease (67% vs 23%, p=0.0004; and 50% vs 27%, p=0.01, respectively). When patients with FAB M3 disease were excluded from the analysis, the group with standard risk continue to have a superior OS and DFS (67% vs 13%, p=0.008; and 50% vs 14%, p=0.02, respectively). We conclude that autologous SCT is an effective treatment in AML with the possibility of long survivorship, particularly in patients with standard risk disease.","['Martins, Carlos', 'Lacerda, Joao F', 'Lourenco, Fernanda', 'Carmo, Jose A', 'Lacerda, J M F']","['Martins C', 'Lacerda JF', 'Lourenco F', 'Carmo JA', 'Lacerda JM']","['Unidade de Transplante de Medula Ossea, Hospital de Santa Maria, Faculdade de Medicina de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Portugal,Acta Med Port,Acta medica portuguesa,7906803,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/04/14 09:00,2006/05/13 09:00,['2006/04/14 09:00'],"['2006/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Med Port. 2005 Sep-Oct;18(5):329-37.

They are either membrane-bound or solubly expressed during certain tumoral malignancies. Soluble human leukocyte antigen G (sHLA-G) molecules seem more frequently expressed than membrane-bound isoforms during hematologic malignancies, such as lymphoproliferative disorders. Assay of these molecules by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in patients suffering from another hematologic disorder (acute leukemia) highlights increased sHLA-G secretion. This increased secretion seems more marked in acute leukemia subtypes affecting monocytic and lymphoid lineages such as FABM4 and FABM5, as well as both B and T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Moreover, this study uses in vitro cytokine stimulations and reveals the respective potential roles of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interferon-gamma in increasing this secretion in FABM4 and ALL. Correlations between sHLA-G plasma level and clinical biologic features suggest a link between elevated sHLA-G level and 1) the absence of anterior myelodysplasia and 2) high-level leukocytosis. All these findings suggest that sHLA-G molecules could be a factor in tumoral escape from immune survey during acute leukemia.","['Gros, Frederic', 'Sebti, Yasmine', 'de Guibert, Sophie', 'Branger, Bernard', 'Bernard, Marc', 'Fauchet, Renee', 'Amiot, Laurence']","['Gros F', 'Sebti Y', 'de Guibert S', 'Branger B', 'Bernard M', 'Fauchet R', 'Amiot L']","['UPRES EA 3889, Immunologie/Hematologie, Universite de Rennes 1, Rennes Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-G Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/*blood/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/blood/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/chemistry/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytokines/blood/pharmacology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HLA Antigens/biosynthesis/*blood/genetics', 'HLA-G Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/biosynthesis/*blood/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/classification/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/classification/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Escape']",2006/04/14 09:00,2006/09/01 09:00,['2006/04/14 09:00'],"['2006/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1593/neo.05703 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 2006 Mar;8(3):223-30. doi: 10.1593/neo.05703.,,,,,,PMC1578523,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five patients achieved both CR and had leukaemia cells that successfully underwent differentiation and therefore proceeded to vaccination. Four escalating doses of DLLC were administered weekly by subcutaneous injection. Vaccination was generally well tolerated although one patient developed extensive eczema and an increased antinuclear factor titre possibly indicating induction of autoimmunity. Development of anti-leukaemic T-cell responses was assessed by enzyme-linked immunospot analysis of gamma-interferon secreting T lymphocytes and by human leucocyte antigen tetramer analysis for WT1-specific T cells. Increases in anti-leukaemic T-cell responses were demonstrated in four patients, but only two of the five remained in remission more than 12 months postvaccination.

Recently, noncanonical ligands have been proposed for Src homology 2 domains including that of Abl and its breakpoint cluster region fusion, which causes chronic myelogenous leukemia. Here, the Abl Src homology 2 domain's binding sites and affinities for phosphotyrosine- and phosphoserine-containing motifs, phosphoinositides as well as a pyridone-based peptidomimetic inhibitor were determined using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in order to define their roles. The cognate Crk peptide ligand was bound with an affinity of 69 microM and, like the higher affinity peptidomimetic, engages the phosphotyrosine and +3 hydrophobic pockets while putative phosphoserine-containing breakpoint cluster region ligands are ruled out. Surprisingly, phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 bisphosphate interacts with an overlapping site through an electrostatic mechanism that does not appear to involve hydrophobic insertion into micelles. The conserved Arg36 residue in the FLVRES motif is required for both phosphotyrosine binding and for localization to phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 bisphosphate-containing liposomes, while Arg59 in the betaD strand is necessary for the phosphoinositide interaction. Thus the Src homology 2 domain of Abl, a myristoylated and membrane-localized protein, is able to interact directly with phosphoinositides through a multifunctional basic site that overlaps the phosphotyrosine pocket.","['Tokonzaba, Etienne', 'Capelluto, Daniel G S', 'Kutateladze, Tatiana G', 'Overduin, Michael']","['Tokonzaba E', 'Capelluto DG', 'Kutateladze TG', 'Overduin M']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center,12801 East 17th Avenue, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Chem Biol Drug Des,Chemical biology & drug design,101262549,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Micelles)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Phosphopeptides)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0I3V7S25AW (Myristic Acid)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ligands', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Micelles', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Myristic Acid/chemistry/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositols/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Phosphopeptides/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine/chemistry/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyridones/chemistry/*metabolism', '*src Homology Domains/genetics']",2006/04/14 09:00,2007/03/10 09:00,['2006/04/14 09:00'],"['2006/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['JPP361 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1747-0285.2006.00361.x [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Drug Des. 2006 Mar;67(3):230-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1747-0285.2006.00361.x.,,,,,"['071684/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'A4592/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'BBS/B/10714/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']",PMC2610419,,,['UKMS1314'],['Chem Biol Drug Des. 2006 Jun;67(6):450'],,,['NLM: UKMS1314'],,,,,,

Zoonoses have given rise to devastating diseases because the host organism is not prepared to resist a new pathogen. Mammals have developed several layers of defense against viruses, including an intracellular antiretroviral defense, a part of innate immunity. Retroviral restrictions had been studied for decades using murine leukemia virus in mice, however it has become clear that primates too have intrinsic mechanisms to ward off infections by retroviruses. Several of these antiretroviral restriction mechanisms have recently been identified, with two particularly well described factors being members of the tripartite motif (Trim) and APOBEC families. Both systems provide a strong barrier against lentiviral infections. The viruses have developed countermeasures that allow them to replicate despite the host factors. This review discusses our current knowledge of this ancient battle between mammalian hosts and their retroviral opponents.","['Baumann, Jorg G']",['Baumann JG'],"['HIV Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland 21702-1201, USA. jbaumann@ncifcrf.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr HIV Res,Current HIV research,101156990,"['0 (Antiviral Restriction Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Fv1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gene Products, vif)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC-3G Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3G protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['APOBEC-3G Deaminase', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Restriction Factors', 'Carrier Proteins/*immunology', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'Gene Products, vif/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/*immunology', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/*immunology', 'Proteins/immunology', 'Repressor Proteins/*immunology', 'Retroviridae/immunology/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Virus Replication']",2006/04/14 09:00,2006/06/23 09:00,['2006/04/14 09:00'],"['2006/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/157016206776055093 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr HIV Res. 2006 Apr;4(2):141-68. doi: 10.2174/157016206776055093.,,,,,,,407,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Microarray expression data were available for 15,315 genes and 111 female subjects enrolled from a population-based study on chronic fatigue syndrome. Algorithms were developed to assign gene scores and threshold values that signified the contribution of each gene to discriminate the multiclasses in each LCA solution. Unsupervised dimensionality reduction was first used to remove noise or otherwise uninformative gene combinations, followed by supervised dimensionality reduction to isolate gene combinations that best separate the classes. RESULTS: The authors' gene score and threshold algorithms identified 32 and 26 genes capable of discriminating the five and six multiclass solutions, respectively. Pair-wise comparisons suggested that some genes (zinc finger protein 350 [ZNF350], solute carrier family 1, member 6 [SLC1A6], F-box protein 7 [FBX07] and vacuole 14 protein homolog [VAC14]) distinguished most classes of fatigued subjects from healthy subjects, whereas others (patched homolog 2 [PTCH2] and T-cell leukemia/lymphoma [TCL1A]) differentiated specific fatigue classes. CONCLUSION: A computational approach was developed for general use to identify discriminatory genes in any multiclass problem. Using this approach, differences in gene expression were found to discriminate some classes of unexplained chronic fatigue, particularly one termed interoception.","['Carmel, Liran', 'Efroni, Sol', 'White, Peter D', 'Aslakson, Eric', 'Vollmer-Conna, Ute', 'Rajeevan, Mangalathu S']","['Carmel L', 'Efroni S', 'White PD', 'Aslakson E', 'Vollmer-Conna U', 'Rajeevan MS']","['National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Pharmacogenomics,Pharmacogenomics,100897350,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Computational Biology', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic/*classification/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Principal Component Analysis']",2006/04/14 09:00,2006/06/13 09:00,['2006/04/14 09:00'],"['2006/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2217/14622416.7.3.375 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacogenomics. 2006 Apr;7(3):375-86. doi: 10.2217/14622416.7.3.375.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PML/RAR alpha mRNA was determined by nested-PCR, and the Survivin mRNA was tested by RT-PCR. The expression of caspase 3 protein in NB4 cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. RESULT: The growth of NB4 cells was inhibited significantly after treated with berbamine at different concentrations for different time points, the IC(50)value was 3.860 microg/ml at 48 hours. Morphology analysis showed the characteristics of apoptosis, and the DNA agarose electrophoresis showed the typical DNA ladder. The apoptosis rate increased from 2.83% to 58.44% after treated with berbamine at 12 microg/ml for 48 hours. The expression of PML/RAR alpha mRNA presented no significant changes, however, Survivin mRNA was decreased dramatically.

The most common chromosomal aberrations were +8, -20/20q-, -Y, translocation, -7/7q-, +9, -5/5q-. The rate of abnormal karyotype in refractory anemia with erythroblasts (RAEB) and refractory anemia erythroblasts-transformation (RAEB-t) was much higher than in refractory anemia (RA). Patients with abnormal karyotype or higher IPSS scores had a higher risk of transformation into acute leukemia than patients with normal karyotype or lower IPSS scores (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: MDS is a highly heterogenous disorder and karyotype analysis is helpful for its diagnosis and prognosis estimation.","['Pan, Han-zhang', 'Chen, Zhi-mei', 'Lou, Ji-yu', 'Xu, Wei-lai', 'Jin, Ji']","['Pan HZ', 'Chen ZM', 'Lou JY', 'Xu WL', 'Jin J']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

Historically, patients with FA and myeloid malignancy have extremely poor outcomes. There are currently no clinical trials or case series addressing the use of chemotherapy for children with FA, except in the context of preparative regimens for stem cell transplantation (SCT). In this report we describe the toxicity of a chemotherapy approach for patients with FA and myeloid malignancy to achieve cytoreduction prior to SCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four patients with FA and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were treated with chemotherapy (fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) and cytosine arabinoside 300 mg/m(2) each on days 2-4 and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) 5 microg/kg on days 1-5), termed reduced intensity FLAG prior to SCT. RESULTS: The chemotherapy was well tolerated with expected hematologic toxicity and no measurable toxicity in other organs. Two of the three patients with AML cleared blasts from their bone marrow. Reduction in marrow cellularity was also achieved in one patient with hypercellular MDS. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that children with FA and myeloid malignancy can tolerate chemotherapy and achieve clearance of disease. It remains unclear whether pre-SCT chemotherapy improves currently poor survival rates for SCT in FA patients with myeloid malignancies and further studies are needed to determine if there is a clinical role for this strategy.","['Mehta, Parinda A', 'Ileri, Talia', 'Harris, Richard E', 'Williams, David A', 'Mo, Jun', 'Smolarek, Teresa', 'Auerbach, Arleen D', 'Kelly, Patrick', 'Davies, Stella M']","['Mehta PA', 'Ileri T', 'Harris RE', 'Williams DA', 'Mo J', 'Smolarek T', 'Auerbach AD', 'Kelly P', 'Davies SM']","[""Fanconi Anemia Comprehensive Care Center, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Cincinnati, Ohio 45229, USA.

Most patients with localized disease usually have a favorable prognosis, but patients with advanced disease have a poor prognosis despite combination chemotherapy. Treatment failure may be attributable to resistance to cytotoxic drugs. PROCEDURE: Using quantitative RT-PCR, we investigated the clinical significance of the level of mRNA expression of multidrug resistance genes (MDR1, MRP1, MRP5, LRP) in a series of 29 advanced neuroblastoma samples. RESULTS: At the end of induction chemotherapy, 48% of patients achieved a clinical complete response, 28% achieved a partial response or stable disease, and 24% presented progressive disease. MDR1 mRNA overexpression (i.e., mRNA level >2 copies of MDR1 gene) was observed in 74% of samples, and MRP1, MRP5, LRP overexpression was observed less frequently (30, 33, and 33% of samples, respectively). None of these parameters were predictive of response, relapse, or survival. However, clinical response to treatment was highly predictive of relapse-free survival and overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: High expression of these multidrug resistance genes in advanced neuroblastoma is not the main parameter of response to cytotoxic drugs; clinical response to treatment remains the most important parameter in predicting the prognosis of patients with advanced neuroblastoma, until other relevant laboratory parameters have been identified.","['de Cremoux, Patricia', 'Jourdan-Da-Silva, Nathalie', 'Couturier, Jerome', 'Tran-Perennou, Carine', 'Schleiermacher, Gudrun', 'Fehlbaum, Pascale', 'Doz, Francois', 'Mosseri, Veronique', 'Delattre, Olivier', 'Klijanienko, Jerzy', 'Vielh, Philippe', 'Michon, Jean']","['de Cremoux P', 'Jourdan-Da-Silva N', 'Couturier J', 'Tran-Perennou C', 'Schleiermacher G', 'Fehlbaum P', 'Doz F', 'Mosseri V', 'Delattre O', 'Klijanienko J', 'Vielh P', 'Michon J']","[""Department of Tumor Biology, Institut Curie, 26 rue d'Ulm, Paris Cedex, France. patricia.de-cremoux@curie.net""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (ABCC5 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/ultrastructure', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Computer Systems', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Genes, MDR', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Neuroblastoma/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'S Phase', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/pharmacology']",2006/04/13 09:00,2007/04/04 09:00,['2006/04/13 09:00'],"['2006/04/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20853 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Mar;48(3):311-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20853.,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations or variants that impair function of RNase L, particularly R462Q, have been proposed as susceptibility factors for prostate cancer. Given the role of this gene in viral defense, we sought to explore the possibility that a viral infection might contribute to prostate cancer in individuals harboring the R462Q variant. A viral detection DNA microarray composed of oligonucleotides corresponding to the most conserved sequences of all known viruses identified the presence of gammaretroviral sequences in cDNA samples from seven of 11 R462Q-homozygous (QQ) cases, and in one of eight heterozygous (RQ) and homozygous wild-type (RR) cases. An expanded survey of 86 tumors by specific RT-PCR detected the virus in eight of 20 QQ cases (40%), compared with only one sample (1.5%) among 66 RQ and RR cases. The full-length viral genome was cloned and sequenced independently from three positive QQ cases. The virus, named XMRV, is closely related to xenotropic murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs), but its sequence is clearly distinct from all known members of this group. Comparison of gag and pol sequences from different tumor isolates suggested infection with the same virus in all cases, yet sequence variation was consistent with the infections being independently acquired. Analysis of prostate tissues from XMRV-positive cases by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed that XMRV nucleic acid and protein can be detected in about 1% of stromal cells, predominantly fibroblasts and hematopoietic elements in regions adjacent to the carcinoma. These data provide to our knowledge the first demonstration that xenotropic MuLV-related viruses can produce an authentic human infection, and strongly implicate RNase L activity in the prevention or clearance of infection in vivo. These findings also raise questions about the possible relationship between exogenous infection and cancer development in genetically susceptible individuals.","['Urisman, Anatoly', 'Molinaro, Ross J', 'Fischer, Nicole', 'Plummer, Sarah J', 'Casey, Graham', 'Klein, Eric A', 'Malathi, Krishnamurthy', 'Magi-Galluzzi, Cristina', 'Tubbs, Raymond R', 'Ganem, Don', 'Silverman, Robert H', 'DeRisi, Joseph L']","['Urisman A', 'Molinaro RJ', 'Fischer N', 'Plummer SJ', 'Casey G', 'Klein EA', 'Malathi K', 'Magi-Galluzzi C', 'Tubbs RR', 'Ganem D', 'Silverman RH', 'DeRisi JL']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Retracted Publication']",United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.26.- (2-5A-dependent ribonuclease)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Endoribonucleases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gammaretrovirus/genetics/*isolation & purification', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome, Viral', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/virology']",2006/04/13 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/04/13 09:00'],"['2005/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/04/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.ppat.0020025 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2006 Mar;2(3):e25. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.0020025.

It may also help predict which patients benefit from advances in adjuvant chemotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To compare differences in benefits from adjuvant chemotherapy achieved by patients with ER-negative vs ER-positive tumors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Trial data from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B and US Breast Cancer Intergroup analyzed; patient outcomes by ER status compared using hazards over time and multivariate models. Randomized trials comparing (1): 3 regimens of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (January 1985 to April 1991); (2) 3 doses of doxorubicin concurrent with cyclophosphamide, with or without subsequent paclitaxel (May 1994 to April 1997); (3) sequential doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and cyclophosphamide with concurrent doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel, and also 3-week vs 2-week cycles (September 1997 to March 1999). A total of 6644 node-positive breast cancer patients received adjuvant treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease-free and overall survival. RESULTS: For ER-negative tumors, chemotherapy improvements reduced the relative risk of recurrence by 21%, 25%, and 23% in the 3 studies, respectively, and 55% comparing the lowest dose in the first study with biweekly cycles in the third study. Corresponding relative risk reductions for ER-positive tumors treated with tamoxifen were 9%, 12%, and 8% in the 3 studies, and 26% overall. The overall mortality rate reductions associated with chemotherapy improvements were 55% and 23% among ER-negative and ER-positive patients, respectively. All individual ER-negative comparisons and no ER-positive comparisons were statistically significant. Absolute benefits due to chemotherapy were greater for patients with ER-negative compared with ER-positive tumors: 22.8% more ER-negative patients survived to 5 years disease-free if receiving chemotherapy vs 7.0% for ER-positive patients; corresponding improvements for overall survival were 16.7% vs 4.0%. CONCLUSION: Among patients with node-positive tumors, ER-negative breast cancer, biweekly doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide plus paclitaxel lowers the rate of recurrence and death by more than 50% in comparison with low-dose cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil as used in the first study.","['Berry, Donald A', 'Cirrincione, Constance', 'Henderson, I Craig', 'Citron, Marc L', 'Budman, Daniel R', 'Goldstein, Lori J', 'Martino, Silvana', 'Perez, Edith A', 'Muss, Hyman B', 'Norton, Larry', 'Hudis, Clifford', 'Winer, Eric P']","['Berry DA', 'Cirrincione C', 'Henderson IC', 'Citron ML', 'Budman DR', 'Goldstein LJ', 'Martino S', 'Perez EA', 'Muss HB', 'Norton L', 'Hudis C', 'Winer EP']","['University of Texas M.

Following remission induction, 1018 patients were randomized to receive IT MTX and 1009 ITT. Multivariate analysis identified male sex, hepatomegaly, CNS-2 status, and age younger than 2 or older than 6 years as significant predictors of isolated CNS (iCNS) relapse. The 6-year cumulative incidence estimates of iCNS relapse are 3.4% +/- 1.0% for ITT and 5.9% +/- 1.2% for IT MTX; P = .004. Significantly more relapses occurred in bone marrow (BM) and testicles with ITT than IT MTX, particularly among patients with T-cell phenotype or day 14 BM aspirate containing 5% to 25% blasts. Thus, the estimated 6-year event-free survivals (EFS) with ITT or IT MTX are equivalent at 80.7% +/- 1.9% and 82.5% +/- 1.8%, respectively (P = .3). Because the salvage rate after BM relapse is inferior to that after CNS relapse, the 6-year overall survival (OS) for ITT is 90.3% +/- 1.5% versus 94.4% +/- 1.1% for IT MTX (P = .01).

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: K562 and LAMA 84 cells were exposed to varying concentrations of DMAG and PD184352 for 48 hours; after which, mitochondrial integrity, caspase activation, and apoptosis were monitored. Parallel studies were done in imatinib mesylate-resistant cells, including BaF3 cells transfected with plasmids encoding clinically relevant Bcr/abl mutations conferring imatinib mesylate resistance (e.g., E255K, M351T, and T315I) and primary CD34(+) bone marrow cells from patients refractory to imatinib mesylate. RESULTS: Cotreatment of Bcr/abl(+) cells with minimally toxic concentrations of DMAG and PD184352 resulted in synergistic induction of mitochondrial injury (cytochrome c release and Bax conformational change), events associated with the pronounced and sustained inactivation of ERK1/2 accompanied by down-regulation of Bcl-x(L). Conversely, cells ectopically expressing Bcl-x(L) displayed significant protection against PD184352/DMAG-mediated lethality. This regimen effectively induced apoptosis in K562 cells overexpressing Bcr/abl, in BaF3 cells expressing various clinically relevant Bcr/abl mutations, and in primary CD34(+) cells from patients resistant to imatinib mesylate, but was relatively sparing of normal CD34(+) bone marrow cells. CONCLUSIONS: A regimen combining the heat shock protein 90 antagonist DMAG and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase 1/2 inhibitor potently induces apoptosis in Bcr/abl(+) cells, including those resistant to imatinib mesylate through various mechanisms including Bcr/abl kinase mutations, through a process that may involve sustained ERK1/2 inactivation and Bcl-x(L) down-regulation. This strategy warrants further attention in Bcr/abl(+) hematopoietic malignancies, particularly those resistant to Bcr/abl kinase inhibitors.","['Nguyen, Tri K', 'Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Gao, Ning', 'Kramer, Lora', 'Corbin, Amie S', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Nguyen TK', 'Rahmani M', 'Gao N', 'Kramer L', 'Corbin AS', 'Druker BJ', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (2-(2-chloro-4-iodophenylamino)-N-cyclopropylmethoxy-3,4-difluorobenzamide)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinones)', '001L2FE0M3 (17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Benzoquinones', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Quinones/*pharmacology', 'Rifabutin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/04/13 09:00,2006/07/19 09:00,['2006/04/13 09:00'],"['2006/04/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/7/2239 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-2282 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Apr 1;12(7 Pt 1):2239-47. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-2282.,,,,,"['CA 100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA72955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA88906/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Native EPO regulates erythropoiesis, at least in part, by protecting erythroid progenitor cells from apoptotic cell death. The recent discovery of the EPO receptor (EPOR) on cancer cells raises the concern that EPO therapy might stimulate tumor growth and/or protect cancer cells from drug-induced apoptosis. Therefore, the capacity of EPO to interfere with the effects of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs on proliferation, apoptosis, and the induction of senescence was investigated in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 breast tumor cells, which express the EPOR as well as in F-MEL erythroleukemia cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Breast cancer cells and F-MEL leukemic cells were cultured in the presence or absence of EPO and then exposed to antitumor drugs. Cell proliferation was assessed by a standard 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide dye reduction assay 72 hours after drug exposure. Cytotoxicity was monitored by clonogenic survival. Apoptosis was evaluated either by the terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated nick-end labeling assay or fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, and senescence was monitored by beta-galactosidase staining. EPO signaling was assessed by monitoring the phosphorylation/activation of specific signaling proteins. RESULTS: EPO failed to stimulate the proliferation of MCF-7 or MDA-MB231 breast tumor cells or F-MEL leukemic cells. EPO treatment also failed to interfere with the antiproliferative and/or cytotoxic effects of Adriamycin, Taxol, and tamoxifen in breast tumor cells (or of cytarabine and daunorubicin in F-MEL cells). EPO failed to prevent apoptosis induced by Taxol or senescence induced by Adriamycin in MCF-7 cells. EPO stimulated the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38, and c-Jun-NH(2)-kinase in MCF-7 cells but did not activate Akt or signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5). EPO failed to activate any of these signaling pathways in MDA-MB231 cells. Cytarabine and daunorubicin interfered with EPO signaling in F-MEL cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that EPO is unlikely to directly counteract the effectiveness of cancer chemotherapeutic drugs. This may be a consequence of either ineffective signaling through the EPOR or drug-mediated suppression of EPO signaling.","['Gewirtz, David A', 'Di, Xu', 'Walker, Teneille D', 'Sawyer, Stephen T']","['Gewirtz DA', 'Di X', 'Walker TD', 'Sawyer ST']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA. gewirtz@hsc.vcu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tamoxifen/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/04/13 09:00,2006/07/19 09:00,['2006/04/13 09:00'],"['2006/04/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/7/2232 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-2287 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Apr 1;12(7 Pt 1):2232-8. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-2287.,,,,,"['R01 DK39781/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL65906/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate whether PTP1B modulates the biological effects of the abl kinase inhibitor STI571 in BCR-ABL-positive cells, we transfected Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia cell-derived K562 cells with either wild-type PTP1B (K562/PTP1B), a substrate-trapping dominant-negative mutant PTP1B (K562/D181A), or empty vector (K562/mock). Cells were cultured with or without STI571 and analyzed for its effects on proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In both K562/mock and K562/PTP1B cells, 0.25 to 1 mumol/L STI571 induced dose-dependent growth arrest and apoptosis, as measured by a decrease of cell proliferation and an increase of Annexin V-positive cells and/or of cells in the sub-G(1) apoptotic phase. Western blot analysis showed increased protein levels of activated caspase-3 and caspase-8 and induction of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Low concentrations of STI571 promoted erythroid differentiation of these cells. Conversely, K562/D181A cells displayed significantly lower PTP1B-specific tyrosine phosphatase activity and were significantly less sensitive to STI571-induced growth arrest, apoptosis, and erythroid differentiation. Pharmacologic inhibition of PTP1B activity in wild-type K562 cells, using bis(N,N-dimethylhydroxamido)hydroxooxovanadate, attenuated STI571-induced apoptosis. Lastly, comparison of the STI571-sensitive Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line SupB15 with a STI571-resistant subline revealed significantly decreased PTP1B activity and enhanced BCR-ABL phosphorylation in the STI571-resistant SupB15 cells.

RESULTS: Our studies demonstrated that constitutively over-expressed active Notch1, via stable transfection of exogenous ICN (intracellular fragment of Notch), resulted in growth suppression of the human tongue cancer cell line Tca8113 in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by G(0)-G(1) cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, down-regulation of beta-catenin protein expression was observed in Tca8113 cells stably expressing active Notch1. Activated Notch1 also led to dramatic increase in p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p53 expression with decreases in Skp2 (S-phase kinase-associated protein 2) and Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphocytic-leukaemia proto-oncogene 2) expression, which may participate in the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. CONCLUSIONS: Since the effects of the Notch1 pathway are cell-type specific and context-dependent in cell types where Notch1 has an anti-proliferative effect, down-regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling may be one of the mechanisms which induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.","['Duan, Li', 'Yao, Jun', 'Wu, Xinxing', 'Fan, Mingwen']","['Duan L', 'Yao J', 'Wu X', 'Fan M']","[""Key Laboratory for Oral Biomedical Engineering of Ministry of Education, School and Hospital of Stomatology, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei 430079, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biol Cell,Biology of the cell,8108529,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry/metabolism', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Shape/genetics/physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*physiology', 'Tongue Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'beta Catenin/genetics/*metabolism']",2006/04/13 09:00,2006/11/04 09:00,['2006/04/13 09:00'],"['2006/04/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['BC20060020 [pii]', '10.1042/BC20060020 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Cell. 2006 Aug;98(8):479-90. doi: 10.1042/BC20060020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Fourteen cases were treated with MCC regimen (Melphanlan 170 mg/m2 x d x 1, MeCCNU 400 mg/m2 x d x 1, CTX 60 mg/kg x d x 2) and the median follow up time was 6 years; 16 cases were treated with BuCy regimen (Busulfan 4 mg/kg x d x 4, CTX 60 mg/kg x d x 2) and the median follow up time was 4 year. RESULTS: All the patients were engrafted successfully. 4 of 10 patients examined in MCC group showed mixed chimerism at day 100 after transplantation, whereas only 1 of 12 patients examined in BuCy group showed mixed chimerism. All the patients became complete donor source later without any DLI. The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 71.4% for MCC group and 62.5% for BuCy group. The transplant related mortality and relapse rate were 21% and 7% for MCC group, whereas those were 25% and 12% for BuCy group, respectively. The regimen related toxicity was relatively lower in MCC group and the median duration of hospitalization was 39 days (25-55 days) for patients with MCC regimen, and 55 days (39-90 days) for BuCy regimen. CONCLUSION: MCC regimen has a partial ablative effect on CML and the long term disease-free survival is the same as that of BuCy regimen. In regard to the cost-effect efficacy, MCC regimen has a substantial advantage over BuCy regimen.","['Jia, Yong-Qian', 'Liu, Ting', 'Xu, Cai-Gang', 'Niu, Ting', 'Meng, Wen-Tong', 'Lu, Jian-Chun', 'Wang, Hui', 'Leng, Ya-Mei']","['Jia YQ', 'Liu T', 'Xu CG', 'Niu T', 'Meng WT', 'Lu JC', 'Wang H', 'Leng YM']","['Division of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.']",['chi'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Sichuan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Sichuan da xue xue bao.

These T cells may be genetically modified by incorporation of a replication-incompetent viral vector (NIT) encoding both an inactive mutant nerve growth factor receptor (LNGFR), as an immunoselectable surface marker, and a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK), rendering the cells sensitive to ganciclovir. The current studies are based on the selective HSV-TK-catalyzed trapping (phosphorylation) of the thymidine analog [(131)I]-2'-fluoro-2'-deoxy-1-beta-D-arabinofuransyl-5-iodo-uracil (FIAU) as a means of stably labeling such T cells for in vivo trafficking (including tumor targeting) studies. Because of the radiosensitivity of lymphocytes and the potentially high absorbed dose to the nucleus from intracellular (131)I (even at tracer levels), the nucleus absorbed dose (D ( n )) and dose-dependent immune functionality were evaluated for NIT(+) T cells labeled ex vivo in [(131)I]FIAU-containing medium. METHODS: Based on in vitro kinetic studies of [(131)I]FIAU uptake by NIT(+) T cells, D ( n ) was calculated using an adaptation of the MIRD formalism and the recently published MIRD cellular S factors. Immune cytotoxicity of [(131)I]FIAU-labeled cells was assayed against (51)Cr-labeled target cells [B-lymphoblastoid cells (BLCLs)] in a standard 4-h release assay. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: At median nuclear absorbed doses up to 830 cGy, a (51)Cr-release assay against BLCLs showed no loss of immune cytotoxicity, thus demonstrating the functional integrity of genetically transduced, tumor-reactive T cells labeled at this dose level for in vivo cell trafficking and tumor targeting studies.","['Zanzonico, Pat', 'Koehne, Guenther', 'Gallardo, Humilidad F', 'Doubrovin, Mikhail', 'Doubrovina, Ekaterina', 'Finn, Ronald', 'Blasberg, Ronald G', 'Riviere, Isabelle', ""O'Reilly, Richard J"", 'Sadelain, Michel', 'Larson, Steven M']","['Zanzonico P', 'Koehne G', 'Gallardo HF', 'Doubrovin M', 'Doubrovina E', 'Finn R', 'Blasberg RG', 'Riviere I', ""O'Reilly RJ"", 'Sadelain M', 'Larson SM']","['Department of Medical Physics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY, USA. zanzonip@MSKCC.ORG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Germany,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,101140988,"['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '3083-77-0 (Arabinofuranosyluracil)', '53T7IN77LC (fialuridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arabinofuranosyluracil/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/diagnostic imaging/immunology/therapy', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/*immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/pharmacokinetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/pharmacokinetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2006/04/12 09:00,2007/04/19 09:00,['2006/04/12 09:00'],"['2005/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00259-005-0057-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. 2006 Sep;33(9):988-97. doi: 10.1007/s00259-005-0057-3.

Multiple myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance are the most common monoclonal gammopathies; the two comprise a spectrum of disorders, ranging from a relatively benign disease, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, to a malignant disease, multiple myeloma. Aberrant promoter methylation represents a primary mechanism of gene silencing during tumorigenesis. DNA repair systems act to maintain genome integrity in the presence of replication errors, environmental insults, and the cumulative effects of aging. The methylation patterns of two genes implicated in DNA repair, O6 methylguanine DNA methyl-transferase (MGMT) and human mutL homologue1 (hMLH1) have been detected in various solid tumours. With the purpose of studying the gene silencing of MGMT and hMLH1 in plasma cell disorders, we investigated the methylation status and expression of both genes in: 29 cases of multiple myeloma; one case of plasma cell leukaemia; 13 cases of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance; and two cases of polyclonal plasmacytosis, using methylation-specific polymerase-chain reaction and immunohistochemical techniques. Methylation frequencies for MGMT were 23% in multiple myeloma and 8% in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. It was 10% for hMLH1 in multiple myeloma. None of the patients diagnosed with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance had hMLH1 hypermethylated. In addition, 50% of myeloma cases had a loss of hMLH1 expression, whereas silencing of MGMT was observed in 43% of myeloma and 36% of samples with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. This study indicates that repair pathway defects play a role in the pathogenesis and evolution of monoclonal gammopathies, and suggests that inactivation of hMLH1 could be implicated in multiple myeloma tumorigenesis.","['Martin, Paloma', 'Santon, Almudena', 'Garcia-Cosio, Monica', 'Bellas, Carmen']","['Martin P', 'Santon A', 'Garcia-Cosio M', 'Bellas C']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (MLH1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutL Protein Homolog 1)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'MutL Protein Homolog 1', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Paraproteinemias/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics']",2006/04/12 09:00,2007/08/09 09:00,['2006/04/12 09:00'],"['2006/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['3800590 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.3800590 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2006 Jul;19(7):914-21. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.3800590.

MLL-AF4 is thought to be required in haematopoietic stem cells to elicit leukaemia and may be involved in tumour phenotype specification as it is only found in B-cell tumours in humans. We have employed the invertor conditional technology to create a model of MLL-AF4, in which a floxed AF4 cDNA was knocked into Mll in the opposite orientation for transcription. Cell-specific Cre expression was used to generate Mll-AF4 expression. The mice develop exclusively B-cell lineage neoplasias, whether the Cre gene was controlled by B- or T-cell promoters, but of a more mature phenotype than normally observed in childhood leukaemia. These findings show that the MLL-AF4 fusion protein does not have a mandatory role in multi-potent haematopoietic stem cells to cause cancer and indicates that MLL-AF4 has an instructive function in the phenotype of the tumour.","['Metzler, M', 'Forster, A', 'Pannell, R', 'Arends, M J', 'Daser, A', 'Lobato, M N', 'Rabbitts, T H']","['Metzler M', 'Forster A', 'Pannell R', 'Arends MJ', 'Daser A', 'Lobato MN', 'Rabbitts TH']","['MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '128559-51-3 (RAG-1 protein)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', '*Cell Lineage', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Female', 'Genes, Lethal', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Integrases/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology']",2006/04/12 09:00,2006/06/28 09:00,['2006/04/12 09:00'],"['2006/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209636 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209636 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 May 25;25(22):3093-103. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209636.,,,,,['G0600914/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer mortality from 1950 through 2000 was evaluated in four counties with the highest estimated exposure to 131I and compared with the cancer mortality experience in five demographically similar counties in Washington State with minimal 131I exposure. Overall, cancer rates in the study counties were slightly below those in the comparison counties [relative risk (RR) 0.95; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93-0.97], due mainly to a low risk for lung cancer (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.85-0.93).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 3-week cycle. Plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 were measured before each treatment, and bortezomib activity was examined in patient samples grown in primary culture. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients received a total of 193 cycles of treatment. Twenty-four patients had mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), 13 had follicular lymphoma (FL), six had lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, six had Hodgkin's disease (HD), and one each had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Patients were heavily pretreated with a median of four previous therapies. Significant grade 3 to 4 toxicities were thrombocytopenia (n = 22), fatigue (n = 10), and peripheral neuropathy (n = 3). Seven patients with MCL responded to treatment (one complete response, six partial responses [PRs]; overall response rate, 29%). Two patients with FL achieved a late PR 3 months after discontinuing therapy. Two patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and one patient with HD achieved a PR. MCL primary cultures demonstrated greater sensitivity to bortezomib than FL (median 50% effective concentration for viability, 209 nmol/L v 1,311 nmol/L, respectively; P = .07), which correlated with clinical response. A median reduction in plasma TNF-alpha of 98% was observed in six patients with MCL who responded to bortezomib compared with a reduction of 38% in six nonresponders (P = .07). CONCLUSION: Bortezomib demonstrates encouraging efficacy in MCL in heavily pretreated individuals. Response was associated with a reduction in plasma TNF-alpha and in vitro sensitivity in a small number of patients.","['Strauss, Sandra J', 'Maharaj, Lenushka', 'Hoare, Susan', 'Johnson, Peter W', 'Radford, John A', 'Vinnecombe, Sarah', 'Millard, Lynda', 'Rohatiner, Ama', 'Boral, Anthony', 'Trehu, Elizabeth', 'Schenkein, David', 'Balkwill, Frances', 'Joel, Simon P', 'Lister, T Andrew']","['Strauss SJ', 'Maharaj L', 'Hoare S', 'Johnson PW', 'Radford JA', 'Vinnecombe S', 'Millard L', 'Rohatiner A', 'Boral A', 'Trehu E', 'Schenkein D', 'Balkwill F', 'Joel SP', 'Lister TA']","[""Cancer Research UK Medical Oncology Unit, St Bartholomew's Hospital, W Smithfield, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Boronic Acids/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pyrazines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*analysis']",2006/04/12 09:00,2006/05/13 09:00,['2006/04/12 09:00'],"['2006/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.04.6789 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.04.6789 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 May 1;24(13):2105-12. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.04.6789.

Decreased function or expression of C/EBPalpha is often found in human acute myeloid leukemia. However, the precise impact of C/EBPalpha deficiency on the maturation arrest in leukemogenesis is not well understood. To address this question, we used a murine transplantation model of a bcr/abl-induced myeloproliferative disease. The expression of bcr/abl in C/EBPalphapos fetal liver cells led to a chronic myeloid leukemia-like disease. Surprisingly, bcr/abl-expressing C/EBPalpha-/- fetal liver cells failed to induce a myeloid disease in transplanted mice, but caused a fatal, transplantable erythroleukemia instead. Accordingly, increased expression of the transcription factors SCL and GATA-1 in hematopoietic precursor cells of C/EBPalpha-/-R01-EY-11298 ) fetal livers was found. The mechanism for the lineage shift from myeloid to erythroid leukemia was studied in a bcr/abl-positive cell line. Consistent with findings of the transplant model, expression of C/EBPalpha and GATA-1 was inversely correlated. Id1, an inhibitor of erythroid differentiation, was identified as a critical direct target of C/EBPalpha. Down-regulation of Id1 by RNA interference impaired C/EBPalpha-induced granulocytic differentiation. Taken together, our study provides evidence that myeloid lineage identity of malignant hematopoietic progenitor cells requires the residual expression of C/EBPalpha.","['Wagner, Katharina', 'Zhang, Pu', 'Rosenbauer, Frank', 'Drescher, Bettina', 'Kobayashi, Susumu', 'Radomska, Hanna S', 'Kutok, Jeffery L', 'Gilliland, D Gary', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Tenen, Daniel G']","['Wagner K', 'Zhang P', 'Rosenbauer F', 'Drescher B', 'Kobayashi S', 'Radomska HS', 'Kutok JL', 'Gilliland DG', 'Krauter J', 'Tenen DG']","['Harvard Institutes of Medicine, Room 954, 77 Avenue Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*deficiency/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/pathology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/*deficiency/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2006/04/12 09:00,2006/06/24 09:00,['2006/04/12 09:00'],"['2006/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['0508143103 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0508143103 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Apr 18;103(16):6338-43. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0508143103.

This list is only the starting point for a meaningful biological interpretation. Modern methods identify relevant biological processes or functions from gene expression data by scoring the statistical significance of predefined functional gene groups, e.g. based on Gene Ontology (GO). We develop methods that increase the explanatory power of this approach by integrating knowledge about relationships between the GO terms into the calculation of the statistical significance. RESULTS: We present two novel algorithms that improve GO group scoring using the underlying GO graph topology. The algorithms are evaluated on real and simulated gene expression data. We show that both methods eliminate local dependencies between GO terms and point to relevant areas in the GO graph that remain undetected with state-of-the-art algorithms for scoring functional terms. A simulation study demonstrates that the new methods exhibit a higher level of detecting relevant biological terms than competing methods.","['Alexa, Adrian', 'Rahnenfuhrer, Jorg', 'Lengauer, Thomas']","['Alexa A', 'Rahnenfuhrer J', 'Lengauer T']","['Max-Planck-Institute for Informatics Stuhlsatzenhausweg 85, D-66123 Saarbrucken, Germany. alexa@mpi-sb.mpg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Models, Statistical', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Protein Folding']",2006/04/12 09:00,2006/09/09 09:00,['2006/04/12 09:00'],"['2006/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['btl140 [pii]', '10.1093/bioinformatics/btl140 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioinformatics. 2006 Jul 1;22(13):1600-7. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btl140.

Here we show that mural cells (MCs), another component of blood vessels, develop physiologically during embryogenesis from a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population, based on the in vitro culture of HSCs and histological examination of acute myeloid leukemia 1 mutant embryos, which lack HSCs. As in the embryo, HSCs in adult bone marrow differentiate into CD45+CD11b+ cells before differentiating into MCs. Moreover, CD45+CD11b+ cells are composed of two populations, CD11bhigh and CD11blow cells, both of which can differentiate into MCs as well as ECs. Interestingly, in a murine ischemia model, MCs and ECs derived from the CD11blow population had a long-term potential to contribute to the formation of newly developed blood vessels in vivo compared with the CD11high population, which could not. Moreover, injection of the CD11bhigh population induced leaky blood vessels, but the CD11blow population did not. With respect to the permeability of vessels, we found that angiopoietin 1, which is a ligand for Tie2 receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on ECs and is suggested to induce cell adhesion between ECs and MCs, is produced by the CD11blow population and plays a critical role in the formation of nonleaky vessels. These observations suggested that the CD11low cell population serves as a good source of cells for in vivo blood vessel regeneration.","['Yamada, Yoshihiro', 'Takakura, Nobuyuki']","['Yamada Y', 'Takakura N']","['Department of Stem Cell Biology, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa 920-0934, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Angiopoietin-1)', '0 (Angpt1 protein, mouse)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Angiopoietin-1/analogs & derivatives/genetics/physiology', 'Animals', 'Blood Vessels/anatomy & histology/*cytology/metabolism', 'Brain/cytology/embryology', 'CD11b Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Hindlimb/blood supply', 'Ischemia/pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Liver/cytology/embryology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains']",2006/04/12 09:00,2006/05/31 09:00,['2006/04/12 09:00'],"['2006/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['jem.20050373 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20050373 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2006 Apr 17;203(4):1055-65. doi: 10.1084/jem.20050373.

WT1 reactivity is limited to ovarian serous carcinomas. Recent studies have shown that WT1 plays an important role in the progression of disease and indicates a poorer prognosis of human malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia and breast cancer. The aims of this study were to determine the survival and recurrence-free survival of women with advanced serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma in relation to WT1 gene expression. METHODS: The study accrued women over an 18-year period, from 1987-2004. During the study period, 163 patients were diagnosed with advanced serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma and had undergone complete post-operative chemotherapy, but the final study group comprised 99 patients. The records of these women were reviewed and the paraffin-embedded tissue of these women stained with WT1 immunostaining. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods. RESULTS: Fifty patients showed WT1 staining and forty-nine did not. Five-year survival of non-staining and staining groups were 39.4% and 10.7% (p < 0.00005); five-year recurrence-free survival of these groups were 29.8% and < or = 7.5% (p < 0.00005), respectively. For survival the HR of WT1 staining, adjusted for residual tumor and chemotherapy response, was 1.98 (95% CI 1.28-3.79), and for recurrence-free survival the HR was 3.36 (95% CI 1.60-7.03). The HR for recurrence-free survival was not confounded by any other variables. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that expression of WT1 gene may be indicative of an unfavorable prognosis in patients with advanced serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma.","['Netinatsunthorn, Wirote', 'Hanprasertpong, Jitti', 'Dechsukhum, Chavaboon', 'Leetanaporn, Roengsak', 'Geater, Alan']","['Netinatsunthorn W', 'Hanprasertpong J', 'Dechsukhum C', 'Leetanaporn R', 'Geater A']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Hatyai, Songkhla, Thailand.

Currently, spot detection is a necessary step to assess relations between spots and biological variables. This often proves time consuming and difficult when working with non-perfect gels. We developed an analysis technique to measure correlation between 2DE images and biological variables on a pixel by pixel basis. After image alignment and normalization, the biological parameters and pixel values are replaced by their specific rank. These rank adjusted images and parameters are then put into a standard linear Pearson correlation and further tested for significance and variance. RESULTS: We validated this technique on a set of simulated 2DE images, which revealed also correct working under the presence of normalization factors. This was followed by an analysis of p53 2DE immunoblots from cancer cells, known to have unique signaling networks. Since p53 is altered through these signaling networks, we expected to find correlations between the cancer type (acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia) and the p53 profiles. A second correlation analysis revealed a more complex relation between the differentiation stage in acute myeloid leukemia and p53 protein isoforms. CONCLUSION: The presented analysis method measures relations between 2DE images and external variables without requiring spot detection, thereby enabling the exploration of biosignatures of complex signaling networks in biological systems.","['Van Belle, Werner', 'Anensen, Nina', 'Haaland, Ingvild', 'Bruserud, Oystein', 'Hogda, Kjell-Arild', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore']","['Van Belle W', 'Anensen N', 'Haaland I', 'Bruserud O', 'Hogda KA', 'Gjertsen BT']","['Bioinformatics Group, Norut IT, Research Park Tromso, Postboks 6434, N9294 Tromso, NO, Norway. werner.van.belle@itek.norut.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional/*methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*analysis']",2006/04/12 09:00,2006/09/26 09:00,['2006/04/12 09:00'],"['2005/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2006/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2105-7-198 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-7-198 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2006 Apr 10;7:198. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-7-198.,20060410,,,,,PMC1559651,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently established novel bioassay systems, in which either phorbol ester-stimulated, differentiated HL-60 human leukemia cells or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 murine macrophages were co-cultured with AS52 Chinese hamster ovary cells. Extensive screening of extracts from Asian vegetables and fruits led to the identification of 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate (ACA), auraptene, nobiletin, and zerumbone, all of which were found to be highly anti-mutagenic in the above co-culture systems. Pretreatment of RAW264.7 macrophages with LPS led to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and Akt, together with the degradation of IkappaB-alpha protein, and the resultant activation of the AP-1, NF-kappaB, and CREB transcription factors. ACA abrogated ERK1/2 and JNK1/2, but not p38 activation, as well as the activation and transcriptional activation of NF-kappaB and CREB, whereas nobiletin allowed phosphorylation of these MAPKs, while it suppressed AP-1, NF-kappaB, and CREB activation.

In addition, auraptene suppressed iNOS protein production, but not mRNA expression, implying that it targets the translation step.

Symptoms result from a pathological release of mast cell mediators and a destructive mast cell infiltration. Cutaneous mastocytosis is most frequently seen in children and may regress. Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a persistent disease. A somatic c-kit mutation at codon 816 is often detectable in haematopoietic cells. The clinical course of mastocytosis is variable, ranging from indolent to aggressive. Five categories of disease are recognized: Indolent SM, aggressive SM, SM with associated clonal haematological non-mast cell-lineage disease (AHNMD) and mast cell leukaemia (MCL). In SM-AHNMD, additional genetic abnormalities have been reported. Patients with cutaneous or indolent systemic disease are treated symptomatically. Patients with aggressive disease are candidates for cytoreductive therapy. The use of 'Kit-targeting' tyrosine kinase inhibitors are best selected following a mutational analysis of c-kit. For instance, the D816V mutation appears to be associated with relative resistance against imatinib. However, imatinib has been used with success in patients with SM-hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and the FIPL1/PDGFRA fusion gene and in a patient with mastocytosis with a mutation outside of codon 816. The value of bone marrow transplantation remains under investigation.","['Metcalfe, Dean D']",['Metcalfe DD'],"['Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Novartis Found Symp,Novartis Foundation symposium,9807767,"['0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', '*Mastocytosis/classification/diagnosis/physiopathology/therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/immunology', 'Stem Cell Factor/genetics/immunology', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",2006/04/12 09:00,2006/06/28 09:00,['2006/04/12 09:00'],"['2006/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Novartis Found Symp. 2005;271:232-42; discussion 242-9.,,,,,,,35,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence has accumulated indicating that there is cross-talk between the FcepsilonRI-mediated signalling pathway and CC chemokine receptor (CCR)-mediated signalling pathways in mast cells. We have found that costimulation with IgE/antigen and CC chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3) enhances degranulation but inhibits chemotaxis of rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL)-2H3 cells expressing human CCR1 (RBL-CCR1 cells). We hypothesize that this signalling cross-talk in mast cells may play important roles in the orchestration and focusing of the allergic response. In this study, we have sought information about global protein networks either enhanced or inhibited following cross-talk between the FcepsilonRI-mediated and CCR-mediated signalling pathways in mast cells. We believe this information may be useful for providing an understanding of mast cell function and in the establishment of new anti-inflammatory drugs for allergic diseases. Proteomics is a promising tool for studying protein profiles within biological samples and facilitates an understanding of the complex responses of an organism to a stimulus. Here, we show comparative data of protein profiles derived from FcepsilonRI-engaged and/or CCR1-engaged RBL-CCR1 cells using protein chip array technology, a proteomic technology.

To specifically understand the clinical features of Aeromonas bacteremic adults with hematologic malignancies, we investigated the demographic, clinical and microbiologic characteristics of Aeromonas bacteremia in this patient population. METHODS: Retrospective study performed in a tertiary medical center in southern Taiwan, in which adults with hematologic malignancies suffered from Aeromonas bacteremia admitted between 1995 and 2003 were included for study. RESULTS: There were 45 episodes of Aeromonas bacteremia in 41 adults with hematologic malignancies. Episodes of Aeromonas bacteremia which occurred at least 2 months apart were counted as separate cases in the analysis. A total of 30 men and 15 women (mean age: 53.2 years), with 4 patients experiencing 2 episodes, was included. The 3 leading underlying hematologic malignancies were acute myelogenous leukemia (37.8%), myelodysplastic syndrome (26.7%) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (17.8%). No cluster of Aeromonas bacteremia was found during the study period. Twenty nine (64.4%) of the 31 patients with nosocomial Aeromonas bacteremia had received recent antineoplastic chemotherapy. The 3 leading clinical manifestations were fever (88.9%), septic shock (40%), and altered consciousness (26.7%). Eleven (24.4%) episodes of bacteremia were polymicrobial. Sixteen (35.6%) patients died within 14 days of onset of bacteremia. The mean duration from sampling blood for culture to death was 3.81 days. Altered consciousness (odds ratio, 8.999; 95% confidence interval, 1.787-45.33; p=0.008) was the only independent prognostic factor for mortality. High resistance rates (11.1% to piperacillin and 35.6% to imipenem) among Aeromonas isolates were also noted. CONCLUSION: In febrile patients with hematologic malignancies and suspected Aeromonas infections, particular attention to the development of alteration of consciousness is needed as it is an independent risk factor for mortality.","['Tsai, Moan-Shane', 'Kuo, Ching-Yuan', 'Wang, Ming-Chung', 'Wu, Hong-Cheng', 'Chien, Chun-Chih', 'Liu, Jien-Wei']","['Tsai MS', 'Kuo CY', 'Wang MC', 'Wu HC', 'Chien CC', 'Liu JW']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Kaohsiung Medical Center, Chang Gung University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Microbiol Immunol Infect,"Journal of microbiology, immunology, and infection = Wei mian yu gan ran za zhi",100956211,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '71OTZ9ZE0A (Imipenem)', 'X00B0D5O0E (Piperacillin)']",IM,"['Aeromonas/*isolation & purification', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/microbiology/*mortality/*physiopathology', 'Consciousness Disorders', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Female', 'Fever', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/microbiology/*mortality/*physiopathology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Imipenem/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/drug therapy', 'Piperacillin/pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Shock, Septic', 'Taiwan', 'Time Factors']",2006/04/11 09:00,2006/08/19 09:00,['2006/04/11 09:00'],"['2006/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Microbiol Immunol Infect. 2006 Apr;39(2):150-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gene for MEN1 encodes a ubiquitously expressed tumor suppressor protein called menin. Menin was recently shown to interact with several components of a trithorax family histone methyltransferase complex including ASH2, Rbbp5, WDR5, and the leukemia proto-oncoprotein MLL. To elucidate menin's role as a tumor suppressor and gain insights into the endocrine-specific tumor phenotype in MEN1, we mapped the genomic binding sites of menin, MLL1, and Rbbp5, to approximately 20,000 promoters in HeLa S3, HepG2, and pancreatic islet cells using the strategy of chromatin-immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray analysis. We found that menin, MLL1, and Rbbp5 localize to the promoters of thousands of human genes but do not always bind together. These data suggest that menin functions as a general regulator of transcription. We also found that factor occupancy generally correlates with high gene expression but that the loss of menin does not result in significant changes in most transcript levels. One exception is the developmentally programmed transcription factor, HLXB9, which is overexpressed in islets in the absence of menin. Our findings expand the realm of menin-targeted genes several hundred-fold beyond that previously described and provide potential insights to the endocrine tumor bias observed in MEN1 patients.","['Scacheri, Peter C', 'Davis, Sean', 'Odom, Duncan T', 'Crawford, Gregory E', 'Perkins, Stacie', 'Halawi, Mohamad J', 'Agarwal, Sunita K', 'Marx, Stephen J', 'Spiegel, Allen M', 'Meltzer, Paul S', 'Collins, Francis S']","['Scacheri PC', 'Davis S', 'Odom DT', 'Crawford GE', 'Perkins S', 'Halawi MJ', 'Agarwal SK', 'Marx SJ', 'Spiegel AM', 'Meltzer PS', 'Collins FS']","['Genome Technology Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (MNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RBBP5 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', '*Genome, Human', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/physiology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis']",2006/04/11 09:00,2006/08/01 09:00,['2006/04/11 09:00'],"['2006/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.pgen.0020051 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS Genet. 2006 Apr;2(4):e51. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.0020051.

Seventeen consecutive adults underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation from related (n=14) or unrelated (n=3) donors. Median age was 50 years (range 26-60). Seven patients (41%) demonstrated relapse or persistent disease at a median of 6 months (range 3-55.5). Five patients underwent DLI for morphologic relapse and one for mixed donor chimerism. Two patients achieved durable complete remissions of 15 months each. The overall transplant-related mortality was 41% (n=7). With a median follow-up of 34.5 months, three patients (18%) currently remain alive and in continuous CR.

The efficacy of rituximab is modest when used as single agent, and alemtuzumab induces severe immunosuppression. To develop more potent and specific therapies, we propose the CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) as an attractive target molecule to treat CLL, as it not only fulfills the requirements of a high-surface expression and a good level of tissue specificity, but it also plays a crucial role in mediating the migration of the tumor cells to lymph nodes (LNs) and thus, in the development of clinical lymphadenopathy. In the current work, murine anti-human CCR7 mAb mediated a potent, complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) against CLL cells while sparing normal T lymphocytes from the same patients. The sensitivity to CDC was related to the antigenic density of CCR7. Moreover, these mAb blocked the in vitro migration of CLL cells in response to CC chemokine ligand 19 (CCL19), one of the physiological ligands of CCR7. Conversely, CLL cells were poorly lysed through antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), probably as a result of the murine origin and the isotype of the anti-CCR7 mAb used. Molecular engineering techniques will allow us to obtain chimeric or humanized anti-CCR7 mAb to reach the best clinical response for this common and yet incurable leukemia.","['Alfonso-Perez, Manuel', 'Lopez-Giral, Sonia', 'Quintana, Nuria E', 'Loscertales, Javier', 'Martin-Jimenez, Patricia', 'Munoz, Cecilia']","['Alfonso-Perez M', 'Lopez-Giral S', 'Quintana NE', 'Loscertales J', 'Martin-Jimenez P', 'Munoz C']","['Department of Immunology, Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, C/Diego de Leon 62, 28006 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CCL19 protein, human)', '0 (CCR7 protein, human)', '0 (Ccl19 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ccr7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CCL19)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/immunology/pathology', 'Chemokine CCL19', 'Chemokines, CC/pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Endocytosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, CCR7', 'Receptors, Chemokine/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Species Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology']",2006/04/11 09:00,2006/08/11 09:00,['2006/04/11 09:00'],"['2006/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.1105623 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.1105623 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2006 Jun;79(6):1157-65. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1105623.

Foamy viruses (FVs) constitute a unique subfamily (Spumavirinae) of the family Retroviridae, for which the integration pattern into the human genome has not yet been determined. To accomplish this, 293 cells were transduced with FV vectors and the integration sites into the cellular genome were determined by a high-throughput method based on inverse PCR. For comparison, a limited number of murine leukemia virus (MLV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) integration sites were analysed in parallel. Altogether, 628 FV, 87 HIV and 141 MLV distinct integration sites were mapped to the human genome. The sequences were analysed for RefSeq genes, promoter regions, CpG islands and insertions into cellular oncogenes. Compared with the integration-site preferences of HIV, which strongly favours active genes, and MLV, which favours integration near transcription-start regions, our results indicate that FV integration has neither of these preferences. However, once integration has occurred into a transcribed region of the genome, FVs tend to target promoter-close regions, albeit with less preference than MLV. Furthermore, our study revealed a palindromic consensus sequence for integration, which was centred on the virus-specific, four-base-duplicated target site. In summary, it is shown that the integration pattern of FVs appears to be unique compared with those of other retroviral genera.","['Nowrouzi, Ali', 'Dittrich, Marcus', 'Klanke, Chuck', 'Heinkelein,

These selected Tax peptides induced secretion of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from monkeys chronically infected with HTLV-1. After immunization, a high titre of antibodies and a high frequency of IFN-gamma-producing cells were detected against the Env and the Tri-Tax immunogens, but not against the individual Tax peptides. This might indicate that epitope(s) distinct from those recognized by humans are recognized by responder monkeys. After challenge, it was shown by competitive PCR that partial protection against HTLV-1 infection could be raised in immunized animals. Further studies should be developed to determine the duration of this protection.","['Kazanji, Mirdad', 'Heraud, Jean-Michel', 'Merien, Fabrice', 'Pique, Claudine', 'de The, Guy', 'Gessain, Antoine', 'Jacobson, Steven']","['Kazanji M', 'Heraud JM', 'Merien F', 'Pique C', 'de The G', 'Gessain A', 'Jacobson S']","[""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France."", 'Laboratoire de Retrovirologie, Institut Pasteur de la Guyane, French Guiana.', 'Laboratoire de Retrovirologie, Institut Pasteur de la Guyane, French Guiana.', 'Centre de Primatologie, Institut Pasteur de la Guyane, French Guiana.', 'CNRS UPR 9051 (UMR 7151), Saint Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', ""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France."", ""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France."", 'Viral Immunology Section, NINDS, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (Vaccines, Synthetic)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Gene Products, env/immunology', 'Gene Products, tax/immunology', 'HLA-A Antigens', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Immunization, Secondary', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Interferon-gamma/blood', 'Saimiri', 'Vaccines, Synthetic/administration & dosage/immunology', 'Viral Vaccines/administration & dosage/*immunology']",2006/04/11 09:00,2006/05/19 09:00,['2006/04/11 09:00'],"['2006/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/vir.0.81582-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2006 May;87(Pt 5):1331-1337. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.81582-0.,,,,,,,,,,,10.1099/vir.0.81582-0 [doi],,,,,,,,

The specificity of the bacterially expressed PR was similar to that of virion-extracted PR. Compared with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) PR, the pH optimum of the MLV enzyme was higher. The specificity of the MLV PR was further compared with that of HIV-1 PR by using various oligopeptides representing naturally occurring cleavage sites in MLV and HIV-1, as well as by using bacterially expressed proteins having part of the MLV Gag. Inhibitors designed against HIV-1 PR were also active on MLV PR, although all of the tested ones were substantially less potent on this enzyme than on HIV-1 PR.

The most effective virucidal agent, the aromatic disulfide NSC20625, was able to inactivate two strains of the prototype arenavirus species Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Inactivated viral particles retained the biological functions of the virion envelope glycoproteins in virus binding and uptake, but were unable to perform viral RNA replication. Furthermore, in inactivated virions, the electrophoretic profile of the Z protein was altered when analysed under non-reducing conditions, whereas the patterns of the proteins NP and GP1 remained unaffected. Treatment of a recombinant LCMV Z protein with the virucidal agents induced unfolding and oligomerization of Z to high-molecular-mass aggregates, probably due to metal-ion ejection and the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds through the cysteine residues of the Z RING finger. NSC20625 also exhibited antiviral properties in LCMV-infected cells without affecting other cellular RING-motif proteins, such as the promyelocytic leukaemia protein PML. Altogether, the investigations described here illustrate the potential of the Z protein as a promising target for therapy and the prospects of the Z-reactive compounds to prevent arenavirus dissemination.","['Garcia, Cybele C', 'Djavani, Mahmoud', 'Topisirovic, Ivan', 'Borden, Katherine L B', 'Salvato, Maria S', 'Damonte, Elsa B']","['Garcia CC', 'Djavani M', 'Topisirovic I', 'Borden KLB', 'Salvato MS', 'Damonte EB']","['Laboratory of Virology, Department of Biological Chemistry, School of Sciences, University of Buenos Aires, Ciudad Universitaria, Pabellon 2, Piso 4, 1428 Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland Biotechnology Center, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.', 'Institute de Recherche en Immunologie et en Cancerologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC H3T 1J4, Canada.', 'Institute de Recherche en Immunologie et en Cancerologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC H3T 1J4, Canada.', 'Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland Biotechnology Center, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.', 'Laboratory of Virology, Department of Biological Chemistry, School of Sciences, University of Buenos Aires, Ciudad Universitaria, Pabellon 2, Piso 4, 1428 Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Azo Compounds)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (p11 Z protein, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Azo Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Disulfides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus/*drug effects/physiology', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Virus Replication/drug effects', 'Zinc Fingers/*drug effects']",2006/04/11 09:00,2006/05/19 09:00,['2006/04/11 09:00'],"['2006/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/vir.0.81667-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2006 May;87(Pt 5):1217-1228. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.81667-0.,,,,,"['R21 AI059247-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 DE015061-01/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI059247/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 DE015061-02/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI053619-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI059247-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI053620/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI053620-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI053619-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI053620-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI053619/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2423342,,,['NIHMS47026'],,10.1099/vir.0.81667-0 [doi],,,,,,,,

During the lytic cycle, the viral genome forms replication compartments, which are usually adjacent to promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies. A tetracycline repressor DNA-binding domain-enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion was used to visualize replicating plasmids carrying a tetracycline operator sequence array. ori lyt mediated the production of plasmid replication compartments that were associated with PML nuclear bodies.

Our purposes in this study were to determine whether activation of Jak-Stat pathway is responsible for the proliferation and survival of ATL cells, and to explore mechanisms by which inhibition of Jak-Stat pathway kills ATL cells. RESULTS: Constitutive activation of Stat3 and Stat5 was observed in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and primary ATL cells, but not in HTLV-1-negative T-cell lines. Using AG490, a Jak-specific inhibitor, we demonstrated that the activation of Stat3 and Stat5 was mediated by the constitutive phosphorylation of Jak proteins. AG490 inhibited the growth of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and primary ATL cells by inducing G1 cell-cycle arrest mediated by altering the expression of cyclin D2, Cdk4, p53, p21, Pim-1 and c-Myc, and by apoptosis mediated by the reduced expression of c-IAP2, XIAP, survivin and Bcl-2. Importantly, AG490 did not inhibit the growth of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that activation of Jak-Stat pathway is responsible for the proliferation and survival of ATL cells.

Promoter elements embedded within SIN designs may suppress transcription of packageable retroviral RNA which in turn results in titer reduction. We tested whether this dominant-negative effect involves histone acetylation state. We designed an MLV-derived SIN vector using the cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer-promoter (CMVIE) as an embedded internal promoter (SINCMV) and transfected the pantropic 293GPG packaging cell line. RESULTS: The SINCMV retroviral producer had uniformly very low titers (approximately 10,000 infectious retroparticles per ml). Northern blot showed low levels of expression of retroviral mRNA in producer cells in particular that of packageable RNA transcript. Treatment of the producers with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors sodium butyrate and trichostatin A reversed transcriptional suppression and resulted in an average 106.3 +/- 4.6 - fold (P = 0.002) and 15.5 +/- 1.3 - fold increase in titer (P = 0.008), respectively. A histone gel assay confirmed increased histone acetylation in treated producer cells. CONCLUSION: These results show that SIN retrovectors incorporating strong internal promoters such as CMVIE, are susceptible to transcriptional silencing and that treatment of the producer cells with HDAC inhibitors can overcome this blockade suggesting that histone deacetylation is implicated in the mechanism of transcriptional suppression.","['Jaalouk, Diana E', 'Crosato, Milena', 'Brodt, Pnina', 'Galipeau, Jacques']","['Jaalouk DE', 'Crosato M', 'Brodt P', 'Galipeau J']","['Department of Medicine, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, McGill University, Montreal, Canada. djaalouk@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/drug effects/*genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection/*methods', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",2006/04/11 09:00,2006/10/03 09:00,['2006/04/11 09:00'],"['2005/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2006/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['1743-422X-3-27 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-3-27 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2006 Apr 7;3:27. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-3-27.,20060407,,,,,PMC1488828,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we review the results of childhood AML therapy in a Singapore university hospital over the last 17 years emphasizing toxicity and outcome. PROCEDURE: Retrospective analysis revealed 34 children with AML between 1988 and 2003. Prior to September 1996, therapy consisted of: POG-8498 (n = 10), others (n = 9). From September 1996, all but one of 15 children received MRC AML 10 treatment. RESULTS: At the time of analysis, 17 had died from disease, and 17 patients were alive among whom 2 had relapsed. MRC AML 10-treated patients (n = 14) had significantly better 3-year overall, event-free, and disease-free survival (74% vs. 35%, 77% vs. 20%, 83% vs. 31%; P = 0.019, P = 0.002, and P = 0.010, respectively) and were likelier to achieve complete remission (CR) than non-MRC AML 10 patients (P = 0.102). Among patients who achieved CR, MRC AML 10-treated patients were significantly more likely to achieve CR after only one cycle of chemotherapy (P = 0.016). Hematologic toxicity was similar among the different regimens (P = 0.9). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that MRC AML 10 treatment results in significantly superior survival, without excess toxicity. Future studies should attempt to elucidate the relative importance of individual MRC AML 10 components and reduce the high cumulative anthracycline dose without compromising outcome.","['Tan, Ronald M', 'Quah, Thuan Chong', 'Aung, Lele', 'Liang, Shen', 'Kirk, Richard C', 'Yeoh, Allen E J']","['Tan RM', 'Quah TC', 'Aung L', 'Liang S', 'Kirk RC', 'Yeoh AE']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, The Children's Medical Institute, National University Hospital, National University of Singapore, Singapore.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'MRC AML 10 protocol', 'POG-8498 protocol']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amsacrine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Developing Countries', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/chemically induced', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infections/etiology', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Singapore/epidemiology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2006/04/08 09:00,2007/04/04 09:00,['2006/04/08 09:00'],"['2006/04/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20834 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Mar;48(3):262-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20834.,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Several studies in children and adults have shown relationships between lean mass (LM), fat mass (FM), and bone mineral content (BMC). The objective of the study was to examine the association between body composition and bone mass in young survivors of childhood cancer. METHODS: Sixty-eight postpubertal participants (31 females and 37 males) aged between 15.5 and 27 years who were at least 5 years after completion of treatment for leukemia (n = 30), lymphoma (n = 28), or solid tumors (n = 10) were studied. Anthropometry was performed and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was used to assess BMC in the total body (T) and lumbar spine (S), FM, and LM. RESULTS: There were no observed differences in age or time for cessation of treatment. Body mass index (BMI) was a strong determinant of bone mass in both sexes. TBMC correlated positively with LM (males r = 0.9 and females r = 0.76; P < 0.0001, respectively) and with FM (r = 0.54; P < 0.01 in males and r = 0.8; P < 0.00001 in females). SBMC correlated with LM in both sexes (in males r = 0.77 and in females r = 0.64; P < 0.0001, respectively) but only in females, SBMC also correlated positively with FM (r = 44 P = 0.03). There were no differences between patients who received radiation and those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: The associations between bone mass and body composition differ by sex and skeletal site, however, they are similar in survivors of childhood cancer and compared to healthy individuals during growth. Further prospective research is needed in cancer survivors to determine the long-term effect of anti-cancer therapy on body composition and bone mass.","['Muszynska-Roslan, Katarzyna', 'Konstantynowicz, Jerzy', 'Krawczuk-Rybak, Maryna', 'Protas, Piotr']","['Muszynska-Roslan K', 'Konstantynowicz J', 'Krawczuk-Rybak M', 'Protas P']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland. kmroslan@amb.edu.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adult', '*Body Composition', '*Bone Density', 'Bone and Bones/anatomy & histology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Survivors']",2006/04/08 09:00,2007/02/03 09:00,['2006/04/08 09:00'],"['2006/04/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20849 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Feb;48(2):200-4. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20849.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that APC activation by Tax induces rapid senescence (tax-IRS) independently of p53 and pRB. In response to tax, cyclin A, cyclin B1, securin, and Skp2 becomes polyubiquitinated and degraded starting in S phase. This is followed by a surge in p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p27(KIP1) in mid to late S and G2/M leading to a permanent G1 arrest. Tax-positive HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines express elevated levels of p21(CIP1/WAF1), but low levels of p27(KIP1). Finally, Tax can be stably expressed in p27(KIP1)-null NIH3T3 cells. These results indicate that APC activation by Tax causes inactivation of SCF(Skp2) and stabilization of p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p27(KIP1).

Evading tax-IRS through a loss of p27(KIP1) function is likely to be critical for cell transformation by Tax and development of adult T-cell leukemia after HTLV-1 infection.

CASE REPORT: Our patient presented with severe nephrotic syndrome. Diagnostic biopsies confirmed MCGN and early-stage BCLL (Binet A). In contrast to previously described cases, kappa monoclonal IgM and cryoglobulins were also detected. The patient was treated with chlorambucil and prednisone. 3 weeks later, renal function and white blood cell (WBC) count were completely normal. DISCUSSION: Although, in most cases, renal disease and CLL present separately, there is evidence for a causal relationship between the two disorders. Although it is widely approved that early-stage CLL should not be treated by medication, the severe nephrotic syndrome in our patient required immediate intervention. So far, there is no standard therapy for MCGN associated with CLL. Our combination therapy resulted in normalization of the nephrotic syndrome and the WBC count. Hence, we emphasize the importance of early recognition of renal symptoms in CLL and propose a successful therapy for nephrotic syndrome in MCGN associated with early-stage B-CLL. Additionally, the pathophysiological and therapeutic aspects of MCGN associated with CLL are retrospectively discussed.","['Alzamora, Meritxell Garcia', 'Schmidli, Markus', 'Hess, Urs', 'Cathomas, Richard', 'von Moos, Roger']","['Alzamora MG', 'Schmidli M', 'Hess U', 'Cathomas R', 'von Moos R']","['Sektion Neuroradiologie, Neurozentrum, Universitatsklinikum Freiburg i.Br., Deutschland.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/administration & dosage', 'Chlorambucil/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Combinations', 'Female', 'Glomerulonephritis/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Prednisone/*administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/04/08 09:00,2006/05/19 09:00,['2006/04/08 09:00'],"['2006/04/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['91644 [pii]', '10.1159/000091644 [doi]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2006 Apr;29(4):153-6. doi: 10.1159/000091644.

We investigated the 70-kDa zeta-associated protein (ZAP-70), CD38, soluble CD23 (sCD23), and cytogenetics in 289 patients with B-CLL. Both a shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were observed in ZAP-70(+) (P < .001), in CD38(+) (P < .001) and in sCD23(+) patients (P < .001 and P = .013, respectively). ZAP-70(+)CD38(+) or ZAP-70(+) patients with an unmutated IgV(H) status showed both a shorter PFS (P < .001) and OS (P < .001 and P < .001, respectively) as compared with ZAP-70(-)/CD38(-) or ZAP-70(-) patients with mutated IgV(H) genes. Discordant patients showed an intermediate outcome. Note, ZAP-70(+) patients even if CD38(-) or mutated showed a shorter PFS, whereas ZAP-70(-) patients even if CD38(+) or unmutated had a longer PFS. Furthermore, ZAP-70 positivity was associated with a shorter PFS both within normal karyotype (P < .001) and within the poor-risk cytogenetic subset (P = .02). The predictive value of ZAP-70 expression was confirmed in multivariate analysis. Thus, ZAP-70 protein determined by flow cytometry improves the prognostic significance of cytogenetics and appears to be a better predictor of outcomes than IgV(H) gene mutational status. On this line, we recommend and are also interested in conducting a prospective randomized trial of early intervention versus observation for ZAP-70(+) patients.","['Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Buccisano, Francesco', 'Maurillo, Luca', 'Venditti, Adriano', 'Zucchetto, Antonella', 'Marini, Rita', 'Niscola, Pasquale', 'Consalvo, Maria Antonietta Irno', 'Mazzone, Carla', 'Ottaviani, Licia', 'Panetta, Paola', 'Bruno, Antonio', 'Bomben, Riccardo', 'Suppo, Giovanna', 'Degan, Massimo', 'Gattei, Valter', 'de Fabritiis, Paolo', 'Cantonetti, Maria', 'Lo Coco, Francesco', 'Del Principe, Domenico', 'Amadori, Sergio']","['Del Principe MI', 'Del Poeta G', 'Buccisano F', 'Maurillo L', 'Venditti A', 'Zucchetto A', 'Marini R', 'Niscola P', 'Consalvo MA', 'Mazzone C', 'Ottaviani L', 'Panetta P', 'Bruno A', 'Bomben R', 'Suppo G', 'Degan M', 'Gattei V', 'de Fabritiis P', 'Cantonetti M', 'Lo Coco F', 'Del Principe D', 'Amadori S']","['Cattedra di Ematologia, Universita Tor Vergata, Ospedale S Eugenio, Via Fiume Giallo, 430 MA, 00144 Roma, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/analysis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, IgE/analysis', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*analysis/genetics']",2006/04/08 09:00,2006/10/06 09:00,['2006/04/08 09:00'],"['2006/04/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52735-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-12-4986 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Aug 1;108(3):853-61. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-12-4986.

Jasmonates increased the life span of EL-4 lymphoma-bearing mice, and exhibited selective cytotoxicity towards cancer cells while sparing normal blood lymphocytes, even when the latter were part of a mixed population of leukemic and normal cells drawn from the blood of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. Jasmonates join a growing number of old and new cancer chemotherapeutic compounds of plant origin. Three mechanisms of action have been proposed to explain the anti-cancer activity of jasmonates. These include: (1) The bio-energetic mechanism-jasmonates induce severe ATP depletion in cancer cells via mitochondrial perturbation; (2) The re-differentiation mechanism-jasmonates induce re-differentiation in human myeloid leukemia cells via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity; (3) The reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated mechanism-jasmonates induce apoptosis in lung carcinoma cells via the generation of hydrogen peroxide, and pro-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family. Several similarities between the effects of jasmonates on plant and cancer cells have been recorded, suggesting that additional analysis of jasmonate effects in plant cells may contribute to a deeper understanding of the anti-cancer actions of these compounds. Those similarities include: induction of cell death, suppression of proliferation and cell cycle arrest, MAPK induction, ROS generation, and enhancement of heat-shock proteins (HSP) expression. Finally, jasmonates can induce death in drug-resistant cells. The drug resistance was conferred by either p53 mutation or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) over-expression. In summary, the jasmonate family of novel anti-cancer agents presents new hope for the development of cancer therapeutics, which should attract further scientific and pharmaceutical interest.","['Flescher, Eliezer']",['Flescher E'],"['Department of Human Microbiology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, 69978, Tel Aviv Israel. flascher@post.tau.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Oxylipins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '6RI5N05OWW (jasmonic acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclopentanes/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxylipins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2006/04/08 09:00,2007/04/06 09:00,['2006/04/08 09:00'],"['2006/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2006/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/04/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(06)00145-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2006.03.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2007 Jan 8;245(1-2):1-10. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2006.03.001.

Accuracy of cell surface markers used in flow cytometric analysis of the leukemic cells was also determined. METHODS: Data of 209 consecutive cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) presenting between July 1995 and July 2003 was analyzed. Flow cytometry was performed on all ALL cases using the standard protocols. TALL markers included CD3, CD5 and CD7. RESULTS: Proportion of TALL among known ALL Pakistani patients was 17.22%. Mean age of the TALL patients was 17.2 years. Proportion of TALL was higher in adults than in children (21.95% vs. 14.17%). Overall in this study there were more male patients affected by TALL (25/36 or 69.40%) than females (11/36 or 30.60%). The female to male ratio among TALL patients was 1:2.27. However, the proportion (%) of TALL in females was higher than males (18.96% vs. 15.82 %) i, e, 1.2:1. CD7 was found to be the most sensitive among both adults & children. It was positive in 94.4% of the TALL cases. CONCLUSION: Proportion of TALL among ALL in Pakistan is similar to that reported in this region, indicating a candidate association with geographical location and socioeconomic status. The reactivity of markers with TALL. cells was similar to what we expected based upon literature. However, due to some aberrant and cross reactivity displayed by each marker, we strongly recommend a panel approach including B and myeloid markers to ensure a correct diagnosis of TALL.","['Khawaja, M R', 'Allana, S S', 'Akbarali, A N', 'Adil, S N', 'Khurshid, M', 'Pervez, S']","['Khawaja MR', 'Allana SS', 'Akbarali AN', 'Adil SN', 'Khurshid M', 'Pervez S']","['Department of Pathology & Microbiology, The Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Pakistan,J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad,"Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad : JAMC",8910750,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Biomarkers', 'Demography', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pakistan/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*physiopathology', 'Prevalence', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology']",2006/04/08 09:00,2006/05/23 09:00,['2006/04/08 09:00'],"['2006/04/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad. 2005 Oct-Dec;17(4):3-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although soluble CD40 (sCD40) is a potential modulator of both antitumor responses and CD40-based therapies, the levels and significance of sCD40 in patients with hematologic malignancies are unknown. METHODS: The authors evaluated serum/plasma sCD40 levels using an enzyme-linked immunoassay in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and multiple myeloma (MM). RESULTS: Levels of sCD40 were elevated in serum (>1.697 ng/mL) or plasma (>0.649 ng/mL) from 73% of patients with CLL, 80% of patients with MCL, 40% of patients with AML, 43% of patients with MDS, and 33% of patients with MM. Multivariate analysis of patients with MM demonstrated that elevated sCD40 was a significant, independent predictor of poor survival. In multivariate analysis of patients with AML, sCD40 was a significant prognostic factor when the interaction of age and sCD40 was included as a variable. Further analysis demonstrated that elevated sCD86 levels were associated with significantly shorter survival only in AML patients younger than age 64 years. Release of sCD40 by CLL cells was induced by cross-linking with CD40 monoclonal antibody. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients with hematologic malignancies have elevated circulating levels of sCD40, and these elevated levels are associated with a poor prognosis at least in patients with MM and AML, suggesting that sCD40 may have a role in modulating antitumor responses and also may be a useful prognostic marker. In addition, the findings suggested that further studies will be required to determine the effect of circulating sCD40 on the clinical effectiveness of CD40-ligating reagents used in the treatment of hematologic malignancies.","['Hock, Barry D', 'McKenzie, Judith L', 'Patton, Nigel W', 'Drayson, Mark', 'Taylor, Karen', 'Wakeman, Chris', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Giles, Francis', 'Albitar, Maher']","['Hock BD', 'McKenzie JL', 'Patton NW', 'Drayson M', 'Taylor K', 'Wakeman C', 'Kantarjian H', 'Giles F', 'Albitar M']","['Haematology Research Group, Christchurch Hospital, Christchurch, New Zealand. barry.hock@chmeds.ac.nz']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'CD40 Ligand/*metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*blood/mortality/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/mortality/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/blood/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Solubility', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Analysis']",2006/04/07 09:00,2006/06/23 09:00,['2006/04/07 09:00'],"['2006/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21816 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2006 May 15;106(10):2148-57. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21816.,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2006 American Cancer Society'],,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-two CML bone marrow samples, collected before imatinib treatment, were hybridized to a cDNA microarray containing 6500 cancer genes, and analyzed using bootstrap statistics. Patients refractory to interferon-alpha treatment were evaluated for cytogenetic and molecular responses for a minimum of 12 months. A set of 46 genes was differentially expressed in imatinib responders and non-responders. This set includes genes involved in cell adhesion (TNC and SCAM-1), drug metabolism (cyclooxygenase 1), protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases (BTK and PTPN22).

Recent evidence suggests that FGF signaling through FGF receptors (FGFRs) may play a role in the proliferation of subsets of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs). However, the precise mechanism and specific FGF receptors that support leukemic cell growth are not known. We show that FGF-2, through activation of FGFR1beta signaling, promotes survival, proliferation and migration of AML cells. Stimulation of FGFR1beta results in phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt activation and inhibits chemotherapy-induced apoptosis of leukemic cells. Neutralizing FGFR1-specific antibody abrogates the physiologic and chemoprotective effects of FGF-2/FGFR1beta signaling and inhibits tumor growth in mice xenotransplanted with human AML. These data suggest that activation of FGF-2/FGFR1beta supports progression and chemoresistance in subsets of AML. Therefore, FGFR1 targeting may be of therapeutic benefit in subsets of AML.","['Karajannis, M A', 'Vincent, L', 'Direnzo, R', 'Shmelkov, S V', 'Zhang, F', 'Feldman, E J', 'Bohlen, P', 'Zhu, Z', 'Sun, H', 'Kussie, P', 'Rafii, S']","['Karajannis MA', 'Vincent L', 'Direnzo R', 'Shmelkov SV', 'Zhang F', 'Feldman EJ', 'Bohlen P', 'Zhu Z', 'Sun H', 'Kussie P', 'Rafii S']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. karajanm@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Agouti-Related Protein)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Agouti-Related Protein', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Subunits/drug effects/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2006/04/07 09:00,2006/10/31 09:00,['2006/04/07 09:00'],"['2006/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404203 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404203 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Jun;20(6):979-86. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404203.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, several groups identified a recurrent somatic point mutation constitutively activating the hematopoietic growth factor receptor-associated JAK2 tyrosine kinase in diverse chronic myeloid disorders - most commonly classic myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), especially polycythemia vera. We hypothesized that the JAK2 V617F mutation might also be present in samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), especially erythroleukemia (AML-M6) or megakaryoblastic leukemia (AML-M7), where it might mimic erythropoietin or thrombopoietin signaling. First, we documented STAT3 activation by immunoblotting in AML-M6 and other AML subtypes. Immunoperoxidase staining confirmed phosphorylated STAT3 in malignant myeloblasts (21% of cases, including all AML-M3 samples tested). We then analyzed genomic DNA from 162 AML, 30 B-cell lymphoma, and 10 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) samples for JAK2 mutations, and assayed a subset for SOCS1 and FLT3 mutations. Janus kinase2 V617F was present in 13/162 AML samples (8%): 10/13 transformed MPD, and three apparent de novo AML (one of 12 AML-M6, one of 24 AML-M7, and one AML-M2 - all mixed clonality). FLT3 mutations were present in 5/32 (16%), while SOCS1 mutations were totally absent. Lymphoproliferative disorder samples were both JAK2 and SOCS1 wild type. Thus, while JAK2 V617F is uncommon in de novo AML and probably does not occur in lymphoid malignancy, unexplained STAT3 activation is common in AML. Janus kinase2 extrinsic regulators and other proteins in the JAK-STAT pathway should be interrogated to explain frequent STAT activation in AML.","['Steensma, D P', 'McClure, R F', 'Karp, J E', 'Tefferi, A', 'Lasho, T L', 'Powell, H L', 'DeWald, G W', 'Kaufmann, S H']","['Steensma DP', 'McClure RF', 'Karp JE', 'Tefferi A', 'Lasho TL', 'Powell HL', 'DeWald GW', 'Kaufmann SH']","['Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.

By the analysis of oligonucleotide microarray, AML1-ETO was shown to modulate the expressions of an impressive array of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes. Here, we investigate potential effects of the ecdysone inducible AML1-ETO expression on apoptosis of leukemic U937 cell line. We show that AML1-ETO significantly stabilizes death receptor Fas protein and increases proapoptotic Bak in addition to reducing Bcl-2 expression. Accordingly, inducible AML1-ETO expression is followed by apoptosis to a lower degree. Especially, AML1-ETO endows leukemic cells with the susceptibility to anti-Fas agonist antibody, ultraviolet light and camptothecin analog NSC606985-induced apoptosis with increased activation of caspase-3/8. Considering that apoptosis-enhancing effect of AML1-ETO would not be favorable to the leukemogenesis harboring the t(8;21) translocation, it must be overcome to fulfill their leukemogenic potential. Complementary to this prediction is that two AML1-ETO-carrying leukemic cells, Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1, present similar sensitivity to apoptosis induction with AML1-ETO-negative leukemic cells. Therefore, genetic and/or epigenetic screenings of apoptosis-related genes modulated by AML1-ETO deserve to be explored for understanding the mechanisms of AML1-ETO-induced leukemogenesis.","['Lu, Y', 'Xu, Y-B', 'Yuan, T-T', 'Song, M-G', 'Lubbert, M', 'Fliegauf, M', 'Chen, G-Q']","['Lu Y', 'Xu YB', 'Yuan TT', 'Song MG', 'Lubbert M', 'Fliegauf M', 'Chen GQ']","['The Department of Pathophysiology, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (NSC606985)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '5289-74-7 (Ecdysterone)', '84986BG3NG (ponasterone A)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics/radiation effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Camptothecin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Ecdysterone/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Time Factors', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'fas Receptor']",2006/04/07 09:00,2006/10/31 09:00,['2006/04/07 09:00'],"['2006/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404218 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404218 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Jun;20(6):987-93. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404218.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This raises the question of whether disease therapies can be developed that eliminate cancer stem cells without eliminating normal stem cells. Here we address this issue by conditionally deleting the Pten tumour suppressor gene in adult haematopoietic cells. This led to myeloproliferative disease within days and transplantable leukaemias within weeks. Pten deletion also promoted haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) proliferation. However, this led to HSC depletion via a cell-autonomous mechanism, preventing these cells from stably reconstituting irradiated mice. In contrast to leukaemia-initiating cells, HSCs were therefore unable to maintain themselves without Pten. These effects were mostly mediated by mTOR as they were inhibited by rapamycin. Rapamycin not only depleted leukaemia-initiating cells but also restored normal HSC function. Mechanistic differences between normal stem cells and cancer stem cells can thus be targeted to deplete cancer stem cells without damaging normal stem cells.","['Yilmaz, Omer H', 'Valdez, Riccardo', 'Theisen, Brian K', 'Guo, Wei', 'Ferguson, David O', 'Wu, Hong', 'Morrison, Sean J']","['Yilmaz OH', 'Valdez R', 'Theisen BK', 'Guo W', 'Ferguson DO', 'Wu H', 'Morrison SJ']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Life Sciences Institute, Department of Internal Medicine, and Center for Stem Cell Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2216, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (Pten protein, mouse)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/*pathology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",2006/04/07 09:00,2006/06/28 09:00,['2006/04/07 09:00'],"['2005/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['nature04703 [pii]', '10.1038/nature04703 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2006 May 25;441(7092):475-82. doi: 10.1038/nature04703.

Glutamate is an important neurotransmitter synthesized from alpha-ketoglutaric acid, an intermediate product of the citric acid cycle, and glutamine is synthesized from glutamate. To examine the brain metabolism of rats infected with neuropathogenic viruses, the amount of glutamate and glutamine in the brains of rats infected with A8, PVC211, and non-neuropathogenic 57 was measured using high performance liquid chromatography, and the (13)C-label incorporation into the C4 position of glutamate and glutamine from [1-(13)C] glucose was measured with (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance. In the cerebral hemisphere and region containing the brain stem and basal ganglia of rats infected with A8 and PVC211 at 8-9 weeks post-infection (wpi), the amount of glutamine was decreased compared with the 57-infected rats. The amount of glutamate was decreased in the cerebral hemisphere of the A8-infected rats and the region containing the brain stem and basal ganglia of PVC211-infected rats at 8-9 wpi. The amount of [4-(13)C] glutamine and [4-(13)C] glutamate in the cerebral hemisphere and region containing the brain stem and basal ganglia of rats infected with A8 and PVC211 at 8-9 wpi was equivalent to that of the 57-infected rats.

These agents 'poison' the enzyme and induce it to generate DNA breaks that are lethal to the cell. Topo II-targeted drugs show a limited sequence preference, triggering double-stranded breaks throughout the genome. Circumstantial evidence strongly suggests that some of these breaks induce chromosomal translocations that lead to specific types of leukaemia (called treatment-related or secondary leukaemia). Therefore, efforts are ongoing to decrease these secondary effects. An interesting option is to increase the sequence-specificity of topo II-targeted drugs by attaching them to triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFO) that bind to DNA in a highly sequence-specific manner. Here five derivatives of VP16 were attached to TFOs. The active topo II poisons, once linked, induced cleavage 13-14 bp from the triplex end where the drug was attached. The use of triple-helical DNA structures offers an efficient strategy for targeting topo II-mediated cleavage to DNA specific sequences. Finally, drug-TFO conjugates are useful tools to investigate the mechanistic details of topo II poisoning.","['Duca, Maria', ""Guianvarc'h, Dominique"", 'Oussedik, Kahina', 'Halby, Ludovic', 'Garbesi, Anna', 'Dauzonne, Daniel', 'Monneret, Claude', 'Osheroff, Neil', 'Giovannangeli, Carine', 'Arimondo, Paola B']","['Duca M', ""Guianvarc'h D"", 'Oussedik K', 'Halby L', 'Garbesi A', 'Dauzonne D', 'Monneret C', 'Osheroff N', 'Giovannangeli C', 'Arimondo PB']","['UMR 5153, CNRS, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (triplex DNA)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*chemistry/toxicity', 'DNA/*chemistry', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Footprinting', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/toxicity', 'Etoposide/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",2006/04/07 09:00,2006/04/25 09:00,['2006/04/07 09:00'],"['2006/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['34/6/1900 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkl126 [doi]']",epublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2006 Apr 5;34(6):1900-11. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkl126.

Parental smoking and the risk of childhood leukemia were examined in the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study, a case-control study, between 1995 and 2002. The present analysis included 327 acute childhood leukemia cases (281 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 46 acute myeloid leukemia (AML)) and 416 controls matched on age, sex, maternal race, and Hispanic ethnicity. Maternal smoking was not associated with an increased risk of either ALL or AML. Paternal preconception smoking was significantly associated with an increased risk of AML (odds ratio = 3.84, 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 14.17); an increased risk for ALL was suggestive for paternal preconception smoking (odds ratio = 1.32, 95% confidence interval: 0.86, 2.04). Greater risks of ALL were observed compared with the risk associated with paternal preconception smoking alone, when paternal preconception smoking was combined with maternal postnatal smoking (p(interaction) = 0.004) or postnatal passive smoking exposure (p(interaction) = 0.004). These results strongly suggest that exposure to paternal preconception smoking alone or in combination with postnatal passive smoking may be important in the risk of childhood leukemia.","['Chang, Jeffrey S', 'Selvin, Steve', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Crouse, Vonda', 'Golembesky, Amanda', 'Buffler, Patricia A']","['Chang JS', 'Selvin S', 'Metayer C', 'Crouse V', 'Golembesky A', 'Buffler PA']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-7380, USA. jeffreyc@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,['0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'California/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', '*Parents', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/*adverse effects', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/*adverse effects']",2006/04/07 09:00,2006/07/14 09:00,['2006/04/07 09:00'],"['2006/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['kwj143 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kwj143 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2006 Jun 15;163(12):1091-100. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwj143.

In the present study, FPG was compared with endonuclease III (ENDOIII) and human 8-hydroxyguanine DNA-glycosylase (hOGG1) for the ability to modify the sensitivity of the comet assay. Mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells were treated with dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) as a standard solvent or reference agents known to induce oxidative damage (gamma irradiation and potassium bromate) or alkylation (methyl methanesulfonate, MMS; ethylnitrosurea, ENU). Using DMSO even up to toxic concentrations, no increase in breaks was seen with FPG, ENDOIII or hOGG1. With gamma irradiation (1-10 Gy), dose-related increases in breaks were seen with all three enzymes. FPG and hOGG1 gave similar increases in breaks after potassium bromate treatment between 0.25 and 2.5 mmol/l, but ENDOIII showed an increase only at the highest concentration, 2.5 mmol/l. Following MMS treatment (5-23 micromol/l), FPG induced a dramatic increase in breaks compared with control levels and ENDOIII also showed a significant but smaller increase; in marked contrast, hOGG1 gave no increase. With ENU (0.5-2.0 mmol/l), increases in breaks were seen with FPG and ENDOIII at 1 and 2 mmol/l but, again, no increase was observed with hOGG1. These data indicate that all three endonucleases recognize oxidative DNA damage and, in addition, FPG and ENDOIII also recognize alkylation damage. Therefore, caution should be taken when using FPG and ENDOIII in the comet assay with an agent that has an unknown mode of action since any additional strand breaks induced by either enzyme cannot necessarily be ascribed to oxidative damage. The use of hOGG1 in the modified comet assay offers a useful alternative to FPG and is apparently more specific for 8-oxoguanine and methyl-fapy-guanine.","['Smith, Catherine C', ""O'Donovan, Michael R"", 'Martin, Elizabeth A']","['Smith CC', ""O'Donovan MR"", 'Martin EA']","['Genetic Toxicology, Safety Assessment AstraZeneca, Alderley Park, Macclesfield, Cheshire, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,"['0 (Bromates)', '0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', '04MB35W6ZA (potassium bromate)', '5614-64-2 (8-hydroxyguanine)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', 'AT5C31J09G (Methyl Methanesulfonate)', 'EC 3.1.25.1 (Deoxyribonuclease (Pyrimidine Dimer))', 'EC 3.1.25.1 (NTH protein, E coli)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (DNA Glycosylases)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (oxoguanine glycosylase 1, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.23 (DNA-Formamidopyrimidine Glycosylase)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)', 'P8M1T4190R (Ethylnitrosourea)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bromates/pharmacology', 'Comet Assay/*methods', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Glycosylases/*metabolism', 'DNA Repair Enzymes', '*DNA-Formamidopyrimidine Glycosylase', 'Deoxyribonuclease (Pyrimidine Dimer)/*metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Escherichia coli Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ethylnitrosourea/pharmacology', 'Gamma Rays', 'Guanine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Methyl Methanesulfonate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2006/04/07 09:00,2006/08/04 09:00,['2006/04/07 09:00'],"['2006/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['gel019 [pii]', '10.1093/mutage/gel019 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutagenesis. 2006 May;21(3):185-90. doi: 10.1093/mutage/gel019.

In multivariate analysis, the 3-year relapse rate was significantly increased after RIC (hazard ratio [HR], 1.64; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.2-2.2; P = .001), but the 3-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM) rate was decreased in the RIC group (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.41-0.91; P = .015).

In conclusion, the lower 3-year NRM after RIC is encouraging, since these patients were older (age > 50 years in 73% RIC vs 28% in SMC, P < .001) and had more adverse pretransplantation variables.

IC50(imatinib) is defined as the in vitro concentration of drug required to reduce phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Crkl by 50%. We now show that interpatient variability in IC50(imatinib) is mainly due to differences in the efficiency of imatinib intracellular uptake and retention (IUR). In 25 untreated CML patients, the IC50(imatinib) strongly correlated (R (2) = -0.484, P = .014 at 2 muM imatinib) with the IUR of [(14)C]imatinib. The addition of prazosin, a potent inhibitor of OCT-1 cellular transporter, reduced the IUR and eliminated interpatient variability. IC50 values for the more potent BCR-ABL inhibitor nilotinib (AMN107) did not correlate with IC50(imatinib) (R(2) =-0.0561, P > .05). There was also no correlation between IC50(nilotinib) and the IUR for [(14)C]nilotinib (R (2) = 0.457, P > .05). Prazosin had no effect on nilotinib IUR, suggesting that influx of nilotinib is not mediated by OCT-1. In conclusion, whereas OCT-1-mediated influx may be a key determinant of molecular response to imatinib, it is unlikely to impact on cellular uptake and patient response to nilotinib. Determining interpatient and interdrug differences in cellular uptake and retention could allow individual optimization of kinase inhibitor therapy.","['White, Deborah L', 'Saunders, Verity A', 'Dang, Phuong', 'Engler, Jane', 'Zannettino, Andrew C W', 'Cambareri, Antony C', 'Quinn, Steven R', 'Manley, Paul W', 'Hughes, Timothy P']","['White DL', 'Saunders VA', 'Dang P', 'Engler J', 'Zannettino AC', 'Cambareri AC', 'Quinn SR', 'Manley PW', 'Hughes TP']","['Division of Hematology, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS) & Hanson Institute, Adelaide, South Australia. deb.white@imvs.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Carbon Isotopes)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-1)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics', 'Benzamides', 'Carbon Isotopes', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-1/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",2006/04/07 09:00,2006/08/23 09:00,['2006/04/07 09:00'],"['2006/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52824-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-11-4687 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jul 15;108(2):697-704. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-11-4687.

Cannabinoid administration decreases heat production by altering hypothalamic neurotransmitter production. Experimental and human data have also shown that the endocannabinoid system is involved in the regulation of reproductive function at both central and peripheral levels. We discuss also the role of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in gestation, and in particular the regulation of the activity of FAAH by progesterone and leptin.

A higher positive rate for WT1-specific CTL and a correlation with the clinical response suggest that WT1 may be a useful antigen for a wider monitoring application.","['Morita, Yuriko', 'Heike, Yuji', 'Kawakami, Mami', 'Miura, Osamu', 'Nakatsuka, Shin-Ichi', 'Ebisawa, Michiko', 'Mori, Shin-Ichiro', 'Tanosaki, Ryuji', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Kim, Sung-Won', 'Tobinai, Kensei', 'Takaue, Yoichi']","['Morita Y', 'Heike Y', 'Kawakami M', 'Miura O', 'Nakatsuka S', 'Ebisawa M', 'Mori S', 'Tanosaki R', 'Fukuda T', 'Kim SW', 'Tobinai K', 'Takaue Y']","['Division of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'WT1 Proteins/*immunology']",2006/04/06 09:00,2006/09/13 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.21960 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2006 Sep 15;119(6):1360-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.21960.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, their nature predisposes patients to unwanted complications. METHODS: CVC-related complications were retrospectively analyzed in 227 hematologic patients who were consecutively admitted to our hematology department between May 2002 and April 2004. Patients' diagnoses comprised acute myeloid leukemia (36.8%), acute lymphoid leukemia (7.3%), lymphoproliferative disorders (28.3%), multiple myeloma (19.5%), myeloproliferative syndromes (5%) and others (3.1%). The CVCs used were polyurethane three lumen 7-Fr (111 patients) for chemotherapy and 12-Fr (114 patients) for chemotherapy and peripheral blood stem cell apheresis, plus two tunneled catheters. RESULTS: The pathological events were: bacteriaemias (n=46); occlusions (n=10); exit tunnel infections (n=8); thrombosis (n=6); lung emboli (n=2). Among febrile patients the bacteriemia frequency was 20%, of which 13.6% were CVC-related (with a higher incidence in leukemia patients (p=0.027). Among the isolates, gram-positive bacteria were found in 29 cases (23 CVC-related cases), and gram-negative bacteria in 16 cases (8 CVC-related cases). Only one patient had Candida albicans sepsis. At univariate and multivariate analysis significant risk factors for infection (p<0.0001) were only the number of days/catheters and neutropenia duration. CONCLUSIONS: In our hematologic patients, the CVC complications were mainly septic, with only 10.1% of CVC-related bacteriemias, despite prolonged catheterization duration. Acute leukemia patients were at major risk for sepsis, probably due to a more severe neutropenia and prolonged catheterization duration.","['Nosari, A', 'Nichelatti, M', 'De Gasperi, A', 'Nador, G', 'Anghilieri, M', 'Mazza, E', 'Cozzi, P', 'Mancini, V', 'Miqueleiz, S', 'Bettinelli, L', 'Lucchesini, C', 'Barate, C', 'Ricci, F', 'Ciapanna, D', 'Ravelli, E', 'Morra, E']","['Nosari A', 'Nichelatti M', 'De Gasperi A', 'Nador G', 'Anghilieri M', 'Mazza E', 'Cozzi P', 'Mancini V', 'Miqueleiz S', 'Bettinelli L', 'Lucchesini C', 'Barate C', 'Ricci F', 'Ciapanna D', 'Ravelli E', 'Morra E']","[""Division of Hematology, Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital, Milan, Italy.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Vasc Access,The journal of vascular access,100940729,,,,2006/04/06 09:00,2006/04/06 09:01,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:01 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/112972980400500406 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vasc Access. 2004 Oct-Dec;5(4):168-73. doi: 10.1177/112972980400500406.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Using data of the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, we designed three inception cohorts: 1975-1977 (n=25,920), 1983-1985 (n=32,722) and 1991-1993 (n=40,819), and analyzed their incidences of second cancers during the first 8 years after initial breast cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: Between the 1970s and the 1990s, the incidence rate of malignant second cancer significantly increased among female breast cancer patients, of which second non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and kidney cancer increased by about 150%, while second cancers of the thyroid, uterine corpus and skin melanoma increased 80%, and cancer of the lung increased 50%. The patterns of trend of second cancers were somewhat similar to those of the general population except for second endometrial cancer at all ages and second leukemia and skin melanoma among young patients aged 20-49. In the 1990s, the risk ratios (RR) of all sites cancer were found to be 5.5 (95% CI=5.0-6.1) for age 20-49, 1.3 (1.3-1.4) for age 50-64, and 1.2 (1.1-1.2) for age 65 and over, comparing breast cancer patients to general population. Additionally, radiotherapy slightly increased the risks of second leukemia (RR=1.8, 1.2-2.8), and second endometrial (RR=1.3, 1.0-1.6) and breast (RR=1.2, 1.1-1.3) cancers. CONCLUSIONS: The fixed inception cohort method is valid for analyzing cancer registry-based second cancer data. By this method, we found that the incidence of second cancer has substantially increased among female breast cancer patients over the past 25 years. Observed changes in incidence may partially reflect the effect of treatments. Because the absolute number of affected patients is small, however, the breast cancer treatments have remained safe for most patients.","['Yu, Guo-Pei', 'Schantz, Stimson P', 'Neugut, Alfred I', 'Zhang, Zuo-Feng']","['Yu GP', 'Schantz SP', 'Neugut AI', 'Zhang ZF']","['Biostatistics and Epidemiology Service, The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, 310 East 14th street, New York, NY 10003, USA. gyu@nyee.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'United States/epidemiology']",2006/04/06 09:00,2006/10/28 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2005/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10552-005-0338-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2006 May;17(4):411-20. doi: 10.1007/s10552-005-0338-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This observation raises the possibility that factors affecting caspase activation might be important determinants of anticancer drug sensitivity. Ectopic expression of caspase-1 has been shown to trigger apoptosis. However, the role of caspase-1 in apoptosis is now considered as minor compared to other caspases. In patients, high levels of caspase-1 expression may be associated with spontaneous regression in neuroblastomas and with a good clinical response to chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia and osteosarcoma. In experimental therapeutics for cancer, caspase-1 has been related to some anticancer activity. These observations led us to examine the effect of over-expression on the response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in vitro and in vivo. Caspase-1 expression mediated by an adenoviral vector was able to kill directly cells and to sensitise the remaining cells to cisplatin or gamma-radiation in vitro. In HeLa cells stably transfected with caspase-1, sensitisation to cisplatin was due to an amplification of the cisplatin-induced mitochondrial apoptotic pathway activation. Caspase-1 mediated sensitisation to cisplatin and gamma-radiation was also observed in vivo. Altogether, we conclude that caspase-1 can act as a radio- and chemo-sensitiser, in vitro and in vivo.","['Martin-Duque, Pilar', 'Quintanilla, Miguel', 'McNeish, Iain', 'Lopes, Rita', 'Romero, Jesus', 'Romero, Diana', 'Lemoine, Nick R', 'Ramon y Cajal, Santiago', 'Vassaux, Georges']","['Martin-Duque P', 'Quintanilla M', 'McNeish I', 'Lopes R', 'Romero J', 'Romero D', 'Lemoine NR', 'Ramon y Cajal S', 'Vassaux G']","[""Cancer Research-UK Molecular Oncology Unit, Bart's and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, John Vane Science Centre, UK. p.martin@ufv.es""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics/radiation effects', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Gamma Rays', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/*methods']",2006/04/06 09:00,2006/10/25 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2006 May;17(5):841-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of these abnormalities significantly influenced the period of treatment-free survival as well as other clinical characteristics. In particular, CLL samples with trisomy 12 and 11q22.3 deletion were associated with shorter treatment-free survival. In order to identify the under-lying molecular differences among CLL subgroups with different chromosome abnormalities, gene expression profiling was performed on a custom DNA microarray consisting of 10,000 human gene-specific oligonucleotides. A gene dosage effect was observed where the expression of genes at the genetic loci of the sites of the somatic genomic abnormality was altered in a fashion according to the type of genomic change. This phenomenon was particularly evident in CLL samples with trisomy 12 and 17p13 deletion.

We have demonstrated that isothiocyanates are also growth regulators, inhibiting cell cycle cdk activity and up-regulating inhibitor p21WAF1 (p21) in cancer cells. The up-stream mechanism to modulate cell cycle progression remained to be elucidated. Here, we have demonstrated that exposure of HL-60 leukemia cells to PHI induced G1 arrest and apoptosis. The hypothesis that PHI inhibits cell growth via chromatin remodeling was investigated. PHI mediates the complex cross talk between chromatin and DNA, and it was demonstrated for the first time as an inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDAC). Thus, the HDAC activity in PHI-exposed HL-60 cells was reduced. Additionally, PHI reduced the expression of HDAC and increased the level of acetyl transferase p300, in favor of accumulation of acetylated histones. Within hours, global acetylation of histones was enhanced. PHI further mediated selective alterations of histone methylation, with a pattern consistent to the marks of transcription competent chromatins. The relationship between acetylated histones and p21 was examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Chromatins from cells exposed to PHI contained more p21 DNA in the precipitates of hyperacetylated histones, indicating more accessibility of transcription machinery to the p21 promoter after chromatin unfolding. The cell cycle inhibitors were activated as a result. In contrast to the PHI-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells, which was mediated by caspase-9 up-regulation and bcl-2 reduction, PHI did not induce significant apoptosis in the mononuclear cells from normal peripheral blood and bone marrow. The results revealed a potential selective effect of isothiocyanates to inhibit the growth of malignant cells.","['Ma, Xudong', 'Fang, Yuqiang', 'Beklemisheva, Anastasia', 'Dai, Wei', 'Feng, Jingyang', 'Ahmed, Tauseef', 'Liu, Delong', 'Chiao, J W']","['Ma X', 'Fang Y', 'Beklemisheva A', 'Dai W', 'Feng J', 'Ahmed T', 'Liu D', 'Chiao JW']","['Department of Medicine, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY 10595, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '133920-06-6 (6-phenylhexyl isothiocyanate)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/drug effects/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics']",2006/04/06 09:00,2006/05/25 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2006 May;28(5):1287-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether molecular detection and monitoring of CML is comparable using peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) aspirate samples, we performed a prospective study using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) of paired PB and BM samples from 41 patients with CML entered onto a single Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) treatment study. QRT-PCR analysis of PB and BM samples was performed prior to initiation of, and during, treatment with homoharringtonine and cytarabine on a CALGB study for previously untreated CML. Statistical analyses demonstrated good agreement of PB and BM pre-treatment samples. However, using the Bland-Altman statistical method that measures true agreement between PB and BM values, we found that there was only modest agreement of BCR-ABL measurements in PB and BM for samples obtained during treatment. PB values obtained during treatment tended to be lower than the corresponding BM values [average difference = -0.37 (p<0.001) in 36 paired samples] and the 95% limits of agreement ranged from -1.23 to 0.48. Nevertheless, our study demonstrates that BM and PB QRT-PCR values followed a similar trend during treatment (Spearman correlation coefficient, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70, 0.96). Our data suggest that, quantitatively, PB and BM measurements of BCR-ABL are frequently disparate. Since BM values tended to be higher than PB values, BM sampling provides the most accurate assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD). Based on these results, we caution against interchanging BM with PB sampling for MRD monitoring during treatment of CML since this may lead to misinterpretation of treatment results.","['Stock, Wendy', 'Yu, Daohai', 'Karrison, Ted', 'Sher, Dorie', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Stock W', 'Yu D', 'Karrison T', 'Sher D', 'Stone RM', 'Larson RA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['University of Chicago Cancer Research Center, Chicago, IL 60637, USA. wstock@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'DNA Primers', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Harringtonines/administration & dosage', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/methods', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2006/04/06 09:00,2006/05/25 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2006 May;28(5):1099-103.,,,,,"['CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10-CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Until now the basis for prognostic evaluation and therapeutic decision has been the karyotype, genetic FLT3 abnormalities and the initial chemotherapy response. A question that has emerged is if extensive gene expression analysis may supplement or partly replace current diagnostics. In an attempt to address this question, we performed cDNA microarray analysis on peripheral blood samples of 25 patients with newly diagnosed AML with high blast counts. The patients were randomly selected from a large group of consecutive patients. Leave-one-out crossvalidation (LOOCV) showed with high accuracy that gene expression classifiers could predict if leukaemia samples belonged to the FAB AML-M1 or to the FAB AML-M2 groups. An unsupervised two-dimensional hierarchical cluster analysis generated 3 patient subgroups. Except for an accumulation of samples classified as FAB M1 and M2 in cluster 3, there was no evident relationship between the clusters and the FAB classification. Each subgroup displayed clearly distinguished gene expression patterns validated using real-time quantitative PCR analysis. The identification of specific gene expressions that together constitute regulatory modules must complement cluster analyses in order to achieve an accurate basis for prognosis and prediction.","['Oyan, Anne Margrete', 'Bo, Trond Hellem', 'Jonassen, Inge', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Bruserud, Oystein', 'Kalland, Karl-Henning']","['Oyan AM', 'Bo TH', 'Jonassen I', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Bruserud O', 'Kalland KH']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Gade Institute, Haukeland University Hospital, Centre for Research in Virology, N-5009 Bergen, Norway. anne.oyan@gades.uib.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis']",2006/04/06 09:00,2006/05/25 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2006 May;28(5):1065-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ceramide is a second messenger in apoptosis signaling that has been shown to increase the cytotoxicity of various anti-cancer drugs. In this study, we determined whether manipulation of intracellular ceramide levels enhanced LfcinB-induced apoptosis of estrogen-nonresponsive MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells. LfcinB caused DNA fragmentation and morphological changes consistent with apoptosis in MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cell cultures, but did not affect the viability of untransformed mammary epithelial cells. MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells also exhibited DNA fragmentation and morphological changes consistent with apoptosis following exposure to the cell-permeable ceramide analog C6. An additive increase in DNA fragmentation was observed when both LfcinB and C6 ceramide were added to MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cell cultures. A greater than additive increase in DNA fragmentation was seen when LfcinB was used in combination with tamoxifen, which prevents the metabolism of endogenous ceramide to glucosylceramide by glucosylceramide synthase, as well as blocking estrogen receptor signaling. However, a selective inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase,1-phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol, failed to further increase DNA fragmentation by LfcinB, suggesting that tamoxifen enhanced LfcinB-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells via a mechanism that did not involve glucosylceramide synthase inhibition. We conclude that combination therapy with LfcinB and tamoxifen warrants further investigation for possible use in the treatment of breast cancer.","['Furlong, Suzanne J', 'Mader, Jamie S', 'Hoskin, David W']","['Furlong SJ', 'Mader JS', 'Hoskin DW']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia B3H 1X5, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '146897-68-9 (lactoferricin B)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Breast/drug effects/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ceramides/*pharmacology', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lactoferrin/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism', 'Tamoxifen/*pharmacology']",2006/04/06 09:00,2006/06/14 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2006 May;15(5):1385-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Empirical antifungal therapy with amphotericin B has been the standard of care for these patients; however, there remains a need for less toxic alternative drugs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of micafungin (MCFG), a novel antifungal agent of the echinocandin class, in an empirical therapy setting for patients with febrile neutropenia. RESULTS: A total of 31 patients with acute leukemia who developed febrile neutropenia were enrolled in the study. Among them, 18 patients fulfilling the protocol-defined criteria, including 10 with persistent fever and 8 with recurrent fever, received MCFG empirically. Underlying diseases consisted of acute myeloid leukemia (n=15) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=3). The median duration of neutropenia and drug administration was 22 and 9.5 days, respectively. Treatment success, defined as defervescence during the neutropenic period, absence of breakthrough fungal infections, and requiring no replacement of antifungal drugs, was achieved in 14 patients (78%). None of the patients required discontinuation or dose reduction due to adverse events except for one patient with severe hypokalemia. CONCLUSIONS: Although the studied patients were limited in number, our results indicate that MCFG is an encouraging agent for empirical antifungal therapy in patients with febrile neutropenia, and deserves further investigation in large-scale studies.","['Yanada, Masamitsu', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Murata, Makoto', 'Suzuki, Momoko', 'Iwai, Masanori', 'Yokozawa, Toshiya', 'Baba, Hisashi', 'Emi, Nobuhiko', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Yanada M', 'Kiyoi H', 'Murata M', 'Suzuki M', 'Iwai M', 'Yokozawa T', 'Baba H', 'Emi N', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Hematology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Intern Med,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",9204241,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', 'R10H71BSWG (Micafungin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Echinocandins', 'Female', 'Fever/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications', 'Lipopeptides', 'Lipoproteins/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Micafungin', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/complications/*drug therapy', 'Peptides, Cyclic/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications', 'Prospective Studies']",2006/04/06 09:00,2006/08/10 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/internalmedicine/45.1498 [pii]', '10.2169/internalmedicine.45.1498 [doi]']",ppublish,Intern Med. 2006;45(5):259-64. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.45.1498.

Sequences were considered affected by cold if they showed statistically significant changes in expression and also met published post hoc filter criteria (changes in geometric mean expression of > or =2-fold and expression calls of ""present"" or ""marginal"" in at least half of the experiments). Changes in the expression of selected sequences were further confirmed by PCR. Sixty-seven sequences met the criteria for increased expression (including cold-inducible genes CIRBP and RNA binding motif 3), and 100 sequences showed decreased expression as a result of hypothermia. Functional categories affected by hypothermia included genes involved in immune responses; cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation; and metabolism and biosynthesis. Several heat shock proteins (HSPs) showed decreases in expression. Moderate hypothermia produces substantial changes in gene expression, in categories potentially of systemic importance.

Here, we report that KLF5 interacts with tumor suppressor p53 in regulating the expression of the inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein survivin, which may play a role in pathological process of cancer. The core promoter region of survivin contains multiple GT-boxes that have been characterized as KLF5 response elements. Deletion and mutation analyses as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation and electronic mobility shift assay indicated that KLF5 binds to the core survivin promoter and strongly induces its activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that KLF5 protein is able to bind to p53 and abrogate the p53-regulated repression of survivin. Transfection of KLF5 into a KLF5-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line EU-8 enhanced survivin expression, and conversely, silencing of KLF5 by small interfering RNA in a KLF5-overexpressing acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line EU-4 down-regulated survivin expression.

Although the transcriptional control of TNFSF6 gene expression is subjected to intense study, the role of its chromatin organization and accessibility to the transcriptional machinery is not known. Here, we determined the chromatin organization of TNFSF6 gene 5' regulatory regions. Using the indirect end-labeling technique, a unique region named HSS1 and encompassing nucleotides -189 to +185 according to the transcriptional start site, was identified throughout a 20-kilobase nucleosomal DNA domain surrounding the promoter. The HSS1 region displayed hypersensitivity to in vivo DNase I digestion in TNFSF6-expressing cells only, including upon T cell activation. Hypersensitivity to micrococcal nuclease digestion and to specific restriction enzyme digestion suggested the precise positioning of two nucleosomes across the transcription start site and minimal promoter region, likely interfering with TNFSF6 active transcription in T lymphocytes. Indeed, HSS1 hypersensitivity to nuclease digestion strictly correlated with TNFSF6 transcription, including in primary and leukemia T cells. HSS1 chromatin remodeling preceded detectable TNFSF6 mRNA accumulation and was blocked by cycloheximide that also prevented TNFSF6 transcription. However, DNA methylation levels of the TNFSF6 HSS1 region did not correlate with transcriptional activation. Induction of global protein acetylation by treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors was not accompanied by HSS1 chromatin remodeling and/or TNFSF6 transcription. We conclude that chromatin remodeling is a primary event in the activation of TNFSF6 expression in primary and leukemia T cells and that mechanisms independent of protein deacetylation and of DNA methylation of the TNFSF6 promoter region are involved in the repression of TNFSF6 gene expression.","['Castellano, Remy', 'Vire, Berengere', 'Pion, Marjorie', 'Quivy, Vincent', 'Olive, Daniel', 'Hirsch, Ivan', 'Van Lint, Carine', 'Collette, Yves']","['Castellano R', 'Vire B', 'Pion M', 'Quivy V', 'Olive D', 'Hirsch I', 'Van Lint C', 'Collette Y']","['INSERM UMR599, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Universite de la Mediterranee, 27 Boulevard Lei Roure, 13009 Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factors)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.1.31.1 (Micrococcal Nuclease)']",IM,"['Chromatin/*metabolism', 'CpG Islands', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', '*DNA Methylation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Micrococcal Nuclease/metabolism', 'Nucleosomes/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors/*genetics/*metabolism']",2006/04/06 09:00,2006/07/11 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)72415-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M602373200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 May 26;281(21):14719-28. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M602373200.

One of the most striking features of the immune response in HAM/TSP centers on the expansion of HTLV-1-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) compartment in the peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid. More than 90% of the HTLV-1-specific CTLs are directed against the viral Tax (11-19) peptide implying that Tax is available for immune recognition by antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs). DCs obtained from HAM/TSP patients have been shown to be infected with HTLV-1 and exhibit rapid maturation. Therefore, we hypothesized that presentation of Tax peptides by activated DCs to naIve CD8(+) T cells may play an important role in the induction of a Tax-specific CTL response and neurologic dysfunction. In this study, a pathway-specific antigen presenting cell gene array was used to study transcriptional changes induced by exposure of monocyte-derived DCs to extracellular HTLV-1 Tax protein. Approximately 100 genes were differentially expressed including genes encoding toll-like receptors, cell surface receptors, proteins involved in antigen uptake and presentation and adhesion molecules. The differential regulation of chemokines and cytokines characteristic of functional DC activation was also observed by the gene array analyses. Furthermore, the expression pattern of signal transduction genes was also significantly altered. These results have suggested that Tax-mediated DC gene regulation might play a critical role in cellular activation and the mechanisms resulting in HTLV-1-induced disease.","['Ahuja, Jaya', 'Kampani, Karan', 'Datta, Suman', 'Wigdahl, Brian', 'Flaig, Katherine E', 'Jain, Pooja']","['Ahuja J', 'Kampani K', 'Datta S', 'Wigdahl B', 'Flaig KE', 'Jain P']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute for Molecular Medicine and Infectious Disease, Center for Molecular Virology and Neuroimmunology, Center for Cancer Biology, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19102, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Neurovirol,Journal of neurovirology,9508123,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/*virology', 'Dendritic Cells/*virology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",2006/04/06 09:00,2006/07/20 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['P721771174TR8343 [pii]', '10.1080/13550280600614981 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurovirol. 2006 Feb;12(1):47-59. doi: 10.1080/13550280600614981.,,,,,['CA54559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These two genes encode cytosolic flavoenzymes that catalyse the beneficial two-electron reduction of quinones to hydroquinones. This reaction prevents the unwanted one-electron reduction of quinones by other quinone reductases; one-electron reduction results in the formation of reactive oxygen species, generated by redox cycling of semiquinones in the presence of molecular oxygen. Both the mammalian NQO1 and NQO2 genes are upregulated as a part of the oxidative stress response and are inexplicably overexpressed in particular types of tumours. A non-synonymous mutation in the NQO1 gene, leading to absence of enzyme activity, has been associated with an increased risk of myeloid leukaemia and other types of blood dyscrasia in workers exposed to benzene. NQO2 has a melatonin-binding site, which may explain the anti-oxidant role of melatonin. An ancient NQO3 subfamily exists in eubacteria and the authors suggest that there should be additional divisions of the NQO family to include the NQO4 subfamily in fungi and NQO5 subfamily in archaebacteria. Interestingly, no NQO genes could be identified in the worm, fly, sea squirt or plants; because these taxa carry quinone reductases capable of one- and two-electron reductions, there has been either convergent evolution or redundancy to account for the appearance of these enzyme functions whenever they have been needed during evolution.","['Vasiliou, Vasilis', 'Ross, David', 'Nebert, Daniel W']","['Vasiliou V', 'Ross D', 'Nebert DW']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO 80262, USA. vasilis.vasiliou@uchsc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",England,Hum Genomics,Human genomics,101202210,"['0 (Flavoproteins)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.8.1.4 (Dihydrolipoamide Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Dihydrolipoamide Dehydrogenase/genetics', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Flavoproteins/genetics', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', '*Multigene Family', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/genetics', 'NADPH Oxidases/*genetics', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/genetics']",2006/04/06 09:00,2006/08/01 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1186/1479-7364-2-5-329 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Genomics. 2006 Mar;2(5):329-35. doi: 10.1186/1479-7364-2-5-329.,,,,,"['P30 ES06096/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES09554/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY11490/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3500182,41,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report that infection of MT-2 cells with HIV-1 leads to efficient proteolysis of PABP. Analysis of PABP integrity was carried out in BHK-21 (baby-hamster kidney) and COS-7 cells upon individual expression of the protease from several members of the Retroviridae family, e.g. MoMLV (Moloney murine leukaemia virus), MMTV (mouse mammary tumour virus), HTLV-I (human T-cell leukaemia virus type I), SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus), HIV-1 and HIV-2. Moreover, protease activity against PABP was tested in a HeLa-cell-free system. Only MMTV, HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases were able to cleave PABP in the absence of other viral proteins. Purified HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases cleave PABP1 directly at positions 237 and 477, separating the two first RNA-recognition motifs from the C-terminal domain of PABP. An additional cleavage site located at position 410 was detected for HIV-2 protease.

However, the methods are time-consuming and costly for routine clinical practice. OBJECTIVES: To review the literature regarding GE data that may provide important information regarding pathogenesis and that may be extrapolated for use in diagnosing and prognosticating lymphomas and leukemias; to present GE findings in Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, acute leukemias, and chronic myeloid leukemia in detail; and to summarize the practical clinical applications in tables that are referenced throughout the text. DATA SOURCE: PubMed was searched for pertinent literature from 1993 to 2005. CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression profiling of lymphomas and leukemias aids in the diagnosis and prognostication of these diseases. The extrapolation of these findings to more timely, efficient, and cost-effective methods, such as flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, results in better diagnostic tools to manage the diseases. Flow cytometric and immunohistochemical applications of the information gained from GE profiling assist in the management of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, other low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas and leukemias, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, and classic Hodgkin lymphoma. For practical clinical use, GE profiling of precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia, precursor T acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia has supported most of the information that has been obtained by cytogenetic and molecular studies (except for the identification of FLT3 mutations for molecular analysis), but extrapolation of the analyses leaves much to be gained based on the GE profiling data.","['Dunphy, Cherie H']",['Dunphy CH'],"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7525, USA. cdunphy@unch.unc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis']",2006/04/06 09:00,2006/04/19 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['RA5087 [pii]', '10.5858/2006-130-483-GEPDIL [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2006 Apr;130(4):483-520. doi: 10.5858/2006-130-483-GEPDIL.,,,,,,,173,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the cell lines investigated, all 3 MCT cell lines showed high expression of RARalpha, and the most effective cell growth inhibition was observed in ATRA-treated MCT cell lines. However, remarkable antiproliferative effects of ATRA treatments were not observed on other tumor cell lines with moderate or low RARalpha mRNA expression. As a result of the relationship between RARalpha mRNA expression and ATRA treatment with regression analysis, statistically significant correlation was suggested. Furthermore, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of RARalpha was performed on MCT tissue samples of dogs with spontaneous disease, and 5 of 9 tissues showed high expression.

Diagnosis and treatment of ALL remains an important issue in pediatric practice. The great variety of prognostic factors has been recognized and applied for the stratification into different risk groups and consequently for selection of the most appropriate treatment. The most significant prognostic factors include age, sex, white blood count at diagnosis, infiltration of the extramedullary organs, and central nervous system involvement. The experience of numerous pediatric hemato-oncology centers has shown that above-mentioned prognostic criteria are not sufficient and they emphasize the need for determination of the response to glucocorticosteroids at day 8 of treatment. A retrospective analysis of treatment results in childhood in ALL patients with regard to steroid response has been performed. The study aimed at analysis whether there is any association between the long-term event-free survival (EFS) in patients with good and poor response to prednisone. The study group consisted of 179 children, aged 2 to 17 years, qualified into low and medium risk groups, treated according to the BFM-86 and BFM-90 protocols in the Department of Pediatrics and Hematology of Silesian Center of Pediatrics in Zabrze between 1986 and 1996. In the study group, 89.9% (161) of children showed good prednisone response (PGR) as compared to 10.1% of children with poor response to steroids (PPR). Cumulative probability of 15-year EFS for the PGR group was 70% and significantly differed from EFS in PPR group (39%; p = 0.006). In the study group, the children showing good response to the initial treatment with prednisone have higher chance for durable remission and subsequent cure. In conclusion, response to glucocorticosteroids employed in the initial treatment of children with ALL, should be included in the stratification into prognostic groups.","['Klimza, Malgorzata J', 'Sonta-Jakimczyk, Danuta J']","['Klimza MJ', 'Sonta-Jakimczyk DJ']",['Studium Doktoranckiego Wydzialu Lekarskiego w Zabrzu.'],['pol'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Wiad Lek,"Wiadomosci lekarskie (Warsaw, Poland : 1960)",9705467,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prednisone/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors']",2006/04/06 09:00,2006/07/11 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Wiad Lek. 2005;58(11-12):622-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,Znaczenie rokownicze odpowiedzi na wstepna steroidoterapie u dzieci chorych na ostra bialaczke limfoblastyczna.,,,,,,,

A 21-year-old woman, with acute recurrent leukemia after bone marrow transplantation, received high-dose Ara-C treatment and 10 days later was referred for psychiatric consultation because of an abrupt onset of convulsion. On neurologic examination, she showed convulsion of all the limbs without loss of consciousness. All limbs looked paretic; however, tendon reflexes in all limbs were normal and pathological reflex was not recognized. When her hand was dropped onto her own face, it fell next to her face but not on her face. Laboratory data were unremarkable. She had no history of psychiatric illness or drug or alcohol abuse. The patient explained that she knew about the recurrence of her own leukemia and the news of the death of a close friend due to leukemia at the same time, which was a shocking event for her, focusing her attention on her own fears of dying from the same disease. Conversion disorder in cancer patients is not common; however, appropriate diagnosis is very important to avoid inappropriate examinations and treatments. In leukemia patients receiving chemotherapy, various kinds of signs and symptoms may develop due to the adverse effects of chemotherapy and/or infection. Therefore, conversion disorder might be overlooked and inappropriate treatment and examinations might be performed. Clinicians should consider conversion disorder in the differential diagnosis when patients develop unexplained neurological symptoms.","['Onishi, Hideki', 'Kamijo, Aki', 'Onose, Masanari', 'Yamada, Tomoki', 'Mizuno, Yasuhiro', 'Ito, Mizuho', 'Saito, Hideyuki', 'Maruta, Ichiro']","['Onishi H', 'Kamijo A', 'Onose M', 'Yamada T', 'Mizuno Y', 'Ito M', 'Saito H', 'Maruta I']","['Department of Psychiatry, Kanagawa Prefecture Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan. h-onishi@jg7.so-net.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Palliat Support Care,Palliative & supportive care,101232529,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Conversion Disorder/complications/*diagnosis/psychology', 'Cytarabine/*adverse effects', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*psychology/therapy', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/*diagnosis', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Seizures/etiology']",2006/04/06 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1017/s147895150404009x [doi]'],ppublish,Palliat Support Care. 2004 Mar;2(1):79-82. doi: 10.1017/s147895150404009x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Denileukin diftitox was administered as 60-minute intravenous infusions for 5 days every 21 days at a dose of 18 mug/kg per day for up to 8 cycles. In total, 28 patients were treated in 2 multiinstitutional studies with similar eligibility criteria and treatment protocols. Twenty-two patients receive > or = 2 cycles of denileukin diftitox and were evaluable for response. RESULTS: Twelve of 22 patients achieved reductions of peripheral CLL cells, with 5 of 12 patients achieving >80% reductions. Six of 22 patients achieved reductions in the size of lymph node on examination and computed tomography scans, and all 6 of those patients met the criteria for a partial or complete response that lasted > or = 2 months. Bone marrow biopsies before and after treatment confirmed a complete remission that lasted for 1 year in 1 patient. Overall, denileukin diftitox produced complete remission in 1 of 22 patients (4%) and partial remission in 5 of 22 patients (23%) for a total remission rate of 27%. Progression-free intervals in the responders were 2 months in 2 patients and 4 months, 6 months, 7 months, and 12 months in 1 patient each. Toxicities were moderate. No infections associated with immunosuppression were seen. There was no significant correlation of response or toxicities with the numbers of denileukin diftitox cycles received or with CD25 levels.

The antioxidant activity of CQPN against various radicals was investigated and its anti-cancer properties against different human tumor cell lines including the solid tumor cell lines hepatocarcinoma (Hep-G2) and breast carcinoma (MCF-7); the hematopoietic tumor cell line lymphoblastic leukemia (1301) was also explored. CQPN activities were compared to that of the known nitrone C-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN). Our results showed that although PBN was the stronger antioxidant than CQPN, the latter was an effective scavenger of different non-physiological (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhyrazyl) and physiological (peroxyl and hydroxyl) radicals. Both of CQPN and PBN possess a significant inhibitory property against LPS-stimulated NO production in macrophage. CQPN and PBN treatment resulted in a growth inhibition in Hep-G2 cells (IC50 31.42 microM and 18.6 microM, respectively). Unlike PBN, CQPN strongly inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells (IC50 14.01 microM) in a dose-dependent manner. On contrary, CQPN and PBN exhibited a proliferative stimulatory activity of the immune cells including macrophages and lymphocytes. Exploring the cytotoxic effect of CQPN against MCF-7 cells indicated that CQPN led to a major time-dependent disturbance in the cell-cycle phases including progressive arrest in both S- and G2/M-phases. This disturbance was found to be associated with a kinetic induction of apoptosis. The novel nitrone derivative CQPN is a strong antioxidant, though less than PBN, and it may be an effective anti-proliferative compound against breast carcinoma.","['Ramadan, Mohamed', 'Gamal-Eldeen, Amira M', 'Abdel-Aziz, Mohamed', 'Abuo-Rahma, Gamal el-Din', 'Abdel-Nabi, Hisham', 'Nagib, Abdel-Hamid']","['Ramadan M', 'Gamal-Eldeen AM', 'Abdel-Aziz M', 'Abuo-Rahma Gel-D', 'Abdel-Nabi H', 'Nagib AH']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, El-Minia University, El-Minia, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Archiv der Pharmazie,0330167,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Nitrogen Oxides)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (nitrones)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Nitrogen Oxides/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Quinolines/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2006/04/06 09:00,2006/06/23 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ardp.200500250 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pharm (Weinheim). 2006 May;339(5):242-9. doi: 10.1002/ardp.200500250.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of these are carcinogens or suspected carcinogens. Increased risk for a number of cancers have been reported, although there are considerable inconsistencies between studies. The present study investigates the mortality of leather tanners in Tuscany, Italy. METHODS: Tanneries were selected from the 1996 Valdarno Inferiore Tanneries Census and were in operation since December 31, 1970. Employees were followed until December 31, 1998 through company records, and the National and Regional Death Index. Demographic and work history data were abstracted from company payrolls. Regional mortality rates were used to calculate Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR). Analyses were completed for the overall cohort (men and women) and for men who ever worked as of finisher, chrome tanners, and vegetable tanner (only men). RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 4,874 workers (4,150 males and 724 females) employed in 92 tanneries active in 1996 and operating on December 31, 1970. Ascertainment of vital status and cause of death were completed for all individuals by the end of follow-up, December 31, 1998. Males showed increases for cancer of the endocrine glands (SMR 5.67, 4 observed (obs), 90% Confidence Intervals (CI) 195-1,308), blood diseases (SMR 3.29, 4 obs, 90% CI 112-753), mental disorders (SMR 1.95, 6 obs, 90% CI 85-385), violence and accidents (SMR 1.30, 54 obs, 90% CI 102-163). Mortality from myeloid leukemia was increased in males (SMR 2.08, 5 obs, 90% CI 82-437) and in females (SMR 5.99, 2 obs, 90% CI 106-1,887). One death from nasal cancer was observed versus 0.2 expected. Mortality from lung cancer was increased among finishers (SMR 1.45, 19 obs, 90% CI 95-212), an increase was observed also for bladder cancer (SMR 1.25, 2 obs, 90% CI 22-393) and pancreatic cancer (SMR 1.20, 2 obs, 90% CI 21-379). CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms previous observations among tanners of increased mortality from lung, bladder, and pancreatic cancer. Noteworthy are the increased mortality from myeloid leukemia together with the new findings of an increased mortality from endocrine glands tumors, blood diseases, and psychiatric disorders which should be considered with caution because of the small number of cases and the novelty of the observation.","['Iaia, Tonina E', 'Bartoli, Dusca', 'Calzoni, Paola', 'Comba, Pietro', 'De Santis, Marco', 'Dini, Flavia', 'Farina, Giuseppe A', 'Valiani, Mauro', 'Pirastu, Roberta']","['Iaia TE', 'Bartoli D', 'Calzoni P', 'Comba P', 'De Santis M', 'Dini F', 'Farina GA', 'Valiani M', 'Pirastu R']","['Dipartimento di Prevenzione, Azienda USL n. 11, Toscana, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,,IM,"['Accidents/mortality', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Cause of Death', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/mortality', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/mortality', 'Sex Factors', '*Tanning', 'Violence/statistics & numerical data']",2006/04/06 09:00,2006/10/28 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.20309 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 2006 Jun;49(6):452-9. doi: 10.1002/ajim.20309.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that in vivo infected CD4+ and CD8+ T cells displayed similar patterns of clonal expansion in carriers without malignancy. Cloned infected cells from individuals without malignancy had a dramatic increase in spontaneous proliferation, which predominated in CD8+ lymphocytes and depended on the amount of tax mRNA. In fact, the clonal expansion of HTLV-1-positive CD8+ and CD4+ lymphocytes relied on 2 distinct mechanisms--infection prevented cell death in the former while recruiting the latter into the cell cycle. Cell cycling, but not apoptosis, depended on the level of viral-encoded tax expression. Infected tax-expressing CD4+ lymphocytes accumulated cellular defects characteristic of genetic instability. Therefore, HTLV-1 infection establishes a preleukemic phenotype that is restricted to CD4+ infected clones.","['Sibon, David', 'Gabet, Anne-Sophie', 'Zandecki, Marc', 'Pinatel, Christiane', 'Thete, Julien', 'Delfau-Larue, Marie-Helene', 'Rabaaoui, Samira', 'Gessain, Antoine', 'Gout, Olivier', 'Jacobson, Steven', 'Mortreux, Franck', 'Wattel, Eric']","['Sibon D', 'Gabet AS', 'Zandecki M', 'Pinatel C', 'Thete J', 'Delfau-Larue MH', 'Rabaaoui S', 'Gessain A', 'Gout O', 'Jacobson S', 'Mortreux F', 'Wattel E']","['Oncovirologie et Biotherapies, CNRS UMR5537- Universite Claude Bernard, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,,IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*virology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*virology', 'Carrier State/virology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Preleukemia/metabolism/virology', 'Time Factors']",2006/04/06 09:00,2006/05/17 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2005/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI27198 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2006 Apr;116(4):974-83. doi: 10.1172/JCI27198.,,,['J Clin Invest. 2006 Apr;116(4):858-60.

In chronic myeloid leukemia, a malignancy caused by the BCR/ABL fusion oncoprotein, we showed cell surface expression of MICA on leukemic, but not healthy, donor hemopoietic CD34+ cells. At diagnosis, chronic myeloid leukemia patients had abnormally high serum levels of sMICA and weak NKG2D expression on NK and CD8+ T cells, which were restored by imatinib mesylate (IM) therapy. In the BCR/ABL+ cell line K562, IM decreased both surface MICA/B expression and NKG2D-mediated lysis by NK cells. Silencing BCR/ABL gene expression directly evidenced its role in the control of MICA expression. IM did not affect MICA mRNA levels, but decreased MICA protein production and release. Sucrose density gradient fractionation of K562 cytoplasmic extracts treated with IM showed a shift in the distribution of MICA mRNA from the polysomal toward the monosomal fractions, consistent with decreased translation. Among the major pathways activated by BCR/ABL that regulate translation, PI3K and mammalian target of rapamycin were shown to control MICA expression.

Because defects in the expression of these peptidases could lead to aberrant surface HLA class I expression in tumor cells, we quantitatively assayed 14 EBV-B cell lines and 35 human tumor cell lines of various lineages for: 1) expression and enzymatic activities of ERAP1 and ERAP2; 2) ER peptide-trimming activity in microsomes; 3) expression of HLA class I H chains and TAP1; and 4) surface HLA class I expression. ERAP1 and ERAP2 expression was detectable in all of the EBV-B and tumor cell lines, but in the latter it was extremely variable, sometimes barely detectable, and not coordinated. The expression of the two aminopeptidases corresponded well to the respective enzymatic activities in most cell lines. A peptide-trimming assay in microsomes revealed additional enzymatic activities, presumably contributed by other unidentified aminopeptidases sharing substrate specificity with ERAP2. Interestingly, surface HLA class I expression showed significant correlation with ERAP1 activity, but not with the activity of either ERAP2 or other unidentified aminopeptidases. Transfection with ERAP1 or ERAP2 of two tumor cell lines selected for simultaneous low expression of the two aminopeptidases resulted in the expected, moderate increases of class I surface expression.

The immunoreactivity and avidity of the fusion protein were comparable with those of the intact BC8 Ab, and the scFv(4)SA construct bound an average of 3.9 biotin molecules out of four theoretically possible. Mouse lymphoma xenograft experiments showed minimal toxicity, excellent tumor-specific targeting of the fusion protein and radiolabeled DOTA-biotin in vivo, marked inhibition of tumor growth, and cured 100% of mice bearing CD45-expressing tumors.

The folate/antifolate transporter with the widest tissue distribution and greatest activity is the reduced folate carrier (RFC). There is little evidence that RFC-mediated influx is posttranscriptionally regulated. We show that [(3)H]MTX influx in CCRF-CEM human childhood T-leukemia cells is potentiated up to 6-fold by exogenous 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside (AICAr) in a AICAr and MTX concentration-dependent manner. Metabolism to more biologically active polyglutamate forms is also potentiated for MTX and other antifolates. That potentiation of influx by AICAr is mediated by effects on the RFC is supported by analyses +/-AICAr showing (a) similarity and magnitude of kinetic constants for [(3)H]MTX influx; (b) similarity of inhibitory potency of known RFC substrates; (c) lack of potentiation in a CCRF-CEM subline that does not express the RFC; and (d) similarity of time and temperature dependence. Potentiation occurs rapidly and does not require new protein synthesis. Effects of specific inhibitors of folate metabolism and the time and sequence of AICAr incubation with cells suggest that both dihydrofolate reductase inhibition and metabolism of AICAr are essential for potentiation. Acute folate deficiency or incubation of CCRF-CEM with AICAr-related metabolites (e.g., adenosine) does not initiate potentiation. AICAr increases growth inhibitory potency of MTX and aminopterin against CCRF-CEM cells when both AICAr and antifolate are present for the first 24 hours of a 120-hour growth period. AICAr is the first small molecule that regulates RFC activity.","['McGuire, John J', 'Haile, William H', 'Yeh, Chen-Chen']","['McGuire JJ', 'Haile WH', 'Yeh CC']","['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm & Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.

Because PIM-1 is a STAT5 target gene, we analyzed the role of the family of PIM serine/threonine kinases (PIM-1 to PIM-3) in PTK-mediated transformation of hematopoietic cells. Ba/F3 cells transformed to growth factor independence by various oncogenic PTKs (TEL/JAK2, TEL/TRKC, TEL/ABL, BCR/ABL, FLT3-ITD, and H4/PDGFbetaR) show abundant expression of PIM-1 and PIM-2. Suppression of PIM-1 activity had a negligible effect on transformation. In contrast, expression of kinase-dead PIM-2 mutant (PIM-2KD) led to a rapid decline of survival in Ba/F3 cells transformed by FLT3-ITD but not by other oncogenic PTKs tested. Coexpression of PIM-1KD and PIM-2KD abrogated growth factor-independent growth of Ba/F3 transformed by several PTKs, including BCR/ABL. Targeted down-regulation of PIM-2 by RNA interference (RNAi) selectively abrogated survival of Ba/F3 cells transformed by various Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-activating mutants [internal tandem duplication (ITD) and kinase domain] and attenuated growth of human cell lines containing FLT3 mutations. Interestingly, cells transformed by FLT3 and BCR/ABL mutations that confer resistance to small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors were still sensitive to knockdown of PIM-2, or PIM-1 and PIM-2 by RNAi. Our observations indicate that combined inactivation of PIM-1 and PIM-2 interferes with oncogenic PTKs and suggest that PIMs are alternative therapeutic targets in PTK-mediated leukemia.

Western blot analysis indicated that KP372-1 decreased the phosphorylation of AKT on both Ser(473) and Thr(308); abrogated the phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase, BAD, and Foxo3a via PI3K/AKT signaling; and down-regulated expression of PIM-1 through direct inhibition of FLT3. Treatment of AML cell lines with KP372-1 resulted in rapid generation of reactive oxygen species and stimulation of oxygen consumption, followed by mitochondrial depolarization, caspase activation, and phosphatidylserine externalization. KP372-1 induced pronounced apoptosis in AML cell lines and primary samples irrespective of their FLT3 status, but not in normal CD34(+) cells. Moreover, KP372-1 markedly decreased the colony-forming ability of primary AML samples (IC(50) < 200 nmol/L) with minimal cytotoxic effects on normal progenitor cells. Taken together, our results show that the simultaneous inhibition of critical prosurvival kinases by KP372-1 leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis of AML but not normal hematopoietic progenitor cells.","['Zeng, Zhihong', 'Samudio, Ismael J', 'Zhang, Weiguo', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Pelicano, Helene', 'Harris, David', 'Frolova, Olga', 'Hail, Numsen Jr', 'Chen, Wenjing', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Huang, Peng', 'Lu, Yiling', 'Mills, Gordon B', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Konopleva, Marina']","['Zeng Z', 'Samudio IJ', 'Zhang W', 'Estrov Z', 'Pelicano H', 'Harris D', 'Frolova O', 'Hail N Jr', 'Chen W', 'Kornblau SM', 'Huang P', 'Lu Y', 'Mills GB', 'Andreeff M', 'Konopleva M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1400 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings)', '0 (KP372-1)', '0 (Tetrazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (3-Phosphoinositide-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PDPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Pdpk1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['3-Phosphoinositide-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/physiology', 'Mutation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tetrazoles/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2006/04/06 09:00,2006/05/23 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/7/3737 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1278 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Apr 1;66(7):3737-46. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1278.,,,,,"['CA 16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA 55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we used 16 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines to investigate telomere stabilization mechanisms and their effect on tumor aggressiveness. Three of 16 NSCLC cell lines (VL-9, SK-LU-1, and VL-7) lacked telomerase activity, correlating with significantly reduced tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Of the three telomerase-negative cell lines, only SK-LU-1 displayed characteristics of an ALT mechanism (i.e., highly heterogeneous telomeres and ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies). VL-9 cells gained telomerase during in vitro propagation, indicating incomplete immortalization in vivo. In contrast, NSCLC metastasis-derived VL-7 cells remained telomerase and ALT negative up to high passage numbers and following transplantation in severe combined immunodeficient mice. Telomeres of VL-7 cells were homogeneously short, and chromosomal instability (CIN) was comparable with most telomerase-positive cell lines. This indicates the presence of an efficient telomere stabilization mechanism different from telomerase and ALT in VL-7 cells. To test the effect of ectopic telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) in these unique ALT- and telomerase-negative tumor backgrounds, hTERT was transfected into VL-7 cells. The activation of telomerase led to an excessively rapid gain of telomeric sequences resulting in very long ( approximately 14 kb), uniform telomeres. Additionally, hTERT expression induced a more aggressive growth behavior in vitro and in vivo without altering the level of CIN. These data provide further evidence for a direct oncogenic activity of hTERT not based on the inhibition of CIN.","['Brachner, Andreas', 'Sasgary, Soleman', 'Pirker, Christine', 'Rodgarkia, Chantal', 'Mikula, Mario', 'Mikulits, Wolfgang', 'Bergmeister, Helga', 'Setinek, Ulrike', 'Wieser, Matthias', 'Chin, Suet-Feung', 'Caldas, Carlos', 'Micksche, Michael', 'Cerni, Christa', 'Berger, Walter']","['Brachner A', 'Sasgary S', 'Pirker C', 'Rodgarkia C', 'Mikula M', 'Mikulits W', 'Bergmeister H', 'Setinek U', 'Wieser M', 'Chin SF', 'Caldas C', 'Micksche M', 'Cerni C', 'Berger W']","['Department of Medicine I, Institute of Cancer Research, Medical University of Vienna, Borschkegasse 8a, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Growth Processes/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Telomerase/biosynthesis/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology/physiology', 'Telomere', 'Transfection']",2006/04/06 09:00,2006/05/23 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/7/3584 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2839 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Apr 1;66(7):3584-92. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2839.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study has tested the hypothesis that Mdm2 inhibits the p53 response in normally growing cells by binding to chromatin-associated p53. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that Mdm2 localizes with p53 at its responsive elements on the waf1 and mdm2 genes in human cell lines expressing p53, but not in cell lines lacking p53 expression, indicating that Mdm2 is recruited to regions of DNA in a p53-dependent manner. Interestingly, our results show a decrease of Mdm2 protein associated with p53-responsive elements on the waf1 and mdm2 genes when p53-induced transcription is activated either by DNA damage or through controlled overexpression of p53. Rapid activation of p53 transcriptional activity before increasing p53 protein levels was observed with addition of either small-molecule inhibitors to disrupt the p53-Mdm2 interaction or small interfering RNA to mdm2. These findings indicate Mdm2 transiently localizes with p53 at responsive elements and suggest that latent p53 results from the recruitment of Mdm2 to chromatin.","['White, David E', 'Talbott, Kathryn E', 'Arva, Nicoleta C', 'Bargonetti, Jill']","['White DE', 'Talbott KE', 'Arva NC', 'Bargonetti J']","['The Institute for Biomolecular Structure and Function and Department of Biological Sciences, Hunter College, City University of New York, 695 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/*metabolism/physiology', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Response Elements', 'Transcriptional Activation/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Up-Regulation']",2006/04/06 09:00,2006/05/23 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/7/3463 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1381 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Apr 1;66(7):3463-70. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1381.,,,,,"['1S06 GM 60654/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'RR 03037/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the area of epigenetic therapy, the demethylating drug decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is increasingly used to treat acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, but the mechanisms of its anticancer activity have remained unclear. Given the clinical efficacy of decitabine and the uncertainties about its mode of action, it will be useful to optimize methods for following DNA methylation as a biochemical response in individual patients. Here, we describe a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip-based method (MSNP) for profiling DNA methylation. Using this procedure, the extent of demethylation in bone marrow aspirates from patients with leukemia receiving decitabine can be assessed genome-wide using commercially available (Affymetrix) SNP chips. We validated the accuracy of MSNP by comparing the results with combined bisulfite restriction analysis and by sequencing cloned PCR products from bisulfite-converted DNA. We further validated MSNP in a Wilms' tumor/normal kidney comparison, comparing the results with methylation-sensitive Southern blotting. MSNP simultaneously detects aberrations in DNA copy number and loss of heterozygosity, making it a generally useful approach for combined genetic and epigenetic profiling in tissue samples from cancer patients.","['Yuan, Eric', 'Haghighi, Fatemeh', 'White, Susan', 'Costa, Ramiro', 'McMinn, Julie', 'Chun, Kathy', 'Minden, Mark', 'Tycko, Benjamin']","['Yuan E', 'Haghighi F', 'White S', 'Costa R', 'McMinn J', 'Chun K', 'Minden M', 'Tycko B']","['Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Medical Center, 1150 St. Nicholas Avenue, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Sulfites)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'OJ9787WBLU (hydrogen sulfite)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Decitabine', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sulfites/chemistry', 'Wilms Tumor/drug therapy/*genetics']",2006/04/06 09:00,2006/05/23 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/7/3443 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-3739 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Apr 1;66(7):3443-51. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-3739.,,,,,['R01 CA 102270/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two C-RAF germ-line mutations, S427G and I448V, were identified in patients with therapy-related AML in the absence of alterations in RAS and FLT3. Both exchanges were located within the kinase domain of C-RAF. In vitro and in vivo kinase assays revealed significantly increased activity for (S427G)C-RAF but not for (I448V)C-RAF. The involvement of the S427G C-RAF mutation in constitutive activation of ERK was further confirmed through demonstration of activating phosphorylations on C-RAF, MEK, and ERK in neoplastic cells, but not in nonneoplastic cells. Transformation and survival assays showed oncogenic and antiapoptotic properties for both mutations. Screening healthy individuals revealed a <1/400 frequency of these mutations and, in the case of I448V, inheritance was observed over three generations with another mutation carrier suffering from cancer.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Here we document the expression of PRDM1 in normal and neoplastic lymphoid cells, through the use of a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the molecule in paraffin-embedded tissue sections. A large series of B and T-cell lymphomas (679 cases) was studied, using tissue microarrays. RESULTS: Multiple myeloma, plasmacytoma and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma cases (n=19) were positive. Plasmablastic lymphoma, oral mucosa-type (n=15), were also found to be positive. PRDM1 protein was expressed in some cases of B-cell neoplasia, i.e. chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (15%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (43%), classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (41%) and also in T-cell lymphoma (23%). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Most B-neoplastic cells showing plasmablastic differentiation were PRDM1-positive. Unexpectedly, a subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma expressed PRDM1, lacked detectable plasmablastic or immunoblastic changes and displayed more aggressive behavior, with a shorter failure-free survival. In contrast to normal B-cells, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cases with increased PRDM1 expression co-expressed BCL-6 and MUM1/IRF4, confirming that PRDM1 expression in these tumors is insufficient to drive the full genetic program associated with plasmacytic differentiation.","['Garcia, Jose-Francisco', 'Roncador, Giovanna', 'Garcia, Juan-Fernando', 'Sanz, Ana-Isabel', 'Maestre, Lorena', 'Lucas, Elena', 'Montes-Moreno, Santiago', 'Fernandez Victoria, Rebeca', 'Martinez-Torrecuadrara, Jorge L', 'Marafioti, Teresa', 'Mason, David Y', 'Piris, Miguel A']","['Garcia JF', 'Roncador G', 'Garcia JF', 'Sanz AI', 'Maestre L', 'Lucas E', 'Montes-Moreno S', 'Fernandez Victoria R', 'Martinez-Torrecuadrara JL', 'Marafioti T', 'Mason DY', 'Piris MA']","['Monoclonal Antibodies Unit, Biotechnology Program, Spanish National Cancer Centre (CNIO), Madrid, Spain. jgarcia@cnio.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '138415-26-6 (PRDM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Plasma Cells/cytology', 'Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology']",2006/04/06 09:00,2006/06/13 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2006 Apr;91(4):467-74.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, relapse is common in patients with advanced or high risk disease. Such patients may be eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), raising the question whether imatinib therapy may compromise the outcome of subsequent SCT. DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 70 patients with CML and 21 with Ph+ ALL who had received imatinib prior to SCT. Data were retrieved by directly contacting centers. Multivariate analysis was used to define factors associated with major outcomes (engraftment, graft-versus-host disease, relapse, non-relapse mortality) in addition to descriptive statistics. For the CML patients major outcomes were compared with those of historical controls drawn from the EBMT registry. RESULTS: At SCT, 44% of CML patients were in accelerated phase or blast crisis and 40% of ALL patients had active disease compared to 84% and 95% prior to imatinib. At 24 months, estimated transplant-related mortality was 44% and estimated relapse mortality 24%. Factors associated with shorter overall and progression-free survival were advanced disease at SCT and a female donor/male recipient pairing. No unusual organ toxicities were observed. Compared to historical controls, prior imatinib treatment did not influence overall survival, progression-free survival or non-relapse mortality, while there was a trend towards higher relapse mortality and significantly less chronic graft-versus-host disease.

Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) were obtained from heparinized blood of CML patients by Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation. The expressions of CD1a, CD83, CD86, HLA-ABC, HLA-DR and CD54 on DC induced by IFN-alpha + GM-CSF, IFN-alpha + GM-CSF+IL-4 and IL-4 + GM-CSF for 7 days in vitro were assayed by flow cytometry. The morphologic features were observed by transmission and optical microscopy. The mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) with DC were evaluated by MTT assay. The results showed that the DC cultured in different cytokine combinations expressed significantly higher levels of CD1a, HLA-ABC, HLA-DR, CD86, CD54, and CD83 than those in the precultured. The DC growing with IFN-alpha + GM-CSF expressed significantly higher levels of HLA-ABC, HLA-DR than those in GM-CSF + IL-4. The CD86 expression and MLR levels in IFN-alpha + GM-CSF + IL-4 increased significantly. The expression rate of DC antigens and MLR in the IFN resistant group significantly lower than those in the newly diagnosed and the effectively treated groups after at least 6 months of IFN-alpha treatment (P < 0.05). The DC from the IFN resistant group did not express significantly CD86 and MLR in IFN-alpha + GM-CSF + IL-4 groups compared to those in the newly diagnosed and IFN effective treated groups. It is concluded that the BMMNC from CML cultured in combination with IFN-alpha and other cytokines can be induced into DC with typical morphologic and immunophenotypic characteristics. Addition of IFN-alpha + GM-CSF + IL-4 to DC cultures can significantly up-regulate the expression of major histocompatibility complex molecules, co-stimulatory molecules and various adhesion molecules. The deficiency of DC differentiation and function may play a role in the development of clinical resistance to IFN-alpha.","['Zhang, Yu-Fang', 'Wu, Chong-Yang', 'Zhang, Lian-Sheng', 'Chai, Ye']","['Zhang YF', 'Wu CY', 'Zhang LS', 'Chai Y']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730030, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/pathology']",2006/04/06 09:00,2007/10/20 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2006)01-0137-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2006 Feb;14(1):137-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After the treatment of leukemia cell line K562 by thapsigargin, morphological change of apoptotic cells was investigated by AO/EB fluorescent staining under fluorescent microscope; apoptosis rate was determined with annexin V-FITC/PI double staining by flow cytometry; intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca(2+)]i) were measured by fluorescence spectrophotometer with calcium sensitive fluorescence indicator Fura-2/AM; mitochondrial transmembrance potentials (Delta Psi m) was detected on flow cytometry through staining of Rhodamine (Rh123); the changes of caspase-3, -7, -9, -12, cytochrome C, GRP78 proteins were detected by Western blot. The results showed that K562 cells cultured in 4 micromol/L thapsigargin for 48 hours exhibited typical morphological changes of apoptotic cells under fluorescent microscope, including shrinkage of cell, condensation of chromatin, breakage of nuclear, formation of apoptotic bodies, fluorescence of yellow green and pellet observed in early apoptoyic cells and hyacinth fluorescence of chromatin showed in late apoptotic cells. 24 and 48 hours after exposure to 1, 2, 4, 8 micromol/L thapsigargin, the apoptotic rates of K562 were respectively 7.51%, 11.65%, 23.22%, 30.56% and 12.85%, 20.27%, 31.51%, 44.16%, in dose-dependent manner, and were statistically significant when compared with the controls (P < 0.05). The apoptotic rate of K562 was dose- and time-dependent in experiment range. The enhancement of [Ca(2+)]i and the decrease of the Delta Psi m in K562 cells were induced by thapsigargin and were dose-dependent in experiment range, compared with control, P < 0.05. Western blot results indicated that cleavage and activation of caspase-3, -7, -9, -12, releasing of cytochrome C from mitochondria, upregulation of GRP78 expression at the endoplasmic reticulum were induced in K562 cells after 24 hours exposure of 4 micromol/L thapsigargin. It is concluded that thapsigargin induces endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis in K562 cells. Endoplasmic reticulum is a novel important initiatory site of apoptosis in cells; the cleavage and activation of caspase-3, -7, -9, -12 play very important role in endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis of K562 cells and is one of the important mechanisms for thapsigargin-induced apoptosis. Thapsigargin-induced apoptosis in K562 cells is associated closely with the disruption of the Delta Psi m and the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria, mitochondria participates in endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis in K562 cells.","['Feng, Xian-Qi', 'You, Yong', 'Xiao, Juan', 'Zou, Ping']","['Feng XQ', 'You Y', 'Xiao J', 'Zou P']","['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. fxqnsm2000@yahoo.com.cn']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 7.2.2.10 (Calcium-Transporting ATPases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium-Transporting ATPases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/drug effects/enzymology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Molecular Chaperones/metabolism', 'Thapsigargin/*pharmacology']",2006/04/06 09:00,2007/10/20 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2006)01-0025-06 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2006 Feb;14(1):25-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proteolytic activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the supernatants were measured by zymography. The VEGF protein in serum of all samples was detected by ELISA. All these results were analyzed for determination of the relationship between VEGF and MMP-2, MMP-9. The results showed that there was a positive correlation between expressions of MMP-2 mRNA or MMP-9 mRNA and VEGF mRNA or protein. But no such correlation was demonstrated in the AML (CR) and normal control (NC) groups. A higher expression level of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the VEGF positive group was found, as compared with the negative group (P < 0.05). More extramedullary infiltration occurred in VEGF positive groups than that in VEGF negative groups of AML. The expression of bcl-2 in HL-60 cells was upregulated by VEGF. It is concluded that there are significantly positive correlations between the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 with VEGF mRNA or protein levels in AML patients.

Among clinical samples, expression of PAX5 mRNA in B-ALL was significantly higher than that in T-ALL and AML (P = 0.029 and P = 0.013 respectively). PAX5 expression was significantly lower in T-ALL and AML than that in normal controls. The difference of PAX5 mRNA expression levels between T-ALL and AML was not significant. Individual difference of PAX5 mRNA expression levels in children with B-ALL was great. Moreover, PAX5 mRNA expressions in de novo and relapse patients with B-ALL were significantly higher than those in remission (P = 0.011 and P = 0.006 respectively).

There were 41 cases with extramedullary infiltration and 25 cases without-extramedullary infiltration. Enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry were used to determine expression of SDF-1alpha and CXCR4 respectively on leukemia cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow of different groups. The results showed that average plasma level of SDF-1alpha in the ALL, M(4)+M(5), M(2) patients and the normal control were 1317.87 +/- 220.76, 1339.79 +/- 187.06, 1063.70 +/- 190.74, 1908.34 +/- 135.55 (pg/ml) respectively. The average levels in the ALL, M(4)+M(5) and M(2) patients groups were lower than those in normal control group. Both levels in ALL and M(4)+M(5) patient groups were higher than that in M(2) patient group. The average levels of SDF-1alpha in patient group with extramedullary infiltration and patient groups without-extramedullary infiltration were 1252.49 +/- 263.12, 1234.91 +/- 185.50 (pg/ml) respectively. The former seemed as if higher than the latter, but without statistical significance.

CXCR4 expression in ALL and M(4)+M(5) patient groups were higher than that in M(2) patient group (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference between the ALL and M(4)+M(5) patient group (P > 0.05).

The former was higher than the latter (P < 0.05). It is concluded that the higher expression of CXCR4 on acute lymphoblatic and monocytic leukemia cells may be one of the molecular mechanisms of extramedullary infiltration in both kinds of leukemia. The average plasma levels of SDF-1alpha decreased in leukemia patients and this decrease not related to the extramedullar infiltration, which may be due to the SDF-1alpha local expression in the organ infiltrated.","['Liu, Zheng-Rong', 'Sun, Hui', 'Zou, Ping']","['Liu ZR', 'Sun H', 'Zou P']","['Institute of Hematology, The Affiliated Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. aylzr@TOM.COM']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', '*Leukemic Infiltration', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism']",2006/04/06 09:00,2007/10/20 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2006)01-0001-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2006 Feb;14(1):1-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: After selecting a threshold PB CD34 value of five CD34 + cells per microL to initiate leukapheresis procedure, a prospective analysis of 50 consecutive patients was initiated to identify the optimal time to initiate leukapheresis and its impact on costs and resource utilization. Clinical decisions were made to commence or to postpone leukapheresis with this PB CD34 threshold number. Based on PB CD34 values for each patient, the number of leukapheresis procedures, postponed or canceled, the number of CD34+ cells per kg, and the total number of cells collected were identified. Costs of mobilization were obtained from the hospital cost accounting system. RESULTS: In 13 months, 50 patients with a hematologic disorder underwent mobilization. There were 34 cancellations or postponements of collections due to a low PB CD34 value in 13 patients. By use of our identified costs per initial collection, this resulted in a savings of 67,660 US dollars. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study defines how the implementation of the PB CD34 value results in costs savings. A low PB CD34 value canceled or postponed a significant number of leukapheresis procedures, resulting in a substantial cost savings. Use of the PB CD34 value should be the standard of care during mobilization and peripheral blood progenitor cell collection.","['Meehan, Kenneth R', 'Hill, John M', 'Patchett, Linda', 'Webber, Susan M', 'Wu, Jillian', 'Ely, Pamela', 'Szczepiorkowski, Zbigniew M']","['Meehan KR', 'Hill JM', 'Patchett L', 'Webber SM', 'Wu J', 'Ely P', 'Szczepiorkowski ZM']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, NH 03756, USA.

Transgenic mice lacking expression of RUNX1 or the RUNX protein-binding partner, CBFbeta, have defective B-cell development, with differentiation blocked at an early stage. Specific knockout of RUNX1 in adult hematopoietic cells also caused a decrease in the number of mature B cells, supporting a role for RUNX1 in both developmental and adult hematopoiesis. Furthermore, RUNX proteins have been shown to regulate several B-cell-specific genes and play an important role in TGF-beta-induced immunoglobulin class switching to IgA. The importance of RUNX1 in B-cell development is additionally demonstrated by its dysregulation in the t(12;21) translocation, which is the most frequent translocation found in acute lymphocytic leukemia. Epstein Barr virus immortalized human B lymphoblastoid cell lines express RUNX3, and cross-regulation of RUNX1 by RUNX3 occurs in these cells. Knockdown of RUNX3 in these cells induces RUNX1 expression and inhibits cell proliferation, directly showing that RUNX proteins can regulate B-cell growth.","['Whiteman, Hannah J', 'Farrell, Paul J']","['Whiteman HJ', 'Farrell PJ']","[""Department of Virology, Imperial College Faculty of Medicine, St. Mary's Campus, Norfolk Place, London W2 1PG, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr,Critical reviews in eukaryotic gene expression,9007261,"['0 (Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor alpha)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching/*genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transforming Growth Factor alpha/metabolism']",2006/04/06 09:00,2006/05/04 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['6d87d8de72c71783,7163bd342ea85e3f [pii]', '10.1615/critreveukargeneexpr.v16.i1.30 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr. 2006;16(1):31-44. doi: 10.1615/critreveukargeneexpr.v16.i1.30.,,,,,,,116,,,,,,,,,,,,

A decrease in the percentage of IL-7(+) cells and an increase in the percentage of IL-16(+) cells in the MLN indicated that secretion of these cytokines was also altered after LP-BM5 infection. The percentage of MLN T cells expressing IL-7 receptors was significantly reduced, while the percentage of MLN T cells expressing TNFR-p75 and of B cells expressing TNFR-p55 increased. Simultaneous analysis of surface markers and cytokine secretion was done in an attempt to understand whether the deregulation of IFN-gamma secretion could be ascribed to a defined cell phenotype, concluding that all T cell subsets studied increased IFN-gamma secretion after retrovirus infection. Finally, thymocyte phenotype was further analyzed trying to correlate changes in thymocyte phenotype with MLN cell phenotype. The results indicated that the increase in single positive either CD4(+)CD8(-) or CD4(-)CD8(+) cells was due to accumulation of both immature (CD3(-)) and mature (CD3(+)) single positive thymocytes. Moreover, single positive mature thymocytes presented a phenotype similar to the phenotype previously seen on MLN T cells. In summary, we can conclude that LP-BM5 uses the immune system to reach the thymus where it interferes with the generation of functionally mature T cells, favoring the development of T cells with an abnormal phenotype. These new T cells are activated to secrete several cytokines that in turn will favor retrovirus replication and inhibit any attempt of the immune system to control infection.","['Lopez, Maria C', 'Watson, Ronald R']","['Lopez MC', 'Watson RR']","['Health Promotion Sciences, Enid and Mel Zuckerman College of Public Health, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Egypt,Clin Dev Immunol,Clinical & developmental immunology,101183692,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/metabolism']",2006/04/06 09:00,2009/03/19 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['K5867X4266T08651 [pii]', '10.1080/17402520500303339 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Dev Immunol. 2005 Dec;12(4):249-57. doi: 10.1080/17402520500303339.,,,,,['HL 63667/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2270737,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The material included bone marrow specimens obtained during induction treatment from 46 children treated for AML between 1998-2003. Immunocytochemical staining for Ki67 was based on the ABC technique. Expression of Ki67 antigen on day 0 of induction treatment was confirmed in all patients. The percentage of immunopositive blasts ranged from 88.4% to 99.8% (mean 91.8%). On day 15, according to chemotherapy response, patients were divided into two groups: G1-36 children who responded to induction treatment and reached remission (blast level 5%, low risk group) and G2-10 patients who did not meet remission criterion (blast level > 5%) and were assigned to the high risk (HR) group. Out of 10 children assigned to this group, Ki67 expression in blast cells was confirmed in 4 cases. The fraction of immunopositive blasts ranged from 78.4% to 88.6%. In the other 6 cases, blasts were Ki67-negative. In 12-month period after beginning the treatment, 18 cases of treatment failure (including 7 deceases) were observed in both groups. Five deaths, observed in the HR group, concerned the patients characterized by Ki67-negative blasts. The results indicate a possible correlation between the Ki67-immunonegative blast pattern on day 15 of treatment induction and early decease of AML children assigned to HR group.","['Nowicki, Michal', 'Ostalska-Nowicka, Danuta', 'Miskowiak, Bogdan']","['Nowicki M', 'Ostalska-Nowicka D', 'Miskowiak B']","['Department of Histology and Embryology, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland. mnowicki@amp.edu.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Folia Histochem Cytobiol,Folia histochemica et cytobiologica,8502651,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Clone Cells', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ki-67 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Treatment Failure']",2006/04/06 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Folia Histochem Cytobiol. 2006;44(1):49-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Forty-four patients who had myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia received treatment with thalidomide in a Phase II clinical trial at a dose of 200 mg daily with escalation by 200 mg weekly until the best tolerated dose (maximum, 800 mg) was reached. RESULTS: Seventeen of 41 evaluable patients (41%) who received treatment for at least 15 days had a response. A complete response (without reversal of bone marrow fibrosis) was achieved in 4 patients (10%), a partial response was achieved in 4 patients (10%), and hematologic improvements in anemia, thrombopenia, and/or splenomegaly were observed in 9 patients (21%). Improvements in anemia occurred in 7 of 35 patients (20%) with hemoglobin levels <10.0 g/dL, and improvements in thrombopenia occurred in 5 of 24 patients (21%) with platelet counts <100 x 10(9)/L. Five of 24 patients (21%) became transfusion-independent. Major or minor regression of splenomegaly was noted in 9 of 29 evaluable patients (31%), and complete regression was noted in 5 patients. Responders had a lower baseline median vascular endothelial growth factor levels (77.9 pg/mL vs. 97.7 pg/mL; P <.01) and higher median basis fibroblast growth factor levels (60.8 pg/mL vs. 37.4 pg/mL; P <.01) compared with nonresponders. Nine patients (22%) had deterioration that was attributed to thalidomide (resolved after withdrawal) with either progressive cytopenias or excessive proliferation. Two patients developed Grade 3 neutropenia with recovery and resumed therapy with dose reductions, and both later achieved a complete response. Dose-related toxicities included fatigue (50%), constipation (48%), rash or pruritus (37%), sedation (35%), peripheral edema (29%), tremors (23%), peripheral neuropathy (22%), and orthostasis (16%).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) two classes of activating FLT3 mutations are known: internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD) in the juxtamembrane domain and point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3-TKD). Recently, a third class of activating mutations was discovered, single point mutations in the juxtamembrane domain (FLT3-JM-PM). Since the crystal structure of the inactive conformation of FLT3 has recently been resolved the role of the juxtamembrane (JM) domain, serving as a key autoinhibitory element regulating kinase activity, was elucidated. Mutations in the JM domain seem to perturb the autoinhibitory activity of the JM domain thereby inducing autonomous activation of the kinase. These findings have important clinical implications. Routine screenings for mutations in FLT3 in leukemia diagnostics should also analyze point mutations in the JM domain of FLT3 and patients harbouring FLT3-JM-PM might benefit from experimental therapeutic approaches with FLT3 inhibitors.

One feature of note is a protein surface layer (S-layer) composed of a single protein, organized as a self-assembled crystalline array that coats the bacterium. In the course of efforts to express cancer-associated peptides as genetic insertions into the S-layer, we noted a tumor suppressive effect of the unmodified bacterium. C. crescentus was examined for anti-tumor activity against three transplantable tumor mouse models: Lewis lung carcinoma cells transfected with the MUC1 gene in C57BL/6, murine mammary carcinoma (EMT-6) in BALB/c (both in prophylactic and therapeutic mode) and murine leukemia cells (L1210) in DBA2. Mice were immunized three times i.p. with C. crescentus (2 x 10(7) cells/mouse). In prophylactic mode, the mice were challenged with tumor cells two weeks after the last immunization. Immunization with live C. crescentus resulted in anti-tumor activity in all three transplantable tumor models, as measured by prolonged survival, reduced tumor mass or reduced number of lung nodules, compared to saline control groups. In the Lewis lung and the EMT-6 mammary carcinoma murine models the number of lung nodules as well as the tumor weight was lower in mice treated with C. crescentus, compared to the control group; for EMT-6, this was observed in prophylactic and therapeutic modes. In the murine leukemia and Lewis lung carcinoma models prolonged survival was observed in the groups of mice immunized with Caulobacters. In most cases the live C. crescentus cells were markedly more efficacious than heat killed or formalin fixed cells, despite the fact that they do not grow or persist in mice. The results suggest that C. crescentus may be a safe, bacterial immunomodulator for the treatment of tumors.","['Bhatnagar, P K', 'Awasthi, A', 'Nomellini, J F', 'Smit, J', 'Suresh, M R']","['Bhatnagar PK', 'Awasthi A', 'Nomellini JF', 'Smit J', 'Suresh MR']","['Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (MUC1 protein, human)', '0 (Mucin-1)', '0 (Mucins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Lewis Lung/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Caulobacter crescentus/*physiology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Leukemia L1210/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mucin-1', 'Mucins/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/transplantation']",2006/04/04 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/04/04 09:00'],"['2006/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['2553 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.5.5.2553 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2006 May;5(5):485-91. doi: 10.4161/cbt.5.5.2553.

We examined QOL in children aged 8-16 years with acquired GHD following treatment for malignancy (AGHD) or idiopathic GHD (IGHD) on commencing growth hormone treatment (GHT) over 6 months. We adopted a longitudinal design involving consecutive patients and their families attending clinic over an 18-month period. Mothers and children were invited to complete questionnaires before GHT (T1) and 6 months later (T2). METHODS: Mothers of 22 children (AGHD n = 14; IGHD n = 8) completed standardized measures of child QOL and behaviour. Children completed parallel measures of QOL, short-term memory tasks and fitness either in clinic or at the family home. RESULTS: For children with AGHD, QOL was significantly below population norms at T1 and improved over time. For children diagnosed with IGHD, QOL at T1 was below, but comparable with population norms. QOL improved over time, though not significantly. CONCLUSION: GHT is potentially valuable for improving QOL in children, especially in cases of AGHD. We conclude that benefits of GHT for QOL need to be evaluated independent of different diagnostic groups.","['Sheppard, L', 'Eiser, C', 'Davies, H A', 'Carney, S', 'Clarke, S A', 'Urquhart, T', 'Ryder, M J', 'Stoner, A', 'Wright, N P', 'Butler, G']","['Sheppard L', 'Eiser C', 'Davies HA', 'Carney S', 'Clarke SA', 'Urquhart T', 'Ryder MJ', 'Stoner A', 'Wright NP', 'Butler G']","['CR-UK Child and Family Health Group, Department of Psychology, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK. l.sheppard@sheffield.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Horm Res,Hormone research,0366126,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Constitution', 'Child', 'Female', 'Growth Disorders/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Health Status Indicators', 'Hormone Replacement Therapy', 'Human Growth Hormone/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications', 'Male', '*Quality of Life', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2006/04/04 09:00,2006/06/28 09:00,['2006/04/04 09:00'],"['2005/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['92455 [pii]', '10.1159/000092455 [doi]']",ppublish,Horm Res. 2006;65(5):243-9. doi: 10.1159/000092455.

METHODS: Mutational analysis of STX11 by direct sequencing was done in 28 FHL families that did not harbour perforin mutations, previously identified in some FHL patients. A detailed investigation of clinical features of these patients was also undertaken. RESULTS: Two different STX11 mutations were identified, one nonsense mutation and one deletion, affecting six of 34 children in four of 28 unrelated PRF1 negative families. Both mutations have been reported before. Three patients experienced long periods (> or = 1 year) in remission without specific treatment, which is very uncommon in this disease. Despite the milder phenotype, some children with STX11 mutations developed severe psychomotor retardation. Two of the six patients harbouring STX11 gene defects developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). CONCLUSIONS: STX11 gene mutations were found in 14% of the PRF1 negative FHL families included in the present cohort. These results suggest that STX11 gene mutations may be associated with secondary malignancies (MDS/AML), and that there is segregation of specific clinical features in FHL patients with an underlying genotype.","['Rudd, E', 'Goransdotter Ericson, K', 'Zheng, C', 'Uysal, Z', 'Ozkan, A', 'Gurgey, A', 'Fadeel, B', 'Nordenskjold, M', 'Henter, J-I']","['Rudd E', 'Goransdotter Ericson K', 'Zheng C', 'Uysal Z', 'Ozkan A', 'Gurgey A', 'Fadeel B', 'Nordenskjold M', 'Henter JI']",,['eng'],"['Letter', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Med Genet,Journal of medical genetics,2985087R,['0 (Qa-SNARE Proteins)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*genetics', 'Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic/complications/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*genetics', 'Pedigree', 'Phenotype', 'Psychomotor Disorders/complications/genetics', 'Qa-SNARE Proteins/*genetics', 'Remission, Spontaneous']",2006/04/04 09:00,2006/06/17 09:00,['2006/04/04 09:00'],"['2006/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['43/4/e14 [pii]', '10.1136/jmg.2005.035253 [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Genet. 2006 Apr;43(4):e14. doi: 10.1136/jmg.2005.035253.,,,,,,PMC2563216,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, effects on nonmalignant cells have not been elucidated and may be important to understanding treatment-related toxicity. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of ARA-C on nondividing vascular endothelial cells. The objectives were to determine the effects of ARA-C on cell viability and to ascertain whether ARA-C caused apoptosis in cultured vascular endothelial cells and hydrocortisone blunted caspase-3-induced apoptosis. Endothelial cells were cultured until confluent and mitotically quiescent then exposed to ARA-C (10(-7)to 10(-3) M) for 1 to 4 days. Some experiments involved cotreatment with hydrocortisone (10(-11),10(-10),10(-4), and 10(-3) M). Light microscopy and the colorimetric MTS assay were used to measure viability. Fluorescent annexin-V and DNA fragmentation assays were used to measure apoptosis, and a fluorescence-based enzymatic assay was used to measure caspase-3 activity, which is one pathway involved in the apoptosis cascade. Two-way ANOVA or the appropriate nonparametric test was used to determine statistical significance in studies of viability and apoptosis. Oneway ANOVA was used to determine statistical significance for caspase-3 activity. Viability was decreased with higher concentrations of ARA-C and increased days of treatment. The percentage of apoptotic cells increased with higher concentrations of ARA-C and increased days of treatment. ARA-C-treated samples showed DNA fragmentation, indicative of apoptosis. Caspase-3 activity increased after ARA-C addition; hydrocortisone blunted this increase. ARA-C caused apoptosis in nondividing endothelial cells in culture. Hydrocortisone may protect against ARA-C-induced apoptosis by reducing caspase-3 activity.","['Moore, Ida M Ki', 'Merkle, Carrie J', 'Miketova, Petra', 'Salyer, Renee K', 'Torres, Bonny J', 'Schaeffer, Richard C Jr', 'Montgomery, David W']","['Moore IM', 'Merkle CJ', 'Miketova P', 'Salyer RK', 'Torres BJ', 'Schaeffer RC Jr', 'Montgomery DW']","['College of Nursing, University of Arizona, Tucson 85721-0203, USA. kmoore@nursing.arizona.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Res Nurs,Biological research for nursing,9815758,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cognition Disorders/chemically induced', 'Colorimetry', 'Cytarabine/*adverse effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', '*Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/pharmacology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Microscopy, Polarization', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",2006/04/04 09:00,2006/05/12 09:00,['2006/04/04 09:00'],"['2006/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['7/4/289 [pii]', '10.1177/1099800405286138 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Res Nurs. 2006 Apr;7(4):289-96. doi: 10.1177/1099800405286138.,,,,,['NR004343/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MEF (also known as ELF4) gene is repressed by several leukemia-associated fusion transcription factor proteins (PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha and AML1-ETO), but it is also activated by retroviral insertion in several cancer models. We have previously shown that cyclin A-dependent phosphorylation of MEF largely restricts its activity to the G(1) phase of the cell cycle; we now show that MEF is a short-lived protein whose expression level also peaks during late G(1) phase. Mutagenesis studies show that the rapid turnover of MEF in S phase is dependent on the specific phosphorylation of threonine 643 and serine 648 at the C terminus of MEF by cdk2 and on the Skp1/Cul1/F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCF(Skp2), which targets MEF for ubiquitination and proteolysis. Overexpression of MEF drives cells through the G(1)/S transition, thereby promoting cell proliferation. The tight regulation of MEF levels during the cell cycle contributes to its effects on regulating cell cycle entry and cell proliferation.","['Liu, Yan', 'Hedvat, Cyrus V', 'Mao, Shifeng', 'Zhu, Xin-Hua', 'Yao, Jinjuan', 'Nguyen, Hoang', 'Koff, Andrew', 'Nimer, Stephen D']","['Liu Y', 'Hedvat CV', 'Mao S', 'Zhu XH', 'Yao J', 'Nguyen H', 'Koff A', 'Nimer SD']","['Division of Hematologic Oncology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, Box 575, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ELF4 protein, human)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 6.- (Ligases)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Ligases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Threonine/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/analysis/*metabolism']",2006/04/04 09:00,2006/05/04 09:00,['2006/04/04 09:00'],"['2006/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/8/3114 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.26.8.3114-3123.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2006 Apr;26(8):3114-23. doi: 10.1128/MCB.26.8.3114-3123.2006.,,,,,"['R01 DK052208/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HL004478/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HL 04478/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 52597/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 DK052208/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM052597/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 52208/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1446966,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether the c-FLIP splice variants, c-FLIP long [c-FLIP(L)] and c-FLIP short [c-FLIP(S)], play a role in Taxol-induced apoptosis. Our results showed that low Taxol concentrations triggered caspase-8- and caspase-10-dependent apoptosis in the CCRF-HSB-2 human lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, and induced the down-regulation of c-FLIP(S) and c-FLIP(L). Taxol decreased the expression of c-FLIP by a post-transcriptional and caspase-independent mechanism. To explore the distinct functions of the c-FLIP variants in Taxol-induced apoptosis, we transfected the cells with expression vectors carrying c-FLIP(L) and c-FLIP(S) in the sense orientation or c-FLIP(S) in the antisense orientation [c-FLIP(S)-AS]. Caspases-8 and -10 were more efficiently activated in the c-FLIP(S)-AS strain treated with 5-50nM Taxol, which revealed that c-FLIP regulates Taxol-induced apoptosis by interacting with these caspases. Furthermore, our data showed that increased expression of c-FLIP(L) or c-FLIP(S) reduced apoptosis at 5-50nM Taxol concentrations suggesting that both isoforms of c-FLIP prevent Taxol-induced apoptosis. These results revealed that Taxol induces apoptosis by down-regulating c-FLIP(S) and c-FLIP(L) expression.","['Day, Travis W', 'Najafi, Farhad', 'Wu, Ching-Huang', 'Safa, Ahmad R']","['Day TW', 'Najafi F', 'Wu CH', 'Safa AR']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Indiana University Cancer Research Institute, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 10)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.63 (CASP10 protein, human)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein', 'Caspase 10', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology']",2006/04/04 09:00,2006/06/09 09:00,['2006/04/04 09:00'],"['2005/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2006/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(06)00131-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2006.02.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2006 May 28;71(11):1551-61. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2006.02.015.

But due to the size and omega-like shape of caveolae it is possible that A-MLV initially binds cells outside of caveolae. Rafts have been suggested to be pre-caveolae and we here investigate whether A-MLV initially binds to its receptor Pit2, a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter, in rafts or caveolae or outside these cholesterol-rich microdomains. RESULTS: Here, we show that a high amount of cell-bound A-MLV was attached to large rafts of NIH3T3 at the time of investigation. These large rafts were not enriched in caveolin-1, a major structural component of caveolae. In addition, they are rather of natural occurrence in NIH3T3 cells than a result of patching of smaller rafts by A-MLV. Thus cells incubated in parallel with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped MLV particles showed the same pattern of large rafts as cells incubated with A-MLV, but VSV-G pseudotyped MLV particles did not show any preference to attach to these large microdomains. CONCLUSION: The high concentration of A-MLV particles bound to large rafts of NIH3T3 cells suggests a role of these microdomains in early A-MLV binding events.","['Beer, Christiane', 'Pedersen, Lene']","['Beer C', 'Pedersen L']","['Institute of Clinical Medicine and Department of Molecular Biology, University of Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark. chb@mb.au.dk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,"['0 (Sphingolipid Activator Proteins)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Caveolae/metabolism/virology', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry/virology', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism/*virology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect/methods', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains/chemistry/*metabolism/*virology', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Sphingolipid Activator Proteins/metabolism']",2006/04/04 09:00,2006/07/21 09:00,['2006/04/04 09:00'],"['2005/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2006/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['1743-422X-3-21 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-3-21 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2006 Apr 2;3:21. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-3-21.,20060402,,,,,PMC1483818,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A 63-year-old male taking amlodipine for his hypertension presented with a 3-week gingival enlargement. Although the obvious clinical impression was that of drug-induced gingival enlargement, an incisional biopsy was performed to corroborate chemical enlargement while ruling out diseases such as lymphoma and leukemia. RESULTS: Microscopic examination of the thickened gingiva revealed surface stratified squamous epithelium having needle-like rete pegs characteristic of drug-induced gingival enlargement. Beneath the surface epithelium, the fibrous tissue was virtually replaced by a dense infiltrate of malignant cells. Immunohistochemical studies were performed with CD117 and myeloperoxidase identifying the malignant cell population as myeloblasts, leading to a diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma. CONCLUSION: Myeloid sarcoma and hematopoietic malignancies must be included in a differential diagnosis of gingival enlargement until the definitive diagnosis is reached by histologic/laboratory examination.","['Yoon, Angela J', 'Pulse, Carla', 'Cohen, Lori D', 'Lew, Timothy A', 'Zegarelli, David J']","['Yoon AJ', 'Pulse C', 'Cohen LD', 'Lew TA', 'Zegarelli DJ']","['Department of Pathology, Division of Oral Pathology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Periodontol,Journal of periodontology,8000345,"['0 (Antihypertensive Agents)', '1J444QC288 (Amlodipine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Amlodipine/*adverse effects', 'Antihypertensive Agents/*adverse effects', 'Biopsy', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Epithelium/pathology', 'Gingival Neoplasms/complications/*diagnosis', 'Gingival Overgrowth/chemically induced/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*diagnosis', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/analysis']",2006/04/04 09:00,2006/05/05 09:00,['2006/04/04 09:00'],"['2006/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1902/jop.2006.77.1.119 [doi]'],ppublish,J Periodontol. 2006 Jan;77(1):119-22. doi: 10.1902/jop.2006.77.1.119.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lower exposures to magnetic fields (< 1 microT average in the home) are classified as ""possibly carcinogenic"" on the basis of epidemiological studies of childhood leukemia. This classification takes into consideration largely negative laboratory data. Lack of biophysical mechanisms operating at such low levels also argues against causality. We survey around 20 biophysical mechanisms that have been proposed to explain effects at such low levels, with particular emphasis on plausibility: the principle that to produce biological effects, a mechanism must produce a ""signal"" larger than the ""noise"" that exists naturally. Some of the mechanisms are impossible, and some require specific conditions for which there is limited or no evidence as to their existence in a way that would make them relevant to human exposure. Others are predicted to become plausible above some level of field. We conclude that effects below 5 microT are implausible. At about 50 microT, no specific mechanism has been identified, but the basic problem of implausibility is removed. Above about 500 microT, there are established or likely effects from accepted mechanisms.

As general indicators of a cellular stress response, we monitored changes in proto-oncogene and heat-shock protein expression. Exponentially growing human lymphoblastoma cells (TK6) were exposed to 1.9 GHz pulse-modulated RF fields at average specific absorption rates (SARs) of 1 and 10 W/kg. Perturbations in the expression levels of the proto-oncogenes FOS, JUN and MYC after exposure to sham and RF fields were assessed by real-time RT-PCR. In addition, the transcript levels of the cellular stress proteins HSP27 and inducible HSP70 were also monitored. We demonstrated that transcript levels of these genes in RF-field-exposed cells showed no significant difference in relation to the sham treatment group. However, concurrent positive (heat-shock) control samples displayed a significant elevation in the expression of HSP27, HSP70, FOS and JUN. Conversely, the levels of MYC mRNA were found to decline in the positive (heat-shock) control.

The study was undertaken to better define mortality, length of stay (LOS), cost, and risk factors associated with mortality and prolonged hospitalization in cancer patients with FN. METHODS: The longitudinal discharge database derived from 115 US medical centers was used to study all adult cancer patients hospitalized with FN between 1995 and 2000, comprising a total of 41,779 patients. Primary outcomes included mortality, LOS, and cost per episode. RESULTS: Overall, in-hospital mortality was 9.5%. Patients without any major comorbidities had a 2.6% risk of mortality, whereas 1 major comorbidity was associated with a 10.3% and more than 1 major comorbidity with a > or = 21.4% risk of mortality, respectively. Mean (median) length of stay was 11.5 (6) days, and the mean (median) cost was $19,110 ($8,376) per episode of FN. Patients hospitalized for > or = 10 days (35% of all patients) accounted for 78% of overall cost. Independent major risk factors for inpatient mortality included invasive fungal infections, Gram-negative sepsis, pneumonia and other lung disease, cerebrovascular, renal, and liver disease. Main predictors for LOS > or = 10 days included leukemia, invasive fungal infections, other types of infection, and several comorbid conditions. CONCLUSION: Factors associated with increased mortality, LOS, and cost in hospitalized adult cancer patients with FN include patient characteristics, type of malignancy, comorbidities, and infectious complications. These factors may be useful in identifying patients at increased risk of serious medical complications and mortality for more aggressive supportive care measures.","['Kuderer, Nicole M', 'Dale, David C', 'Crawford, Jeffrey', 'Cosler, Leon E', 'Lyman, Gary H']","['Kuderer NM', 'Dale DC', 'Crawford J', 'Cosler LE', 'Lyman GH']","['James P.

Using immunophenotyping it is possible, to enrich HSC, however, so far we are not able to positively select HSC. For the identification, characterization and quantification of HSC it is necessary to use functional assay systems, such as xenotransplantation models. HSC from bone marrow, peripheral blood and in some cases also cord blood have been used for years in transplantation settings especially in patients with leukemia. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying stem cell regulation as well as stem cell self renewal would have clinical implications e. g. for clinical transplantation strategies. A number of hematological diseases such as chronic myeloid leukemia originates from a malignant transformed HSC. A better understanding of the biology of normal as well as malignant HSC is therefore crucial not only for a better understanding of the disease, but also for the development of strategies aiming at the discrimination of normal and malignant stem cell candidates and the development of therapies targeting the leukemic stem cell.","['Buske, C', 'Glimm, H', 'Feuring-Buske, M']","['Buske C', 'Glimm H', 'Feuring-Buske M']","['Medizinische Klinik III, Klinikum Grosshadern der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Internist (Berl),Der Internist,0264620,,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hematologic Diseases/blood/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/blood/therapy']",2006/04/01 09:00,2007/05/31 09:00,['2006/04/01 09:00'],"['2006/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00108-006-1602-2 [doi]'],ppublish,"Internist (Berl). 2006 May;47(5):459-60, 462-4. doi: 10.1007/s00108-006-1602-2.",,,,,,,,,,,,Hamatopoetische Stammzelltherapie.

The aim of the study was the analysis of relationship between ex vivo drug resistance of prednisolone and dexamethasone and exposure to these drugs in childhood ALL, with respect to risk factor analysis. Ex vivo resistance to both glucocorticoids was compared to maximum drug concentration achievable in body fluids, calculated in mathematical model. Drug resistance to vincristine and L-asparaginase, expression of multidrug resistance and apoptosis proteins was also determined. Concentration of both glucocorticoids in extracellular fluid was higher than drug resistance in the following groups of patients: in initial ALL patients, in patients staying in remission during follow-up, and in prednisolone good responders. Factors significant by multivariate analysis were early bone marrow response by day 15 and concentration of prednisolone higher than ex vivo prednisolone resistance. For initial ALL patients with determined response to initial prednisolone monotherapy, factors significant by univariate analysis were early bone marrow response, and exposure to glucocorticoids higher than ex vivo resistance to these drugs. No factor was significant by multivariate analysis in this group. Risk factor analysis showed that concentration of prednisolone and dexamethasone higher than respective ex vivo drug resistance, is a strongest prognostic factor in childhood ALL.","['Styczynski, J', 'Koltan, A', 'Wysocki, M']","['Styczynski J', 'Koltan A', 'Wysocki M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Collegium Medicum Bydgoszcz, 85-094 Bydgoszcz, Poland. jan.styczynski@wp.pl']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/biosynthesis', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Asparaginase/pharmacokinetics', 'Body Fluids/chemistry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Male', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vincristine/pharmacokinetics']",2006/04/01 09:00,2006/08/04 09:00,['2006/04/01 09:00'],"['2006/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 2006;53(2):168-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined the expression of several lineage and maturation linked antigens used in routine immunophenotyping of patients with de novo AML, using a 3-color two-step panel. Cases were diagnosed by peripheral blood counts, bone marrow cytology, cytochemistry, cytogenetics and immunophenotyping (CD2, CD3, CD7, CD19, CD13, CD33, myeloperoxydase -- MPO, CD14, CD15, HLA-DR, CD34, CD56 and CD45). Antigen expression was measured by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) by flow cytometry (Paint-a-gate software). Thirty five patients were analyzed. Median age: 51 years (15-79). Predominant FAB types were M2 and M4. In 6 cases more than one phenotypically distinct blast subpopulation could be detected. Although our set was small, we tried to analyze the impact of MFI of the examined antigens on the overall survival of the patients. In Cox univariate analysis, age, peripheral leukocytes (WBC) at diagnosis, MFI of CD45, and MPO were significant for worse a survival. In the multivariate analysis only MFI of CD45 and WBC remained in the model (p=0.018 and p=0.014 respectively). After bootstrap resampling, MFI of CD45 entered the model in 69%, WBCin 60%, age in 42% and MFI of MPO in 35% of the sets. Analysis of antigen expression by MFI permitted to detect cases presenting phenotypically distinct blast subpopulations.

In acute leukemia three types of abnormality of AML1 have been observed -- chromosomal translocations, point mutation and duplication or amplification of the unrearranged gene. The most common origin of extra copies of the AML1 gene is polysomy of chromosome 21 or a partial duplication of the long arm of chromosome 21, less frequently ring, isochromosome or the tandem repetition of chromosome 21. In the study 13 children and 5 adults with ALL and AML or MDS, respectively, have been included.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) occurring as a secondary malignancy is uncommon. Translocation RCC, bearing TFE3 or TFEB gene fusions, are recently recognized entities for which risk factors have not been identified. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe the clinical, pathologic, cytogenetic, and molecular data on six translocation RCCs that arose in five young patients who had received chemotherapy. RESULTS: The ages at time of diagnosis of the RCC ranged from 6 to 22 years. Histologically, these tumors showed typical features previously described for translocation RCCs. At the molecular level, three tumors contained the ASPL-TFE3 fusion, two contained Alpha-TFEB, and one contained PRCC-TFE3. The intervals between chemotherapy and the diagnosis of RCC ranged from 4 to 13 years. The indications for the antecedent chemotherapy were varied and included acute promyelocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia with t(9;11), bilateral Wilms' tumor, systemic lupus erythematosus, and conditioning regimen of bone marrow transplant for Hurler's syndrome. Only the latter patient had also received radiation. Hence, among 39 genetically confirmed translocation RCCs in our personal experience, six (15%) have arisen in patients who had received cytotoxic chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Cytotoxic chemotherapy may predispose to the development of renal translocation carcinomas.","['Argani, Pedram', 'Lae, Marick', 'Ballard, Edgar T', 'Amin, Mahul', 'Manivel, Carlos', 'Hutchinson, Brian', 'Reuter, Victor E', 'Ladanyi, Marc']","['Argani P', 'Lae M', 'Ballard ET', 'Amin M', 'Manivel C', 'Hutchinson B', 'Reuter VE', 'Ladanyi M']","['Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (TFE3 protein, human)', '0 (TFEB protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*genetics', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2006/04/01 09:00,2006/04/14 09:00,['2006/04/01 09:00'],"['2006/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['24/10/1529 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.04.4693 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Apr 1;24(10):1529-34. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.04.4693.,,,,,['R01 CA95785/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (median age, 6 years; cytogenetics, favorable 27%, intermediate 59%, poor 13%) were treated between 1995 and 2002 and enrolled in Leucemie aigue Myeloblastique Enfant (LAME) 89/91, LAME 99 pilot study and Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia French collaborative protocols. With a median follow-up of 26 months, event-free survival was 56% with a standard deviation (SD) of 5% and overall survival of 62.5% with an SD of 6%. WT1 copy number was normalized by TATA box binding protein gene transcripts and expressed as WT1/TBP x 1,000 ratio. Median WT1 ratio in normal patient controls was 12 (range, 0 to 57). A level over two SD than normal bone marrow controls (ie, WT1 ratio > 50), was considered as significant overexpression. RESULTS: At diagnosis, WT1 overexpression was detected in 78% of patients (72 of 92 patients; median copy ratio, 2231). The WT1 values were significantly higher (P = .01) in favorable cytogenetics and lower (P < .0001) in M5-FAB subtype, 11q23 rearrangements (P < .001), and infants (P = .003) and demonstrate a strong correlation with fusion transcript AML1-ETO, PML-RARalpha expression. After induction treatment, WT1 ratio was analyzed in 46 of 72 patients and found above 50 in nine of 36 patients and five of 25 patients at D35-50 and 3 to 5 months, respectively. WT1 ratio > 50 after induction is an independent prognostic risk factor of relapse (P = .002) and death (P = .02).

In this study we investigated whether baseline mRNA expression levels of the 5 different GR promoter transcripts (1A1, 1A2, 1A3, 1B, and 1C) or differences in the degree of regulation of the GR or GR promoter transcripts upon GC exposure are related to GC resistance. Therefore, mRNA levels of the 5 GR promoter transcripts and of the GR were measured by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR; Taqman) technology in primary ALL cells prior to and after 3, 8, and 24 hours of prednisolone exposure. GR expression is induced upon GC exposure in primary ALL patient samples, which is opposite to what is found in tissues in which GCs do not induce apoptosis. GC resistance in childhood ALL cannot be attributed to an inability of resistant cells to up-regulate the expression of the GR upon GC exposure, nor to differences in GR promoter usage (at baseline and upon GC exposure).","['Tissing, Wim J E', 'Meijerink, Jules P P', 'Brinkhof, Bas', 'Broekhuis, Mathilde J C', 'Menezes, Renee X', 'den Boer, Monique L', 'Pieters, Rob']","['Tissing WJ', 'Meijerink JP', 'Brinkhof B', 'Broekhuis MJ', 'Menezes RX', 'den Boer ML', 'Pieters R']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC, Sophia Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Dr Molewaterplein 60, 3015 GJ Rotterdam, the Netherlands.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prednisolone/pharmacology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects/genetics']",2006/04/01 09:00,2006/10/06 09:00,['2006/04/01 09:00'],"['2006/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52761-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-01-0261 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Aug 1;108(3):1045-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-01-0261.

We determined whether naltrexone, an opioid receptor antagonist widely used in the treatment of alcoholism, inhibits alcohol-mediated enhancement of HIV infection of T cells. Alcohol enhanced HIV infection of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and a human lymphoid cell line (CEMX174). Alcohol increased HIV X4 envelope (Env), not murine leukemia virus Env-pseudotyped infection of CEMX174 cells. Naltrexone antagonized the enhancing effect of alcohol on HIV infection of PBL and CEMX174 cells. The specific mu-opioid receptor antagonist, Cys2, Tyr3, Arg5, Pen7 (CTAP) amide, also blocked the enhancing effect of alcohol on HIV infection. Investigation of the underlying mechanism for the alcohol action showed that alcohol significantly increased endogenous beta-endorphin production and induced mu-opioid receptor mRNA expression in PBL and CEMX174 cells.

In the appropriate conditions, the myospheres adhere to the plate, spread out, and form a monolayer of MyoD(+) cells. Unlike previously described myogenic cell lines, most of the myosphere cells differentiate, without cell fusion, into thin mononucleated contractile fibers, which express myogenin and skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain. The presence of Pax-7 in a significant proportion of these cells suggests that they originate from satellite cells. The addition of leukemia inhibitory factor to the growth medium of the myospheres enhances proliferation and dramatically increases the proportion of cells expressing Sca-1, which is expressed by several types of stem cells. The capacity of myosphere cells to transdifferentiate to other mesodermal cell lineages was examined. Exposure of cloned myosphere cells to bone morphogenetic protein resulted in suppression of myogenic differentiation and induction of osteogenic markers such as alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin. These cells also sporadically differentiated to adipocytes. Myosphere cells could not, so far, be induced to transdifferentiate to hematopoietic cells. When inoculated into injured muscle, myosphere-derived cells participated in regeneration, forming multinucleated cross-striated mature fibers. This suggests a potential medical application.","['Sarig, Rachel', 'Baruchi, Zadok', 'Fuchs, Ora', 'Nudel, Uri', 'Yaffe, David']","['Sarig R', 'Baruchi Z', 'Fuchs O', 'Nudel U', 'Yaffe D']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel. rachel.sarig@weizmann.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Ly6a protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Lineage', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Muscles/*injuries/physiology', 'Osteogenesis', 'Regeneration/*physiology', 'Spheroids, Cellular/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Time']",2006/04/01 09:00,2006/09/28 09:00,['2006/04/01 09:00'],"['2006/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['2005-0547 [pii]', '10.1634/stemcells.2005-0547 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2006 Jul;24(7):1769-78. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.2005-0547.

The caudal HD protein Cdx-2 is a transactivator for the proglucagon gene, expressed in pancreatic A cells and intestinal endocrine L cells. We demonstrate here that co-transfection of the TALE homeobox gene Pbx1 enhanced the activation of Cdx-2 on the proglucagon promoter in either the pancreatic A cell line InR1-G9 or BHK fibroblasts. The activation was observed for proglucagon promoter constructs with or without the binding motifs for Pbx1. Furthermore, mutating the penta-peptide motif (binding motif for TALE HD proteins) on Cdx-2 substantially attenuated its activation on proglucagon promoter, but not on the sucrase-isomaltase gene (SI) promoter, or its own (Cdx-2) promoter; suggesting that Cdx-2 utilizes Pbx1 as a co-factor for regulating the expression of selected target genes. Physical interaction between Cdx-2 and Pbx1 was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation as well as GST fusion protein pull-down.

Exposure of U937 cells to TSA resulted in growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner as measured by hemocytometer counts, fluorescence microscopy, agarose gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry analysis. The increase in apoptosis was associated with the up-regulation in proapoptotic Bax expression and down-regulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L). TSA treatment inhibited the levels of cIAP family members and induced the proteolytic activation of caspase-3, which was associated with concomitant degradation of poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase and beta-catenin protein. TSA treatment markedly inhibited the activity of telomerase in a dose-dependent fashion. Additionally, the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), a main determinant of the telomerase enzymatic activity, was progressively down-regulated by TSA treatment. We therefore conclude that TSA demonstrated antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing effects on U937 cells in vitro, and that changes in Bcl-2 family protein levels as well as telomerase activity may play an important role in its mechanism of action.","['Woo, Hyun Joo', 'Lee, Su Jae', 'Choi, Byung Tae', 'Park, Yeong-Min', 'Choi, Yung Hyun']","['Woo HJ', 'Lee SJ', 'Choi BT', 'Park YM', 'Choi YH']","['Department of Biochemistry, Dongeui University College of Oriental Medicine, Busan 614-052, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Mol Pathol,Experimental and molecular pathology,0370711,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histone Deacetylases/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Telomerase/*drug effects/metabolism']",2006/04/01 09:00,2007/03/03 09:00,['2006/04/01 09:00'],"['2006/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4800(06)00014-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexmp.2006.02.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Pathol. 2007 Feb;82(1):77-84. doi: 10.1016/j.yexmp.2006.02.004.

Here, we show that in Xenopus, Evi1 and MEL1 have partially overlapping restricted embryonic expression profiles. Within the pronephros, Evi1 and MEL1 are sequentially expressed within the distal tubule and duct compartments, Evi1 transcription being detected prior to any sign of pronephric morphogenesis. In the pronephros of zebrafish embryos, Evi1 expression is restricted to the posterior portion of the duct, the anterior portion having characteristics of proximal tubules. In the Xenopus pronephros, Evi1 expression is upregulated by retinoid signaling and repressed by overexpression of xWT1 and by Notch signaling. Overexpression of Evi1 from late neurula stage specifically inhibits the expression of proximal tubule and glomus pronephric markers. We show that the first zinc finger and CtBP interaction domains are required for this activity. Overexpression of a hormone-inducible Evi1-VP16 antimorphic fusion with activation at neurula stage disrupts distal tubule and duct formation and expands the expression of glomus markers. Although overexpression of this construct also causes in many embryos a reduction of proximal tubule markers, embryos with expanded and ectopic staining have been also observed. Together, these data indicate that Evi1 plays a role in the proximo-distal patterning of the pronephros and suggest that it may do so by functioning as a CtBP dependent repressor.","['Van Campenhout, Claude', 'Nichane, Massimo', 'Antoniou, Aline', 'Pendeville, Helene', 'Bronchain, Odile J', 'Marine, Jean-Christophe', 'Mazabraud, Andre', 'Voz, Marianne L', 'Bellefroid, Eric J']","['Van Campenhout C', 'Nichane M', 'Antoniou A', 'Pendeville H', 'Bronchain OJ', 'Marine JC', 'Mazabraud A', 'Voz ML', 'Bellefroid EJ']","[""Laboratoire d'Embryologie Moleculaire, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Institut de Biologie et de Medecine Moleculaires (IBMM), rue des Profs.

Although several different LTRs have been used in the context of retroviral vector, the activity of the various LTRs has not yet been systematically compared for their level of gene expression. We evaluated the effect of four different LTRs on gene expression using luciferase, stem cell factor, and enhanced green fluorescence protein as reporter genes. LTRs tested in this study were derived from Moloney murine leukemia virus, myeloproliferative sarcoma virus, murine stem cell virus, and spleen focus-forming virus. It was found that the level of gene expression is affected by not only LTRs but also the transgenes and the cell types in which gene expression occurs. Furthermore, the presence of other nucleotide sequences such as the internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-neo cassette could also significantly affect gene expression. Our results suggested that the LTR should be chosen carefully, more or less on an empirical basis.","['Kim, Sujeong', 'Lee, Karim', 'Kim, Mi-Dong', 'Kang, Seock', 'Joo, Chang Wan', 'Kim, Jong-Mook', 'Kim, Seon Hee', 'Yu, Seung Shin', 'Kim, Sunyoung']","['Kim S', 'Lee K', 'Kim MD', 'Kang S', 'Joo CW', 'Kim JM', 'Kim SH', 'Yu SS', 'Kim S']","['ViroMed Co., Ltd., 1510-8 Bongcheon7-Dong, Gwanak-Gu, Seoul 151-818, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/genetics', 'Stem Cell Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences', '*Transgenes']",2006/04/01 09:00,2006/06/10 09:00,['2006/04/01 09:00'],"['2006/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(06)00553-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.03.035 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2006 May 19;343(4):1017-22. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.03.035.

The role of oncogenic RAS and its associated genetic events in AML are not yet defined. We examined the frequency of RAS mutation in 239 Thai de novo adult AML patients using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis. Thirty-five RAS mutations were found in 32 cases (13%) predominantly classified as M1/M2 (53%) followed by M4/M5 subtype (38%). Ten cases were positive for N-RAS codon 12, 11 cases for N-RAS codon 61, 13 cases for N-RAS codon 13, and one case for K-RAS codon 13. No mutation was found in K-RAS exon 2 or H-RAS. The most common base substitution was the G to A transition at codon 13. Most M1/M2 cases had mutations at codon 12 or 13, whereas M4/M5 cases preferentially affected codon 61. Half of the patients with RAS mutations had abnormal karyotypes with the majority involving chromosomes 21, 11 and 7. Four patients had core-binding factor leukemia and four additional patients had coexisting FLT3 or AML1 mutation. One patient had RAS, FLT3 and t(8;21) and the other had RAS, AML1 point mutation and del(9q). In conclusion, mutation of RAS gene was not as common in the Thais as in the western population. Several additional genetic abnormalities occurred in RAS-mutated patients.

Pioglitazone (Actos, AD4833), an antidiabetic drug, and 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2) have recently been identified as synthetic and natural ligands for PPARgamma, respectively. In this study, we examined the effects of PPARgamma ligands on differentiation and lipogenesis in promyelocytic leukemia NB4 cells, in which PPARgamma protein was expressed and ligand-stimulated PPARgamma-specific transcription of adipocyte fatty-acid binding protein was confirmed. Treatment with PPARgamma ligand (AD4833 or PGJ2) alone markedly suppressed proliferation but did not induce differentiation. The combined treatment of the cells with PPARgamma ligand and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) synergistically induced myelocytic differentiation, as determined by nitroblue tetrazolium reducing ability and cell morphology. During these processes of differentiation, we observed marked accumulation of lipid droplets in the cytoplasm. The cellular triacylglycerol levels increased 2.7-fold after treatment with the inducers. Simultaneously, BODIPY-fatty acid was incorporated into the cytosol and concentrated in lipid droplets. The biosynthesis of triacylglycerol-containing BODIPY-fatty acids was increased twofold in differentiated cells. These findings clearly demonstrate that treatment with PPARgamma ligands not only induced differentiation but also stimulated lipogenesis in NB4 cells, indicating a close association between differentiation and lipogenesis in PPARgamma-stimulated human myeloid cells.","['Yasugi, Etsuko', 'Horiuchi, Akiko', 'Uemura, Isao', 'Okuma, Emiko', 'Nakatsu, Masami', 'Saeki, Kumiko', 'Kamisaka, Yasushi', 'Kagechika, Hiroyuki', 'Yasuda, Kazuki', 'Yuo, Akira']","['Yasugi E', 'Horiuchi A', 'Uemura I', 'Okuma E', 'Nakatsu M', 'Saeki K', 'Kamisaka Y', 'Kagechika H', 'Yasuda K', 'Yuo A']","['Department of Hematology, Research Institute, International Medical Center of Japan, 1-21-1, Toyama, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 162-8655, Japan. e-yasugi@umin.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Dev Growth Differ,"Development, growth & differentiation",0356504,"['0 (15-deoxy-delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2)', '0 (2-chloro-5-nitrobenzanilide)', '0 (Anilides)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '0 (diazepinylbenzoic acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)', 'X4OV71U42S (Pioglitazone)']",IM,"['Adipocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Anilides/pharmacology', 'Benzoates/pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Lipids/*physiology', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'PPAR gamma/drug effects/*physiology', 'Pioglitazone', 'Prostaglandin D2/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Thiazolidinediones/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Triglycerides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",2006/04/01 09:00,2006/07/04 09:00,['2006/04/01 09:00'],"['2006/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['DGD [pii]', '10.1111/j.1440-169X.2006.00855.x [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Growth Differ. 2006 Apr;48(3):177-88. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-169X.2006.00855.x.,,,,,,,,,,['Dev Growth Differ. 2006 Jun;48(5):347'],,,,,,,,,

This case demonstrates that capsule endoscopy is a diagnostic tool that may play an important role in the assessment of patients, including children, with possible GVHD.","['Silbermintz, Ari', 'Sahdev, Indira', 'Moy, Libia', 'Vlachos, Adrianna', 'Lipton, Jeffrey', 'Levine, Jeremiah']","['Silbermintz A', 'Sahdev I', 'Moy L', 'Vlachos A', 'Lipton J', 'Levine J']","[""Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, North Shore--LIJ Health System Schneider Children's Hospital, New Hyde Park, NY 11040, USA. arisilb1@yahoo.com""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'B72HH48FLU (Infliximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Diarrhea/etiology', 'Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal/*methods', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*diagnosis/etiology/*surgery', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infliximab', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/surgery', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']",2006/04/01 09:00,2006/08/23 09:00,['2006/04/01 09:00'],"['2006/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['PTR454 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1399-3046.2005.00454.x [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2006 Mar;10(2):252-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-3046.2005.00454.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One such inhibitor, bortezomib (formerly known as PS341), has proven to be an effective reversible inhibitor of the chymotryptic protease in the 26S proteasome. Proteasome inhibitors represent a new approach for the treatment of many forms of cancer, especially select hematological malignancies. The proteasome plays an important role in regulating the availability of different intracellular proteins. While only some of the consequences of inhibiting this activity are understood, a growing amount of data suggests that inhibition of the proteasome is associated with a remarkable panoply of different biological effects that include cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, changes in cell surface adhesion markers, and an increased sensitivity to standard chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Bortezomib was recently approved by the US FDA for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. In addition, bortezomib has also shown encouraging results in the treatment of select types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs). Ongoing phase II clinical trials in pretreated patients are exploring bortezomib in different histologies of NHLs and in combination with conventional chemotherapy. Preliminary data have shown interesting activity, especially in patients with follicular, marginal zone, and mantle cell lymphoma; in these populations, durable complete and partial remissions have been reported. The toxicity profile of this drug, coupled with its unusual mechanism of action, make it a potentially important agent warranting further preclinical and clinical attention. However, many unanswered questions remain regarding how best to employ bortezomib in the conventional treatment of lymphoma. The apparent lack of activity in different subtypes of lymphoma, such as small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, as well as a lack of understanding about the best way to combine bortezomib with standard therapies for indolent NHLs, raises important questions regarding the mechanistic basis for its effects. We will undoubtedly need to understand these effects better in order to fully exploit the potential of this new class of drugs.","['Paoluzzi, Luca', ""O'Connor, Owen A""]","['Paoluzzi L', ""O'Connor OA""]","['Laboratory of Experimental Therapeutics for the Lymphoproliferative Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",New Zealand,BioDrugs,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",9705305,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Boronic Acids/*therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Protease Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazines/*therapeutic use']",2006/04/01 09:00,2006/09/30 09:00,['2006/04/01 09:00'],"['2006/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['2012 [pii]', '10.2165/00063030-200620010-00002 [doi]']",ppublish,BioDrugs. 2006;20(1):13-23. doi: 10.2165/00063030-200620010-00002.,,,,,['UO1 CA 69913/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,87,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of our study was to retrospectively analyze the clinical presentations and outcome of a large cohort of Thai CLL patients diagnosed at a single institution in Bangkok, Thailand, from 1963-1998. One hundred and eighty-four patients were included in the study. The most frequent age group was 60-80 years old with the male to female ratio of 2:1. Only 12% of patients were younger than the age of 50. Most patients were from the central agricultural region of Thailand. Clinical findings at presentation included splenomegaly (64%), lymphadenopathy (60%), anemia (54%), hepatomegaly (49%), fatigue (39%), weight loss (33%), fever (21%), thrombocytopenia (18%), and anorexia (8%). Only 8% of Thai CLL patients were asymptomatic at presentation. The majority of patients were categorized as stages III and IV with the median survival of 20 months and 8 months, respectively. Infection was the most common cause of death, particularly in the elderly patients who had comorbid illnesses. Twenty-two percent of the patients had associated autoimmune disorders. The unfavorable prognostic factors observed were older age (> 70 years), weight loss and hepatosplenomegaly. We concluded that the age and gender of Thai CLL patients were similar to those of the Western countries but our patients came to medical attention at a later and more advanced stage.

METHODS: We analyzed in vivo apoptosis induction in blast cells and in lymphocytes of AML patients receiving remission induction treatment. RESULTS: We show, on 12 peripheral blood samples, that the increase of peripheral apoptotic blast cells cannot be considered as the earliest marker of the treatment efficiency, because the significant increase of apoptosis followed the white blood cell and the peripheral blast cell count reductions, probably due to an efficient clearance of circulating apoptotic cells. Furthermore, the study of 65 bone marrow samples at d15 showed that the treatment induced apoptosis of blast cells while sparing the lymphocytes. This apoptosis was evidenced both at the caspase and at the membrane levels using respectively fmk-VAD-FITC and Annexin V binding assays. We found that less than 50% of apoptosis, measured with the fmk-VAD-FITC, in the d15 residual bone marrow blast cells, correlated with lower disease-free survival probability. CONCLUSION: More studies are needed in larger series and earlier during the remission induction treatment to confirm the possible prognostic significance of in vivo apoptosis induction.","['Vial, J-P', 'Tabrizi, R', 'Pigneux, A', 'Lacombe, F', 'Praloran, V', 'Belloc, F']","['Vial JP', 'Tabrizi R', 'Pigneux A', 'Lacombe F', 'Praloran V', 'Belloc F']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU de Bordeaux Hopital du Haut-Leveque, Pessac, France. jean-philippe.vial@chu-bordeaux.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

In the present study, we investigated the underlying mechanism of its antiproliferative effect on chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. We studied the role of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 or 5 (STAT(1) or STAT(5)) and Bcl-X(L) proteins in IN-induced proliferative inhibition on CML cells. Both K562 cells and fresh bone marrow mononuclear cells from five CML patients were exposed to IN. Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. The expression of JAK(2), STAT(1), STAT(5), and Bcl-X(L) proteins was probed with Western blotting. The level of phosphorylated STAT(1) (p-STAT(1)) or STAT(5) (p-STAT(5)) proteins was determined by coimmunoprecipitation combined with Western blotting. Intracellular localizations of both STAT(1)/STAT(5) and p-STAT(1)/p-STAT(5) were observed by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Our results showed that IN could inhibit the proliferation of CML cells in a dose-dependent manner (36-288 microg/ml). The expression of STAT(1) and STAT(5) was suppressed by IN both in a concentration-dependent manner and a time-dependent (0-36 h) manner. The levels of p-STAT(1) and p-STAT(5) were down-regulated by IN. A similar result was obtained for Bcl-X(L) protein expression. The intracellular fluorescence signals representing STAT(1)/STAT(5) and p-STAT(1)/p-STAT(5) were obviously weakened by IN. In contrast with IN, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor could significantly promote the growth of CML cells and up-regulate the expression of both STAT(1)/STAT(5) and p-STAT(1)/p-STAT(5). This data indicated that IN is able to suppress the proliferation of CML cells, and the mechanism is associated with the inhibition of STATs/ Bcl-X(L) signal transduction pathway.","['Zhang, Guangsen', 'Fu, Yunbi']","['Zhang G', 'Fu Y']","[""Institute of Molecular Hematology, the Second Xiang-ya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, 410011, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indomethacin/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'STAT Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2006/03/31 09:00,2007/01/19 09:00,['2006/03/31 09:00'],"['2005/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-006-0098-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2006 Jul;85(7):443-9. doi: 10.1007/s00277-006-0098-0.

Chromosome 11q23 translocations in acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cells demonstrate myeloid lymphoid leukemia (MLL) fusions with over 40 gene partners, like AF9 and AF4 on chromosomes 9 and 4, respectively. Therapy-related leukemia is associated with the above gene rearrangements following the treatment with topoisomerase II (topo II) inhibitors. BCR, ABL, MLL, AF9 and AF4 have defined patient breakpoint cluster regions. Chromatin structural elements including topo II and DNase I cleavage sites and scaffold attachment sites have previously been shown to closely associate with the MLL and AF9 breakpoint cluster regions, implicating these elements in non-homologous recombination (NHR). In this report, using cell lines and primary cells, chromatin structural elements were analyzed in BCR, ABL and AF4 and, for comparison, in MLL2, which is a homolog to MLL, but not associated with chromosome translocations. Topo II and DNase I cleavage sites associated with all breakpoint cluster regions, whereas SARs associated with ABL and AF4, but not with BCR.

To investigate the underlying mechanism(s) of IM resistance, it is essential to quantify Bcr-Abl kinase status at the stem cell level. We developed a flow cytometry method to measure CrkL phosphorylation (P-CrkL) in samples with <10(4) cells. The method was first validated in wild-type (K562) and mutant (BAF3) BCR-ABL(+) as well as BCR-ABL(-) (HL60) cell lines. In response to increasing IM concentration, there was a linear reduction in P-CrkL, which was Bcr-Abl specific and correlated with known resistance. The results were comparable to those from Western blotting. The method also proved to be reproducible with small samples of normal and Ph(+) CD34(+) cells and was able to discriminate between Ph(-), sensitive and resistant Ph(+) cells. This assay should now enable investigators to unravel the mechanism(s) of IM resistance in stem cells.","['Hamilton, A', 'Elrick, L', 'Myssina, S', 'Copland, M', 'Jorgensen, H', 'Melo, J V', 'Holyoake, T']","['Hamilton A', 'Elrick L', 'Myssina S', 'Copland M', 'Jorgensen H', 'Melo JV', 'Holyoake T']","['Section of Experimental Haematology, Division of Cancer Sciences & Molecular Pathology, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/*biosynthesis', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/03/31 09:00,2006/10/31 09:00,['2006/03/31 09:00'],"['2006/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404189 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404189 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Jun;20(6):1035-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404189.,,,,,"['G84/6317/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'SCD/04/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several lines of evidence indicated that both BCL10 and MALT1 are required for nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation by antigen receptor stimulation in lymphocytes, and API2-MALT1 can bypass this BCL10/MALT1 signaling pathway. Nuclear factor kappa B activation may contribute to antiapoptotic effect through NF-kappaB-mediated upregulation of apoptotic inhibitor genes. We recently demonstrated that API2-MALT1 can induce transactivation of the API2 gene through NF-kappaB activation, thus highlighting a positive feedback-loop mechanism of self-activation by upregulating its own expression in t(11;18) MALT lymphomas. We also demonstrated that API2-MALT1 possesses an antiapoptotic effect, in part, through its direct interaction with apoptotic regulators. These findings therefore led us to hypothesize that the antiapoptotic effect by API2-MALT1 may be mediated by its interaction with apoptotic regulators, on the one hand, and by NF-kappaB-mediated upregulation of apoptotic inhibitor genes on the other. We also found that BCL10 and MALT1 are shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm, and that MALT1 can regulate the subcellular location of BCL10.","['Nakagawa, M', 'Seto, M', 'Hosokawa, Y']","['Nakagawa M', 'Seto M', 'Hosokawa Y']","['Division of Molecular Medicine, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (API2-MALT1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Models, Genetic', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/genetics']",2006/03/31 09:00,2006/10/31 09:00,['2006/03/31 09:00'],"['2006/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404192 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404192 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Jun;20(6):929-36. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404192.,,,,,,,113,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are indirect suggestions that clinical phenotype and also some biological characteristics are dependent on the mutated allele levels. We have designed and validated in 179 MPD patients an amplification-refractory mutation sequencing PCR assay that allows the relative quantitation of mutated and normal JAK2 mRNAs using dye-labelled mutation-specific primers and capillary electrophoresis. Direct sequencing confirmed the specificity of the assay, which has a detection limit congruent with1% and allowed to identify 9% more JAK2-mutated patients as compared to conventional allele-specific PCR. The mutated mRNA ratio ranged from 5 to 51% in the JAK2(V617F) heterozygote and from 45 to 100% in the homozygote patients. Expression levels of both PRV-1 and NF-E2 gene, previously found to be overexpressed in MPD patients, were significantly correlated to the amount of mutated JAK2 mRNA. We propose that this method might complement current technologies based on genomic DNA analysis, and lead prospectively to a better clinically oriented assessment of the impact of JAK2(V617F) mutation in MPD.","['Vannucchi, A M', 'Pancrazzi, A', 'Bogani, C', 'Antonioli, E', 'Guglielmelli, P']","['Vannucchi AM', 'Pancrazzi A', 'Bogani C', 'Antonioli E', 'Guglielmelli P']","['Department of Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliera-Universitaria Careggi, University of Florence, Florence, Italy. amvannucchi@unifi.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CD177 protein, human)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (NFE2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Chronic Disease', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary/methods', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Isoantigens/genetics', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2006/03/31 09:00,2006/10/31 09:00,['2006/03/31 09:00'],"['2006/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404209 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404209 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Jun;20(6):1055-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404209.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) assay showed that the intracellular concentration of ceramide increased time-dependently after X irradiation of cells, and this radiation-induced accumulation of ceramide did not occur prior to the appearance of apoptotic cells. Treatment with D609 significantly inhibited radiation-induced apoptosis, but did not inhibit the increase of intracellular ceramide. Treatment with desipramine or GW4869 prevented neither radiation-induced apoptosis nor the induced increase of ceramide. On the other hand, fumonisin B1 and L-cycloserine had no effect on the radiation-induced induction of apoptosis, in spite of significant inhibition of the radiation-induced ceramide. From these results, it was suggested that the increase of the intracellular concentration of ceramide was not essential for radiation-induced apoptosis in MOLT-4 cells.","['Takahashi, Eriko', 'Inanami, Osamu', 'Asanuma, Taketoshi', 'Kuwabara, Mikinori']","['Takahashi E', 'Inanami O', 'Asanuma T', 'Kuwabara M']","['Laboratory of Radiation Biology, Department of Environmental Veterinary Sciences, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,['0 (Ceramides)'],IM,"['*Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Ceramides/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/03/31 09:00,2006/06/02 09:00,['2006/03/31 09:00'],"['2006/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/02 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jrr/47.19 [pii]', '10.1269/jrr.47.19 [doi]']",ppublish,J Radiat Res. 2006 Mar;47(1):19-25. doi: 10.1269/jrr.47.19.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He and his team, however, soon observed the intriguing phenomenon of hematological diversification, which corresponded to a decrease of myeloid leukemias and an increase of other types of leukemias. Recently, we derived two different molecular clones corresponding to ecotropic nondefective genomes that were named GV-1.2 and GV-1.4. The induced leukemias were classified as myeloid based on morphological analysis of blood smears. In this study, we further characterized the two variants of the Graffi murine retrovirus, GV-1.2 and GV-1.4, in three different strains of mice. We show that the Graffi MuLV is a multipotent retrovirus capable of inducing both lymphoid (T- and B-cell) and nonlymphoid (myeloid, erythroid, megakaryocytic) leukemia. Many of these are very complex with concomitant expression of different hematopoietic lineages. Interestingly, a high percentage of megakaryocytic leukemias, a type of leukemia rarely observed with MuLVs, arise in the FVB/n strain of mice. The genetic backgrounds of the different strains of mice influence greatly the results. Furthermore, the enhancer region, different for GV-1.2 and GV-1.4, plays a pivotal role in the disease specificity: GV-1.2 induces more lymphoid leukemias, and GV-1.4 induces more nonlymphoid ones.","['Voisin, Veronique', 'Barat, Corinne', 'Hoang, Trang', 'Rassart, Eric']","['Voisin V', 'Barat C', 'Hoang T', 'Rassart E']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire, Departement des Sciences Biologiques, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Case Postale 8888 Succ.

Here we show that cells also possess an intrinsic immune defense against HCMV that is disarmed by the virus. In HCMV-infected cells, the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body (PML-NB) protein Daxx silences viral immediate-early gene expression through the action of a histone deacetylase. However, this antiviral tactic is efficiently neutralized by the viral pp71 protein, which is incorporated into virions, delivered to cells upon infection, and mediates the proteasomal degradation of Daxx. This work demonstrates the mechanism through which pp71 activates viral immediate-early gene expression in HCMV-infected cells. Furthermore, it provides insight into how a PML-NB protein institutes an intrinsic immune defense against a DNA virus and how HCMV pp71 inactivates this defense.","['Saffert, Ryan T', 'Kalejta, Robert F']","['Saffert RT', 'Kalejta RF']","['Institute for Molecular Virology, and McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin--Madison, 1525 Linden Drive, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '107852-97-1 (cytomegalovirus phosphoprotein 71kDa)', '133343-34-7 (lactacystin)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Carrier Proteins/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Cytomegalovirus/*genetics', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*immunology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Silencing', '*Genes, Immediate-Early', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*physiology', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/physiology', 'Viral Proteins/*physiology']",2006/03/31 09:00,2006/04/25 09:00,['2006/03/31 09:00'],"['2006/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/8/3863 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.80.8.3863-3871.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Apr;80(8):3863-71. doi: 10.1128/JVI.80.8.3863-3871.2006.,,,,,,PMC1440479,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the significance of the ganglioside GM3 in cancer malignancy, we established GM3-reconstituted cells by transfecting the cDNA of GM3 synthase into a GM3-deficient subclone of the 3LL Lewis lung carcinoma cell line (Uemura, S. (2003) Glycobiology, 13, 207-216). The GM3-reconstituted cells were resistant to apoptosis induced by etoposide and doxorubicin. There were no changes in the expression levels of topoisomerase IIalpha or P-glycoprotein, or in the uptake of doxorubicin between the GM3-reconstituted cells and the mock-transfected cells. To understand the mechanism of the etoposide-resistant phenotype acquired in the GM3-reconstituted cells, we investigated their apoptotic signaling. Although no difference was observed in the phosphorylation of p53 at serine-15-residue site by etoposide between the GM3-reconstituted cells and mock-transfected cells, the activation of both caspase-3 and caspase-9 was specifically inhibited in the former. We found that the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) was increased in the GM3-reconstituted cells. Moreover, wild-type 3LL Lewis lung carcinoma cells, which have an abundance of GM3, exhibited no DNA fragmentation following etoposide treatment and expressed higher levels of the Bcl-2 protein compared with the J5 subclone. Thus, these results support the conclusion that endogenously produced GM3 is involved in malignant phenotypes, including anticancer drug resistance through up-regulating the Bcl-2 protein in this lung cancer cell line.","['Noguchi, Mariko', 'Kabayama, Kazuya', 'Uemura, Satoshi', 'Kang, Byoung-won', 'Saito, Masaki', 'Igarashi, Yasuyuki', 'Inokuchi, Jin-ichi']","['Noguchi M', 'Kabayama K', 'Uemura S', 'Kang BW', 'Saito M', 'Igarashi Y', 'Inokuchi J']","['Department of Biomembrane and Biofunctional Chemistry, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Glycobiology,Glycobiology,9104124,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (G(M3) Ganglioside)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp9 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Carcinoma, Lewis Lung/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Ceramides/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'G(M3) Ganglioside/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/physiology', 'Up-Regulation']",2006/03/31 09:00,2006/08/23 09:00,['2006/03/31 09:00'],"['2006/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['cwj103 [pii]', '10.1093/glycob/cwj103 [doi]']",ppublish,Glycobiology. 2006 Jul;16(7):641-50. doi: 10.1093/glycob/cwj103.

Unlike human leukocyte antigen genes, mHAg are encoded by genetically and functionally unrelated genes located throughout the chromosome. The role of mHAg in stem cell transplantation and the population frequencies of mHAg alleles remain unknown due in part to the lack of suitable high throughput methods for genotyping these diverse genes. Here we describe the development and utility of a multiplexed Luminex assay for genotyping human mHAg, including HA-1, HA-2, HA-3, HA-8, HB-1, CD31(125), and CD31(563). The assay uses a multiplexed, allele-independent, gated amplification of mHAg genes followed by differential detection of allele-specific primer extension products using the MultiCode PLx system (EraGen Biosciences, Madison, WI). The alleles are interrogated using a multiplex allele-specific primer extension reaction using primers tagged with EraCodes. The products are hybridized to Luminex beads and the hybridization duplexes are detected using streptavidin-phycoerythrin. The assay resolved the mHAg genotypes of 259 Caucasian donors and provided population estimates of mHAg gene and phenotypic frequencies. All mHAg alleles evaluated in this study exhibited Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, although some mHAg phenotypes were present in large majority of individuals tested (HA-2, HB-1). This assay will provide a valuable tool for determining mHAg frequencies in other ethnic populations, as well as for establishing the clinical importance of mHAg disparities in stem cell transplantation.","['Pietz, Bradley C', 'Warden, Melissa B', 'DuChateau, Brian K', 'Ellis, Thomas M']","['Pietz BC', 'Warden MB', 'DuChateau BK', 'Ellis TM']","['Product Development Laboratory, BloodCenter of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53201-2178, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",United States,Hum Immunol,Human immunology,8010936,"['0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genotype', 'Humans', 'Isoantigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2006/03/31 09:00,2009/06/12 09:00,['2006/03/31 09:00'],"['2005/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/30 00:00 [revised]', '2005/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0198-8859(05)00408-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.humimm.2005.08.243 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Immunol. 2005 Nov;66(11):1174-82. doi: 10.1016/j.humimm.2005.08.243.

Four general types of pathogenic effects with various retroviruses have been observed including: hemorrhage (TR1.3), spongiform encephalopathy (CasBrE, FrCasE, PVC211, NT40, Mol-ts1), demyelination with inflammatory lesions (HTLV-1, visna, CAEV), and encephalopathy with gliosis and proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines, usually with microglial giant cells and nodules [human immunodeficiencyvirus (HIV), feline immunodeficiencyvirus (FIV), simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), Fr98]. This review focuses on this fourth group of retroviruses. In this latter group, proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine upregulation accompanies the disease process, and may influence pathogenesis by direct effects on resident CNS cells. The review first discusses the Fr98 murine polytropic virus system with particular reference to the roles of cytokines and chemokines in the pathogenic process. The Fr98 data are then compared and contrasted to the cytokine and chemokine data in the lentivirus systems, HIV, SIV, and FIV.

Notably, the SH-7's inhibitory potency on Topo II was much stronger than that on Topo I. In addition, SH-7 significantly stabilized Topo II-DNA cleavable complex and elevated the expression of phosphorylated-H2AX. The in vitro cell-based investigation demonstrated that SH-7 displayed wide cytotoxicity in diversified cancer cell lines with the mean IC(50) value of 7.75 microM. One important finding is SH-7 displayed significant cytotoxicity in the 3 MDR cell lines, with an average IC(50) value nearly equivalent to that of the corresponding parental cell lines. The average resistance factor (RF) of SH-7 was 1.74, which was much lower than those of reference drugs VP-16 (RF 145.92), ADR (RF 105.97) and VCR (RF 197.39). Further studies illustrated that SH-7 had the marked apoptosis-inducing function on leukemia HL-60 cells, which was validated to be of mitochondria-dependence. The in vivo experiments showed that SH-7 had inhibitory effects on S-180 sarcoma implanted to mice, SMMC-7721, BEL-7402 human hepatocellular carcinoma and PC-3 human prostate cancer implanted to nude mice. Taken together, these results suggest that SH-7 induces DSBs as a Topo II inhibitor, which was crucial to activate the apoptotic process, and subsequently accounts for its both in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities. The well-defined Topo II inhibitory activity, antitumor effects particularly with its obvious anti-MDR action, better solubility and less toxicity make SH-7 as a potential antitumor drug candidate for further research and development.","['Yang, Fan', 'Chen, Yi', 'Duan, Wenhu', 'Zhang, Chao', 'Zhu, Hong', 'Ding, Jian']","['Yang F', 'Chen Y', 'Duan W', 'Zhang C', 'Zhu H', 'Ding J']","[""State key laboratory of drug research, Division of Anti-tumor pharmacology, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, People's Republic Of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0', '(1-(1,4-dihydro-5,8-dihydroxy-1,4-dioxonaphthalen-2-yl)-4-methylpent-3-enylfuran-', '2-caroxylate)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '3IK6592UBW (shikonin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Naphthoquinones/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Sarcoma/drug therapy', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2006/03/30 09:00,2006/08/23 09:00,['2006/03/30 09:00'],"['2006/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.21943 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2006 Sep 1;119(5):1184-93. doi: 10.1002/ijc.21943.,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, an alternative approach using monocyte-derived DCs pulsed with tumor antigens is required. We investigated the possibility of immunotherapy for AML using leukemic-cell-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes that were stimulated in vitro by autologous DCs pulsed with tumor antigens. To generate DCs, CD14(+) cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using magnetic-activated cell sorting, and cultured in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4. On day 6, maturation of DCs was induced by addition of cytokine cocktail (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and prostaglandin E(2)) for 2 days, and then the mature DCs were pulsed with whole leukemic cell lysates or apoptotic leukemic cells. There were no differences in the phenotypic expressions of mature DCs generated by pulsing with or without leukemic antigens. The mature DCs pulsed with tumor cell lysates or apoptotic leukemic cells showed a higher allostimulatory capacity for allogeneic CD3(+) T cells as compared with mature non-pulsed DCs. Autologous CD3(+) T cells stimulated by the mature pulsed DCs showed more potent cytotoxic activities against autologous leukemic cells than those stimulated by mature non-pulsed DCs. These results suggest that use of DCs pulsed with leukemic cell lysates or apoptotic leukemic cells is a feasible alternative immunotherapeutic approach to overcome the limitations of leukemic-DCs for the treatment of AML patients.","['Lee, J-J', 'Park, M-S', 'Park, J-S', 'Kang, H-K', 'Kim, S-K', 'Nguyen Pham, T-N', 'Zhu, X-W', 'Cho, D', 'Nam, J-H', 'Kim, Y-J', 'Rhee, J-H', 'Chung, I-J', 'Kim, H-J']","['Lee JJ', 'Park MS', 'Park JS', 'Kang HK', 'Kim SK', 'Nguyen Pham TN', 'Zhu XW', 'Cho D', 'Nam JH', 'Kim YJ', 'Rhee JH', 'Chung IJ', 'Kim HJ']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Korea. drjejung@chonnam.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Apher,Journal of clinical apheresis,8216305,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Separation', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Monocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*cytology/metabolism']",2006/03/30 09:00,2007/01/04 09:00,['2006/03/30 09:00'],"['2006/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jca.20085 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Apher. 2006 Oct;21(3):188-94. doi: 10.1002/jca.20085.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, because their incidence is low, not much is known about their particular features. METHODS: The incidence, characteristics, risk, and prognostic factors of myeloma, Hodgkin disease, and lymphoid leukemia using the United States Renal Data System from 1991 to 2000 among 66,159 Medicare patients were analyzed. RESULTS: In all, 1,169 recipients developed a lymphoid disease: 823 (1.2%) non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), 160 (0.24%) myelomas, 60 (0.1%) Hodgkin lymphomas, and 126 (0.2%) lymphoid leukemias. Older age was associated with an increased risk of myeloma and leukemia. The incidence of hepatitis C virus infection was higher in recipients with myeloma (6.9 vs. 3.9%, P=0.05). Induction therapy was associated with a greater risk of myeloma and leukemia, but not Hodgkin disease. Azathioprine was associated with a lower risk of myeloma, and tacrolimus with a lower risk of Hodgkin disease. According to the type of malignancy, ten-year survival rates were significantly different: 42, 26, 55 and 39% respectively for NHL, myeloma, Hodgkin disease, and leukemia. CONCLUSION: These results support specific features and risk factors related to the occurrence of each type of lymphoid-proliferation and suggest for the first time a possible association between hepatitis C virus and myeloma in kidney transplant recipients.","['Caillard, Sophie', 'Agodoa, Lawrence Y', 'Bohen, Erin M', 'Abbott, Kevin C']","['Caillard S', 'Agodoa LY', 'Bohen EM', 'Abbott KC']","['Nephrology Service, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC 20307, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*etiology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*etiology/microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*etiology/microbiology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",2006/03/30 09:00,2006/04/20 09:00,['2006/03/30 09:00'],"['2006/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.tp.0000203554.54242.56 [doi]', '00007890-200603270-00013 [pii]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2006 Mar 27;81(6):888-95. doi: 10.1097/01.tp.0000203554.54242.56.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A critical role of PKC-epsilon in antigen-triggered activation of various signaling pathways was observed in basophilic leukemia cells. To study the function of PKC-epsilon in MCs differentiated in vitro from murine bone marrow, we used our established PKC-epsilon null mice. Unexpectedly, we did not reveal any difference in antigen-induced activation of many central signaling molecules (PKB, mitogen-activated protein kinase, p38, Jun-N-terminal kinase, phospholipase C-gamma1, Bruton's tyrosine kinase, PKD, Fos and PKC-delta) in time-course as well as dose-response studies between PKC-epsilon-deficient and wild-type MCs. In correlation, antigen-triggered degranulation, release of arachidonic acid and secretion of IL-6 were unaltered by the loss of PKC-epsilon. Furthermore, stimulation of MCs via different receptor systems [Steel factor receptor (c-kit) and toll-like receptor 4] did not lead to differences in the measured responses between both cell types.

Since histamine has been shown to act as a growth factor in malignant melanoma cells, we decided to evaluate the in vitro effect of diphenhydramine and other H1 histamine receptor antagonists, such as terfenadine, astemizol and triprolidine on four malignant human melanoma cell lines. These antagonists were found to induce apoptotic cell death in all four melanoma cell lines. Apoptosis was determined by assessment of phosphatidylserine exposure on the surface of the cells and nuclear fragmentation. Importantly, H1 antagonist treatments did not adversely affect the viability of human melanocytes and murine fibroblasts at the same doses and duration of exposure. Treatment of melanoma cells with terfenadine induced DNA damage and caspases 2, 3, 6, 8 and 9 activation. Furthermore, the general caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-FMK) and a selective inhibitor of caspase-2 (z-VDVAD-FMK) protected melanoma cells from terfenadine-induced apoptosis. In contrast, the caspase-8 inhibitor (z-IETD-FMK) was ineffective. In addition, we found that mitochondria are involved in TEF-induced apoptosis, characterized by the dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, the release of cytochrome c into the cytosolic compartment and caspase-9 activation. On the basis of these results we conclude that H1 histamine receptor antagonists induce apoptosis in human melanoma cells but not in normal melanocytes and embryonic murine fibroblasts; this apoptosis appears to be caspase-2-dependent and involves the mitochondrial pathway. The present results may contribute to the elaboration of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of malignant human melanoma.","['Jangi, Shawkat-Muhialdin', 'Diaz-Perez, Jose Luis', 'Ochoa-Lizarralde, Borja', 'Martin-Ruiz, Itziar', 'Asumendi, Aintzane', 'Perez-Yarza, Gorka', 'Gardeazabal, Jesus', 'Diaz-Ramon, Jose Luis', 'Boyano, Maria Dolores']","['Jangi SM', 'Diaz-Perez JL', 'Ochoa-Lizarralde B', 'Martin-Ruiz I', 'Asumendi A', 'Perez-Yarza G', 'Gardeazabal J', 'Diaz-Ramon JL', 'Boyano MD']","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of the Basque Country, Leioa E-48940, and Department of Dermatology, Cruces Hospital, Vizcaya, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Histamine H1 Antagonists)', '0 (Mutagens)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 2', 'Caspases/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histamine/metabolism', 'Histamine H1 Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Melanocytes/metabolism', 'Melanoma/*metabolism', 'Mutagens/pharmacology']",2006/03/30 09:00,2006/10/17 09:00,['2006/03/30 09:00'],"['2006/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['bgl021 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgl021 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2006 Sep;27(9):1787-96. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgl021.

We investigated rapid generation and expansion of donor derived-allogeneic T-cell lines cytotoxic against patient leukemic cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) blasts were cultured 5 days in Stem Span, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-4, and calcium ionophore. All B-precursor ALL (N22) and AML (N13), but not T-cell ALL (N3), differentiated into mature leukemia-derived antigen-presenting cells (LD-APC). All but one LD-APC generated cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) from adult human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical (N8) or unrelated donors (N2). RESULTS: Upon in vitro culture, donor-derived CTL acquired a memory T phenotype, showing concomitant high CD45RA, CD45RO, CD62L expression. CD8(+) cells, but not CD4(+) cells, were granzyme, perforine, and interferon-gamma-positive. Pooled CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells were cytotoxic against leukemic blasts (32%, 30:1 E:T ratio), but not against autologous or patient-derived phytohemagglutinin blasts. LD-APC from five ALL patients were used to generate CTL from cord blood. A mixed population of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells was documented in 54% of wells. T cells acquired classical effector memory phenotype and showed a higher cytotoxicity against leukemia blasts (47%, 1:1 E:T ratio). Adult and cord blood CTL showed a skewing from a complete T-cell receptor repertoire to an oligo-clonal/clonal pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Availability of these cells should allow clinical trials for salvage treatment of leukemia patients relapsing after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","['Barbui, Anna M', 'Borleri, Gianmaria', 'Conti, Elena', 'Ciocca, Alice', 'Salvi, Anna', 'Mico, Caterina', 'Introna, Martino', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro']","['Barbui AM', 'Borleri G', 'Conti E', 'Ciocca A', 'Salvi A', 'Mico C', 'Introna M', 'Rambaldi A']","['Laboratorio di Terapia Cellulare e Genica G.

In order to identify the chromatin regulatory factors associated with incomplete cell differentiation and impaired chromatin condensation in hematological malignancies, we examined expression levels of major heterochromatin proteins in normal blood cells and cells derived from a number of chronic and acute myeloid leukemia patients exhibiting different degrees of differentiation. METHODS: We used immunoblotting and immunofluorescence to examine the levels and localization of epigenetic heterochromatin factors in isolated cell nuclei and fractionated peripheral blood cells. RESULTS: While the major epigenetic heterochromatin factor, histone H3 methylated at lysine 9, is present in all cell types, its main counterparts, nonhistone proteins, heterochromatin proteins 1 (HP1) alpha, beta, and gamma, are dramatically reduced in peripheral blood leukocytes of normal donors and chronic myeloid leukemia patients, but are substantially increased in the blood of accelerated phase and blast crisis patients. In the terminally differentiated cells, nuclear chromatin accumulates a nucleocytoplasmic serpin, monocyte and neutrophil elastase inhibitor (MNEI). HP1 and MNEI levels inversely correlate in a number of normal and leukemia myeloid cells and show strikingly opposite coordinated changes during differentiation of U937 cell line induced by retinoic acid. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that repression of HP1 and accumulation of MNEI are linked to terminal cell differentiation and that their levels may be monitored in blood cell populations to detect transitions in cell differentiation associated with leukemia progression and treatment.","['Popova, Evgenya Y', 'Claxton, David F', 'Lukasova, Emilie', 'Bird, Phillip I', 'Grigoryev, Sergei A']","['Popova EY', 'Claxton DF', 'Lukasova E', 'Bird PI', 'Grigoryev SA']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Penn State University College of Medicine, Milton S.

Present treatments do not differentiate between normal and malignant cells. New reagents that distinguish malignant cells and enable the isolation of these cells from the normal background will enhance the molecular characterization of disease and specificity of treatment. METHODS: Peptide ligands were selected from a phage-displayed peptide library by biopanning on the B-cell lymphoma line, A20. The isolated peptides were assessed as reagents for identification and isolation of lymphoma cells by flow cytometry and cell capture with magnetic beads. RESULTS: Two novel peptides and one obtained previously on cardiomyocytes were selected. A20 cells bind phage displaying these peptides 250- to 450-fold over control phage. These phage bind to other bone marrow-derived cancel lines including some macrophage and T cells but do not bind to normal splenocytes. Synthetic constructs of these peptides have binding affinities comparable to B-cell-specific antibodies. Similar to antibodies, these peptides can be used in flow cytometry and magnetic bead capture to distinguish lymphoma cells from normal splenocytes. CONCLUSION: Bone marrow-derived malignant cells express cell surface markers that can be used to distinguish them from normal cells. These results demonstrate the ability to use an unbiased screen to rapidly generate high-affinity peptide ligands for identification and isolation of lymphoma cells.","['McGuire, Michael J', 'Samli, Kausar N', 'Chang, Ya-Ching', 'Brown, Kathlynn C']","['McGuire MJ', 'Samli KN', 'Chang YC', 'Brown KC']","['Division of Translational Research, Department of Internal Medicine, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, 75390, USA. michael.mcguire@utsouthwestern.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptides/*genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",2006/03/30 09:00,2006/05/18 09:00,['2006/03/30 09:00'],"['2005/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/18 00:00 [revised]', '2005/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(05)00583-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2005.12.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2006 Apr;34(4):443-52. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2005.12.013.,,,,,"['R01 AI050235/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '1 R01 AI50235-01A1/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several approaches have been proposed to quantify its level of expression by flow cytometry. METHODS: We compared the use of (i) the percentage of CD38 positive cells, (ii) CD38 antibodies bound per cell (ABC), and (iii) a semi-quantitative method based on the shape of the CD38 histogram, within a cohort of 78 B-CLL patients. RESULTS: A decreased overall survival was seen with >30% CD38 positivity among B-CLL cells, with CD38 ABC >100, and with bimodal or unimodal, strongly positive CD38 histograms. However, patients with unimodal weakly positive CD38 histograms also showed a significantly reduced survival as did patients with intermediate proportions (i.e. 5-30%) of CD38+ cells. Furthermore, within the group with <5% CD38 positivity among their B-CLL cells, 84% of patients showed prognostically favourable mutated IGVH gene segments and 100% had low ZAP70 gene expression. For 5-30% CD38 positivity, these proportions were 50 and 83%, while for >30% CD38 positivity, these proportion were only 28 and 56%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We found a simple method of quantitation of CD38 expression (i.e., >5% CD38 positivity among B-CLL cells) to be sufficient to identify patients with an unfavourable prognosis. The level of CD38 expression as defined with this method correlated well with the IGVH mutation status and ZAP70 gene expression.","['Boonstra, Joke G', 'van Lom, Kirsten', 'Langerak, Anton W', 'Graveland, Wilfried J', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Kraan, Jaco', ""van 't Veer, Mars B"", 'Gratama, Jan W']","['Boonstra JG', 'van Lom K', 'Langerak AW', 'Graveland WJ', 'Valk PJ', 'Kraan J', ""van 't Veer MB"", 'Gratama JW']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, The Netherlands. j.boonstra@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Therefore, we wanted to see if JC-1 could also simultaneously assess both, P-gp activity and apoptosis, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. METHODS: P-gp activity was measured using JC-1 and compared to the results of the Rhodamine 123 (Rh 123) assay in P-gp negative and P-gp positive cell lines, and 12 AML samples. For apoptosis, spontaneous apoptosis, as well as, apoptosis induced by Cytosine Arabinosine and Homoharringtonine were analyzed. Both mitochondrial red fluorescence and cytoplasmic green fluorescence of JC-1 with and without a P-gp inhibitor (Cyclosporine A : CsA) were used for the identification of apoptotic cells, and this was compared to Annexin V/PI staining. RESULTS: (1) We found a good correlation between JC-1 and Rh 123 in viable cells. Even in a small population of viable cells, P-gp positive cells emitting low red fluorescence, gained on red fluorescence after P-gp inhibition with CsA permitting an evaluation of P-gp activity. (2) We found a good correlation between the Annexin V/PI staining and JC-1 (P < 0.0001) in the assessment of apoptotic cells. Most importantly, the apoptotic cells could be distinguished by the loss of red fluorescence and the increase of green fluorescence without any change after P-gp inhibition with CsA. CONCLUSIONS: JC-1 can simultaneously evaluate two important parameters involved in drug resistance in AML cells, P-gp activity and apoptosis.","['Chaoui, Driss', 'Faussat, Anne-Marie', 'Majdak, Patricia', 'Tang, Ruoping', 'Perrot, Jean-Yves', 'Pasco, Sabine', 'Klein, Christophe', 'Marie, Jean-Pierre', 'Legrand, Ollivier']","['Chaoui D', 'Faussat AM', 'Majdak P', 'Tang R', 'Perrot JY', 'Pasco S', 'Klein C', 'Marie JP', 'Legrand O']","['Universite Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6, UMR S 736, Les Cordeliers, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate behavioral and educational functioning in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or a Wilms tumor. In this study, children with ALL received central nervous system directed chemotherapy without cranial irradiation. METHODS: In a multicenter study, behavioral functioning and school performance was examined in 199 children age 4 to 18. Sixty-four children were at least 1 year from finishing treatment with chemotherapy for ALL (n = 28) or a Wilms tumor (n = 36). They were compared with siblings (n = 37) and with a control group of healthy schoolchildren (n = 98). RESULTS: A moderately increased risk of behavioral and educational problems was found in children with ALL but not in children with Wilms tumor. School performance was poorer in children with ALL attending primary school compared with same-age peers; however, the rate of utilization of special education services was low. Teacher-rated behavior and mathematics performance was correlated with attention function in children with ALL.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this survey is to describe the disability profile in a group of tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-I-associated myelopathy patients, identifying the requirements for community ambulation. SETTING: Tertiary care unit, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. METHODS: Seventy-two patients were assessed (49 female and 23 male), referred by tertiary care centers, when a clinical protocol was applied. RESULTS: The sample had an average age of 40 years and an average of 137 months of duration of the disease. The most prevalent aspects of disability found were in gait and sphincter control areas. A total of 72% of the patients were community ambulators and 17% were restricted to wheel chair. Age, strength and low-back pain interfere in activities of daily living (P<0.05). A positive correlation was found between community ambulation and the knee extensors (r=0.80) and ankle plantar flexors (r=0.74). Strength, age, low-back pain, duration of disease, asymmetric onset of the symptoms and spasticity interfered in the ability to walk (P<0.05). A rehabilitation program was proposed focusing on modifiable factors that affect disability level.

Based on these findings, we investigated (i.) whether SLP65-deficiency also occurs in mature B cell-derived lymphoma and (ii.) whether SLP65-deficient B cell lymphoma cells use an alternative B cell receptor signaling pathway in the absence of SLP65. Indeed, expression of SLP65 protein was also missing in a fraction of B cell lymphoma cases. While SLP65 is essential for B cell receptor-induced Ca2+ mobilization in normal B cells, B cell receptor engagement in SLP65-deficient as compared to SLP65-reconstituted B cell lymphoma cells resulted in an accelerated yet shortlived Ca2+-signal. B cell receptor engagement of SLP65-deficient lymphoma cells involves SRC kinase activation, which is critical for B cell receptor-dependent Ca2+-mobilisation in the absence but not in the presence of SLP65. As shown by RNA interference, the SRC kinase LYN is required for B cell receptor-induced Ca2+ release in SLP65-deficient B cell lymphoma cells but dispensable after SLP65-reconstitution. B cell receptor engagement in SLP65-deficient B cell lymphoma cells also resulted in tyrosine-phosphorylation of the proliferation- and survival-related MAPK1 and STAT5 molecules, which was sensitive to silencing of the SRC kinase LYN. Inhibition of SRC kinase activity resulted in growth arrest and cell death specifically in SLP65-deficient lymphoma cells. These findings indicate that LYN can short-circuit conventional B cell receptor signaling in SLP65-deficient B cell lymphoma cells and thereby promote activation of survival and proliferation-related molecules.","['Sprangers, M', 'Feldhahn, N', 'Herzog, S', 'Hansmann, M-L', 'Reppel, M', 'Hescheler, J', 'Jumaa, H', 'Siebert, R', 'Muschen, M']","['Sprangers M', 'Feldhahn N', 'Herzog S', 'Hansmann ML', 'Reppel M', 'Hescheler J', 'Jumaa H', 'Siebert R', 'Muschen M']","['Laboratory for Molecular Stem Cell Biology, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, and Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein Campus Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B cell linker protein)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*enzymology/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",2006/03/29 09:00,2006/10/26 09:00,['2006/03/29 09:00'],"['2006/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209510 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209510 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Aug 17;25(36):5056-62. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209510.

Reliable data on familial risks are important for clinical counselling and cancer genetics. The current analysis was based on the nation-wide Swedish Family-Cancer Database on 10.5 million individuals, containing families with parents and offspring. Cancer data were retrieved from the Swedish Cancer Registry from the years 1958 to 2002, including 3636 patients with any type of eye cancer. Familial risk for offspring was defined using the standardized incidence ratio (SIR), adjusted for many variables. Ocular melanoma was detected in two parent-offspring pairs, but the SIR of 3.90 was not significant. Parental upper aerodigestive tract (2.05), left-sided colon (1.83) and male non-medullary thyroid (6.98) cancers showed an association with ocular melanoma, albeit some with a borderline significance. The SIR for leukaemia was increased when parents were diagnosed with eye melanoma. There was no evidence for the association of ocular melanoma with cutaneous melanoma. The SIR for ocular melanoma was 1.76 when a sister was diagnosed with breast cancer, but there was no increase when a mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. When both a child and the parent presented with retinoblastoma, the SIR was 900. The parents of children with retinoblastoma had an excess of small intestinal and rectal cancers and Hodgkin's disease. The present findings were based on a limited number of cases, but they display a complex and heterogeneous pattern of familial associations in ocular melanoma, including an association with breast cancer through a putative recessive mechanism.","['Hemminki, Kari', 'Chen, Bowang']","['Hemminki K', 'Chen B']","['Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Centre, Heidelberg, Germany.

Data were analyzed by cohort (cohort 1, age 55 to 64 years; cohort 2, age 65 to 74 years; cohort 3, age > or = 75 years). RESULTS: Paclitaxel concentration versus time (AUC) and total-body clearance (CL(tb)) data were available for 122 patients (cohort 1, 46 patients; cohort 2, 44 patients; cohort 3, 32 patients). Mean paclitaxel AUC increased across cohorts (P = .01).

Although photosaturation of a sensitizer and oxygen depletion in tumor have been considered to be involved during pulsed laser irradiation, there is a lack of experimental data. In the present work several parameters such as the amount of merocyanine 540 (MC540) in cells, the oxygen concentration in cells, and the amount of photos reaching cells during pulsed laser irradiation, were studied to compare the MC540-mediated PDT effects of a pulsed laser and a CW light source on murine myeloid WEH-3B (JCS) cells in vitro. The results showed that the pulsed laser was less effective at cell inactivation than the CW light under the same irradiation dose. However, when the energy of the pulsed laser was reduced from 0.25 to 0.06 mJ/cm2 while keeping the total irradiation dose unchanged, the photoinactivation of cells was increased significantly. Based on the measurements and calculations for the present experimental conditions, each cell has about 108 MC540 molecules bound (5 microg/ml MC540 for 1 hr) and receives about 109 photos from 0.25 mJ/cm2 of the pulsed laser. The results indicate that the photosaturation of MC540 occurs in the present conditions due to the fact that the photons received by one cell in one laser pulse were much more than the numbers of MC540 molecules bound to one cell. Thus, the photosaturation of the photosensitizer is one of the reasons to explain the different efficiency in cell inactivation between the pulsed laser and CW light.","['Chen, Jiyao', 'Mak, Naiki K', 'Leung, Wongneng', 'Cheung, Naihou', 'Peng, Qian']","['Chen J', 'Mak NK', 'Leung W', 'Cheung N', 'Peng Q']","['Department of Physics, The State Key Lab for Advance Photonic Materials and Devices, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol,"Journal of environmental pathology, toxicology and oncology : official organ of the International Society for Environmental Toxicology and Cancer",8501420,"['0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', '*Light', 'Mice', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidinones/*pharmacology']",2006/03/29 09:00,2006/11/15 09:00,['2006/03/29 09:00'],"['2006/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['5d84548f012e18bf,3d90da876885c24b [pii]', '10.1615/jenvironpatholtoxicoloncol.v25.i1-2.130 [doi]']",ppublish,J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol. 2006;25(1-2):217-22. doi: 10.1615/jenvironpatholtoxicoloncol.v25.i1-2.130.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The HPA axis is a major stress response system, and the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) may be a potent mediator of the HPA axis; therefore, circulating LIF levels in burn patients were studied. Twenty extensively burned patients (burn surface area, >20%), ie, 10 women and 10 men, 37 to 77 years of age (average: 59.1 +/- 12.10 years), were assessed. Circulating LIF, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), other inflammatory markers, and 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion levels were investigated. LIF levels were greater in patients who died than in those who survived (186.1 +/- 80.41, 83.5 +/- 64.49 pg/ml, respectively, P < .001) at 36 hours after injury. ACTH levels were more significantly elevated in fatal cases than in those who survived. (41.3 +/- 8.28, 25.2 +/- 7.84 pg/ml, respectively, P < .0001). Twenty-four hour (24 to 48 hours after injury) pooled urinary free cortisol excretion levels also were significantly greater in fatal cases than in the surviving patient group (235.0 +/- 36.49 microg/day, 69.0 +/- 18.04 microg/day, respectively, P < .0001). The correlation between serum LIF and urine free cortisol was significant (r = .30; P < .01) as was the correlation of serum LIF with plasma ACTH (r = .24; P < .01). Serum LIF as well as HPA axis activity markers is a good marker of disease severity and prognosis in patients with extensive burns.","['Akita, Sadanori', 'Akino, Kozo', 'Ren, Song Guang', 'Melmed, Shlomo', 'Imaizumi, Toshifumi', 'Hirano, Akiyoshi']","['Akita S', 'Akino K', 'Ren SG', 'Melmed S', 'Imaizumi T', 'Hirano A']","['Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Department of Developmental and Reconstructive Medicine Nagasaki University, Graduate School of Biomedical and Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Burn Care Res,Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association,101262774,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/blood', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Burns/*metabolism/mortality/physiopathology', 'C-Reactive Protein/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/urine', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/physiopathology', 'Interleukin-6/*blood', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System/physiopathology', 'Trauma Severity Indices']",2006/03/29 09:00,2006/06/29 09:00,['2006/03/29 09:00'],"['2006/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.BCR.0000197679.08671.A5 [doi]', '01253092-200603000-00019 [pii]']",ppublish,J Burn Care Res. 2006 Mar-Apr;27(2):221-5. doi: 10.1097/01.BCR.0000197679.08671.A5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors reported significantly higher radiation risks, both for cancers and non-cancers, among those survivors with acute injuries compared with those without. The risks were reported to be particularly large among survivors aged <10 or > or =55 years of age at the time of bombings. The aim of this paper is to examine these findings more closely using the LSS acute effects data. All the analyses were carried out using Poisson regression. Relative risk models were fitted with adjustment for sex and other factors. Significant differences in relative risk between survivors with epilation and burns and those without epilation and burns are found for leukaemia. There is also some evidence for heterogeneity in the leukaemia risk between survivors with two or more acute injuries and those with no injuries, but the evidence is disappeared when survivors with one or more injuries are compared with those without injuries. For solid cancers, cardiovascular disease and all deaths combined, the risks do not differ to a statistically significant extent between survivors with and without injuries. There is no statistically significant heterogeneity in risk across age-at-exposure categories for survivors with injuries. For all deaths combined, relative risk estimates and their uncertainties are significantly higher for survivors exposed at ages <10 years when compared with other exposure ages, but risks are not significantly raised for survivors exposed at > or =55 years of age.

Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells genetically deficient for DNMT1, or both DNMT3a and DNMT3b have dramatically elongated telomeres compared with wild-type controls. Mammalian telomere repeats (TTAGGG) lack the canonical CpG methylation site. However, we demonstrate that mouse subtelomeric regions are heavily methylated, and that this modification is decreased in DNMT-deficient cells. We show that other heterochromatic marks, such as histone 3 Lys 9 (H3K9) and histone 4 Lys 20 (H4K20) trimethylation, remain at both subtelomeric and telomeric regions in these cells. Lack of DNMTs also resulted in increased telomeric recombination as indicated by sister-chromatid exchanges involving telomeric sequences, and by the presence of 'alternative lengthening of telomeres' (ALT)-associated promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies (APBs). This increased telomeric recombination may lead to telomere-length changes, although our results do not exclude a potential involvement of telomerase and telomere-binding proteins in the aberrant telomere elongation observed in DNMT-deficient cells. Together, these results demonstrate a previously unappreciated role for DNA methylation in maintaining telomere integrity.","['Gonzalo, Susana', 'Jaco, Isabel', 'Fraga, Mario F', 'Chen, Taiping', 'Li, En', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Blasco, Maria A']","['Gonzalo S', 'Jaco I', 'Fraga MF', 'Chen T', 'Li E', 'Esteller M', 'Blasco MA']","['Telomeres and Telomerase Group, Molecular Oncology Program, Spanish National Cancer Centre (CNIO), Madrid E-28029, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nat Cell Biol,Nature cell biology,100890575,"['0 (Dnmt3a protein, mouse)', '0 (Heterochromatin)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA methyltransferase 3B)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (Dnmt1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Coiled Bodies/genetics/metabolism', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics/*physiology', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/metabolism', 'Heterochromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Sister Chromatid Exchange', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Telomere/*genetics']",2006/03/28 09:00,2006/05/23 09:00,['2006/03/28 09:00'],"['2005/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['ncb1386 [pii]', '10.1038/ncb1386 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Cell Biol. 2006 Apr;8(4):416-24. doi: 10.1038/ncb1386.

METHODS: C57/BL6 mice were treated with a single intravenous injection of NaIO3 (50 mg/kg) to create RPE damage. At different time points real-time RT-PCR, ELISA, and immunohistochemistry were used to identify chemoattractants secreted in the subretinal space. Conditioned medium from NaIO3-treated mouse RPE was used in an in vitro assay to assess chemotaxis of stem cell antigen-1 positive (Sca-1+) BM mononuclear cells (MNCs). The expression of early ocular markers (MITF, Pax-6, Six-3, Otx) in migrated cells and in MNCs isolated from granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and Flt3 ligand (FL)-mobilized and nonmobilized peripheral blood (PB) was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: mRNA for stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), C3, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was significantly increased, and higher SDF-1 and C3 protein secretion from the RPE was found after NaIO3 treatment. A higher number of BMMNCs expressing early ocular markers migrated to conditioned medium from damaged retina. There was also increased expression of early ocular markers in PBMNCs after mobilization. CONCLUSIONS: Damaged RPE secretes cytokines that have been shown to serve as chemoattractants for BM-derived stem cells (BMSCs). Retina-committed stem cells appear to reside in the BM and can be mobilized into the PB by G-CSF and FL. These stem cells may have the potential to serve as an endogenous source for tissue regeneration after RPE damage.","['Li, Yang', 'Reca, Ryan G', 'Atmaca-Sonmez, Pelin', 'Ratajczak, Mariusz Z', 'Ildstad, Suzanne T', 'Kaplan, Henry J', 'Enzmann, Volker']","['Li Y', 'Reca RG', 'Atmaca-Sonmez P', 'Ratajczak MZ', 'Ildstad ST', 'Kaplan HJ', 'Enzmann V']","['Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, the.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,7703701,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Eye Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Iodates)', '0 (Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor)', '0 (Mitf protein, mouse)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Otx Transcription Factors)', '0 (PAX6 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Paired Box Transcription Factors)', '0 (Pax6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Sine oculis homeobox homolog 3 protein)', 'U558PCS5Z9 (sodium iodate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Chemotactic Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/*physiology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Eye Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Iodates/*toxicity', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Otx Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'PAX6 Transcription Factor', 'Paired Box Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pigment Epithelium of Eye/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2006/03/28 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/03/28 09:00'],"['2006/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['47/4/1646 [pii]', '10.1167/iovs.05-1092 [doi]']",ppublish,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2006 Apr;47(4):1646-52. doi: 10.1167/iovs.05-1092.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A coculture system with ARPE-19 and irradiated cells of an HTLV-1-producing T-cell line, MT2 was used to determine the permissivity of RPE to HTLV-1 infection in vitro. The susceptibility to HTLV-1 was assessed by detection of viral DNA using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), viral mRNA transcripts with reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and viral antigen by immunofluorescence staining. An HTLV-1 Tax-activated HTLV-LTR-luciferase reporter assay was developed to measure viral infection quantitatively. The ICAM-1 expression on cocultured ARPE-19 cells was detected by flow cytometry and an ICAM-1-neutralizing antibody was used to test ICAM-1's role in the HTLV-1 infection of ARPE-19 cells. The regulation of HTLV-1 infection was investigated by culturing ARPE-19 cells with proinflammatory cytokines. RESULTS: HTLV-1 infected ARPE-19 cells in vitro. The infection correlated with elevated expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 on the surface of ARPE-19 cells. ICAM-1-neutralizing antibody dramatically inhibited viral infection. Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines dramatically suppressed HTLV-1 viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: The tropism of HTLV-1 to retinal pigment epithelium could provide an explanation for the pathogenesis of HTLV-1-related ophthalmic diseases. A better understanding of specific roles of proinflammatory cytokines in the development of ophthalmic diseases may be beneficial for treatment.","['Liu, Baoying', 'Li, Zhuqing', 'Mahesh, Sankaranarayana P', 'Kurup, Shree K', 'Giam, Chou-Zen', 'Nussenblatt, Robert B']","['Liu B', 'Li Z', 'Mahesh SP', 'Kurup SK', 'Giam CZ', 'Nussenblatt RB']","['Laboratory of Immunology, National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,7703701,"['0 (Antibodies, Blocking)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Blocking/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/physiology', 'HTLV-I Antigens/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*immunology', 'Pigment Epithelium of Eye/drug effects/metabolism/*virology', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Transfection']",2006/03/28 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/03/28 09:00'],"['2006/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['47/4/1510 [pii]', '10.1167/iovs.05-1277 [doi]']",ppublish,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2006 Apr;47(4):1510-5. doi: 10.1167/iovs.05-1277.,,,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIM: To study the role of methylation in the inactivation of CKI in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was carried out on DNA obtained from the bone marrow of 56 newly diagnosed patients with CLL. RESULTS: Similar demographic features and clinical outcome were observed in our patients when compared with Caucasian patients, including an indolent clinical course (10-year overall survival 51%) and advanced Rai stage (p = 0.006), and a high-risk karyotype such as trisomy 12 and complex aberrations (p = 0.03). In the INK4 family, methylation in p15 and p16 occurred in 20 (35.7%) and 8 (14.3%) patients, respectively. In all, 5 (8.9%) CLL samples harboured concurrent methylation of both p15 and p16. Apart from an association of p16 methylation with higher presenting leucocyte count (64.5 x 10(9)/l in methylated p16 and 16.0 x 10(9)/l in unmethylated p16 patients; p = 0.016), there was no association between p15 and p16 methylation and age, sex and Rai stage. No difference was observed in the overall survival for patients with and without p15 and p16 methylation. By contrast, p18 and Rb were unmethylated in all samples. In the CIP/KIP family, apart from infrequent methylation of p57 in 4 (7.1%) patients, methylation of p21 and p27 was uniformly absent. CONCLUSION: p15 and, less frequently, p16 of the INK4 family of CKI, instead of the CIP or KIP family, were targeted by methylation in CLL. p16 methylation was associated with a higher lymphocyte count at presentation. This is the first comprehensive study of the epigenetic dysregulation of the INK4 and CIP/KIP families of CKI in Chinese patients with CLL.","['Chim, C S', 'Fung, T K', 'Wong, K F', 'Lau, J S', 'Law, M', 'Liang, R']","['Chim CS', 'Fung TK', 'Wong KF', 'Lau JS', 'Law M', 'Liang R']","['Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong. jcshim@hku.hk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor Proteins/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",2006/03/28 09:00,2006/11/15 09:00,['2006/03/28 09:00'],"['2006/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['jcp.2005.035089 [pii]', '10.1136/jcp.2005.035089 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2006 Sep;59(9):921-6. doi: 10.1136/jcp.2005.035089.

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses indicate that CD44 and the LARG protein are expressed in HSC-3 cells and that these two proteins are physically associated as a complex. HA-CD44 binding induces LARG-specific RhoA signaling and phospholipase C epsilon (PLC epsilon) activity. In particular, the activation of RhoA-PLC epsilon by HA stimulates inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate production, intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, and the up-regulation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), leading to phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal protein, filamin. The phosphorylation of filamin reduces its interaction with filamentous actin, promoting tumor cell migration. The CD44-LARG complex also interacts with the EGF receptor (EGFR). Most importantly, the binding of HA to the CD44-LARG-EGFR complex activates the EGFR receptor kinase, which in turn promotes Ras-mediated stimulation of a downstream kinase cascade including the Raf-1 and ERK pathways leading to HNSCC cell growth. Using a recombinant fragment of LARG (the LARG-PDZ domain) and a binding assay, we have determined that the LARG-PDZ domain serves as a direct linker between CD44 and EGFR. Transfection of the HSC-3 cells with LARG-PDZcDNA significantly reduces LARG association with CD44 and EGFR. Overexpression of the LARG-PDZ domain also functions as a dominant-negative mutant (similar to the PLC/Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and EGFR/MAPK inhibitor effects) to block HA/CD44-mediated signaling events (e.g. EGFR kinase activation, Ras/RhoA co-activation, Raf-ERK signaling, PLC epsilon-mediated inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate production, intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, CaMKII activity, filamin phosphorylation, and filamin-actin binding) and to abrogate tumor cell growth/migration. Taken together, our findings suggest that CD44 interaction with LARG and EGFR plays a pivotal role in Rho/Ras co-activation, PLC epsilon-Ca2+ signaling, and Raf/ERK up-regulation required for CaMKII-mediated cytoskeleton function and in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma progression.","['Bourguignon, Lilly Y W', 'Gilad, Eli', 'Brightman, Amy', 'Diedrich, Falko', 'Singleton, Patrick']","['Bourguignon LY', 'Gilad E', 'Brightman A', 'Diedrich F', 'Singleton P']","['Department of Medicine, University of California at San Francisco and Endocrine Unit (111N), Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, California 94121, USA. lillyb@itsa.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ARHGEF12 protein, human)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (rho-Associated Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Phosphoinositide Phospholipase C)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (phospholipase C epsilon)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'ErbB Receptors/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Hyaluronic Acid/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Phosphoinositide Phospholipase C', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism', 'ras Proteins/metabolism', 'rho-Associated Kinases']",2006/03/28 09:00,2006/07/22 09:00,['2006/03/28 09:00'],"['2006/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)78045-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M507734200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 May 19;281(20):14026-40. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M507734200.

It has remained unclear whether this oncoprotein kinase is mutated or post-translationally activated in human cancer cells. We have shown here that Tpl2/Cot is constitutively activated in human leukemia cell lines transformed by the human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I). The kinase activity of Tpl2/Cot is normally suppressed through its physical interaction with an inhibitor, the NF-kappaB1 precursor protein p105. Interestingly, a large pool of Tpl2/Cot is liberated from p105 and exhibits constitutive kinase activity in HTLV-I-transformed T cells. In contrast to its labile property in normal cells, the pathologically activated Tpl2/Cot is remarkably stable. Further, whereas the physiological activation of Tpl2/Cot involves its long isoform, the HTLV-activated Tpl2/Cot is predominantly the short isoform. We have also shown that the HTLV-I-encoded Tax protein is able to activate Tpl2/Cot in transfected cells. Finally, Tpl2/Cot participates in the activation of NF-kappaB by Tax.

Previous studies demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities and the objective of this work was to investigate a possible antinociceptive action of ethanolic extract of Croton celtidifolius bark (EE) and ethyl acetate fraction (EAF), n-butanol fraction (FBuOH), and aqueous fraction (FAq) obtained from EE. Two standard rodent models of pain were employed for this investigation, the writhing test and the formalin test. In the writhing test, the pre-treatment with EE significantly reduced the writhing induced by 0.6% acetic acid injection and its effect persisted for 4 h. In the formalin test, the pre-treatment with EAF caused marked and dose-related inhibition of formalin-induced licking in mice in the first phase, while pre-treatment with EAF, FBuOH and FAq had a similar effect in the second phase, when given by intraperitoneal (i.p.) and orally (p.o.) route. However, given by i.p. route, the effect of fractions was about three to five-fold more potent in inhibiting licking than when administered by p.o. route. EE presented an antinociceptive effect only in the second phase, when given by i.p. or p.o. route. The oedema caused by formalin was significantly reduced in animals treated i.p. with EAF, FBuOH and FAq. Under the same experimental conditions, in animals treated with sub-fractions derived from EAF only the 63 sub-fraction significantly reduced nociception in both phases and oedema caused by formalin. The results obtained suggest that Croton celtidifolius possesses antinociceptive properties since the EE, fractions and a sub-fraction significantly reduced the writhing induced by acetic acid and the nociception in both phases of the formalin test.","['Nardi, Geisson Marcos', 'Dalbo, Silvia', 'Monache, Franco Delle', 'Pizzolatti, Moacir Geraldo', 'Ribeiro-do-Valle, Rosa Maria']","['Nardi GM', 'Dalbo S', 'Monache FD', 'Pizzolatti MG', 'Ribeiro-do-Valle RM']","['Area de Ciencias Biologicas da Saude, ACBS, Universidade do Oeste de Santa Catarina, UNOESC, Joacaba, SC, Brazil. geisson.nardi@unoesc.edu.br']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,"['0 (Analgesics)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Analgesics/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Croton/*chemistry', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology']",2006/03/28 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/03/28 09:00'],"['2004/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2006/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-8741(06)00094-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2006.02.012 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2006 Aug 11;107(1):73-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2006.02.012.

Liposomes composed of DC-Chol/egg PC/PEG-DSPE (25:73.5:1.5, mol/mol/mol) were loaded with G3139 with high efficiency (70-80%). To prepare targeted liposomes, transferrin was first coupled to PEG-DSPE and then incorporated into the bilayer by post-insertion. The liposomes had a mean diameter of 100 to 150 nm and exhibited colloidal stability for up to 8 weeks. Uptake of Tf-conjugated G3139-containing liposomes in TfR positive K562 cells was found to be more efficient than that of the non-targeted control formulation and could be blocked by excess free Tf. Treatment with Tf-conjugated liposomes resulted in Bcl-2 protein downregulation in K562 cells that was approximately 2-fold greater than with non-targeted liposomes (p<0.05) and 10-fold greater than with free G3139. Treatment with 2 microM G3139 in Tf-conjugated liposomes resulted in >80% reduction in Bcl-2 transcript. In addition, Tf-conjugated liposomal G3139-sensitized K562 cells to daunorubicin, lowering IC50 from 1.8 microM to 0.18 microM. In conclusion, Tf-conjugated liposomes are effective delivery vehicles for G3139 antisense oligos in TfR positive K562 cells and warrant further investigation as an in vivo oligo delivery vehicle.","['Chiu, Shih-Jiuan', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Perrotti, Danilo', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Lee, Robert J']","['Chiu SJ', 'Liu S', 'Perrotti D', 'Marcucci G', 'Lee RJ']","['Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '85J5ZP6YSL (oblimersen)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Drug Stability', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Ligands', 'Liposomes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Thionucleotides/*administration & dosage']",2006/03/28 09:00,2006/07/11 09:00,['2006/03/28 09:00'],"['2005/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2006/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0168-3659(06)00080-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jconrel.2006.02.011 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2006 May 15;112(2):199-207. doi: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2006.02.011.

In order to prevent these complications, often platelet reductive drugs are used. These agents are by themselves potentially toxic, i.e. may cause leukemia or cardiac side effects. In order to avoid these adverse effects, a better understanding of the mechanism of thrombus formation which is causative in ET is mandatory. Unfortunately, until now, no biomarkers have been identified which allow the estimation of the risk of thrombotic complications. Platelet number is not a good predictor per se since thrombotic complications can occur in some patients at low platelet numbers whereas others do not encounter a thrombosis even at very high platelet levels. On the other hand, lowering of the platelet count usually results in symptomatic improvement. In ET, morphological alterations of the megakaryocyte in the bone marrow and the circulating platelets are observed: megakaryocyte nuclei show a staghorn appearance, circulating platelets are characterized by anisocytosis and giant size. Functional studies indicate that these anatomically altered platelets function abnormally. When platelets are analyzed with a platelet function analyzer (PFA-100, which uses cartridges that measure how well a patient's platelets adhere and aggregate to form a platelet plug in the first phase of thrombus formation), in many patients with ET, closure time using collagen/ADP and collagen/epinephrine cartridges is prolonged. This seems paradoxical since these patients do not show an increased bleeding time. These results indicate that either receptors and/or consecutive signaling events are abnormal in ET platelets. Proteomic analysis of platelets of ET patients has revealed individual differences but not yet led to the identification of disease-specific proteins. Moreover, the search for alternative risk factors (factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene polymorphism, etc.) has not provided evidence for the contribution of these factors to the generation of the thrombotic risk in ET patients. In summary, despite intensive research over several decades, relatively little is known about the pathogenesis and risk factors for thrombosis in ET. I expect that this conference will contribute to the development of new strategies to identify patients at risk for hemostatic complications.","['Petrides, Petro E', 'Siegel, Fabian']","['Petrides PE', 'Siegel F']","['Hematology Oncology Center, Munich, Zweibruckenstr.2, 80331 Munich, Germany. petrides@onkologiemuenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Biomarkers/blood', 'Blood Platelets/*metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Size', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/*metabolism/pathology', '*Platelet Aggregation/genetics', 'Platelet Count/instrumentation/methods', 'Risk Factors', '*Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*blood/complications/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Thrombosis/*blood/etiology/genetics/mortality']",2006/03/28 09:00,2006/11/04 09:00,['2006/03/28 09:00'],"['2005/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(06)00026-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2005.12.031 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2006 May-Jun;36(3):379-84. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2005.12.031.

Saturable entry of leukemia inhibitory factor from blood to the central nervous system. J. Neuroimmunol. 106, 172-180]. Since LIF is a cytokine beneficial to spinal cord regeneration, understanding the regulation of its transport across the injured BBB may help in the design of strategies for the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI). In this study, we initially showed that transport of LIF is mediated by its specific receptor LIFRalpha (gp190), using both adult mice and monolayers of mouse brain microvessel endothelial cells. Permeation of radioactively labeled LIF was inhibited not only by excess unlabeled LIF, but also by a blocking antibody to the extracellular domain of gp190 LIFRalpha receptor. This showed that the saturable transport of LIF across the BBB involves LIFRalpha. We then tested the hypothesis that this transport system can be upregulated after SCI. SCI was generated by an established compression method at the upper lumbar level. Transport was studied 1 week after SCI, a time of tissue repair following ischemia and inflammation. Spinal cord uptake of 99mTc-albumin 10 min after intravenous injection was used as an indicator of paracellular permeability of the BBB, its small but significant increase at the injury site indicating the level of persistent BBB disruption. The uptake of 125I-LIF by the injured lumbar spinal cord was significantly greater than that in the uninjured controls as well as that of 99mTc-albumin. Both excess unlabeled LIF and the blocking antibody against LIFRalpha significantly suppressed the increased entry of 125I-LIF without affecting that of 99mTc-albumin. Thus, the increased blood-to-spinal cord permeation of LIF was not solely explained by barrier disruption but involved LIFRalpha. This enhanced transport correlated with increased expression of LIFRalpha shown by immunofluorescent staining and Western blot. Therefore, LIFR at the BBB provides an important target for therapeutic intervention.","['Pan, Weihong', 'Cain, Courtney', 'Yu, Yongmei', 'Kastin, Abba J']","['Pan W', 'Cain C', 'Yu Y', 'Kastin AJ']","['Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70808, USA. weihong.pan@pbrc.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,J Neuroimmunol,Journal of neuroimmunology,8109498,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Iodine Isotopes)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/*physiopathology', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Capillary Permeability/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique/methods', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Iodine Isotopes/pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Protein Transport/physiology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/immunology/*physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Spinal Cord Injuries/*physiopathology', 'Time Factors']",2006/03/28 09:00,2006/07/11 09:00,['2006/03/28 09:00'],"['2005/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/02 00:00 [revised]', '2006/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-5728(06)00046-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jneuroim.2006.02.006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neuroimmunol. 2006 May;174(1-2):119-25. doi: 10.1016/j.jneuroim.2006.02.006.

Additionally, both the lack of mutation status progression in serial analysis (available in nine patients) and the low frequency of patients with high mutated allele burden suggest that LT arising from MMM is probably not dependent on changes in JAK2(V617F) mutation status.","['Mesa, Ruben A', 'Powell, Heather', 'Lasho, Terra', 'Dewald, Gordon', 'McClure, Rebecca', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Mesa RA', 'Powell H', 'Lasho T', 'Dewald G', 'McClure R', 'Tefferi A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, United States. mesa.ruben@mayo.edu <mesa.ruben@mayo.edu>']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Substitution/genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', 'DNA/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/complications/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Survival Rate']",2006/03/28 09:00,2007/10/16 09:00,['2006/03/28 09:00'],"['2006/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/18 00:00 [revised]', '2006/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(06)00045-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2006.01.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2006 Nov;30(11):1457-60. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2006.01.008.

A chimeric HIV-1 carrying a non-homologous matrix (MA) from murine leukemia virus in place of HIV-1 MA can assemble efficiently in murine cells, yet has poor infectivity. Here, we assess the ability of a homologous MA from SIV MAC239 to complement assembly and infection in chimeric viruses designated SHIV(MA). The resulting SHIV(MA) chimeras produce more virus than native HIV-1 when transfected into murine cells. SHIV(MA) exhibits cell-type-specific replication in human T cell lines, replicating well in MT4 cells and poorly in Jurkat cells due to an incompatibility with the HIV-1 Env. The infectivity defects of SHIV(MA) are rescued by pseudotyping with VSV-G but not by truncation of the cytoplasmic tail of Env. Passage of SHIV(MA) in Jurkat cells produces variants with improved Env incorporation and improved replication in Jurkat but not in 3T3 TXC cells. The results indicate that cell-type-specific, or species-specific, host factors interact with MA to modulate the efficiency of assembly and its compatibility with Env. With additional selection, SIV/HIV-1 chimeras may be useful for the development of murine models of lentiviral infection.","['Chen, Ping', 'Hubner, Wolfgang', 'Riviere, Kareen', 'Liu, Yu-Xin', 'Chen, Benjamin K']","['Chen P', 'Hubner W', 'Riviere K', 'Liu YX', 'Chen BK']","['Department of Pharmacology and Biological Chemistry, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp160)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '0 (simian immunodeficiency virus matrix protein p17)']",IM,"['Adaptation, Biological', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Fibroblasts/virology', 'Gene Products, gag/*genetics', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp160/genetics', 'HIV-1/*genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism/physiology', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/*genetics/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism/physiology', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/*genetics', 'Virus Assembly/genetics/*physiology', 'Virus Replication/genetics/*physiology']",2006/03/28 09:00,2006/07/04 09:00,['2006/03/28 09:00'],"['2005/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/26 00:00 [revised]', '2006/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(06)00095-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2006.02.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2006 May 25;349(1):1-12. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2006.02.022.

The drug is a tight inhibitor of adenosine deaminase, a key degradative enzyme of purine metabolism present in all human tissues, with the highest levels found in the lymphoid system. Early clinical trials indicated that this agent was highly active in acute lymphoblastic leukemias with high intracellular adenosine deaminase levels. Relatively high doses of the drug were needed, which was associated with severe adverse events. Through the efforts of a few investigators, better tolerated, low-dose regimens have been shown to be extremely active in lymphoproliferative diseases with very low intracellular adenosine deaminase levels such as hairy cell leukemia, B- and T-cell chronic leukemias, T-cell cutaneous lymphomas and low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Clinical as well as experimental data have indicated that this drug induces lymphocyte-specific cytotoxicity, and myelosuppressive adverse events have been minimal. Although all the purine analogs have shown similar activity, the advantage of pentostatin is the relatively specific cytotoxicity against lymphocytes, which permits treatment even in patients with severe cytopenias. Although no direct comparisons of the purine analogs have been performed, pentostatin may be preferred due to this property.","['Ho, Anthony D', 'Hensel, Manfred']","['Ho AD', 'Hensel M']","['Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg , Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany. anthony_dick.ho@urz.uni-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Future Oncol,"Future oncology (London, England)",101256629,"['0 (Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)']",IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*drug therapy', 'Pentostatin/*therapeutic use', 'Purine Nucleosides/*therapeutic use']",2006/03/28 09:00,2006/05/12 09:00,['2006/03/28 09:00'],"['2006/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2217/14796694.2.2.169 [doi]'],ppublish,Future Oncol. 2006 Apr;2(2):169-83. doi: 10.2217/14796694.2.2.169.,,,,,,,92,,,,,,,,,,,,

Associated chemotherapy and radiotherapy to which these patients are submitted induce secondary effects, with a high metabolic stress. Glutamine is considered a conditionally essential amino acid, and has been shown effective in severe catabolic states. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of parenteral nutrition (PN) therapy supplemented with glutamine on duration of nutritional support in a group of patients with BMT. We have also analyzed associated complications, the nutritional status, the clinical course at 6 months, differences as to type of transplantation, and oral ingestion capability. This is a phase IV, randomized, double blind, and parallel clinical trial, done at a single center. The study was performed on 49 patients, 29% male and 71% female patients, with ages between 21-63 years, distributed in 3 diagnostic groups (leukemia, lymphoma, and solid tumors), and admitted to the Hematology Department of our Hospital. Fifty percent of the patients in each group have received PN supplemented with glutamine (0.4 g/kg/day of L-alanine-L-glutamine), and the other 50% have received standard PN. RESULTS: we have not found significant differences nor at the beginning nor at the end of the study between both groups with regards to studied variables. CONCLUSIONS: PN is and effective therapy for maintenance of the nutritional status in patients submitted to a therapy with a, highly catabolic effect such as BMT.

Subsequent development of ON was treated with a bisphosphonate (pamidronate) for 2 years. Mobility and pain control were assessed regularly with MRI and X-ray of affected areas at 0, 12 and 24 months. RESULTS: Reduction in pain was reported in four of six patients in the first year with increased mobility. Two patients who had radiological evidence of joint destruction prior to treatment and when continued on corticosteroids reported no improvement in pain or mobility. In the second year, patients who started treatment in the first few months after diagnosis were stable while patients who had treatment initiated later deteriorated but had less pain than prior to treatment with pamidronate. MRIs of affected areas were completely unchanged over 2 years. X-rays revealed no new bony collapse in four of six patients after 12 months of treatment. However, three of six patients continued to undergo extensive collapse of femoral heads (one at 12 months, two at 24 months) and all these required urgent hip replacement. CONCLUSION: Pamidronate treatment has a palliative effect in control of pain and may delay the natural history of bony collapse in the acute phase of ON, especially in early treated patients, but does not prevent late bone collapse and joint destruction in corticosteroid treated patients with ALL. Larger studies are needed to provide evidence as to whether bisphosphonate is indicated for treatment of ON for patients using corticosteroids.","['Nguyen, ThiThuyAn', 'Zacharin, Margaret R']","['Nguyen T', 'Zacharin MR']","[""Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Royal Children 's Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Germany,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab,Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,9508900,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Bone Density Conservation Agents)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', 'OYY3447OMC (Pamidronate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Density Conservation Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Diphosphonates/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glucocorticoids/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Osteonecrosis/*chemically induced/complications/*drug therapy', 'Pain/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Pamidronate', 'Range of Motion, Articular/drug effects']",2006/03/28 09:00,2006/05/06 09:00,['2006/03/28 09:00'],"['2006/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1515/jpem.2006.19.2.161 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab. 2006 Feb;19(2):161-7. doi: 10.1515/jpem.2006.19.2.161.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Modern treatment approaches to APL include simultaneous combination of ATRA and anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is a calicheamicin-conjugated monoclonal antibody directed against CD33, a cell surface antigen highly expressed on APL cells. Engagement of CD33 by gemtuzumab results in immunoconjugate internalization and hydrolytic release of calicheamicin, which, in turn, causes irreversible DNA damage and cell death. A number of preliminary reports have highlighted the sensitivity of APL to gemtuzumab given alone or in combination with other agents. Several reasons may account for the efficacy of gemtuzumab in APL, including: (1) CD33 is detectable in virtually 100% of APL cases; (2) calicheamicin belongs to the anthracycline family, a group of chemotherapeutic agents known to be highly effective in APL; and (3) the APL blast cells lack the multidrug resistance glycoprotein 170. Due to the availability of other highly effective agents (ATRA, arsenic trioxide), relatively few APL patients have been treated thus far with gemtuzumab, and their follow-up is still short. However, it is conceivable that the use of this agent in APL will increase in the near future in light of its capability to induce molecular remission even in advanced disease. Furthermore, the use of low doses of gemtuzumab in high-risk patients might be relevant in order to reduce treatment toxicity due to conventional anthracyclines. This review summarizes the mechanism of action and toxicity profile of gemtuzumab as well as the published experience with this compound in patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed APL.","['Lo Coco, Francesco', 'Ammatuna, Emanuele', 'Noguera, Nelida']","['Lo Coco F', 'Ammatuna E', 'Noguera N']","['Department of Biopathology, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy. lo.coco@uniroma2.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Aminoglycosides/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Oxides/therapeutic use']",2006/03/28 09:00,2006/04/29 09:00,['2006/03/28 09:00'],"['2006/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,"Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2006 Jan;4(1):57-62, 76-7.",,,,,,,53,,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND: Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), also known as immune thrombocytopenic purpura, is a hemorrhagic disorder that is primarily immunologic in origin but is sometimes triggered by viral infection in children. It has also been associated with heroin and quinine drug use. A reduced platelet count can result in mucosal or deep tissue bleeding, or both, and most importantly, intracranial bleeding. Because football is a collision sport, it is imperative that any player presenting with ITP-type symptoms be removed immediately from all contact and referred to a physician. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Leukemia, aplastic anemia, drug side effects, vitamin deficiency, kidney failure, infection, multiple contusions. TREATMENT: The traditional first-line treatment consists of corticosteroid medication and time and removal from all physical activities until the blood platelet count is normal and controlled. In quinine-induced ITP, discontinuation of the drug and bedrest are recommended to reduce the risk of major hemorrhage for a 12-to 14-hour period in order to allow the quinine to clear the system and the platelet count to return to normal. UNIQUENESS: ITP's presentation needs to be differentiated from other disorders. Incorrect diagnosis could seriously jeopardize the athlete, who could develop intracranial and internal bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of the signs and symptoms associated with ITP is essential to prevent further participation by the athlete. Immediate intervention is needed to determine the severity and to institute appropriate treatment.","['Leonard, J C', 'Rieger, M']","['Leonard JC', 'Rieger M']","['Carle Sports Medicine, Urbana IL 61801-1015.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Athl Train,Journal of athletic training,9301647,,,,2006/03/25 09:00,2006/03/25 09:01,['2006/03/25 09:00'],"['2006/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/25 09:01 [medline]', '2006/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Athl Train. 1998 Jul;33(3):269-70.,,,,,,PMC1320436,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To demonstrate the value of this assay, the phagocytic and microbicidal activity of leukocytes from healthy subjects and patients against Candida albicans was investigated. Apart from individual cases, no differences in the phagocytic activity between groups of healthy subjects and patients with candida vaginitis or different types of cancer could be found. However, the killing capacity of the leukocytes from women with recurrent candida vaginitis was reduced. The leukocytes of one patient showing a very low killing capacity lacked myeloperoxidase.

Specific dysregulation of these factors can alter the course and pathogenesis of infection. Soluble interleukin-6 receptor (sIL-6R) was shown to circulate at elevated levels in HTLV-I-infected patients, and high expressions of IL-6R and sIL-6R by HTLV-I-infected T cells were clinically and experimentally associated with Tax activity. To examine roles of Tax in expression of the IL-6R gene, the JPX-9 cell line was used, which is derived from Jurkat cell line expressing Tax cDNA. Over-expression of Tax enhanced IL-6R expression but not in Tax mutant JPX-9/M cell line. The clinical relevance of these observations was further demonstrated by ELISA using sera obtained from HTLV-I-infected patients.

One of the late sequelae in STT survivors is the development of a second malignancy. The present study aimed at quantifying risks for second malignancies in patients with STTs, and risks for second STTs after other primary malignancies. Adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), calculated from the Swedish Family-Cancer Database, were used as a measure of risk. Among 6,671 primary STT patients, a total of 650 second malignancies occurred. Besides second STTs, other cancer sites with an increased SIR were the nervous system, endocrine glands, skin (melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma) and prostate; the risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) was also increased. The overall risk of second malignancies decreased in the following order: fibrosarocma (1.63) > myxosarcoma (1.48) > leiomyosarcoma (1.44) > liposarcoma (1.21). An increased risk of second STTs after primary cancers of the bone, ovary, nervous system, cervix, thyroid gland, skin, endometrium, breast, upper aerodigestive tract, and after Hodgkin disease, NHL and leukemia was also noted. This study showed that the incidence of second primary malignancies in patients with STTs was increased, but the SIRs varied among specific cancer sites. Besides therapeutic effects, the associations between STTs and bone and nervous system tumors suggested that cancer syndromes, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and Li-Fraumeni syndrome, may partly explain the excesses. The associations of STTs with cancers of the skin (squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma) and with NHL may be related to immunodeficiency.","['Ji, Jianguang', 'Hemminki, Kari']","['Ji J', 'Hemminki K']","['Department of Bioscience at Novum, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge, Sweden. jianguang.ji@biosci.ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*complications/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/*complications/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",2006/03/25 09:00,2006/08/10 09:00,['2006/03/25 09:00'],"['2006/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.21910 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2006 Aug 15;119(4):909-14. doi: 10.1002/ijc.21910.,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Both therapies use high dose cytotoxic medication for the induction of higher remission rates in malignant diseases. While autologous HSCT rescues hematopoiesis after high dose chemotherapy, in allogeneic HSCT donor immune cells exert an additional allo-reactivity towards recipient tissue and residual malignant cells. Autologous HSCT is mainly used in relapsed malignant high-grade lymphoma. Allogeneic HSCT results in cure from acute leukemia with unfavorable prognosis in a high percentage of patients.

Although both drugs have been in clinical use for a number of years, comparative studies of their selectivity and mode of action are still lacking. Here, we have evaluated the activities of ANA and HC on the growth and differentiation of human haematopoietic progenitor cells in liquid culture. Both drugs inhibited thrombopoietin-induced megakaryocytopoiesis in a dose-dependent manner, but with strikingly different potencies (IC(50)=26 nM for ANA and 30 muM for HC) and modes of action. Whereas HC inhibited cell proliferation, ANA acted primarily on the differentiation process. At doses that abrogated megakaryocytopoiesis, HC also inhibited the expansion of CD34(+) cells stimulated by stem cell factor, interleukin-3 and Flt-3 ligand and also induced apoptosis. Furthermore, HC inhibited erythroid and myelomonocytic cell growth, induced by erythropoietin or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, respectively. In contrast, ANA showed none of these additional effects. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ANA is a potent and selective inhibitor of megakaryocytopoiesis, having no significant activity against haematopoietic progenitor cell expansion or differentiation into other lineages. In contrast, the anti-megakaryocytopoietic activity of HC cannot be dissociated from its more general cytoreductive and cytotoxic actions.","['Hong, Y', 'Wang, G', 'Del Arroyo, A Gutierrez', 'Hernandez, J', 'Skene, C', 'Erusalimsky, J D']","['Hong Y', 'Wang G', 'Del Arroyo AG', 'Hernandez J', 'Skene C', 'Erusalimsky JD']","['The Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'K9X45X0051 (anagrelide)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Lineage/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*pharmacology', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology']",2006/03/25 09:00,2006/10/31 09:00,['2006/03/25 09:00'],"['2006/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404180 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404180 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Jun;20(6):1117-22. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404180.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, CD4(+)FOXP3(+) T cells were also markedly reduced in the CD4(+) population within the peripheral blood of Sezary patients compared to controls as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter, quantitative PCR and functional analyses.

Here, we examined its effects on leukemic cells and found that, at 100 nM or less, it potently induced apoptosis in various leukemic cell lines and primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts. We then attempted to identify its mechanisms of action. Triptolide induced caspase-dependent cell death accompanied by a significant decrease in XIAP levels. Forced XIAP overexpression attenuated triptolide-induced cell death. Triptolide also decreased Mcl-1 but not Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) levels. Bcl-2 overexpression suppressed triptolide-induced apoptosis. Further, triptolide induced loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome C release. Caspase-9 knock-out cells were resistant, while caspase-8-deficient cells were sensitive to triptolide, suggesting criticality of the mitochondrial but not the death receptor pathway for triptolide-induced apoptosis. Triptolide also enhanced cell death induced by other anticancer agents. Collectively, our results demonstrate that triptolide decreases XIAP and potently induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in leukemic cells mediated through the mitochondrial pathway at low nanomolar concentrations. The potent antileukemic activity of triptolide in vitro warrants further investigation of this compound for the treatment of leukemias and other malignancies.","['Carter, Bing Z', 'Mak, Duncan H', 'Schober, Wendy D', 'McQueen, Teresa', 'Harris, David', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Evans, Randall L', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Carter BZ', 'Mak DH', 'Schober WD', 'McQueen T', 'Harris D', 'Estrov Z', 'Evans RL', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '19ALD1S53J (triptolide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/analysis/drug effects', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Epoxy Compounds', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Phenanthrenes/*pharmacology', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/analysis/drug effects/pharmacology']",2006/03/25 09:00,2006/08/23 09:00,['2006/03/25 09:00'],"['2006/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52816-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-09-3898 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jul 15;108(2):630-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-09-3898.

Treatment comprised 10 21-day cycles with IL-2 (16 400 U/kg) plus HDC (0.5 mg); both compounds were administered by subcutaneous injection twice daily. Study arms were balanced for age, sex, previous treatment, leukemic karyotypes, time from CR to inclusion, and frequency of secondary leukemia. Three years after enrollment of the last patient, treatment with HDC/IL-2 was found to improve LFS over control in the study population (CR1 + CR > 1, n = 320; P < .01, log-rank test). For patients in CR1 (n = 261), treatment significantly improved LFS (P = .01) with 3-year LFS estimates of 40% (HDC/IL-2) compared with 26% (control). Side effects were typically mild to moderate.

We show that hypertrophic signals stimulate the expression and transcriptional activity of myocardin, a cardiac and smooth muscle-specific coactivator of serum response factor (SRF). Consistent with a role for myocardin as a transducer of hypertrophic signals, forced expression of myocardin in cardiomyocytes is sufficient to substitute for hypertrophic signals and induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and the fetal cardiac gene program. Conversely, a dominant-negative mutant form of myocardin, which retains the ability to associate with SRF but is defective in transcriptional activation, blocks cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by hypertrophic agonists such as phenylephrine and leukemia inhibitory factor. Myocardin-dependent hypertrophy can also be partially repressed by histone deacetylase 5, a transcriptional repressor of myocardin. These findings identify myocardin as a nuclear effector of hypertrophic signaling pathways that couples stress signals to a transcriptional program for postnatal cardiac growth and remodeling.","['Xing, Weibing', 'Zhang, Tong-Cun', 'Cao, Dongsun', 'Wang, Zhigao', 'Antos, Christopher L', 'Li, Shijie', 'Wang, Yibin', 'Olson, Eric N', 'Wang, Da-Zhi']","['Xing W', 'Zhang TC', 'Cao D', 'Wang Z', 'Antos CL', 'Li S', 'Wang Y', 'Olson EN', 'Wang DZ']","['Carolina Cardiovascular Biology Center, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7126, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Circ Res,Circulation research,0047103,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (myocardin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cardiomegaly/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Heart/physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Muscle Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Myocardium/cytology/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Serum Response Factor/physiology', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/metabolism']",2006/03/25 09:00,2006/06/03 09:00,['2006/03/25 09:00'],"['2006/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['01.RES.0000218781.23144.3e [pii]', '10.1161/01.RES.0000218781.23144.3e [doi]']",ppublish,Circ Res. 2006 Apr 28;98(8):1089-97. doi: 10.1161/01.RES.0000218781.23144.3e.

It is the second cause of primary amenorrhea after gonadal dysgenesis and occurs in approximately 1 in 4500 women. Aetiology of this syndrome remains poorly understood. Frequent association of other malformations with the MRKH syndrome, involving kidneys, skeleton and ears, suggests the involvement of major developmental genes such as those of the HOX family. Indeed mammalian HOX genes are well known for their crucial role during embryogenesis, particularly in axial skeleton, hindbrain and limb development. More recently, their involvement in organogenesis has been demonstrated notably during urogenital differentiation. Although null mutations of HOX genes in animal models do not lead to MRKH-like phenotypes, dominant mutations in their coding sequences or aberrant expression due to mutated regulatory regions could well account for it. Sequence analysis of coding regions of HOX candidate genes and of PBX1, a likely HOX cofactor during Mullerian duct differentiation and kidney morphogenesis, did not reveal any mutation in patients showing various forms of MRKH syndrome. This tends to show that HOX genes are not involved in MRKH syndrome. However it does not exclude that other mechanisms leading to HOX dysfunction may account for the syndrome.","['Burel, Agnes', 'Mouchel, Thomas', 'Odent, Sylvie', 'Tiker, Filiz', 'Knebelmann, Bertrand', 'Pellerin, Isabelle', 'Guerrier, Daniel']","['Burel A', 'Mouchel T', 'Odent S', 'Tiker F', 'Knebelmann B', 'Pellerin I', 'Guerrier D']","['CNRS UMR 6061, Genetique et Developpement, Universite de Rennes 1, Groupe IPD, IFR140 GFAS, Faculte de Medecine, Rennes, France. agnes.burel@univ-rennes1.fr']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Negat Results Biomed,Journal of negative results in biomedicine,101152210,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HOXA7 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA13)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Abnormalities, Multiple/*genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Syndrome', 'Uterus/*abnormalities', 'Vagina/*abnormalities']",2006/03/25 09:00,2006/07/13 09:00,['2006/03/25 09:00'],"['2005/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['1477-5751-5-4 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-5751-5-4 [doi]']",epublish,J Negat Results Biomed. 2006 Mar 23;5:4. doi: 10.1186/1477-5751-5-4.,20060323,,,,,PMC1444933,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article, the authors review the main targeted therapies available in haematology, such as monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase, farnesyltransferase, as well as proteasome inhibitors, antiangiogenesis compounds and antisense oligonuceotides. Finally, the authors focus on the application of imatinib mesylate in chronic myeloid leukaemia as the paradigm of molecular treatment.

The EWS-FLI1 fusion transcript encodes a 68 kDa protein with two primary domains. The EWS domain is a potent transcriptional activator, while the FLI1 domain contains a highly conserved ets DNA binding domain. ESFT presents a clinical challenge, especially in patients with metastatic disease in which dose-intensifying chemotherapy with bone-marrow transplantation does not improve survival. EWS-FLI1 is only present in ESFT cells and does not exist in any normal cell of the body. Experiments using ESFT cell lines or animal xenograft models have proven that EWS-FLI1 is required for tumor survival. Therefore, ESFT contains a unique protein generated by a tumor-specific translocation that has great potential as a molecular target for therapy. However, therapeutic applications directed towards eliminating or inactivating EWS-FLI1 have not reached the clinic. EWS-FLI1 has been a very difficult molecule to directly analyze in vitro due to poor solubility.

On the opposite, there is no close human homolog of the two STLV-2 strains that have been discovered in African bonobos chimpanzees.

Although we discuss chemotherapy trials in acute leukemia, the issues pertain to a much larger class of early-phase clinical trials. Our focus is on the manner in which numerical values of standard and targeted response rates of a statistical design are specified, the number of interim tests that are applied, and the effects of these design features on early stopping probabilities and the treatments that patients actually receive. These points are illustrated by numerical comparisons of alternative designs for a particular phase II trial of a new drug for relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia. We show that statistical designs that target inappropriately low response rates or that apply early stopping rules too infrequently are at odds with good statistical and medical practice and that such designs often provide less benefit to the patients in the trial than would be obtained by simply treating all patients with standard therapy.

A total of 683 samples from blood donors (n = 191) and pregnant women (n = 492) were collected from both sites and screened for the different virus infection markers resulting in the following prevalence values for Nouna or Ouagadougou, respectively: HIV 3.6/4.6, anti-HBV core (anti-HBc) 69.6/76.4, HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)14.3/17.3, HCV 2.2/1.5, HTLV 1.4/0.5, HHV-8 11.5/13.5, dengue virus 26.3/36.5. Individuals aged > or =25 years were more likely to be infected with HIV than those below 24 years (P < 0.05). Infection with HIV increased the likelihood of co-infection with other viruses, such as HHV-8, HBV and HTLV. Co-infection studies involving five viruses (HBV-HBsAg, HHV-8, HIV, HCV, and HTLV) showed that 4.8% (33/683) of the studied population were dually infected, with HBsAg+ HHV-8 (13/33), HBsAg+HIV (8/33) and HIV+HHV-8 (8/33) being the most common co-infections. Of the population studied 0.6% (4/683) was triply infected, the most common infection being with HBV+HIV+HHV-8 (3/4). There was no difference in the prevalence of HIV, anti-HBc, HBsAg, HCV, HTLV, and HHV-8 either among blood donors or pregnant women in urban or rural setting, while dengue virus prevalence was relatively lower in rural (26.3%) than in urban (36.5%) Burkina Faso.","['Collenberg, Ellen', 'Ouedraogo, Thierry', 'Ganame, Jean', 'Fickenscher, Helmut', 'Kynast-Wolf, Gisela', 'Becher, Heiko', 'Kouyate, Bocar', 'Krausslich, Hans-Georg', 'Sangare, Lassana', 'Tebit, Denis M']","['Collenberg E', 'Ouedraogo T', 'Ganame J', 'Fickenscher H', 'Kynast-Wolf G', 'Becher H', 'Kouyate B', 'Krausslich HG', 'Sangare L', 'Tebit DM']","['Abteilung Virologie, Universitaetsklinikum Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (HIV Antibodies)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (Hepatitis C Antibodies)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', '*Blood Donors', 'Burkina Faso/epidemiology', 'Comorbidity', 'Dengue/*epidemiology', 'Dengue Virus/*immunology', 'Female', 'HIV Antibodies/blood', 'HIV Infections/*epidemiology', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/blood', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology', 'Hepatitis C/*epidemiology', 'Hepatitis C Antibodies/blood', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*epidemiology', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*epidemiology', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies']",2006/03/24 09:00,2006/06/09 09:00,['2006/03/24 09:00'],"['2006/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jmv.20593 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Virol. 2006 May;78(5):683-92. doi: 10.1002/jmv.20593.,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, we reported in a previous study that santonin, a eudesmanolide sesquiterpene lactone, exerts no effects on the differentiation of leukemia cells. In this report, to evaluate the possibility of chemically modifying santonin into its derivatives with differentiation inducing activity, we synthesized a series of santonin derivatives, and determined their effects on cellular differentiation in the human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cell system. A diacetoxy acetal derivative of santonin (DAAS) was found to induce significant HL-60 cell differentiation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas santonin in its original form did not. The HL-60 cells were differentiated into a granulocytic lineage when exposed to DAAS. In addition, the observed induction in cell differentiation closely correlated with the levels of NF-kappaB DNA binding activity inhibited by DAAS. Both Western blot analyses and kinase inhibitor studies determined that protein kinase C, ERK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase were upstream components of the DAAS-mediated inhibition of NF-kappaB binding activity in HL-60 leukemia cells. The results of this study indicate that santonin can, indeed, be chemically modified into a derivative with differentiation inducing abilities, and suggest that DAAS might prove useful in the treatment of neoplastic diseases.","['Kim, Seung Hyun', 'Song, Ju Han', 'Choi, Bo Gil', 'Kim, Hyeoung-Joon', 'Kim, Tae Sung']","['Kim SH', 'Song JH', 'Choi BG', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim TS']","['School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 136-701.', 'College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Drug Development, Chonnam National University, Gwangju 500-757.', 'College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Drug Development, Chonnam National University, Gwangju 500-757.', 'Genome Research Center for Hematopoietic Diseases, Chonnam National University Hospital, Gwangju 501-757, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 136-701; Genome Research Center for Hematopoietic Diseases, Chonnam National University Hospital, Gwangju 501-757, Republic of Korea.

Thioflavin T (ThT) has been one of the molecules of choice to attempt the detection of these amyloid deposits. However, it has been reported that ThT was unable to cross blood-brain barrier (BBB). Our aim was to understand the mechanism according to which it has been said that ThT is not able to cross the BBB. For this purpose we have used cellular models overexpressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP1), two proteins overexpressed in BBB. Our results show that: (i) ThT is able to cross membranes and to penetrate inside the cells; (ii) ThT is a P-gp substrate; (iii) ThT is poor MRP1 substrate. In conclusion, our results suggest that two factors could be involved in the low accumulation of ThT in the brain: ThT is a P-gp substrate and its lipophilicity is low.","['Darghal, Nacira', 'Garnier-Suillerot, Arlette', 'Salerno, Milena']","['Darghal N', 'Garnier-Suillerot A', 'Salerno M']","['Laboratoire de Biophysique Moleculaire, Cellulaire et Tissulaire (BioMoCeTi), UMR CNRS 7033, Universite Paris 13 et Paris 6, 74 rue Marcel Cachin, 93017 Bobigny, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '2390-54-7 (thioflavin T)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Benzothiazoles', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', '*Lipid Metabolism', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Static Electricity', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacokinetics']",2006/03/24 09:00,2006/05/17 09:00,['2006/03/24 09:00'],"['2006/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(06)00549-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.03.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2006 May 5;343(2):623-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.03.024.

METHODS: Follicular aspiration, recovering follicular fluid during assisted reproductive treatment, follicular fluid storage and analysis of chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines were carried out. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interleukin-15, leukemia inhibitory factor, epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide 78, regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted, and growth-regulated oncogene-alpha were analyzed in the follicular fluid and compared between women with (n =47) and without endometriosis (n = 279). RESULTS: The above cytokines were detected in the follicular fluid samples. Epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide 78 levels were significantly higher in follicular fluid from endometriosis patients than from controls (p = 0.008). Increases (to twice the control level) were also observed for tumor necrosis factor-alpha and for interleukin-6. CONCLUSIONS: Increased follicular fluid levels of epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide 78, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 indicate that these cytokines may influence oocyte quality and fecundability of women with endometriosis by deteriorating the microenvironment in the human follicle.","['Wunder, Dorothea M', 'Mueller, Michael D', 'Birkhauser, Martin H', 'Bersinger, Nick A']","['Wunder DM', 'Mueller MD', 'Birkhauser MH', 'Bersinger NA']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Berne, Switzerland. dorothea.wunder@insel.ch']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand,Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,0370343,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CXCL5 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL5)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers/*analysis', 'Chemokine CXCL5', 'Chemokines, CXC/*analysis', 'Endometriosis/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Female', 'Fertility', 'Follicular Fluid/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/analysis', 'Oocytes', 'Ovarian Follicle/physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis']",2006/03/24 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2006/03/24 09:00'],"['2006/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/00016340500501715 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand. 2006;85(3):336-42. doi: 10.1080/00016340500501715.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was designed to investigate the efficiency of in vitro generation of dendritic cells from CD14+ acute myelomonocytic (M4) or monocytic (M5) leukemia cells and their ability of stimulating specific antileukemia T-cell response. METHODS: Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) were isolated from 5 M4/M5 leukemia patients with high CD14 expression, and then divided into 3 groups: adherent leukemia cells, nonadherent blasts, and total unfractioned blasts. CD14 expression of the 3 groups was evaluated by flow cytometry (FCM). When cultured with or without granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) for 7-10 days, monocytic leukemia cell-derived dendritic cells (Mo-LDCs) were identified through morphologic observation and immunophenotype analysis using FCM. The immune function of Mo-LDCs was detected through allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (Allo-MLR) and cytotoxicity assay of antileukemia cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The leukemic origin of Mo-LDCs was confirmed by chromosomal karyotype analysis combined with the aberrant expression of myeloid antigens. RESULTS: The amount of CD14+ cells, which could differentiate into CD83+ mature DCs under induction of the cytokine combination, was higher in adherent leukemia cells than in nonadherent blasts and total unfractioned blasts. Regarding each 3 cell groups of the same patient or the unfractioned blasts of various patients, initial CD14 expression was positively related to the yield of CD83+ DCs after induction (r = 0.967, P = 0.007). Mo-LDCs exhibited typical morphology and phenotype as mature DCs, induced potent proliferation of homogeneous T cells in Allo-MLR, stimulated the expansion of leukemia-specific CTLs, and continued to possess the cytogenetic abnormalities of the original leukemia, as well as the aberrant expression of myeloid antigens. CONCLUSIONS: In M4/M5 subtype of AML, CD14+ cells could differentiate into immune-competent Mo-LDCs under the induction of the cytokine combination. CD14 expression level may predict the DCs differentiation ability of monocytic leukemia. Mo-LDCs, which possess the classical phenotype and function of DCs, as well as the abnormal leukemic antigens, may be useful for the immunotherapy of M4/M5 AML.","['Sheng, Li-Xia', 'Xie, Xiao-Bao', 'Qiu, Guo-Qiang', 'Gu, Wei-Ying', 'Wang, Zhi-Lin', 'Wu, Hao-Qing']","['Sheng LX', 'Xie XB', 'Qiu GQ', 'Gu WY', 'Wang ZL', 'Wu HQ']","['Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Changzhou, Jiangsu, 213000, PR China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD83 antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/*analysis', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",2006/03/24 09:00,2007/07/14 09:00,['2006/03/24 09:00'],"['2006/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2005 Nov;24(11):1338-44.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated in T-ALL cell line, CCRF-CEM, the in vitro cytotoxic effect and the mechanism of action of baicalin, a compound extracted from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi and S. rivularis Benth (Labiateae). Results demonstrated that baicalin displayed a remarkable cytotoxic effect in CCRF-CEM, with an IC(50) value of 10.6 microg/ml. It triggered apoptotic effect by fragmentizing cellular DNA and arrested the cell cycle at G(0)/G(1) phase. Baicalin (37.5 microg/ml) had not effected the expression of p53 and Fas protein. It was shown to decline the expression of Bcl-2 (22.0 pg/ml), which consequently caused the loss (52.7%) of transmembrane potential (Delta Psi m) in the mitochondria after 72 hours of treatment. Baicalin (37.5 microg/ml) also elevated the amount of cytosolic cytochrome c (19.2 microg/ml), which finally triggered the activation of caspase-3 (50.1 pmol/min). In conclusion, baicalin was found to induce apoptosis in T-ALL cell lines through multiple pathways. This finding encourages further investigation of baicalin in its role as a potential candidate for chemotherapeutic agents in T-ALL.","['Shieh, Den-En', 'Cheng, Hua-Yew', 'Yen, Ming-Hong', 'Chiang, Lien-Chai', 'Lin, Chun-Ching']","['Shieh DE', 'Cheng HY', 'Yen MH', 'Chiang LC', 'Lin CC']","['Tajen Institute of Technology, Ping-Tung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Singapore,Am J Chin Med,The American journal of Chinese medicine,7901431,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '347Q89U4M5 (baicalin)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*pathology', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",2006/03/23 09:00,2006/09/28 09:00,['2006/03/23 09:00'],"['2006/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0192415X06003801 [pii]', '10.1142/S0192415X06003801 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Chin Med. 2006;34(2):245-61. doi: 10.1142/S0192415X06003801.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The telomerase activity of HL-60 cells was examined by the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP)--an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Apoptosis was analyzed by morphological observation, DNA agarose gel electrophoresis, flow cytometry (FCM), and TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL). After treatment with HHT at 5-500 microg/l for 48 hours, the level of telomerase activity in HL-60 cells decreased in a dose-and time-dependent manner.

We evaluated the brains of patients previously treated for ALL with cranial irradiation and intrathecal MTX with MR imaging and tested the hypothesis that these patients have more MR evidence of central nervous system (CNS) injury than control patients who are in complete remission following systemic chemotherapy without cranial irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: ALL patients recruited from a pediatric cancer center data base were examined at 1.5T by using T1-weighted, T2-weighted, gradient echo (GE), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences. Patients treated in childhood for solid extracranial neoplasms were used as controls. RESULTS: Lesions consistent with old hemorrhage were detected in 23 (55%) of the ALL patients and in none of the control patients (P <.001). Of the 62 hemorrhages detected on the GE images, only 9 (15%) were shown on T2-weighted images. White matter abnormalities were found in 2 ALL patients (5%) and one control patient (5%). Old infarcts were seen in 2 ALL patients (10%). CONCLUSION: Cerebral hemorrhages related to radiation-induced vascular malformations, most of which are asymptomatic, are much more common in survivors of childhood ALL than previously thought.

We found that TPO correlated strongly in a continuous manner with overall survival in both previously treated and untreated patients. The univariate Cox proportional hazard model demonstrated that high TPO levels were associated with shorter survival (P < .001), and multiple variable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis demonstrated that this was independent of the IgV(H) mutation status, beta2-M, and Rai stage. Recursive partitioning showed that a cutoff point of 639 pg/mL separated the CLL patients into 2 major survival groups (P < .001).

Mixed lymphoid/myeloid hyperplasia and hematologic malignancies (most frequently B-cell lymphomas) developed in Mll-AF4 mice after prolonged latency; long latency to malignancy indicates that Mll-AF4-induced lymphoid/myeloid deregulation alone is insufficient to produce malignancy. In contrast, young Mll-AF9 mice had predominately myeloid deregulation in vivo and in vitro and developed myeloid malignancies. The early onset of distinct mixed lymphoid/myeloid lineage deregulation in Mll-AF4 mice shows evidence for both ""instructive"" and ""noninstructive"" roles for AF4 and AF9 as partners in MLL fusion genes.

According to published criteria, refractoriness was defined by primary induction failure (PIF; n = 37), early (n = 53), refractory (n = 8), or second (n = 5) relapse. Chemotherapy consisted of fludarabine (4 x 30 mg/m(2)), cytarabine (4 x 2 g/m(2)), and amsacrine (4 x 100 mg/m(2)), followed 4 days later by RIC, comprising 4 Gy total body irradiation (TBI), cyclophosphamide, and antithymocyte globulin. Patients without graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) at day +120 received pDLT in escalating doses. Patients' median age was 51.8 years. Before conditioning, 99 patients had active disease, 3 were aplastic, 1 was in second complete remission (CR2). Forty-one patients had family donors, 62 had unrelated donors. With a 25-month median follow-up, overall survival (OS) at 1, 2, and 4 years was 54%, 40%, and 32%; the respective leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 47%, 37%, and 30%. Patients with PIF showed a 2-year OS of 62.5%. OS was 87% in 17 patients receiving pDLT. One-year cumulative incidence of leukemic death and non-relapse-mortality was 28.7% and 17.2%. In a multivariate analysis, more than 2 courses of prior chemotherapy were the strongest predictor for poor outcome (P = .007; HR = 3.01 [OS]; P = .002; HR = 3.25 [LFS]).

Study end points were complete response (CR), overall response, minimal residual disease (MRD), progression-free survival, overall survival, and toxicity. From January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2003, 508 patients from 15 hematology departments were randomized. Compared with 2-CdA, CMC induced higher CR rate (36% vs 21%, P = .004), and a trend for higher CR rate with CC was observed (29% vs 21%, P = .08). Furthermore, the percentage of patients who were in CR and were MRD negative was higher in CMC compared with 2-CdA (23% vs 14%, P = .042). There were no differences in overall response, progression-free survival, and overall survival among treatment groups. Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred more frequently in CC (32%) and CMC (38%) than in 2-CdA (20%) (P = .01 and P = .004, respectively). Infections were more frequent in CMC compared with 2-CdA (40% vs 27%, P = .02). In conclusion, CMC used in first-line treatment of CLL results in a higher CR rate and suppresses MRD more efficiently than 2-CdA monotherapy, although associates with increased toxicity.

Because the nuclear transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) has been shown to suppress apoptosis and promote proliferation and is linked with inflammation and differentiation, we postulated that CDDO-Me modulates NF-kappaB activity and NF-kappaB-regulated gene expression. Using human leukemia cell lines and patient samples, we show that CDDO-Me potently inhibits both constitutive and inducible NF-kappaB activated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1beta, phorbol ester, okadaic acid, hydrogen peroxide, lipopolysaccharide, and cigarette smoke. CDDO-Me was more potent than CDDO and its imidazole derivative. NF-kappaB suppression occurred through inhibition of IkappaBalpha kinase activation, IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, IkappaBalpha degradation, p65 phosphorylation, p65 nuclear translocation, and NF-kappaB-mediated reporter gene transcription. This inhibition correlated with suppression of NF-kappaB-dependent genes involved in antiapoptosis (IAP2, cFLIP, TRAF1, survivin, and bcl-2), proliferation (cyclin d1 and c-myc), and angiogenesis (VEGF, cox-2, and mmp-9). CDDO-Me also potentiated the cytotoxic effects of TNF and chemotherapeutic agents. Overall, our results suggest that CDDO-Me inhibits NF-kappaB through inhibition of IkappaBalpha kinase, leading to the suppression of expression of NF-kappaB-regulated gene products and enhancement of apoptosis induced by TNF and chemotherapeutic agents.","['Shishodia, Shishir', 'Sethi, Gautam', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Aggarwal, Bharat B']","['Shishodia S', 'Sethi G', 'Konopleva M', 'Andreeff M', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (1-(2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oyl) imidazole)', '0 (2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-dien-28-oic acid)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factors)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'CEG1Q6OGU1 (bardoxolone methyl)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/genetics/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Oleanolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Death Domain Protein/metabolism', 'Triterpenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2006/03/23 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/03/23 09:00'],"['2006/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/6/1828 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-2044 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Mar 15;12(6):1828-38. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-2044.,,,,,"['CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA91844/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA89346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: IgG+ CLL cells were characterized using phenotypic, functional, and immunogenetic analyses. RESULTS: IgG+ CLL was phenotypically similar to mutated IgM+IgD+ CLL (M-CLL) and variably expressed CD38 (4 of 14). ZAP-70, a tyrosine kinase preferentially expressed in unmutated CLL, was found in only 2 of 14 cases. The ability to signal via surface IgM (sIgM) varies between the main subsets of CLL and is associated with expression of ZAP-70. In IgG(+) CLL, 9 of 14 responded to engagement of sIgG with no apparent requirement for expression of CD38 or ZAP-70. However, signal capacity correlated with intensity of sIgG expression. Most switched immunoglobulin variable region genes were somatically mutated without intraclonal variation, and no case expressed activation-induced cytidine deaminase. Derivation from a postgerminal center B cell is, therefore, likely, and a relationship with M-CLL is suggested. This is supported by a shared biased usage of the V4-34 gene. Similar bias in normal B cells developed with age, providing an expanded population for transforming events. However, conserved sequences detected in the CDR3 of V4-34-encoded gamma chains were not found M-CLL, indicating no direct path of isotype switch from M-CLL. CONCLUSION: IgG+ CLL is likely to arise from an age-related expanded pool of B cells, on a path parallel to M-CLL, and perhaps with a similar clinical course.","['Potter, Kathleen N', 'Mockridge, C Ian', 'Neville, Louise', 'Wheatley, Isla', 'Schenk, Michael', 'Orchard, Jennifer', 'Duncombe, Andrew S', 'Packham, Graham', 'Stevenson, Freda K']","['Potter KN', 'Mockridge CI', 'Neville L', 'Wheatley I', 'Schenk M', 'Orchard J', 'Duncombe AS', 'Packham G', 'Stevenson FK']","['Molecular Immunology Group, Tenovus Research Laboratory, Cancer Sciences Division, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK. kp1@soton.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/immunology', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/genetics/*immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/immunology']",2006/03/23 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/03/23 09:00'],"['2006/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/6/1672 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-2164 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Mar 15;12(6):1672-9. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-2164.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently reported that human monocyte-derived macrophages capture viable and apoptotic human leukocytes through homophilic interactions involving CD31 and that CD31 then promotes the engulfment of apoptotic cells or the detachment of viable cells. We now report that CD31 homophilic interactions between phagocyte and target cells lead to activation of phagocyte alpha5beta1 integrin and the engulfment of apoptotic Jurkat T lymphocytes via a fibronectin (Fn) ""bridge."" Although Fn and serum served as an opsonin for beta1 integrin-dependent phagocytosis of apoptotic leukemic T cells, they failed to do so for neutrophils. Given the complexities and inherent variability of working with primary cells, we have refined our model to show that ligation of CD31 on THP-1 macrophages also regulates beta1 integrin-dependent phagocytosis of Fn-coated Latex beads. Thus, selective ""tethering"" of apoptotic leukocytes by phagocyte CD31 not only discriminates dying from viable cells but also selectively activates phagocyte integrins for the engulfment of apoptotic cells.","['Vernon-Wilson, Elizabeth F', 'Aurade, Frederic', 'Brown, Simon B']","['Vernon-Wilson EF', 'Aurade F', 'Brown SB']","[""MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, C2.05 Queen's Medical Research Institute, Little France Crescent, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin alpha5beta1)', '0 (Opsonin Proteins)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Proteolipids)', '0 (proteoliposomes)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Fibronectins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha5beta1/*physiology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages/*physiology', 'Microspheres', 'Neutrophils/physiology', 'Opsonin Proteins', 'Phagocytosis/*physiology', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/immunology/*physiology', 'Proteolipids/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology']",2006/03/23 09:00,2006/08/11 09:00,['2006/03/23 09:00'],"['2006/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.1005571 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.1005571 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2006 Jun;79(6):1260-7. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1005571.

However, little information is available regarding the metabolic pathway of free 8-oxo-dG. In this study, we generated radiolabeled 8-oxo-dG to track its metabolic fate. We report that 8-oxo-dG is neither phosphorylated to 8-oxo-dGMP nor degraded to the free base, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxo-Gua), indicating that 8-oxo-dG is not a substrate for nucleotide synthesis. This result was confirmed by the finding that no radioactivity was detected in the DNA of U937 cells after incubating the cells with radiolabeled 8-oxo-dG. These observations indicate that 8-oxo-dG produced by oxidative stress is not reutilized for DNA synthesis.","['Kim, Ja-Eun', 'Chung, Myung-Hee']","['Kim JE', 'Chung MH']","['Seoul National University College of Medicine, Department of Pharmacology, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Free Radic Res,Free radical research,9423872,"['5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '6957-76-2 (8-oxo-7,8-dihydrodeoxyguanine)', ""88847-89-6 (8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine)"", '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine/analogs & derivatives"", 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA Replication/physiology', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Oxidative Stress/physiology']",2006/03/23 09:00,2006/06/10 09:00,['2006/03/23 09:00'],"['2006/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['R68332N184407XJ2 [pii]', '10.1080/10715760600570539 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Res. 2006 May;40(5):461-6. doi: 10.1080/10715760600570539.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether they also have an increased risk for other cancer sites remains under discussion. The aim of this study was to examine the leukemia risk among miners. METHODS: An individually matched case-control study of former uranium miners in East Germany was conducted with 377 cases and 980 controls. RESULTS: Using conditional logistic regression models, a dose-response relationship between leukemia risk and radon progeny could not be confirmed. Yet, a significantly elevated risk is seen in the category > or = 400 mSv when combining gamma-radiation and long-lived radionuclides. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that an elevated risk for leukemia is restricted to employees with a very long occupational career in underground uranium mining or uranium processing. Moreover, the study does not support the hypothesis of an association between exposure to short-lived radon progeny and leukemia risk.","['Mohner, Matthias', 'Lindtner, Manfred', 'Otten, Heinz', 'Gille, Hans-G']","['Mohner M', 'Lindtner M', 'Otten H', 'Gille HG']","['Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (BAuA), Berlin, Germany.

PROCEDURE: We evaluated the frequency and prognostic significance of EMI at diagnosis of AML in children. RESULTS: Of 240 cases of de novo AML excluding children with Down syndrome and acute promyelocytic leukemia, 56 (23.3%) showed EMI at diagnosis. Patients with EMI had a higher initial WBC count and a higher proportion of M4/M5 morphological variants. The complete remission rate following induction chemotherapy was lower in patients with EMI. However, the overall survival and event-free survival did not differ between patients with and without EMI. A detailed analysis showed that patients with EMI with a WBC count at diagnosis of over 100 x 10(9)/L or infiltration into the central nervous system are likely to have a poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: CNS leukemia and EMI together with a WBC count of >100 x 10(9)/L at diagnosis of AML are high risk factors for relapse, and alternative treatment approaches for patients with these characteristics should be explored.","['Kobayashi, Ryoji', 'Tawa, Akio', 'Hanada, Ryoji', 'Horibe, Keizo', 'Tsuchida, Masahiro', 'Tsukimoto, Ichiro']","['Kobayashi R', 'Tawa A', 'Hanada R', 'Horibe K', 'Tsuchida M', 'Tsukimoto I']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan. r-koba@med.hokudai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone and Bones/pathology', 'Central Nervous System/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gingiva/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/administration & dosage', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Orbit/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/drug therapy/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Skin/pathology', 'Testis/pathology']",2006/03/22 09:00,2007/04/28 09:00,['2006/03/22 09:00'],"['2006/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20824 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Apr;48(4):393-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20824.,,['Japanese childhood AML cooperative study group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nine patients in 4 years had the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and lymphoma, including 2 with Hodgkin disease, 1 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and 3 each with low-grade follicular and intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In SEER data, the observed/expected (O/E) ratio of NHL and RCC is 1.86 to 2.07. In our series, 2 patients were diagnosed with NHL after the diagnosis of RCC, 1 was diagnosed concurrently, and in the other 6, lymphoma preceded diagnosis of RCC. In reviews of second malignancies following treatment of Hodgkin disease, RCC is less common (O/E 1.5, with 1/3 being transitional cell carcinoma and 2/3 being adenocarcinoma). We report 2 cases with Hodgkin disease preceding RCC, and in both, Hodgkin disease occurred as an adult. There is a male predominance for patients with both diagnoses, which is greater than the male predominance for either RCC or NHL alone (2.2 vs. 2.0 vs. 1.2). There is an increased likelihood of the lymphoma being extranodal. There is an increased association of RCC and NHL more often among male patients, and often with extranodal lymphoma. Potential common etiological factors include prior treatment for malignancy, genetic predisposition, environmental factors, including a search for viral sequences, and possible immune dysregulation generating the lymphoma and subsequently leading to solid tumors such as RCC or melanoma.","['Kunthur, Anuradha', 'Wiernik, Peter H', 'Dutcher, Janice P']","['Kunthur A', 'Wiernik PH', 'Dutcher JP']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center, New York Medical College, Bronx, New York 10466, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Sex Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/03/22 09:00,2006/05/23 09:00,['2006/03/22 09:00'],"['2006/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.20533 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2006 Apr;81(4):271-80. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20533.,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, the antitumor activity of celecoxib in hematopoietic tumors, especially in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), has not been well established. This study was designed to investigate the effect of celecoxib on growth and apoptosis in a human CML cell line (K562 cells) or in primary CML cells, and to examine the synergistic actions of celecoxib and hydroxyurea or imatinib on K562 cell proliferation and apoptosis. Celecoxib significantly inhibited the growth of both K562 and primary CML cells and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion. The IC50 of celecoxib was 46 microM for inhibition of K562 cell proliferation. The effect of celecoxib on growth inhibition was accompanied by the downregulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin E and p-Rb expression, the upregulation of P16(INK4a) and P27KIP expression, and a G1-S phase arrest of the cell cycle. The pro-apoptotic effect of celecoxib was determined to be mediated by caspase-3 activation. When K562 cells were pretreated with DEVD-fmk, a specific inhibitor of caspases, the apoptotic activity of celecoxib was, in part, abrogated. Importantly, we demonstrated for the first time that K562 cells were Cox-2-positive both at the mRNA and protein levels. We noted the following observations: (i) we detected Cox-2 mRNA in K562 cells by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and protein expression by western blot analysis; (ii) Cox-2 expression in K562 cells was stimulated by IL-1beta, a specific inducing agent of Cox-2 expression; (iii) primary CML cells from CML patient bone marrow also exhibited Cox-2 protein expression. Furthermore, Cox-2 expression was downregulated at higher doses of celecoxib (80-160 microM), suggesting a Cox-2-dependent mechanism was involved in the drug's effects of growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis. In addition, a synergistic effect was observed when cells were exposed to low-dose celecoxib (40 microM) and hydroxyurea (10 mM) or a combination of celecoxib (40 microM) and imatinib (0.2 microM). These findings provide the basis for uncovering the mechanism of celecoxib's antitumor effects and developing a new therapeutic strategy for treating CML.","['Zhang, Guang-Sen', 'Liu, Ding-Sheng', 'Dai, Chong-Wen', 'Li, Rui-Juan']","['Zhang GS', 'Liu DS', 'Dai CW', 'Li RJ']","['Division of Hematology, Institute of Molecular Hematology, The Second Xiang Ya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha City, Hunan, PR China. zgsllzy@public.cs.hn.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'JCX84Q7J1L (Celecoxib)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells/enzymology/pathology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Celecoxib', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Cyclin E/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/biosynthesis', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2006/03/22 09:00,2006/05/23 09:00,['2006/03/22 09:00'],"['2006/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.20542 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2006 Apr;81(4):242-55. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20542.,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied the expression of the beta2-integrin Mac-1 (CD11b) on mononuclear cells in 48 patients with AML at first diagnosis by flow cytometry using a direct fluorescein-conjugated antibody. A case was defined as positive if more than 20% of the cells expressed Mac-1. Within the FAB types, we observed a high expression rate in cases with M5 (100% MAC-1+ cases, 73% MAC-1+ cells), M4 (75% MAC-1+ cases, 48% MAC-1+ cells) and in cases with FAB-M1 with 71% MAC-1+ cases and 29% MAC-1+ cells. Separating our patients' cohort in cytogenetic risk groups, we could detect significant higher proportions of MAC-1+, cases (88% vs. 27%, P = 0.005) and cells (51% vs. 16%, P = 0.015) with poor cytogenetic risk compared to the favorable risk group. For clinical evaluations only patients treated according to the protocols of the German AML Cooperative Group (AML-CG) were included (n = 29, cases with AML-M3 were excluded). More MAC-1+ cases and cells were found in the ""non-responders"" group (n = 8) compared to the ""responders"" group (n = 24). We can conclude that AML cases with high MAC-1 expression are characterized by a worse prognosis.

Interestingly, the del(16q) was also detected in the patient's uncultured cells, as demonstrated by FISH, excluding an in vitro origin of the del(16q) during culture. The bone marrow was hypocellular with decreased neutrophils and their precursors. Absolute neutrophil counts ranged from (0.62 to 1.24) x 10(9)/L with a median value of 1.02 x 10(9)/L. The patient had a more severe neutropenia than her mother, which correlated with the presence of more cells with del(16q) in the marrow. The patient's mother, who was also diagnosed with neutropenia, revealed only a few cells with the rare fra(16)(q22) in her peripheral blood cells, whereas her bone marrow showed cells with both fra(16)(q22) and del(16)(q22), although the del(16q) was present in only 2/20 cells. Some possible candidate genes contributing to the pathogenesis of the neutropenia are discussed. Chromosome abnormalities involving the 16q22 breakpoint have been observed in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this patient, the del(16)(q22) risk factor is unknown for subsequent development of MDS or AML. Another point to consider is the need to determine the origin of a chromosome abnormality, particularly when the clinical picture does not fit the chromosome findings. Although, the observation of a constitutional structural abnormality in a mosaic form is an extremely rare event, it is somewhat different in the case of a fragile site expression, which can, as in this case, be present in some cells and not in others.","['Glasser, Lewis', 'Meloni-Ehrig, Aurelia', 'Joseph, Plakyil', 'Mendiola, Jennifer']","['Glasser L', 'Meloni-Ehrig A', 'Joseph P', 'Mendiola J']","['Department of Pathology, Rhode Island Hospital/Brown Medical School, Providence, Rhode Island 02903, USA.

To elucidate the role of HDAC in this process, we have generated HDAC1-RARalpha fusion proteins and tested their activity and oncogenicity in vitro and in vivo in transgenic mice (TM). In parallel, we studied the in vivo leukemogenic potential of dominant negative (DN) and truncated RARalpha mutants, as well as that of PML-RARalpha mutants that are insensitive to retinoic acid. Surprisingly, although HDAC1-RARalpha did act as a bona fide DN RARalpha mutant in cellular in vitro and in cell culture, this fusion protein, as well as other DN RARalpha mutants, did not cause a block in myeloid differentiation in vivo in TM and were not leukemogenic. Comparative analysis of these TM and of TM/PML(-/-) and p53(-/-) compound mutants lends support to a model by which the RARalpha and PML blockade is necessary, but not sufficient, for leukemogenesis and the PML domain of the fusion protein provides unique functions that are required for leukemia initiation.","['Matsushita, Hiromichi', 'Scaglioni, Pier Paolo', 'Bhaumik, Mantu', 'Rego, Eduardo M', 'Cai, Lu Fan', 'Majid, Samia M', 'Miyachi, Hayato', 'Kakizuka, Akira', 'Miller, Wilson H Jr', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo']","['Matsushita H', 'Scaglioni PP', 'Bhaumik M', 'Rego EM', 'Cai LF', 'Majid SM', 'Miyachi H', 'Kakizuka A', 'Miller WH Jr', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Department of Pathology, Weill Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Cornell University, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology/*etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology']",2006/03/22 09:00,2006/05/31 09:00,['2006/03/22 09:00'],"['2006/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['jem.20050616 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20050616 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2006 Apr 17;203(4):821-8. doi: 10.1084/jem.20050616.

Their unique ability to self-renew while generating differentiated daughter cells permits HSCs to sustain blood cell production throughout life. In mammals, the pool of HSCs shifts from early sites in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region and the placenta to the fetal liver and ultimately bone marrow. During the past decade, a map of transcriptional activators and repressors that regulate gene expression in HSCs, their precursors and their progeny, at distinct stages of development has been drafted. These factors control a program that first establishes the pool of HSCs in the fetus, and later guides decisions between quiescence, self-renewal, and lineage commitment with progressive differentiation to maintain homeostasis. Continuing studies of the regulatory mechanisms that control HSC gene expression followed by the identification of specific loci that are activated or silenced during the life of an HSC will help to further elucidate longstanding issues in HSC decisions to self-renew or to differentiate, and to define the origins of and connections between distinct HSC pools and their precursors.","['Teitell, Michael A', 'Mikkola, Hanna K A']","['Teitell MA', 'Mikkola HK']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California at Los Angeles, 90095, USA. mteitell@ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,"['0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Repressor Proteins/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology']",2006/03/22 09:00,2006/06/14 09:00,['2006/03/22 09:00'],"['2006/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['59/4_Part_2/33R [pii]', '10.1203/01.pdr.0000205155.26315.c7 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Res. 2006 Apr;59(4 Pt 2):33R-9R. doi: 10.1203/01.pdr.0000205155.26315.c7.,,,,,"['CA107300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK069659/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM073981/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,63,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Drosophila melanogaster developmental gene g1 encodes a variant zinc-finger-motif protein. Gene 125, 205-209]. In mouse, the m-Goliath mRNA level was shown to be increased in growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis of myeloid cells [Baker, S.J., Reddy, E.P., 2000. Cloning of murine G1RP, a novel gene related to Drosophila melanogaster g1. Gene 248, 33-40]. Due to its putative function of transcription factor in apoptosis, we cloned the human cDNA for h-Goliath and characterized the expression of the protein in blood and bone marrow cells. The human protein of 419 aa (44 kDa) contains a protease-associated domain, a transmembrane domain and a RING-H2 motif. This structure classifies h-Goliath as a new member of a human family of ubiquitin ligases with GRAIL (gene related to anergy in lymphocytes) as founder. This E3 ligase controls the development of T cell clonal anergy by ubiquitination [Anandasabapathy, N., Ford, G.S., Bloom, D., Holness, C., Paragas, V., Seroogy, C., Skrenta, H., Hollenhorst, M., Fathman, C.G., Soares, L., 2003. GRAIL: an E3 ubiquitin ligase that inhibits cytokine gene transcription is expressed in anergic CD4+ T cells. Immunity 18, 535-547]. In vitro ubiquitination studies support the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of h-Goliath. In human, the protein is expressed under 3 isoforms, a major one at 28 kDa and two others at 46 and 55 kDa. These proteins come from a common precursor (44 kDa) as we observed using in vitro transcription-translation. Using immunohistochemistry on blood or bone marrow smears, of healthy or leukemia samples, we found that the protein expression was restricted to the cytoplasm of progenitors and fully differentiated leukocyte populations. We did not observe any modification of h-Goliath expression or localization in leukemia. In these cells, this new E3 ubiquitin ligase protein does not seem associated with a differentiation state of the cell or with apoptosis.","['Guais, Adeline', 'Siegrist, Sylvie', 'Solhonne, Brigitte', 'Jouault, Helene', 'Guellaen, Georges', 'Bulle, Frederique']","['Guais A', 'Siegrist S', 'Solhonne B', 'Jouault H', 'Guellaen G', 'Bulle F']","['INSERM U581, Hopital H.

High-dose chemoradiation conditioning regimens have been associated with a significant incidence of organ toxicity and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Recent efforts to diminish the acute transplant-associated toxicities have focused on the development of relatively nontoxic, nonmyeloablative, or less myeloablative conditioning regimens, with the emphasis being predominantly on induction of immunosuppression to enable engraftment. Without ablative chemotherapy, disease control in these regimens is largely relegated to the graft-versus-leukemia/lymphoma (GVL) effect. While the evolution these regimens has resulted in successful engraftment of allogeneic stem cells with minimal toxicity, acute and chronic GVHD occurs in 20% to 50% of patients and remains a major cause of transplant-associated morbidity. Strategies to lower the incidence of acute GVHD have primarily focused on more precise molecular donor/recipient matching, alternative stem cell sources, and T-cell depletion of the graft. While successful in lowering the frequency and severity of GVHD, T-cell-depleted grafts have been associated with compromised the graft-versus-disease effect. Recent studies have suggested that, in addition to T-effector cells within the graft, donor and host dendritic cells may play a role in GVHD. Purine analogues have been evaluated as part of these regimens. While fludarabine and cladribine have been shown to be effective, these agents have been associated with an increased incidence of serious infection and severe acute GVHD. Pentostatin has a different mechanism of action and was also investigated as part of these preparative regimens. Regimens using pentostatin/extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP)/total body irradiation (TBI) have been shown to be well tolerated and associated with early full donor engraftment with a predominance of donor dendritic cell (DC)2 cells and a low incidence of acute GVHD.

Methylation of lysine residues on histone tails is an epigenetic mark that influences chromatin repression when specifically imparted on lysines 9 and 27 of histone H3, and on lysine 20 of H4. Histone lysines can be mono-, di-, and trimethylated, and all three modification states have been identified in different nuclear domains. Correlation of these methylated histone states to different stages of cell differentiation, however, is not extensive. Mammalian spermatogenesis is a developmental process ideal for studying the epigenetic control of differentiation. Maintenance of spermatogonial stem cells requires the transcriptional repressor Plzf, but a role for histone methylation has not been established. Here we show that Plzf-expressing spermatogonia completely lack monomethyl-H3-K27 and monomethyl-H4-K20, and contain very little monomethyl-H3-K9. Dimethylated H3-K27 and H4-K20 are detected as punctate foci in Plzf-positive cells, but dimethyl-H3-K9 is absent. Trimethylated H3-K9 and H4-K20 exhibit a unique perinuclear distribution that coincides with Plzf expression, localizing to punctate foci in more differentiated spermatogonia. Loss of Plzf correlates with increased punctate distribution of trimethylated H3-K9 and H4-K20 at the expense of perinuclear localization. These data signify the possible importance of different histone lysine methylation states in the epigenetic control of spermatogenesis.","['Payne, Christopher', 'Braun, Robert E']","['Payne C', 'Braun RE']","['Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington School of Medicine, Box 357730, 1705 N.E.

We performed a thorax CT scan that showed lymph nodes enlargement and subsequently by presence of abdominal pain was performed an abdominal and pelvis CT scan that showed a right kidney tumor of 4 x 5 cms besides of abdominal lymph nodes enlargement. A radical right nephrectomy was designed and Hodgkin's lymphoma was diagnosed in the abdominal lymph nodes while renal cell tumor exhibited a renal cell cancer.

However, it is likely that patients with CML will require prolonged and perhaps life-long therapy. In general, the side-effects of imatinib therapy have been mild to moderate, with the large majority of patients tolerating prolonged periods of therapy. However, a minority of patients are completely intolerant of therapy, while others are able to remain on therapy despite significant side-effects. Here, we describe a novel form of fluid retention presenting as multiple joint effusions in a patient with advanced phase CML on high-dose imatinib, as well as successful measures that were undertaken to control this adverse event. Although fluid retention, including periorbital oedema, pleural and pericardial effusions, as well as life-threatening cerebral oedema have been previously described and attributed to imatinib, this is the first case of imatinib-associated polyarticular effusions that we are aware of. Further work will be required to confirm a casual relationship between imatinib therapy and this novel side-effect, as well as to determine the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.","['Moore, James C', 'Dennehey, Carolyn F', 'Anavim, Arash', 'Kong, Kevin M', 'Tiong Ong, S']","['Moore JC', 'Dennehey CF', 'Anavim A', 'Kong KM', 'Tiong Ong S']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, College of Medicine, University of California at Irvine, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Benzamides', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Edema/*chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hip Joint/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Joint Diseases/*chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Knee Joint/*pathology/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Piperazines/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/03/22 09:00,2006/06/15 09:00,['2006/03/22 09:00'],"['2006/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH649 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00649.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2006 May;76(5):444-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00649.x.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have characterized two pediatric t(12;14)-positive T-ALLs using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), cDNA microarray, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: FISH revealed breakpoints (BPs) in the T-cell receptor alpha/delta locus (14q11) and in the vicinity of the CCND2 gene at 12p13. To investigate the expression of genes in 12p13, cDNA microarray analysis was performed. Expression data for eight genes, including CCND2, surrounding the 12p BP were compared with those in other T-ALLs. The t(12;14)-positive T-ALL displayed an increased expression of CCND2 compared to the controls, whereas the expression of the other genes was similar in all T-ALLs. Expression of CCND2 and two additional genes (PARP11 and FGF23), close to the 12p BP, was investigated with real-time PCR of the two t(12;14)-positive cases and four controls. Neither PARP11 nor FGF23 displayed expression differences among the T-ALLs, whereas CCND2 was clearly overexpressed in both t(12;14)-positive cases as compared to the mean expression level in the controls. CONCLUSION: We have confirmed, in two additional cases, that the recurrent T-ALL-associated t(12;14) results in overexpression of cyclin D2. The t(12;14) is the first neoplasia-associated translocation shown to result in overexpression of cyclin D2. Furthermore, it is the first example of a T-cell neoplasm with a targeted deregulation of a member of a cyclin-encoding gene family.","['Karrman, Kristina', 'Andersson, Anna', 'Bjorgvinsdottir, Helga', 'Strombeck, Bodil', 'Lassen, Carin', 'Olofsson, Tor', 'Nguyen-Khac, Florence', 'Berger, Roland', 'Bernard, Olivier', 'Fioretos, Thoas', 'Johansson, Bertil']","['Karrman K', 'Andersson A', 'Bjorgvinsdottir H', 'Strombeck B', 'Lassen C', 'Olofsson T', 'Nguyen-Khac F', 'Berger R', 'Bernard O', 'Fioretos T', 'Johansson B']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.

Following an initial pro-apoptotic signal, controlling phases allow the cell to reinforce or downgrade signals leading to the irrevocable entry into apoptosis. Bak (Bcl-2-antagonist killer) is a mitochondrial pore-forming pro-apoptotic effector inhibited through titration by the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 (Myeloid cell leukemia-1). Viruses have taken advantage of proteasome-dependent degradation of Bak as a mechanism to prevent apoptosis in infected cells. It is not clear however whether regulation of Bak protein level is involved in other physiological processes. In this report, we show that Mcl-1 level is paralleled by Bak while a Mcl-1 non-interacting mutant of Bak does not accumulate in cells. This mechanism is proteasome independent. Following serum withdrawal, Bak accumulation becomes independent of Mcl-1 level and cells are sensitized to pro-apoptotic stimuli. Based on these results, we propose that regulation of Mcl-1-Bak steochiometry is a control mechanism used as a checkpoint to prevent or allow entry into apoptosis.","['Minet, E', 'Cosse, J-P', 'Demazy, C', 'Raes, M', 'Michiels, C']","['Minet E', 'Cosse JP', 'Demazy C', 'Raes M', 'Michiels C']","['Laboratory of Biochemistry and Cellular Biology, University of Namur, 61 rue de Bruxelles, 5000, Namur, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '133343-34-7 (lactacystin)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*physiology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*metabolism']",2006/03/21 09:00,2007/11/02 09:00,['2006/03/21 09:00'],"['2006/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-006-6650-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2006 Jun;11(6):1039-47. doi: 10.1007/s10495-006-6650-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the host immune system appears to be tolerant to leukemia cells. To overcome this tolerance, we vaccinated immunocompetent mice with murine leukemia cells (WEHI-3B and BCR-ABL+ 32D cells) transduced with a specifically constructed transmembrane form of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (tmGM-CSF). The transduced cells expressed tmGM-CSF on the cell-surface. To determine whether tmGM-CSF-expressing WEHI-3B leukemia cells would prevent leukemia formation as a vaccine, immunocompetent mice (BALB/c and C3H/HEJ) were immunized with lethally irradiated murine leukemia cells expressing cell-surface tmGM-CSF before challenging mice with murine leukemia cells. Two immunocompetent mouse models were investigated, either WEHI-3B cells in BALB/c mice or BCR-ABL+ 32D cells in C3H/HEJ mouse. The results showed that 100% of WEHI-3B/tmGM-CSF-vaccinated BALB/c mice and about 65% of 32D+ BCR-ABL/tmGM-CSF-vaccinated C3H/HEJ mice were protected from leukemia after leukemia cell challenge, whereas all non-vaccinated mice succumbed to leukemia. Spleen and marrow cell suspensions from vaccinated mice challenged with WEHI-3B cells lacked detectable GFP+ WEHI-3B cells at 82 days post-challenge. A significant delay of death was observed in C3H/HEJ mice challenged with the very aggressive DA-1 cell line expressing BCR-ABL. Vaccination of mice with WEHI-3B/CD40L cells protected 80% of the mice from the WEHI-3B challenge. Notably, 60% of the WEHI-3B/BALB/c mice were also protected from leukemia when WEHI-3B/tmGM-CSF vaccination was carried out after the leukemia challenge. In order to determine whether cellular immunity is involved in this vaccine-mediated protection, either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were depleted from mice after the WEHI-3B/tmGM-CSF vaccination. The results indicate that CD8+ T-cells mediated the protective immune response provided by the irradiated tmGM-CSF-expressing WEHI-3B cells. In addition, vaccination of nude mice did not provide protection from WEHI-3B leukemia induction. Importantly, 80% of non-vaccinated mice were also protected from a WEHI-3B cell challenge after receiving spleen cells from vaccinated mice 1 day before challenge with leukemia cells. These results indicate that overexpression of tmGM-CSF on the leukemia cell-surface can enhance the recognition of leukemic cells by CD8+ T cells, and can either prevent or significantly delay leukemia induction. These findings suggest that injection of irradiated leukemia cells expressing cell-surface-bound GM-CSF has the potential as an immunological approach to treat leukemia.","['Ling, X', 'Wang, Y', 'Dietrich, M F', 'Andreeff, M', 'Arlinghaus, R B']","['Ling X', 'Wang Y', 'Dietrich MF', 'Andreeff M', 'Arlinghaus RB']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD40 Ligand/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cancer Vaccines/administration & dosage/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/immunology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Nude', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2006/03/21 09:00,2006/11/10 09:00,['2006/03/21 09:00'],"['2006/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209477 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209477 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Jul 27;25(32):4483-90. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209477.

We described a t(1;12)(q21;p13) chromosomal translocation in human acute myeloblastic leukemia that involves the translocated Ets leukemia (TEL/ETV6) and the ARNT genes and results in the expression of a TEL-ARNT fusion protein. Functional studies show that TEL-ARNT interacts with HIF1alpha and the complex binds to consensus hypoxia response element. In low oxygen tension conditions, the HIF1alpha/TEL-ARNT complex does not activate transcription but exerts a dominant-negative effect on normal HIF1 activity. Differentiation of normal human CD34+ progenitors cells along all the erythrocytic, megakaryocytic and granulocytic pathways was accelerated in low versus high oxygen tension conditions. Murine 32Dcl3 myeloid cells also show accelerated granulocytic differentiation in low oxygen tension in response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Interestingly, stable expression of the TEL-ARNT in 32Dcl3 subclones resulted in impaired HIF1-mediated transcriptional response and inhibition of differentiation enhancement in hypoxic conditions.

We investigated the roles of PLZF in the regulation of osteoblastic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and C2C12 cells. siRNA-mediated gene-silencing of PLZF resulted in a reduction of the expression of osteoblast-specific genes such as the alkaline phosphatase, collagen 1A1, Runx2/CBFA1, and osteocalcin genes in the presence of osteogenic differentiation medium (OS) in hMSCs. The overexpression of PLZF induced CBFA1 induction, suggesting that PLZF is an upstream regulator of CBFA1 and thereby participates in promoting the ossification of spinal ligament cells in OPLL patients. Adenovirus-mediated TSG-6 overexpression in hMSCs resulted in suppression of osteoblastic differentiation induced by either BMP-2 or OS. TSG-6 can bind to BMP-2 directly and thereby could inhibit BMP-2 signaling. Taken together, these findings indicate that PLZF and TSG-6 play important roles in early osteoblastic differentiation.","['Inoue, Ituro', 'Ikeda, Ryuji', 'Tsukahara, So']","['Inoue I', 'Ikeda R', 'Tsukahara S']","['Division of Genetic Diagnosis, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. ituro@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,J Pharmacol Sci,Journal of pharmacological sciences,101167001,"['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (TNFAIP6 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Longitudinal Ligaments/metabolism/pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Ossification of Posterior Longitudinal Ligament/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Osteoblasts/metabolism/pathology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'RNA Interference', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",2006/03/21 09:00,2006/05/12 09:00,['2006/03/21 09:00'],"['2006/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jphs/FMJ05004X5 [pii]', '10.1254/jphs.fmj05004x5 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Sci. 2006 Mar;100(3):205-10. doi: 10.1254/jphs.fmj05004x5.,,,,,,,15,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within the repressive chromatin environment, the virally encoded Tax protein mediates the recruitment of the coactivators CREB-binding protein/p300 to the HTLV-1 promoter, located within the long terminal repeats (LTRs) of the provirus. These proteins carry acetyltransferase activity that is essential for strong transcriptional activation of the virus in the context of chromatin. Consistent with this, the amino-terminal tails of nucleosomal histones at the viral promoter are acetylated in Tax-expressing cells. We have developed a system in which we transfect Tax into cells carrying integrated copies of the HTLV-1 LTR driving the luciferase gene to analyze changes in ""activating"" histone modifications at the LTR. Unexpectedly, Tax transactivation led to an apparent reduction of these modifications at the HTLV-1 promoter and downstream region that correlates with a similar reduction in histone H3 and linker histone H1. Micrococcal nuclease protection analysis showed that less LTR-luciferase DNA is nucleosomal in Tax-expressing cells. Furthermore, nucleosome depletion correlated with RNA polymerase II recruitment and loss of SWI/SNF. The M47 Tax mutant, deficient in HTLV-1 transcriptional activation, was also defective for nucleosome depletion. Although this mutant formed complexes with CREB and p300 at the HTLV-1 promoter in vivo, it was unable to mediate RNA polymerase II recruitment or SWI/SNF displacement. These results support a model in which nucleosomes are depleted from the LTR and transcribed region during Tax-mediated transcriptional activation and correlate RNA polymerase II recruitment with nucleosome depletion.","['Lemasson, Isabelle', 'Polakowski, Nicholas J', 'Laybourn, Paul J', 'Nyborg, Jennifer K']","['Lemasson I', 'Polakowski NJ', 'Laybourn PJ', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523-1870.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523-1870.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523-1870.

The adhesion molecule VCAM-1 and eotaxin have been implicated in extravasation and accumulation of eosinophils into tissue in animal models of asthma. In this study, we investigated the role of OSM in regulation of VCAM-1 expression, and STAT6 tyrosine 641 phosphorylation in murine fibroblasts. OSM induced VCAM-1 expression in C57BL/6 mouse lung fibroblasts (MLF) and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts at the protein and mRNA level in vitro. OSM also induced STAT6 Y641 phosphorylation in MLF and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, an activity not observed with other IL-6/gp130 cytokine family members (IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, cardiotropin-1, and IL-11) nor in cells derived from STAT6(-/-) mice (STAT6(-/-) MLF). STAT6 was not essential for OSM-induced VCAM-1 or eotaxin-1 as assessed in STAT6(-/-) MLF. Combination of IL-4 and OSM synergistically enhanced eotaxin-1 expression in MLF. IL-4 induction and the IL-4/OSM synergistic induction of eotaxin-1 was abrogated in STAT6(-/-) MLF, however, regulation of IL-6 was similar in -/- or wild-type MLF. Induction of VCAM-1 by OSM was diminished by pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K (LY294002) but not inhibitors of ERK1/2 (PD98059) or p38 MAPK (SB203580). These data support the role of OSM in eosinophil accumulation into lung tissue through eotaxin-1 and VCAM-1 expression and the notion that OSM is able to induce unique signal transduction events through its receptor complex of OSMR beta-chain and gp130.","['Fritz, Dominik K', 'Kerr, Christine', 'Tong, Li', 'Smyth, David', 'Richards, Carl D']","['Fritz DK', 'Kerr C', 'Tong L', 'Smyth D', 'Richards CD']","['Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Ccl11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CCL11)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT6 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL11', 'Chemokines, CC/*metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/metabolism', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oncostatin M', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'STAT6 Transcription Factor/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/*metabolism']",2006/03/21 09:00,2006/05/02 09:00,['2006/03/21 09:00'],"['2006/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['176/7/4352 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.176.7.4352 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2006 Apr 1;176(7):4352-60. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.176.7.4352.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the bone marrow (BM) of leukemic mice, only DX5(+)CD3(-) cells were continuously increased, despite the progression of leukemia. In addition, DX5(+)CD3(-) cells were rapidly increased in peripheral blood (PB) 20 days after inoculation. We also found that myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) expressing low levels of I-A(d) and having low allo-T cell stimulatory activity were markedly increased in PB and spleen. The increase in DX5(+) cells in BM was thought to be induced by soluble factors from leukemic cells. DX5(+) cells from leukemic mice were CD3(-), B220(-), Gr-1(-), CD14(-), CD94(-), Ly-49C/F(-), asialo GM1(+), CD25(+), CD122(+), Thy-1(bright), and c-kit(dim) and showed low killing activity against YAC-1 cells, suggesting that those DX5(+) cells were immature NK cells. NK cells from leukemic PB down-regulated the expression of I-A(d) on DCs, an effect mediated by TGF-beta. Moreover, these NK cells significantly suppressed the allo-T cell stimulatory activity of DCs, an effect requiring cell-to-cell contact between NK cells and DCs and thought to involve CD25. Importantly, NK cells from leukemic PB inhibited generation of autotumor-specific CTL induced by DCs in primary MLR or by DC immunization. In conclusion, we identified circulating immature NK cells with immunosuppressive activities.

Moreover, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) regulate the expression of Ids. We hypothesized that BMP4 and Id proteins play a role in the expansion and differentiation of epithelial progenitor cells. We demonstrate that BMP4 induces the expression of Id2 along with the expansion of AR42J pancreatic epithelial cells. Furthermore, neutralization of BMP4 significantly reduced duct epithelial cell expansion in a mouse model of islet regeneration. BMP4 stimulation promotes Id2 binding to the bHLH transcription factor NeuroD, which is required for the differentiation of pancreatic islet cells. Therefore, our results indicate that BMP4 stimulation blocks the differentiation of endocrine progenitor cells and instead promotes their expansion thereby revealing a novel paradigm of signaling explaining the balance between expansion and differentiation of pancreatic duct epithelial progenitors.

Here, we examined the mechanism of the apoptosis induced by ssHHT in myeloid leukemia cells. First, we have shown that ssHHT induces apoptosis in HL60 and HL60/MRP cell lines in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and independently of the expression of Bax. The decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c were observed in the apoptotic cells induced by ssHHT. To unveil the relationship between ssHHT and the mitochondrial disruption, we have shown that ssHHT decreased myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) expression and induced Bcl-2 cleavage in HL60 and HL60/MRP cell lines. The Bcl-2 cleavage could be inhibited by the Z-VAD.fmk caspase inhibitor. However, Mcl-1 turnover was very rapid and occurred before caspase activation. The Mcl-1 turnover was only induced by ssHHT and cycloheximide, but not by daunorubicin and cytosine arabinoside, and could be restored by proteasome inhibitors. Second, we confirmed that ssHHT rapidly induced massive apoptosis in acute myelogenous leukemia patient cells. We have also confirmed the release of cytochrome c and a rapid turnover of Mcl-1 in these patient cells, taking place only in apoptotic cells induced by ssHHT but not in cells undergoing spontaneous apoptosis. Finally, we have shown that ssHHT inhibits protein synthesis in both cell line and patient cells. We suggest that the inhibition of protein synthesis and resulting Mcl-1 turnover play a key role in the apoptosis induced by ssHHT. Our results encourage further clinical trials for the use of ssHHT in acute myelogenous leukemia.","['Tang, Ruoping', 'Faussat, Anne-Marie', 'Majdak, Patricia', 'Marzac, Christophe', 'Dubrulle, Sabine', 'Marjanovic, Zora', 'Legrand, Ollivier', 'Marie, Jean-Pierre']","['Tang R', 'Faussat AM', 'Majdak P', 'Marzac C', 'Dubrulle S', 'Marjanovic Z', 'Legrand O', 'Marie JP']","['Universite Pierre et Marie Curie; INSERM UMRS 736, Hopital Hotel Dieu, 1 place du Parvis-Notre-Dame, 75181 Paris cedex 04, France. ruoping.tang@htd.ap-hop-paris.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', '9035-34-1 (Cytochromes a)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Cytochromes a/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Harringtonines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2006/03/21 09:00,2006/05/27 09:00,['2006/03/21 09:00'],"['2006/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['5/3/723 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-05-0164 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2006 Mar;5(3):723-31. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-05-0164.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies suggest that resveratrol possesses anticancer effects, although its mechanism of action is not well understood. We now show that resveratrol inhibits Src tyrosine kinase activity and thereby blocks constitutive signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) protein activation in malignant cells. Analyses of resveratrol-treated malignant cells harboring constitutively-active Stat3 reveal irreversible cell cycle arrest of v-Src-transformed mouse fibroblasts (NIH3T3/v-Src), human breast (MDA-MB-231), pancreatic (Panc-1), and prostate carcinoma (DU145) cell lines at the G0-G1 phase or at the S phase of human breast cancer (MDA-MB-468) and pancreatic cancer (Colo-357) cells, and loss of viability due to apoptosis. By contrast, cells treated with resveratrol, but lacking aberrant Stat3 activity, show reversible growth arrest and minimal loss of viability. Moreover, in malignant cells harboring constitutively-active Stat3, including human prostate cancer DU145 cells and v-Src-transformed mouse fibroblasts (NIH3T3/v-Src), resveratrol treatment represses Stat3-regulated cyclin D1 as well as Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 genes, suggesting that the antitumor cell activity of resveratrol is in part due to the blockade of Stat3-mediated dysregulation of growth and survival pathways. Our study is among the first to identify Src-Stat3 signaling as a target of resveratrol, further defining the mechanism of antitumor cell activity of resveratrol and raising its potential application in tumors with an activated Stat3 profile.","['Kotha, Anupama', 'Sekharam, Madhavi', 'Cilenti, Lucia', 'Siddiquee, Khandaker', 'Khaled, Annette', 'Zervos, Antonis S', 'Carter, Bradford', 'Turkson, James', 'Jove, Richard']","['Kotha A', 'Sekharam M', 'Cilenti L', 'Siddiquee K', 'Khaled A', 'Zervos AS', 'Carter B', 'Turkson J', 'Jove R']","['Molecular Oncology Program, H.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The germline cells were irradiated with raster-scanned broad beam or collimated microbeam of 220 MeV 12C5+ particles delivered from the azimuthally varying field (AVF) cyclotron, and subsequently observed for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. RESULTS: Whole-body irradiation with the broad beam at the L4 larval stage arrested germ cell proliferation. When the tip region of the gonad arm was irradiated locally with the microbeam at the L4 stage, the same arrest was observed. When the microbeams were used to irradiate the pachytene region of the gonad arm, at a young gravid stage, radiation-induced apoptosis occurred in the gonad. In contrast, arrest and apoptosis were not induced in the non-irradiated neighboring region or the opposite gonad. Similar results were confirmed in the c-abl-1 (mammalian ortholog of cellular counterpart of Abelson murine leukemia virus) mutant that is hypersensitive to radiation-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the microbeam irradiation is useful in characterizing tissue-specific, local biological response to radiation in organisms.

A meta-analysis of experimental studies.,1-12,"PURPOSE: This paper is a meta-analysis of data from in vitro studies and short-term animal studies that have combined extremely low frequency magnetic fields with known carcinogens or other toxic physical or chemical agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data was analyzed by systematic comparison of study characteristics between positive and negative studies to reveal possible consistent patterns. RESULTS: The majority of the studies reviewed were positive, suggesting that magnetic fields do interact with other chemical and physical exposures. Publication bias is unlikely to explain the findings. Interestingly, a nonlinear 'dose-response' was found, showing a minimum percentage of positive studies at fields between 1 and 3 mT. The radical pair mechanism (magnetic field effects on recombination of radical pairs) is a good candidate mechanism for explaining the biphasic dose-response seen in the present analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the studies reviewed used magnetic fields of 100 microT or higher, so the findings are not directly relevant for explaining the epidemiological findings suggesting increased risk of childhood leukemia above 0.4 microT. However, confirmed adverse effects even at 100 microT would have implications for risk assessment and management, including the need to reconsider the exposure limits for magnetic fields. There is an obvious need for further studies on combined effects with magnetic fields.","['Juutilainen, Jukka', 'Kumlin, Timo', 'Naarala, Jonne']","['Juutilainen J', 'Kumlin T', 'Naarala J']","['University of Kuopio, Department of Environmental Sciences, Kuopio, Finland. jukka.juutilainen@uku.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/*toxicity', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Risk Assessment']",2006/03/21 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/03/21 09:00'],"['2006/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['PP23575810G22757 [pii]', '10.1080/09553000600577839 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2006 Jan;82(1):1-12. doi: 10.1080/09553000600577839.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we show that fludarabine can also induce pro-inflammatory stimulation of monocytic cells, as evaluated by increased expression of ICAM-1 and IL-8 release. To study the mechanisms involved, we employed selective inhibitors of MAPK and NF-kappaB pathways, both of which have been implicated in the modulation of ICAM-1 and IL-8. Our results showed that fludarabine effects were mediated through the activation of ERK and were independent on p38, JNK or NF-kappaB pathways. By Western blotting analysis we corroborated that fludarabine induced a rapid activation of ERK that was sustained for at least 30 min. Moreover, pro-inflammatory activation of monocytic cells by fludarabine was largely attenuated by coadministration of the free radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine suggesting the involvement of reactive oxygen species in fludarabine effects. Finally, we showed that fludarabine induced the activation of the transcription factor AP-1 not only in monocytic cells but also in non-proliferating lymphocytes from chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

We have previously shown that the protein tyrosine kinase Hck, a member of the Src family, triggers the de novo formation of podosome rosettes in a lysosome-dependent manner when expressed in its constitutively active form. Hck is specifically expressed in myeloid cells. In human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) it is present at podosomes. Here we addressed whether its activation by lipopolysaccharide and interferon-gamma has an effect on podosome organization in MDMs. Several structures were observed evolving from individual podosomes to clusters, aggregates and rosettes. In chronic myeloid leukemia cells, Hck is constitutively activated by the fusion protein Bcr-Abl and podosome-like structures were present. Finally, in monocyte-derived osteoclasts, Hck was found to accumulate at podosome belts. In conclusion, in monocyte-derived cells, it is likely that Hck could play a role in podosome re-arrangements.","['Poincloux, Renaud', 'Vincent, Claire', 'Labrousse, Arnaud', 'Castandet, Jerome', 'Rigo, Maxime', 'Cougoule, Celine', 'Bordier, Christine', 'Le Cabec, Veronique', 'Maridonneau-Parini, Isabelle']","['Poincloux R', 'Vincent C', 'Labrousse A', 'Castandet J', 'Rigo M', 'Cougoule C', 'Bordier C', 'Le Cabec V', 'Maridonneau-Parini I']","['CNRS UMR5089, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, 205 route de Narbonne, F-31077 Toulouse Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Cell Biol,European journal of cell biology,7906240,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (HCK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck)']",IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/*ultrastructure', 'Animals', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Lipopolysaccharides/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cells/*enzymology/*ultrastructure', 'Osteoclasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/03/21 09:00,2006/08/23 09:00,['2006/03/21 09:00'],"['2006/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0171-9335(05)00151-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejcb.2005.09.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cell Biol. 2006 Apr;85(3-4):327-32. doi: 10.1016/j.ejcb.2005.09.012.

It is curative for a small number of malignancies including childhood leukemia, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and germ cell malignancies. It has a palliative role for most metastatic epithelial malignancies. Finally, it has an adjuvant role in several types of resected epithelial malignancies particularly breast cancer. First successfully employed in the mid 1970s, adjuvant chemotherapy is associated with up to a 30% relative improvement in long-term overall survival in high risk breast cancer but demonstrates significantly less absolute improvement. Now that adjuvant chemotherapy is being used in lower risk disease, both the relative and absolute improvement in overall survival is even less impressive. With a growing number of long-term survivors, we are only now able to define the delayed implications of adjuvant chemotherapy. These long-term side effects include acceleration of neurocognitive decline, musculoskeletal complications such as early onset osteoporosis, premature skin and ocular changes and the most common long-term complaint; mild to profound fatigue. This complex of problems is suggestive of early onset frailty. This paper explores various potential mechanisms of aging including accumulation of free-radical damage, accumulation of DNA damage, telomere shortening with accompanying decline in telomerase activity and finally a decline in neuroendocrine/immune function. The impact of chemotherapy, particularly those agents used in the adjuvant setting, in relationship to these aging mechanisms is explored. There is good evidence that chemotherapy can effect all these aging mechanisms leading to early onset frailty. The implications of this hypothesis are quite profound. Whereas short-term toxicity of chemotherapy can usually be considered acceptable even for a small improvement in survival, long-term toxicity such as early onset frailty can have an impact on quality of life that could last for years. This possible effect on aging could have implications on the decision to take adjuvant chemo, what agents to use, means to minimize the aging effect and the need to monitor for early onset frailty.","['Maccormick, Ronald Eric']",['Maccormick RE'],"['Dalhousie University, Cape Breton Cancer Clinic, 1482 George Street, Sydney, NS, Canada B1P 1P3. ronmaccormick@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,,IM,"['Aging, Premature/*etiology', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy']",2006/03/21 09:00,2006/08/24 09:00,['2006/03/21 09:00'],"['2006/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0306-9877(06)00101-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mehy.2006.01.045 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 2006;67(2):212-5. doi: 10.1016/j.mehy.2006.01.045.

We investigated the prevalence of the LIF gene mutations in the population of infertile women that consisted of nulligravid and secondary infertile patients. STUDY DESIGN: We designed a LIF gene mutation screening method that is based on the Temperature Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (TGGE). The population to screen consisted of 176 infertile women including group A of 147 nulligravid women and group B of 29 women with secondary infertility that had a history of either miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy but no live births. The control population was comprised of 75 healthy fertile subjects. The groups of fertile controls and infertile patients were compared for statistically significant differences using the t-test. RESULTS: Six potentially functional LIF gene mutations, the G to A transitions at the position 3400 leading to the valin to methionin exchange at codon 64 (V64M) in the AB loop region of the LIF protein, were detected. All of the six positive women were infertile. Four of them were nulligravid and two of them had history of spontaneous conception followed by early miscarriage. No positive TGGE samples were identified in the control group, which means that the frequency of functionally relevant mutations of the LIF gene in infertile women is significantly enhanced in comparison with controls (P<0.05, t-test). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the LIF gene mutations affect fertility. Even though they occur infrequently, their impact on molecular events during early phases of pregnancy should be further established.","['Kralickova, Milena', 'Sima, Radek', 'Vanecek, Tomas', 'Sima, Petr', 'Rokyta, Zdenek', 'Ulcova-Gallova, Zdenka', 'Sucha, Renata', 'Uher, Petr', 'Hes, Ondrej']","['Kralickova M', 'Sima R', 'Vanecek T', 'Sima P', 'Rokyta Z', 'Ulcova-Gallova Z', 'Sucha R', 'Uher P', 'Hes O']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Capkovo namesti 1, Plzen CZ-326 00, Czech Republic.

This study demonstrated that FME was able to inhibit cell proliferation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Treatment with FME caused induction of caspase-2, caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-8, and caspase-9 activity in a time-dependent manner, but not affect caspase-1 activity; it induced the proteolysis of DNA fragmentation factor (DFF-45) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Induction of cell death by FME was completely prevented by a pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-FMK) and a caspase-2 inhibitor, Z-Val-Asp-Val-Ala-Asp-FMK (Z-VDVAD-FMK). Furthermore, treatment with FME caused a rapid loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, stimulation of generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into cytosol, and GSH depletion. Anti-oxidants such as N-acetylcysteine, catalase, superoxide dismutase, allopurinol, and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, but not diphenylene iodonium, significantly inhibited FME-induced cell death. In addition, the results showed that FME-induced apoptosis was accompanied by up-regulation of Bax and Bad, and down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. Taken together, induction of apoptosis on HL-60 cells by FME was mainly associated with ROS production, GSH depletion, mitochondrial dysfunction, and caspase activation.","['Huang, Ying-Tang', 'Huang, Yi-Hsuan', 'Hour, Tzhy-Chyuan', 'Pan, Bonnie Sun', 'Liu, Yeuk-Chuen', 'Pan, Min-Hsiung']","['Huang YT', 'Huang YH', 'Hour TC', 'Pan BS', 'Liu YC', 'Pan MH']","['Department of Marine Biotechnology, National Kaohsiung Marine University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 2', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Corbicula/*chemistry', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2006/03/21 09:00,2006/09/20 09:00,['2006/03/21 09:00'],"['2005/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/30 00:00 [revised]', '2006/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0278-6915(06)00027-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fct.2006.02.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2006 Aug;44(8):1261-72. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2006.02.001.

The median follow-up from CR for all patients was 13.6 months (range, 6.0-123.1 months). The median follow-up from remission for surviving patients was 81 months (range, 41.4-123.1 months). Seven patients are alive in continuous CR, 19 died from relapse, and 1 died as a result of treatment-related infection. Leukemia-free survival and overall survival are 10.3 and 13.4 months, respectively. Actuarial leukemia-free and overall survival at 3 years are 25% +/- 9% and 28% +/- 9%, respectively. Our results demonstrate that autologous transplantation of peripheral blood progenitor cells is well tolerated and feasible for patients > or =60 years of age with AML in first CR. Future investigation should focus on a randomized study evaluating a larger group of elderly patients in first CR comparing autologous stem cell transplantation with conventional cytarabine-based consolidation chemotherapy to identify the optimal postremission therapy.","['Lashkari, Ashkan', 'Lowe, Tom', 'Collisson, Eric', 'Paquette, Ronald', 'Emmanouilides, Christos', 'Territo, Mary', 'Schiller, Gary']","['Lashkari A', 'Lowe T', 'Collisson E', 'Paquette R', 'Emmanouilides C', 'Territo M', 'Schiller G']","['Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation Conditioning/methods/mortality', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2006/03/21 09:00,2006/12/23 09:00,['2006/03/21 09:00'],"['2004/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(05)01412-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.12.027 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2006 Apr;12(4):466-71. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.12.027.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, 4 groups were compared: Cy-TBI <13 Gy (n = 217), Cy-TBI > or =13 Gy (n = 81), etoposide-TBI <13 Gy (n = 53), and etoposide-TBI > or =13 Gy (n = 151). Analyses of relapse, leukemia-free survival (LFS), and survival were performed separately for CR1 and CR2 transplantations. Transplant-related mortality did not differ by conditioning regimen. In CR1, there were also no significant differences in relapse, LFS, or survival by conditioning regimen. In CR2, these outcomes differed among conditioning groups. In comparison with Cy-TBI <13 Gy, the risks of relapse, treatment failure (inverse of LFS), and mortality tended to be lower with etoposide (regardless of TBI dose) or with TBI doses > or =13 Gy. For both CR1 and CR2 transplantations, causes of death were similar among the groups; disease recurrence accounted for 47% of deaths.

DLI was highly effective in relapsed chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), with 71% of patients achieving durable complete remissions (CR). In relapsed acute myeloid leukemia, DLI led to durable CRs in 31% of patients; the rate was <20% in all other diseases. Achieving full donor chimerism and GVHD were predictive of CR. Grade II or higher acute or chronic GVHD occurred in 36 (43%) patients and contributed to death in 13 (16%). Even more patients, 33 (40%), died of their underlying malignancy, including 10 who developed active GVHD. In relapsed CML, most durable CRs occurred without clinically apparent GVHD, yet all responders achieved full donor chimerism, including 6 with coincident normal host hematopoiesis at the time of DLI. Thus, in CML, potent lymphohematopoietic graft-versus-host reactions occurred even in the absence of clinically apparent GVHD; this confirms the ability to dissociate these processes and argues against a leukemia-specific immunologic effect. DLI clearly has efficacy in the treatment of relapsed disease after allogeneic transplantation.

We have previously demonstrated that donor HSC-derived Thy1(+) T(reg) cells, consisting primarily of CD4(+)CD25(+) cells, play an important role in the suppression of graft-versus-host (GVH) reactivity when DLI is given to complete donor chimeras 28 days after HSC transplantation. Data presented here demonstrate that protection against GVHD exerted by Thy1(+) T(reg) cells is less evident with time and eventually is not required in long-term complete donor chimeras because of an absence of host-type APCs to activate alloreactive T cells. Lethal GVHD was observed when Thy1(+) T(reg) cells were depleted from complete donor chimeras given by DLI at day 28, 35, or 42; however, T(reg) cell depletion and DLI at day 70 no longer induced GVHD-associated mortality. Moreover, the failure of DLI to induce GVHD with T(reg) depletion correlated with a loss of the DLI-induced GVL effect in long-term (day 100) complete donor chimeras. In contrast to the results from complete donor chimeras, GVL reactivity in day 100 mixed chimeras was robust after DLI. Loss of a DLI-induced GVL effect in long-term complete donor chimeras was attributed to the absence of host APCs because the infusion of exogenous host-type dendritic cells partially restored both DLI-induced GVL and GVH reactions in day 100 complete donor chimeras. The GVL and GVH reactions restored by infusion of host dendritic cells in day 100 complete donor chimeras were at least partially regulated by T(reg) cells because transient depletion of CD25(+) cells increased both the GVL effect and the severity of GVHD after DLI. Taken together, these data suggest that T(reg) cells can regulate DLI-induced GVL and GVH reactions in both early and long-term complete donor chimeras, and a state of mixed chimerism is superior to complete donor chimerism because host-type APCs facilitate a DLI-induced GVL effect without severe GVHD.","['Xia, Guliang', 'Truitt, Robert L', 'Johnson, Bryon D']","['Xia G', 'Truitt RL', 'Johnson BD']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/methods', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Transplantation Chimera/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2006/03/21 09:00,2006/12/23 09:00,['2006/03/21 09:00'],"['2005/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(05)01360-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.11.519 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2006 Apr;12(4):397-407. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.11.519.,,,,,['CA90286/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. Here we report that Tempo (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl) is a potent thermosensitizer for promoting cell death in human leukemia U937 cells. Treatment with Tempo (10 mM, 37 degrees C/30 min) and hyperthermia (44 degrees C/30 min) induced 30 and 70-80% apoptosis, respectively, through Bax-mediated cytochrome c release and DEVDase activation. The Tempo/heat combination also caused Bax-mediated cytochrome c release, but switched heat-induced apoptosis to the particular pyknotic cell death, resulting in the irreparable inhibition of proliferation. Tempo and heat stress, but not the combination, caused an early transient elevation of H2O2/O2*- and a late induction of only O2*-, respectively. Mitochondrial Ca2+ overloads were indistinguishable after any treatment. Heat stress induced the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk-suppressible low-Deltapsi (mitochondrial membrane potential) in 75% of cells as a result of DEVDase activation. In contrast, Tempo yielded low-Deltapsi by deprivation of the mitochondrial H+ gradient. The combined treatment induced 97% zVAD-resistant low-Deltapsi cells through irreversible mitochondrial dysfunction.

The amyloid nature of the fibrils was confirmed by far UV circular dichroism spectra indicating for rich beta-structure, thioflavin T binding assays, and examination of the obtained polymers by atomic force microscopy. Fusing of short peptides--octapeptide of human alpha(2)-interferon (130-137) or hexapeptide HLDF-6 (41-46) of human leukemia differentiation factor--with the N-terminus of ABB led to increased amyloidogenicity of the protein: the rate of fibril formation increased and the morphology of fibrils became more complex. The presence of free hexapeptide HLDF-6 in the ABB solution had the same effect. Increasing ionic strength also activated the process of amyloid formation, but to less extent than did the peptides fused with ABB or added to the ABB solution. We suggest an important role of electrostatic interactions in formation of ABB fibrils. The foregoing ways (addition of salt or peptides) allow decrease in electrostatic repulsion between ABB molecules carrying large negative charge (-12) at neutral pH, thus promoting fibril formation.","['Lavrikova, M A', 'Zamotin, V V', 'Malisauskas, M', 'Chertkova, R V', 'Kostanyan, I A', 'Dolgikh, D A', 'Kirpichnikov, M P', 'Morozova-Roche, L A']","['Lavrikova MA', 'Zamotin VV', 'Malisauskas M', 'Chertkova RV', 'Kostanyan IA', 'Dolgikh DA', 'Kirpichnikov MP', 'Morozova-Roche LA']","['Shemyakin and Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow. marikalav@vega.protres.ru']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry (Mosc),Biochemistry.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate children post autologous and allogeneic HSCT, with a positive PCR or immunohistochemistry for HHV-7 either from blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or any other pathology specimen. Clinical data for these patients were collected examining symptoms and signs, engraftment, acute infectious complications, graft versus host disease (GVHD) where applicable, and survival. RESULTS: Between June 1999 and June 2003, 265 HSCT were performed in The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, allogeneic (n = 163) and autologous (n = 102). Nine children were positive for HHV-7 at a median of 21 days (range 16-27 days) post-HSCT. All had allogeneic transplantation. The most common underlying diagnosis was acute leukemia and 7 had matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplantation. Eight of the nine patients had grade II-IV acute GVHD and all of them had multiple infectious episodes with fungal, bacterial and other viral pathogens. Although not fully attributed to HHV-7, the clinical syndrome varied from fever, vomiting and diarrhea to septic shock. Four patients died due to GVHD and sepsis. CONCLUSION: HHV-7 was uncommon post-HSCT. It was associated with severe GVHD and sepsis secondary to severe immunosuppression.","['Khanani, Muhammad', 'Al-Ahmari, Ali', 'Tellier, Raymond', 'Allen, Upton', 'Richardson, Susan', 'Doyle, John J', 'Gassas, Adam']","['Khanani M', 'Al-Ahmari A', 'Tellier R', 'Allen U', 'Richardson S', 'Doyle JJ', 'Gassas A']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Blood/virology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/virology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/virology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Herpesvirus 7, Human/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/adverse effects', 'Infections/virology', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2006/03/18 09:00,2007/05/12 09:00,['2006/03/18 09:00'],"['2006/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20829 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 May;48(5):567-70. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20829.,,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Apr;50(4):935; author reply 936.

Upon stimulation, the cells secrete the granule contents via an exocytotic process whereby the granules translocate to the cell periphery, the granule membranes fuse with the plasma membrane, and the granule contents are released extracellularly. We have reported previously that another exocytotic process, release of mucin by secretory cells of the airway epithelium, is regulated by the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) (Li Y, Martin LD, Spizz G, Adler KB. MARCKS protein is a key molecule regulating mucin secretion by human airway epithelial cells in vitro. J Biol Chem 2001;276:40982-40990; Singer M, Martin LD, Vargaftig BB, Park J, Gruber AD, Li Y, Adler KB. A MARCKS-related peptide blocks mucus hypersecretion in a mouse model of asthma. Nat Med 2004;10:193-196). In those studies, mucin secretion in vitro and in vivo was attenuated by a synthetic peptide identical to the N-terminus of MARCKS, named the MANS peptide (Li and colleagues, 2001). In this study, we used the MANS peptide to investigate possible involvement of MARCKS in secretion of leukocyte granule proteins. In neutrophils isolated from human blood, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced myeloperoxidase release was attenuated in a concentration-dependent manner by MANS but not by equal concentrations of a missense control peptide. In additional studies using human leukocyte cell lines, secretion of eosinophil peroxidase from the eosinophil-like cell line HL-60 clone 15, lysozyme from the monocytic leukemia cell line U937, and granzyme from the lymphocyte natural killer cell line NK-92 were attenuated by preincubation of the cells with MANS but not with the missense control peptide. The results indicate that MARCKS protein may play an important role in the secretion of membrane-bound granules from different leukocytes. MARCKS may be an important component of secretory pathways associated with release of granules by different cell types.","['Takashi, Shuji', 'Park, Joungjoa', 'Fang, Shijing', 'Koyama, Sekiya', 'Parikh, Indu', 'Adler, Kenneth B']","['Takashi S', 'Park J', 'Fang S', 'Koyama S', 'Parikh I', 'Adler KB']","['The National Chuushin Matsumoto Hospital, Matsumoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,8917225,"['0 (MARCKS-related peptide)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Eosinophil Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.78 (GZMA protein, human)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['*Cell Degranulation', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Eosinophil Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Granzymes', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/enzymology/*physiology', 'Muramidase/metabolism', 'Neutrophils', 'Peptide Fragments/*pharmacology', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells']",2006/03/18 09:00,2006/06/30 09:00,['2006/03/18 09:00'],"['2006/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['2006-0030RC [pii]', '10.1165/rcmb.2006-0030RC [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2006 Jun;34(6):647-52. doi: 10.1165/rcmb.2006-0030RC.

We investigated cellular resistance to imatinib in BCR-ABL-expressing cells transduced and selected to overexpress BCRP (K562/BCRP-MX10). These cells exhibited a 2- to 3-fold increase in resistance to imatinib (P < .05) and a 7- to 12-fold increase in resistance to mitoxantrone, a known BCRP substrate. Resistance to imatinib was completely abolished by the specific BCRP inhibitor fumitremorgin C. Studies of the mechanism of the diminished resistance to imatinib compared with mitoxantrone revealed that imatinib decreased the expression of BCRP in K562/BCRP-MX10 cells without affecting mRNA levels. BCRP levels in cells that do not express BCR-ABL were not affected by imatinib. Loss of BCRP expression was accompanied by imatinib-induced reduction of phosphorylated Akt in the BCRP-expressing K562 cells. The phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 also decreased BCRP levels in K562/BCRP-MX10 cells. These studies show that BCRP causes measurable imatinib resistance, but this effect is attenuated by imatinib-mediated inhibition of BCR-ABL, which in turn downregulates overall BCRP levels posttranscriptionally via the PI3K-Akt pathway.","['Nakanishi, Takeo', 'Shiozawa, Ken', 'Hassel, Bret A', 'Ross, Douglas D']","['Nakanishi T', 'Shiozawa K', 'Hassel BA', 'Ross DD']","['Program in Experimental Therapeutics, University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center (UMGCC), Baltimore, 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'CW5S8OP3VO (tryptoquivaline)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Benzamides', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mitoxantrone/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2006/03/18 09:00,2006/08/23 09:00,['2006/03/18 09:00'],"['2006/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52822-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-10-4020 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jul 15;108(2):678-84. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-10-4020.

We investigated the potential therapeutic use of nongenotoxic p53 activation by a small-molecule antagonist of Mdm2, Nutlin-3a, in CLL. Nutlin-3a induced significant apoptosis in 30 (91%) of 33 samples from previously untreated patients with CLL; all resistant samples had TP53 mutations. Low levels of Atm (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) or high levels of Mdm2 (murine double minute 2) did not prevent Nutlin-3a from inducing apoptosis. Nutlin-3a used transcription-dependent and transcription-independent pathways to induce p53-mediated apoptosis. Predominant activation of the transcription-independent pathway induced more pronounced apoptosis than that of the transcription-dependent pathway, suggesting that activation of the transcription-independent pathway is sufficient to initiate p53-mediated apoptosis in CLL. Combination treatment of Nutlin-3a and fludarabine synergistically increased p53 levels, and induced conformational change of Bax and apoptosis in wild-type p53 cells but not in cells with mutant p53. The synergistic apoptotic effect was maintained in samples with low Atm that were fludarabine resistant.

Upon IL-3 withdrawal, protein levels of MCL-1 decreased but were sustained by pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3, which prevented cytochrome c release and apoptosis. MCL-1 was phosphorylated by GSK-3 at a conserved GSK-3 phosphorylation site (S159). S159 phosphorylation of MCL-1 was induced by IL-3 withdrawal or PI3K inhibition and prevented by AKT or inhibition of GSK-3, and it led to increased ubiquitinylation and degradation of MCL-1. A phosphorylation-site mutant (MCL-1(S159A)), expressed in IL-3-dependent cells, showed enhanced stability upon IL-3 withdrawal and conferred increased protection from apoptosis compared to wild-type MCL-1. The results demonstrate that the control of MCL-1 stability by GSK-3 is an important mechanism for the regulation of apoptosis by growth factors, PI3K, and AKT.","['Maurer, Ulrich', 'Charvet, Celine', 'Wagman, Allan S', 'Dejardin, Emmanuel', 'Green, Douglas R']","['Maurer U', 'Charvet C', 'Wagman AS', 'Dejardin E', 'Green DR']","['Division of Cellular Immunology, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, 10355 Science Center Drive, San Diego, California 92121, USA. ulrich.maurer@mol-med.uni-freiburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell,Molecular cell,9802571,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Permeability', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",2006/03/18 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/03/18 09:00'],"['2005/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/28 00:00 [revised]', '2006/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1097-2765(06)00111-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molcel.2006.02.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell. 2006 Mar 17;21(6):749-60. doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2006.02.009.,,,['Mol Cell. 2006 Mar 17;21(6):728-30.

It forms during late stages of fetal development but continues into early adult life. Myelination correlates with cognitive development and can be regulated by impulse activity through unknown molecular mechanisms. Astrocytes do not form myelin, but these nonneuronal cells can promote myelination in ways that are not understood. Here, we identify a link between myelination, astrocytes, and electrical impulse activity in axons that is mediated by the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). These findings show that LIF is released by astrocytes in response to ATP liberated from axons firing action potentials, and LIF promotes myelination by mature oligodendrocytes. This activity-dependent mechanism promoting myelination could regulate myelination according to functional activity or environmental experience and may offer new approaches to treating demyelinating diseases.","['Ishibashi, Tomoko', 'Dakin, Kelly A', 'Stevens, Beth', 'Lee, Philip R', 'Kozlov, Serguei V', 'Stewart, Colin L', 'Fields, R Douglas']","['Ishibashi T', 'Dakin KA', 'Stevens B', 'Lee PR', 'Kozlov SV', 'Stewart CL', 'Fields RD']","['Nervous System Development and Plasticity Section, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Neuron,Neuron,8809320,"['0 (Anesthetics, Local)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Azo Compounds)', '0 (Brd protein, Drosophila)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (MOG protein, human)', '0 (Mog protein, mouse)', '0 (Mog protein, rat)', '0 (Myelin Basic Protein)', '0 (Myelin Proteins)', '0 (Myelin-Associated Glycoprotein)', '0 (Myelin-Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (O Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', ""35920-39-9 (Adenosine-5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide))"", '4368-28-9 (Tetrodotoxin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9YDL1Q990E (Sudan Black B)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'Y37441OBL1 (2-methylthio-ATP)']",IM,"['Action Potentials/physiology/radiation effects', 'Adenosine/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', ""Adenosine-5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide)/pharmacology"", 'Anesthetics, Local/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Astrocytes/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Axons/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Azo Compounds', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Cell Communication/drug effects/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Cell Count/methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebral Cortex/cytology', 'Coculture Techniques/methods', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drosophila Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electric Stimulation/*methods', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Ganglia, Spinal/cytology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Interleukin-6/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Myelin Basic Protein/metabolism', 'Myelin Proteins/*metabolism', 'Myelin-Associated Glycoprotein/metabolism', 'Myelin-Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein', 'Naphthalenes', 'Neurons/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'O Antigens/metabolism', 'Oligodendroglia/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Stem Cells', 'Tetrodotoxin/pharmacology', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",2006/03/18 09:00,2006/05/12 09:00,['2006/03/18 09:00'],"['2005/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/30 00:00 [revised]', '2006/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0896-6273(06)00096-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.neuron.2006.02.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuron. 2006 Mar 16;49(6):823-32. doi: 10.1016/j.neuron.2006.02.006.,,,['Neuron. 2006 Mar 16;49(6):777-8.

To facilitate testing of new inhibitors in an animal model with similarity to human ASM/MCL, we developed a murine model that is based on retro-orbital injection of P815 cells, a murine mastocytoma line expressing the homologous D814Y mutant of KIT, into syngeneic DBA/2 mice. We found that the systemic disease induced by this approach is highly reproducible and resembles human ASM/MCL.

In this report, CalR before and after irradiation was examined to determine whether they exert different effects on the prevention of radiation-induced myeloid leukemogenesis and the consequent extension of life span by CalR. METHODS: The C3H/HeMS strain, which is prone to radiation-induced myeloid leukemia, was used. Groups subjected to different CalR timings, pre- and postirradiation, were compared with groups not subjected to CalR during their lifetime for the incidences of neoplasms, specifically that of myeloid leukemia, and the incidence of tumor-free death. A single dose of 3Gy X-ray was administered to mice at 10 weeks old. Results of colonization assay before and after CalR were compared with the incidence of leukemogenesis among the groups. RESULTS: Irrespective of the CalR timing in terms of irradiation, there was a significant difference in the prevention of myeloid leukemogenesis, and a consequent difference in longevity (731 approximately 805 days for CalR groups vs. 697 days for the group without CalR; Log rank, P<0.03). During CalR, the number of hemopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), potential leukemogenic targets, significantly decreased (0.4 x 10(4) vs. 4.2 x 10(4) of granulomacrophage colony forming units per spleen; 1.3 x 10(4) vs. 7.6 x 10(4) of the splenic colony forming units per spleen), but this decreased number of HPCs returned to that of the non-CalR control group, when the CalR group was returned to nonrestricted diet (returned to 1.5 x 10(4) granulomacrophage colony-forming units per spleen; returned to 2.8 x 10(4) splenic colony-forming units per spleen). Although preirradiation CalR followed by a conventional non-CalR diet negates the potential preventive effect, prevention conferred by pre-and postirradiation CalR suggests different underlying mechanisms; preirradiation CalR prevents the initiation of direct genotoxic leukemogenesis, while postirradiation CalR the indirect, epigenetic, leukemogenesis. CONCLUSION: The incidences of tumor-free death significantly increased in all the groups undergoing CalR except for the group subjected to preirradiation CalR, which contributed to the longevity of the groups undergoing CalR.","['Yoshida, Kazuko', 'Hirabayashi, Yoko', 'Watanabe, Fumiko', 'Sado, Toshihiko', 'Inoue, Tohru']","['Yoshida K', 'Hirabayashi Y', 'Watanabe F', 'Sado T', 'Inoue T']","['Radiation Hazards Research Group, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Animals', '*Caloric Restriction', '*Death', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*prevention & control', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', '*X-Rays']",2006/03/18 09:00,2006/06/20 09:00,['2006/03/18 09:00'],"['2005/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2005/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(05)00559-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2005.11.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2006 Mar;34(3):274-83. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2005.11.016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated the involvement of autophagy and apoptosis in the Crotoxin-induced death of chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562 cells.

Crotoxin stimulated the autophagic activity as evidenced by the appearance of punctuate monodansylcadaverine (MDC) fluorescence staining in the cytoplasm and increased the formation of autophagosomes. Crotoxin caused the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase-3. Caspase inhibitors attenuated Crotoxin-induced K562 cell death, while blockage of autophagy maturation with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and NH4Cl potentiated the neurotoxin's cytotoxicity.

The aim of this study was to provide information about risk factors for candidaemia in patients with solid tumours. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study. During a 9-year period (1995-2003) we reviewed all cases of candidaemia that affected cancer patients in Santa Casa Complexo Hospitalar, Brazil. RESULTS: During the period of study, 210 patients had the diagnosis of candidaemia in our medical centre, and 83 of these patients had cancer (39.5%). The majority of patients with cancer had solid tumours (77.1%), mostly in the alimentary tract. Most of solid cancers were non-metastatic (71.9%). Major diagnoses in patients with haematological neoplasia were acute leukaemia (n = 13), high grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 5) and Hodgkin's disease (n = 1). Non-Candida albicans species caused 57.8% of the episodes of candidaemia in patients with cancer, mainly in patients with haematological malignancies (p = 0.034). Neutropenia and treatment with corticosteroids were more frequent in the haematological group, in comparison with patients with solid tumours. Only 22.2% of patients with solid tumours were neutropenic before candidaemia. Nonetheless, the presence of ileus and the use of anaerobicides were independent risk factors for candidaemia in patients with solid cancers. The overall mortality in cancer patients with candidaemia was 49.4%. We then compared 2 groups of adult patients with candidaemia. The first was composed of non-neutropenic patients with solid tumours, and the second group included patients without cancer. We found that central venous catheters and gastrointestinal surgery were independently associated with candidaemia in patients with solid tumour. CONCLUSION: Cancer patients with candidaemia seem to have very different predisposing factors to acquire the infection when stratified according to baseline diseases. This study provides some useful clinical information regarding risk for candidaemia in patients with solid tumours.","['Pasqualotto, Alessandro Comaru', 'Rosa, Daniela Dornelles', 'Medeiros, Lidia Rosi', 'Severo, Luiz Carlos']","['Pasqualotto AC', 'Rosa DD', 'Medeiros LR', 'Severo LC']","['Medical School, The University of Manchester, UK. alessandro.pasqualotto@manchester.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Candidiasis/*complications/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Fungemia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Odds Ratio', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2006/03/18 09:00,2006/12/14 09:00,['2006/03/18 09:00'],"['2005/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2334-6-50 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2334-6-50 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2006 Mar 16;6:50. doi: 10.1186/1471-2334-6-50.,20060316,,,,,PMC1431538,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their potential to be expanded in culture as a monolayer and to be induced into different cell lineages in vitro has not been previously reported in detail. In this study, the ectomesenchymal cells in the first branchial arch were enzymatically isolated from the mandibular processes of BALB/c mice and were maintained in an intact state in a medium containing leukaemia inhibitory factor. Here, we first evaluated the proliferative activity of the cells after the third passage, using bromodeoxyuridine labelling and in situ hybridization of telomerase mRNA. Positive staining for expression of HNK-1, S-100 and vimentin confirmed that the population of stem cells originated from the ectomesenchyme, which did not express cytokeratin. Then we investigated the molecular and cellular characteristics of the ectomesenchymal cells during their differentiation towards neurogenic, endothelial, myogenic and odontogenic lineages. Expression of multiple lineage-specific genes and proteins was detected by utilizing a range of molecular and biochemical approaches when the cells were transferred to inductive medium. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis of the induced cells at various intervals indicated obvious phenotypic alteration and presence of specific proteins for the differentiated lineages, for example nestin, factor VIII, alpha-SMA and dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), respectively. Correlatively, results of reverse transcription-PCR corroborated at mRNA level the expression of the characteristic molecules during differentiation. Therefore, it is suggested that the ectomesenchymal cells derived from the first branchial arch may represent a novel source of multipotential stem cells capable of undergoing expansion and variant differentiation in vitro.","['Lin, Yunfeng', 'Yan, Zhengbin', 'Liu, Lei', 'Qiao, Ju', 'Jing, Wei', 'Wu, Ling', 'Chen, Xizhe', 'Li, Zhiyong', 'Tang, Wei', 'Zheng, Xiaohui', 'Tian, Weidong']","['Lin Y', 'Yan Z', 'Liu L', 'Qiao J', 'Jing W', 'Wu L', 'Chen X', 'Li Z', 'Tang W', 'Zheng X', 'Tian W']","['Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, West China College of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Branchial Region/*cytology', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Telomerase/metabolism']",2006/03/18 09:00,2006/05/11 09:00,['2006/03/18 09:00'],"['2006/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['CPR374 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2184.2006.00374.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2006 Apr;39(2):79-92. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.2006.00374.x.,,,,,,PMC6496172,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations of intronic mononucleotide repeats in ATM and MRE11 were found in nine and six lines, respectively, whereas mutations of mononucleotide repeats of RAD50 were found in only one line, and none were found in either NBS1 or ATR. Frequencies of ATM and MRE11 mutations were significantly higher in MSI-positive than MSI-negative lines. These mutations generated aberrant splicing in both genes. The intensity of the aberrant transcript of ATM (497del22) was stronger in five lines harboring mononucleotide mutations of 2 bp or more than in the lines without or with a 1-bp mutation. The intensity of the aberrant transcript of MRE11 (315del88) was stronger in four lines with mononucleotide mutations than in lines without. The expression levels of ATM and MRE11 transcripts in MSI-positive lines were significantly higher than those in MSI-negative lines. MSI-positive cell lines showed delay or abrogation of DSB repair.

While imatinib remains a frontline therapy for CML, patients with advanced disease frequently develop resistance to imatinib therapy through multiple mechanisms. These mechanisms include insufficient potency at therapeutic doses, activation of alternate oncogenic pathways, and overexpression of the multidrug-resistant gene. One of the possible causes of imatinib-acquired resistance is associated with increased expression of the SRC-related kinase Lyn and loss of BCR-ABL dependence arising from sequence mutations. In December 2005, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced that it has completed the rolling NDA submission to the US FDA for dasatinib in the treatment of CML in chronic, accelerated or blast phases, as well as Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in patients with resistance or intolerance to prior treatment. At the Bristol-Myers Squibb R&D Day in May 2005, the company stated that it plans to evaluate dasatinib in solid tumours. In in vitro assays, dasatinib induced apoptosis and had potent activity in the imatinib-resistant tumour cells lines and CML patient specimens. It effectively inhibited the proliferation of cells expressing nearly all imatinib-resistant isoforms. In vivo, dasatinib has shown efficacy, with no apparent toxicity, when administered orally in SCID mice with xenografts of imatinib-sensitive and resistant human CML cells lines.

These include the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia with the Bcr-Abl inhibitor imatinib and non-small-cell lung cancer with the epidermal growth factor inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib. Unfortunately, initially successful therapy is often hampered by relatively rapid onset of resistance to the drug and subsequent relapse, particularly in patients with advanced disease. In the majority of cases this is caused by expansion of clones containing mutated forms of the targeted kinases, which confer insensitivity to the drug of the cancer cell. In addition, multiple factors including pharmacokinetic issues such as suboptimal drug delivery further contribute to resistance formation. Loss of target dependence due to the activation of parallel signaling pathways has also been reported as cause for acquired drug insensitivity.

Single copy (sc) products ranging in length from 62 to 2,304 nucleotides [Rogan et al., 2001; Knoll and Rogan, 2004] from ABL1 (chromosome 9q34), TEKT3 (17p12), PMP22 (17p12), and HOXB1 (17q21) were conjugated to spectrally distinct polystyrene microspheres. These conjugated probes were used in multiplex hybridization to detect homologous target sequences in biotinylated genomic DNA extracted from fixed cell pellets obtained for cytogenetic studies. Hybridized targets were bound to phycoerythrin-labeled streptavidin; then the spectral emissions of both target and conjugated microsphere were codetected by flow cytometry. Prior amplification of locus-specific target DNA was not required because sc probes provide adequate specificity and sensitivity for accurate copy number determination. Copy number differences were distinguishable by comparing the mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) of test probes with a biallelic reference probe in genomic DNA of patient samples and abnormal cell lines. Concerted 5' ABL1 deletions in patient samples with a chromosome 9;22 translocation and chronic myelogenous leukemia were confirmed by comparison of the mean fluorescence intensities of ABL1 test probes with a HOXB1 reference probe. The relative intensities of the ABL1 probes were reduced to 0.59+/-0.02 fold in three different deletion patients and increased 1.42+/-0.01 fold in three trisomic 9 cell lines. TEKT3 and PMP22 probes detected proportionate copy number increases in five patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth Type 1a disease and chromosome 17p12 duplications. Thus, the assay is capable of distinguishing one allele and three alleles from a biallelic reference sequence, regardless of chromosomal context.","['Newkirk, Heather L', 'Rogan, Peter K', 'Miralles, Mauricio', 'Knoll, Joan H M']","['Newkirk HL', 'Rogan PK', 'Miralles M', 'Knoll JH']","[""Laboratory of Genomic Disorders, Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, University of Missouri-Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri 64108, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Mutat,Human mutation,9215429,['0 (DNA Probes)'],IM,"['Cell Line', 'Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease/genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'DNA Probes', 'Gene Dosage/*genetics', 'Genome, Human', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Humans', '*Microspheres', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Trisomy/genetics']",2006/03/17 09:00,2006/12/27 09:00,['2006/03/17 09:00'],"['2006/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/humu.20312 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Mutat. 2006 Apr;27(4):376-86. doi: 10.1002/humu.20312.,,,,,['1R21CA95167-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['Hum Mutat. 2006 Jun;27(6):597'],,,,,,,,,

In all 13 AML patients carrying NPM1 mutations at diagnosis, cDNA RQ-PCR showed >30 000 copies of NPM1-mutated transcript.

In four patients studied at different time intervals, the number of NPM1 copies closely correlated with clinical status and predicted impending hematological relapse in two.

Patients resistant to glucocorticoids (prednisone poor responders (PPR)) have a poorer event-free survival compared to glucocorticoid-sensitive patients (prednisone good responders (PGR)). A case-control study was performed to investigate differential protein expression in leukaemic blasts from PGR and PPR childhood ALL patients. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was used for an unsupervised screening and surface enhanced laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) for the characterisation of protein spots. In difference maps of average gels for the proteomes of each responder group, differentially expressed proteins were identified after tryptic digestion and spotting onto H4-SELDI-TOF-MS chips. Proteins overexpressed in PPR were Catalase, RING finger protein 22 alpha, Valosin-containing protein (VCP) and a G-protein-coupled receptor. Proteins overexpressed in PGR were protein kinase C and malate dehydrogenase. Valosin-containing protein was chosen for validation and quantification by Western blot analysis in a second case-control group of ALL patients. In this second independent cohort, median VCP expression (P25-P75) was 0.15 (0.11-0.28) in PGR and 0.34 (0.14-0.99) in PPR patients (P = 0.04).

Owing to its structural similarity with p53, p73 was originally considered to have tumor suppressor function. However, the discovery of N-terminal truncated isoforms with oncogenic properties showed a 'two in one' structure of its product, p73 protein. The full-length variants are strong inducers of apoptosis, whereas the truncated isoforms inhibit proapoptotic activity of p53 and the full-length p73. Thus, p73 is involved in the regulation of cell cycle, cell death and development. Moreover, it plays a role in carcinogenesis and controls tumor sensitivity to treatment. p73 is commonly expressed in tumor cells in hematological malignancies. Overexpression of p73 protein and aberrant expression of its particular isoforms, with very low frequency of P73 hypermethylation or mutations, were found in malignant myeloproliferations, including acute myeloblastic leukemia. In contrast, hypermethylation and subsequent inactivation of the P73 gene are the most common findings in malignant lymphoproliferative disorders, especially acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Assessment of P73 methylation may provide important prognostic information, as was confirmed in patients with ALL.

These results indicate that AID expression and ASHM are associated with higher-grade transformation of CLL and provide further evidences that AID expression and ASHM may be activated during the clonal history of B-cell lymphomas.","['Reiniger, L', 'Bodor, C', 'Bognar, A', 'Balogh, Z', 'Csomor, J', 'Szepesi, A', 'Kopper, L', 'Matolcsy, A']","['Reiniger L', 'Bodor C', 'Bognar A', 'Balogh Z', 'Csomor J', 'Szepesi A', 'Kopper L', 'Matolcsy A']","['1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RhoH protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/pathology', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics']",2006/03/17 09:00,2006/10/31 09:00,['2006/03/17 09:00'],"['2006/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404183 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404183 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Jun;20(6):1089-95. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404183.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of CT treatment on the ""in vitro"" clonogenicity, the Population Doubling Time (PDT), apoptosis, PKA activation and Bax and Bcl-2 expression was evaluated in WEHI-3B cell line and its CT-resistant subclone (WEHI-3B/CTRES). In WEHI-3B parental cells the dramatic accumulation of cAMP induced by CT correlated well with PKA activation, increased PDT value, inhibition of clonogenicity and apoptosis. H-89 treatment inhibited PKA activation by CT but did not protect the cells from apoptosis and growth inhibition. In WEHI-3B/CTRES no significant CT-dependent accumulation of cAMP occurred with any increase of PKA activity and PDT. In CT resistant cells (WEHI-3B/CTRES), Bcl-2 expression was down regulated by both CT or drug treatment (eg., ciprofloxacin, CPX) although these cells were protected from CT-dependent apoptosis but not from drug-induced apoptosis. Differently from other cell models described, down regulation of Bcl-2 is proved to be independent on cAMP accumulation and PKA activation. Our observations support the implication of cAMP dependent kinase (PKA) in the inhibition of WEHI-3B cells growth and suggest that, in WEHI-3B/CTRES, Bcl-2 expression could be modulated by CT in the absence of cAMP accumulation. Also in consideration of many contradictory data reported in literature, our cell models (of one sensitive parental cell strain and two clones with different uncrossed specific resistance to CT and CPX) provides a new and interesting tool for better investigating the relationship between the CT signal transduction mechanisms and Bcl-2 expression and function.","['Pessina, Augusto', 'Croera, Cristina', 'Savalli, Nicoletta', 'Bonomi, Arianna', 'Cavicchini, Loredana', 'Turlizzi, Elisa', 'Guizzardi, Fabiana', 'Guido, Lucia', 'Daprai, Laura', 'Neri, Maria Grazia']","['Pessina A', 'Croera C', 'Savalli N', 'Bonomi A', 'Cavicchini L', 'Turlizzi E', 'Guizzardi F', 'Guido L', 'Daprai L', 'Neri MG']","['Institute of Microbiology, University of Milan, Via Pascal 36, 20133 Milan, Italy. augusto.pessina@unimi.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cell Res,Cell research,9425763,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cholera Toxin/*pharmacology', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Genes, bcl-2/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/biosynthesis']",2006/03/17 09:00,2006/06/24 09:00,['2006/03/17 09:00'],"['2006/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['7310038 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.cr.7310038 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Res. 2006 Mar;16(3):306-12. doi: 10.1038/sj.cr.7310038.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All those who underwent cranial radiation showed memory impairment. Twenty years after, 49 of them were still alive. On the occasion of the 30th Anniversary of the Department, we contacted their parents and invited them to an encounter: 43 agreed. We wished to learn as much as possible about their current health and psychosocial status. The principal aim of our research was to investigate if any differences existed between the 2 groups and to measure the psychosocial performance of these subjects against comparable Italian figures extracted from the last national census (Census 2001). METHODS: We chose the narrative style for the encounters, because most of them knew about us only from their parents, and we were afraid to use with them questionnaires and official interviews. Most of them did not even know the name of their disease. Our study shows that the whole group of adults had achieved good physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral development and adjustment. Following the narrative approach, we were able to obtain detailed personal information and the values of capacities of each subject. RESULTS: The results showed no significant differences between the 2 groups and the corresponding age-class in the 2001 Italian census as far as education and occupational group were concerned. Only one unemployed subject (with a university degree) was reported among them. The distribution of fathers' occupation perfectly reflected national figures, and long-term survivors in most cases improved their social level. As regards marriage and fertility no difference was seen between the 2 groups. All these statistics parallel, if not exceed, national figures. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis and comparison of long-term cancer survivors' quality of life can yield important clues and insight, and thus contribute to improved approaches towards newly diagnosed patients, not only regarding treatment protocols, but also psychosocial outcomes.","['Massimo, L M', 'Wiley, T J', 'Bonassi, S', 'Caprino, D']","['Massimo LM', 'Wiley TJ', 'Bonassi S', 'Caprino D']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, G.

So far, this detection has been carried out using antibodies against cytoskeletal proteins, such as alpha-smooth muscle actin (1A4) and calponin. However, the specificity of these markers has been questioned since they may be expressed in stromal myofibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle. Recently, two novel myoepithelial markers have been described: the nuclear protein p63, a member of the p53 family, and the surface antigen CD10, also known as common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA). The authors assessed the use of p63 and CD10 in the differential diagnosis between benign sclerosing lesions, such as sclerosing adenosis and radial scar, and tubular carcinoma, in comparison to the traditional myoepithelial markers 1A4 and calponin. p63, CD10, 1A4, and calponin were expressed in myoepithelial cells of all benign lesions and were consistently negative in all cases of tubular carcinoma. In contrast to cytoskeletal proteins, p63 and CD10 were mostly confined to myoepithelial cells and thus were more specific than the traditional counterparts. However, 1A4 was more intensely expressed and more reproducible than the novel markers. In conclusion, p63 and CD10 may be used as a complement to 1A4 in distinguishing benign sclerosing lesions from tubular carcinoma of the breast.","['de Moraes Schenka, Natalia Guimaraes', 'Schenka, Andre Almeida', 'de Souza Queiroz, Luciano', 'de Almeida Matsura, Marisa', 'Alvarenga, Marcelo', 'Vassallo, Jose']","['de Moraes Schenka NG', 'Schenka AA', 'de Souza Queiroz L', 'de Almeida Matsura M', 'Alvarenga M', 'Vassallo J']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medical Sciences, State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (TP63 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/*metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Neprilysin/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Phosphoproteins/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Sclerosis', 'Trans-Activators/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2006/03/17 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/03/17 09:00'],"['2006/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.pai.0000146545.59395.74 [doi]', '00129039-200603000-00013 [pii]']",ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2006 Mar;14(1):71-7. doi: 10.1097/01.pai.0000146545.59395.74.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One drawback of this procedure is the formation of mixed TCR dimers with unknown specificities due to pairing of endogenous and introduced TCR chains. We investigated whether gammadelta T cells can be an alternative effector population for TCR gene transfer because the gammadeltaTCR is not able to form dimers with the alphabetaTCR. Peripheral blood-derived gammadelta T cells were transduced with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I- or HLA class II-restricted minor histocompatibility antigen (mHag) or virus-specific TCRs. Because most gammadelta T cells do not express CD4 and CD8, we subsequently transferred these coreceptors. The TCR-transduced gammadelta T cells exerted high levels of antigen-specific cytotoxicity and produced IFN-gamma and IL-4, particularly in the presence of the relevant coreceptor. gammadelta T cells transferred with a TCR specific for the hematopoiesis-specific mHag HA-2 in combination with CD8 displayed high antileukemic reactivity against HA-2-expressing leukemic cells.

However, lamellarin D maintains a marked cytotoxicity toward cell lines resistant to the reference topoisomerase I poison camptothecin. We therefore hypothesized that topoisomerase I is not the only cellular target for the drug. Using complementary cell-based assays, we provide evidence that lamellarin D acts on cancer cell mitochondria to induce apoptosis. Lamellarin D, unlike camptothecin, induces early disruption of the inner mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Deltapsi(m)) in the P388 leukemia cell line. The functional alterations are largely prevented by cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), but not by the inhibitor of caspases, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(Ome)-fluoromethylketone. Deltapsi(m) disruption is associated with mitochondrial swelling and cytochrome c leakage. Using a reliable real-time flow cytometric monitoring of Deltapsi(m) and swelling of mitochondria isolated from leukemia cells, we show that lamellarin D has a direct MPT-inducing effect. Furthermore, mitochondria are required in a cell-free system to mediate lamellarin D-induced nuclear apoptosis. The direct mitochondrial effect of lamellarin D accounts for the sensitivity of topoisomerase I-mutated P388CPT5 cells resistant to camptothecin. Interestingly, a tumor-active analogue of lamellarin D, designated PM031379, also exerts a direct proapoptotic action on mitochondria, with a more pronounced activity toward mitochondria of tumor cell lines compared with nontumor cell lines. Altogether, this work reinforces the pharmacologic interest of the lamellarins and defines lamellarin D as a lead in the search for treatments against chemoresistant cancer cells.","['Kluza, Jerome', 'Gallego, Miguel-Angel', 'Loyens, Anne', 'Beauvillain, Jean-Claude', 'Sousa-Faro, Jose-Maria Fernandez', 'Cuevas, Carmen', 'Marchetti, Philippe', 'Bailly, Christian']","['Kluza J', 'Gallego MA', 'Loyens A', 'Beauvillain JC', 'Sousa-Faro JM', 'Cuevas C', 'Marchetti P', 'Bailly C']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Reserche Medicale U-524, Institut de Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (lamellarin D)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cell-Free System', 'Coumarins/*pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Rats']",2006/03/17 09:00,2006/05/04 09:00,['2006/03/17 09:00'],"['2006/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/6/3177 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1929 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Mar 15;66(6):3177-87. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1929.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The underlying molecular mechanisms are, however, unknown. NPM is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that has been implicated in several cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis, centrosome duplication, cell cycle progression, and stress response. It has been recently shown that NPM is required for the stabilization and proper nucleolar localization of the tumor suppressor p19(Arf). We report here that the AML-associated NPM mutant localizes mainly in the cytoplasm due to an alteration of its nucleus-cytoplasmic shuttling equilibrium, forms a direct complex with p19(Arf), but is unable to protect it from degradation. Consequently, cells or leukemic blasts expressing the NPM mutant have low levels of cytoplasmic Arf. Furthermore, we show that expression of the NPM mutant reduces the ability of Arf to initiate a p53 response and to induce cell cycle arrest. Inactivation of p19(Arf), a key regulator of the p53-dependent cellular response to oncogene expression, might therefore contribute to leukemogenesis in AMLs with mutated NPM.","['Colombo, Emanuela', 'Martinelli, Paola', 'Zamponi, Raffaella', 'Shing, Danielle C', 'Bonetti, Paola', 'Luzi, Lucilla', 'Volorio, Sara', 'Bernard, Loris', 'Pruneri, Giancarlo', 'Alcalay, Myriam', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe']","['Colombo E', 'Martinelli P', 'Zamponi R', 'Shing DC', 'Bonetti P', 'Luzi L', 'Volorio S', 'Bernard L', 'Pruneri G', 'Alcalay M', 'Pelicci PG']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/genetics/*metabolism']",2006/03/17 09:00,2006/05/04 09:00,['2006/03/17 09:00'],"['2006/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/6/3044 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2378 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Mar 15;66(6):3044-50. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2378.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The best-studied cases involve the inheritance of heterochromatic chromosomal domains, and little is known about specific gene regulation by epigenetic mechanisms. Recent evidence shows that epigenesis pivots on methylation of nucleosomes at histone 3 lysines 4, 9 or 27. Bioinformatics indicates that mammals have several enzymes for each of these methylations, including at least six histone 3 lysine 4 methyltransferases. To look for evidence of gene-specific epigenetic regulation in mammalian development, we examined one of these six, Mll2, using a multipurpose allele in the mouse to ascertain the loss-of-function phenotype. Loss of Mll2 slowed growth, increased apoptosis and retarded development, leading to embryonic failure before E11.5. Using chimera experiments, we demonstrated that Mll2 is cell-autonomously required. Evidence for gene-specific regulation was also observed. Although Mox1 and Hoxb1 expression patterns were correctly established, they were not maintained in the absence of Mll2, whereas Wnt1 and Otx2 were. The Mll2 loss-of-function phenotype is different from that of its sister gene Mll, and they regulate different Hox complex genes during ES cell differentiation. Therefore, these two closely related epigenetic factors play different roles in development and maintain distinct gene expression patterns. This suggests that other epigenetic factors also regulate particular patterns and that development entails networks of epigenetic specificities.","['Glaser, Stefan', 'Schaft, Julia', 'Lubitz, Sandra', 'Vintersten, Kristina', 'van der Hoeven, Frank', 'Tufteland, Katharina R', 'Aasland, Rein', 'Anastassiadis, Konstantinos', 'Ang, Siew-Lan', 'Stewart, A Francis']","['Glaser S', 'Schaft J', 'Lubitz S', 'Vintersten K', 'van der Hoeven F', 'Tufteland KR', 'Aasland R', 'Anastassiadis K', 'Ang SL', 'Stewart AF']","['Genomics, BioInnovationsZentrum, Dresden University of Technology, Am Tatzberg 47, Dresden 01307, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2b protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*physiology', 'Female', 'Fetal Growth Retardation/genetics', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/physiology', 'Genes, Lethal', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*deficiency/*genetics/physiology', 'Phenotype']",2006/03/17 09:00,2006/06/14 09:00,['2006/03/17 09:00'],"['2006/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['dev.02302 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.02302 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2006 Apr;133(8):1423-32. doi: 10.1242/dev.02302.

Here we have found a differential subcellular distribution of the alkyl-lysophospholipid edelfosine in leukemic and solid tumor cells that leads to distinct anticancer responses. Edelfosine induced rapid apoptosis in human leukemic cells, including acute T-cell leukemia Jurkat and Peer cells, but promoted a late apoptotic response, preceded by G(2)/M arrest, in human solid tumor cells such as cervix epitheloid carcinoma HeLa cells and lung carcinoma A549 cells. c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and caspase-3 were accordingly activated at earlier times in edelfosine-treated Jurkat cells as compared with drug-treated HeLa cells. Both leukemic and solid tumor cells took up this alkyl-lysophospholipid and expressed the two putative edelfosine targets, namely cell surface Fas death receptor (also known as APO-1 or CD95) and endoplasmic reticulum CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase. However, edelfosine was mainly located to plasma membrane lipid rafts in Jurkat and Peer leukemic cells and to endoplasmic reticulum in solid tumor HeLa and A549 cells. Edelfosine induced translocation of Fas, Fas-associated death domain-containing protein, and JNK into membrane rafts in Jurkat cells, but not in HeLa cells. In contrast, edelfosine inhibited phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in both HeLa and A549 cells, but not in Jurkat or Peer leukemic cells, before the triggering of apoptosis. These data indicate that edelfosine targets two different subcellular structures in a cell type-dependent manner, namely cell surface lipid rafts in leukemic cells and endoplasmic reticulum in solid tumor cells.","['Nieto-Miguel, Teresa', 'Gajate, Consuelo', 'Mollinedo, Faustino']","['Nieto-Miguel T', 'Gajate C', 'Mollinedo F']","['Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas-Universidad de Salamanca, Campus Miguel de Unamuno, E-37007 Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lysophospholipids/*chemistry', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Phospholipid Ethers/*pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/biosynthesis']",2006/03/17 09:00,2006/07/11 09:00,['2006/03/17 09:00'],"['2006/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)72427-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M511251200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 May 26;281(21):14833-40. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M511251200.

In APL, PML is involved in a chromosomal translocation generating the PML-retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARalpha) fusion protein. Two missense mutations in the remaining PML alleles have been identified, which give rise to a truncated cytoplasmic PML protein (Mut PML). APL patients carrying these mutations display resistance to retinoic acid (RA) and very poor prognosis. Here we show that Mut PML associates with the cytoplasmic regions we refer to as PML-cytoplasmic bodies (PML-CBs). Mut PML interacts with PML-RARalpha in PML-CB and potentiates PML-RARalpha-mediated inhibition of RA-dependent transcription. Remarkably, Mut PML stabilizes PML-RARalpha and inhibits differentiation induced by pharmacological doses of RA. A mutant form of PML-RARalpha that accumulates in the cytoplasm inhibits RA-dependent transcription and differentiation, thus suggesting that cytoplasmic localization of PML-RARalpha may contribute to transformation. Finally, we show that the bcr3 PML-RARalpha form is predominantly cytoplasmic and accumulates in PML-CBs.

Usually, cancer patients undergo radiotherapy besides chemotherapy and surgery. It is hypothesized that radiation exposure would induce HTLV-I genome generation/activation, nevertheless there is not any report on experimental procedures trying to demonstrate HTLV-I gene expression in cells exposed to ionizing radiation. Anyway, earlier experimental works by Lieberman and Kaplan in 1959 succeeded to isolate retroviral particles, the radiation leukemia virus (RadLV), from thymic lymphomas of X-ray-irradiated C57BL/Ka mice, assuming that RadLV activated in the host by ionizing radiation, is released and transported to the thymus, where lymphoblasts, generated during the postradiation recovery phase, constitute an optimal target cell population for both replication of and eventual transformation by virus. Recent studies claim that besides RadLV, another retrovirus (RadLV-0) also induced by ionizing radiation is expressed and would be responsible for transformed cells of bone marrow origin. Epidemiological studies coincidentally point out to high incidence of HTLV-I infection in geographic areas displaying significant levels of radioactivity contamination as in Central Africa, Japan Islands and Mururoa Atoll. In our research work, we detected HTLV-I antibodies and viral genome integration in cancer patients of cervix and uterus and health care workers, whose had been exposed to ionizing radiation during radiotherapeutic procedures. Recombinational events among endogenous retrovirus and other retrogenic elements in the host cell genome under the bombardment of ionizing radiation from different sources could have optimized the phenomena occurrence or even ignited them to happen, generating HTLV-I genome, related viral peptides and virions. Therefore, it is feasible that exposure to ionizing radiation during therapeutic procedures could generate HTLV-I genome or induce the virus to be expressed in cells of cancer patients submitted to radiotherapy as also in healthy subjects under the same conditions, in artificial or natural radiation environment.","['Barros Kanzaki, Luis Isamu']",['Barros Kanzaki LI'],"['PIADICUFAP, Federal University of Amapa, Rodovia Juscelino Kubtscheck de Oliveira, Km 02, CEP 68 902 280, Macapa, Amapa, Brazil.

These marrow lesions are currently considered to be metastatic in origin, but as fibrosis and sclerosis are identifying features they are here equated to myelofibrosis. Myelofibrotic marrow is characterized by an increase in the number and size of vascular sinusoids. The increased blood flow suggested by this morphology, and observed in myelofibrosis patients, causes a rise in marrow pressure which may trigger the fibrosis. Specific carcinoma morphologies are equated to stages in endochondral bone and marrow formation and, as such, cancer cell identity varies with morphology. For example, infiltrating carcinomas of the breast consist of collagen and mucoid secreting cells in single file formation. This morphology is equated to the cartilagenous stage of marrow formation, when mesenchymal stem cells proliferate and differentiate into chondroblasts. In this model ""infiltrating"" cells arise in situ from stem cells located in the connective tissue. Tubular breast carcinoma, with its single layer of osteoblast-like carcinoma cells encircling small lumens and long branching tubules, is equated to the trabecular stage of marrow formation during which osteoblasts surround small pieces of calcified cartilage and begin secreting osteoid that will form the trabeculae. Lobular carcinoma in situ consists of cancer cell clusters separated by narrow clear spaces that, under high magnification, appear vascular. This morphology is equated to hematopoietic tissue in which primitive hematopoietic cells lie between anastomosing sinusoids. Similar cartilagenous, trabecular and hematopoietic morphologies can be found in carcinomatous tumors of most organs, but the nomenclature is variable. The hematopoietic carcinomas share numerous features with hematopoietic tissue including a structure composed of intermingled normoxic and hypoxic regions and a metabolism characterized by elevated levels of glycolysis. They also contain similar proportions of clonal cells. If this model is correct it necessitates a change in the treatment of carcinoma. If cancer cells are not the enemy, but desperately needed immature blood cells, and the medical problem is not the presence of tumors, but the inefficiency of this extramedullary hematopoietic tissue, then treatment should focus on increasing marrow hematopoiesis. As evidence suggests that the marrow lesion is the result of increased hydrostatic pressure this could be done by reducing blood volume. One way to accomplish this may be through the ingestion of ephedrine, as it is hypothesized to increase vascular tone.","['Schiel, Kathryn Ann']",['Schiel KA'],['kschiel@tvi.edu'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Carcinoma/diagnosis/*etiology/pathology', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', '*Hematopoiesis, Extramedullary', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms/diagnosis/*etiology/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/pathology']",2006/03/17 09:00,2006/08/15 09:00,['2006/03/17 09:00'],"['2006/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0306-9877(06)00095-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mehy.2006.01.037 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 2006;67(1):93-109. doi: 10.1016/j.mehy.2006.01.037.

Like other leukemia associated aberrations they are also present in healthy adults. To delineate the leukemogenic mechanism we tracked down MLL-PTD in normal hematopoiesis and investigated cord blood samples. MLL-PTD were observed in 56/60 (93%) of all cord bloods. In contrast to AML, the transcript frequency in cord blood was four log scales lower as determined by real-time PCR. The CD34+ progenitor cell, CD33+ myeloid, CD19+ B-lymphoid and CD3+ T-lymphoid subfractions were positive. The ubiquitous presence of MLL-PTD in cord blood implicates a lifelong exposure, not an accumulation during lifetime.

Statins induce apoptosis in different cell culture systems including rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. We investigated possible effects of different statins in vitro in human adult cardiac myocytes on the expression of proteins thought to be involved in the regulation of apoptosis such as Mcl-1, an inhibitor of apoptosis, Bax, an inducer of apoptosis, as well as on cytoplasmic histone-associated-DNA-fragments. Human adult cardiac myocytes (HACM) were treated with different statins at concentrations from 0.01 to 5 microM for up to 96 h. Whereas the lipophilic statin simvastatin at a concentration of 5 microM downregulated Mcl-1 mRNA by 49%, the hydrophilic pravastatin had no effect. Bax mRNA levels were not affected by neither of the statins. Simvastatin but not pravastatin reduced Mcl-1 protein expression whereas Bax protein was not detectable in HACM as determined by Western blotting. Simvastatin, atorvastatin and fluvastatin induced an up to seven-fold increase in histone-associated-DNA-fragments whereas pravastatin did not. Simvastatin up regulated histone-associated-DNA-fragments dose-dependently, and mevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate reversed this effect to control levels. Our results show that lipophilic statins can induce a pro-apoptotic state in human adult cardiac myocytes in vitro. We speculate that, similar to findings in animal models, statins might be involved in the attenuation of cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling in humans by modulating the balance between cell survival and apoptosis.","['Demyanets, Svitlana', 'Kaun, Christoph', 'Pfaffenberger, Stefan', 'Hohensinner, Philipp J', 'Rega, Gersina', 'Pammer, Johannes', 'Maurer, Gerald', 'Huber, Kurt', 'Wojta, Johann']","['Demyanets S', 'Kaun C', 'Pfaffenberger S', 'Hohensinner PJ', 'Rega G', 'Pammer J', 'Maurer G', 'Huber K', 'Wojta J']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University Vienna, A-1090 Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, and 3rd Medical Department for Cardiology and Emergency Medicine, Wilhelminenspital, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated)', '0 (Heptanoic Acids)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '4L066368AS (Fluvastatin)', 'A0JWA85V8F (Atorvastatin)', 'AGG2FN16EV (Simvastatin)', 'KXO2KT9N0G (Pravastatin)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Apoptosis', 'Atorvastatin', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated/pharmacology', 'Fluvastatin', 'Heptanoic Acids/pharmacology', 'Histones', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Pravastatin/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Simvastatin/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2006/03/17 09:00,2006/05/23 09:00,['2006/03/17 09:00'],"['2005/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/25 00:00 [revised]', '2006/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(06)00068-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2006.01.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2006 Apr 28;71(9):1324-30. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2006.01.016.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 235 patients diagnosed with ALL in the central region of Cuba from 1972 to 2000 were included. Four groups were considered according to the diagnostic period and treatment protocol. Group 1 was composed of 20 patients who did not receive a uniform treatment regimen. The remaining groups were treated with different protocols of the Latin American Group for Malignant Hemopathy Therapy (Glathem). Group 2 was treated with less aggressive classical regimens from the 1970s, and groups 3 and 4 received more aggressive regimens, type Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM). Intravenous high-dose methotrexate was used in group 4 but not in group 3. Classification by prognostic groups was based on age and leukocyte count. RESULTS: Of 215 patients included in the Glathem protocols, remission occurred in 197 (91.6%). Overall survival in the distinct treatment groups progressively increased during the study period, from a 5-year survival of 15% in group 1 to 72% in group 4. Event-free survival in patients included in the Glathem protocols increased from 42% in group 2 (classical protocols) to 68.7% in the BFM protocols (groups 3 and 4). Significant differences were found among the different treatment and prognostic groups considered. CONCLUSIONS: During the period analyzed, survival in children with ALL progressively increased in parallel with improved treatment regimens. These results demonstrate the importance of well-programmed polychemotherapy to achieve prolonged survival and a high percentage of cure in this disease.","['Vergara Dominguez, B', 'Cedre Hernandez, T', 'Martinez Cardenas, L', 'Lopez Garcia, C', 'Gonzalez Seivane, F', 'Pichs Leon, V', 'Alegret Martinez, M', 'Perez Garcia, S', 'Courell Martin, G', 'Castro Martinez, M E']","['Vergara Dominguez B', 'Cedre Hernandez T', 'Martinez Cardenas L', 'Lopez Garcia C', 'Gonzalez Seivane F', 'Pichs Leon V', 'Alegret Martinez M', 'Perez Garcia S', 'Courell Martin G', 'Castro Martinez ME']","['Hospital Pediatrico Universitario Jose Luis Miranda de Santa Clara, Villa Clara, Cuba. bvergara@capiro.vcl.sld.cu']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,An Pediatr (Barc),"Anales de pediatria (Barcelona, Spain : 2003)",101162596,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Survival Analysis']",2006/03/17 09:00,2006/03/29 09:00,['2006/03/17 09:00'],"['2006/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['13083832 [pii]', '10.1016/s1695-4033(06)70009-1 [doi]']",ppublish,An Pediatr (Barc). 2006 Jan;64(1):52-8. doi: 10.1016/s1695-4033(06)70009-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,Evolucion de la leucemia linfoblastica aguda en la edad pediatrica en 29 anos (1972-2000).,,,,,,,

METHODS: The localization of IkappaBalpha protein was investigated by using an immunofluorescence method. The expression of IkappaBalpha and NF-kappaB /p65 proteins in Raji and U937 cells were investigated by using Western blotting. Apoptosis was detected through annexin V/PI double-labeled cytometry. RESULTS: IkappaBalpha localized in the cytoplasm in untreated and deguelin-treated cells. After treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) or deguelin plus TNF-alpha for 15 min, there was a substantial reduction in the amount of IkappaBalpha protein.

Also described are the first syntheses, by modular amide coupling reactions, of the natural product purealidin A (a component of purealin) and a small library of analogues. The library was examined for inhibition of cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain and cell growth. The compounds showed effective antiproliferative activity against a mouse leukemia cell line but selective activities against human carcinoma cell lines. Purealin and some of the analogues inhibited the microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity of recombinant cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain motor domain. The inhibitory effect of purealin was concentration dependent and uncompetitive, supporting the hypothesis that it does not compete with the binding of ATP.","['Zhu, Guangyu', 'Yang, Fanglong', 'Balachandran, Raghavan', 'Hook, Peter', 'Vallee, Richard B', 'Curran, Dennis P', 'Day, Billy W']","['Zhu G', 'Yang F', 'Balachandran R', 'Hook P', 'Vallee RB', 'Curran DP', 'Day BW']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15260, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bromobenzenes)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '100101-28-8 (purealin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.4.2 (Dyneins)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/chemistry', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Bromobenzenes/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytoplasm/enzymology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Dyneins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Porifera', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2006/03/17 09:00,2006/04/29 09:00,['2006/03/17 09:00'],"['2006/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm051030l [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2006 Mar 23;49(6):2063-76. doi: 10.1021/jm051030l.,,,,,"['CA078039/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM047434/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CMN inhibited the proliferation of K562 leukemic cells by induction of apoptosis. The current study demonstrated synergy with combination of drug therapy, and suggested that combination of ferulic acid and cisplatin synergistically inhibited cellular proliferation. Cytotoxic synergy was observed independent of the sequence of addition of two drugs to cultured cells. The synergized growth inhibitory effect with cisplatin was probably associated with G2-M arrest in cell cycle progression. These findings suggested that among the cinnamoyl compounds, CMN was most potent and FER appeared to be a better modulating agent on human malignant cell line.","['Indap, M A', 'Radhika, S', 'Motiwale, Leena', 'Rao, K V K']","['Indap MA', 'Radhika S', 'Motiwale L', 'Rao KV']","['Chemotherapy Group, Khanolkar Shodhika, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer (ACTREC), Tata Memorial Centre, Kharghar, Navi Mumbai 410 208, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Exp Biol,Indian journal of experimental biology,0233411,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclodextrins)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Polyphenols)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Curcuma/*chemistry', 'Curcumin/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cyclodextrins/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Phenols/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Polyphenols']",2006/03/17 09:00,2006/08/22 09:00,['2006/03/17 09:00'],"['2006/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Indian J Exp Biol. 2006 Mar;44(3):216-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microfilaments, the motile apparatus is known to regulate these changes by polymerization of monomeric G-actin to fibrous F-actin. PMNL from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients have been reported to be defective in locomotion in response to synthetic peptide, n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) but the mechanism leading to defective locomotion and their spatial reorganization remains unclear. Therefore, in order to study the cause of defective motility of PMNL from CML patients the spatial distribution and reorganization of microfilaments and microtubules in response to fMLP have been examined by transmission electron (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Under SEM, the PMNL-CML surface appeared smoother with reduced ruffling resulting in rounding off cells with lesser polarized morphology. Unstimulated PMNL from normal as well as CML subjects showed shorter and fewer microtubules and evenly distributed microfilaments as compared to fMLP stimulated PMNL. It is proposed that the cause of defective locomotion was due to reduced surface activity as a consequence of altered cytoskeletal configuration. This phenomenon seems to be related to impaired functional appendages and as a whole led to the defective cell motility and hence reduced chemotaxis in PMNL from CML patients.","['Kamble, G', 'Advani, S H', 'Bhisey, A N']","['Kamble G', 'Advani SH', 'Bhisey AN']","['Chemical Carcinogenesis, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Cancer Research Institute, Tata Memorial Centre, Kharghar, Navi Mumbai 410 208.

While some patients have indolent disease, others require aggressive treatment within a short time after diagnosis. Differences in the expression of proteins regulating cell cycle and apoptosis may be responsible for the heterogeneous course of the disease. Recently, protein ZAP 70 [zeta-chain (T-cell receptor) associated protein kinase 70 kDa] has been found to be differentially expressed within two biologic subgroups, characterized by the presence or absence of somatic mutations in specific immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region genes. In the present work, we analyzed highly purified B-CLL cells from 60 patients for ZAP 70 expression and the expression of cyclin E, bcl-2, bax, and mcl-1 as well as the ratios of bcl-2/bax and mcl-1/bax. The results indicate that cyclin E is expressed significantly higher in ZAP 70-positive as in ZAP 70-negative samples. We did not observe significant differences within the expression of Bcl-2 family member proteins. We conclude that higher cyclin E expression in samples of ZAP 70-positive patients may reflect a larger proliferating compartment in vivo compared to ZAP 70-negative patients and that cyclin E may add prognostic information in this context for patients with B-CLL.","['Bogner, Christian', 'Sandherr, Michael', 'Perker, Michael', 'Weick, Katrin', 'Ringshausen, Ingo', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Decker, Thomas']","['Bogner C', 'Sandherr M', 'Perker M', 'Weick K', 'Ringshausen I', 'Peschel C', 'Decker T']","['IIIrd Department of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Ismaningerstrasse 15, 81675, Munich, Germany. christian.bogner@lrz.tu-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cyclin E/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/deficiency/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/deficiency/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/deficiency/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/deficiency/*genetics']",2006/03/16 09:00,2007/01/19 09:00,['2006/03/16 09:00'],"['2005/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-005-0076-y [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2006 Jul;85(7):458-62. doi: 10.1007/s00277-005-0076-y.

A weighed voting technique is going to be used to improve the prediction of the number of clusters based on different data mining techniques. These tools may be used for the identification of new tumour classes using DNA microarray datasets. This estimation approach may perform a useful tool to support biological and biomedical knowledge discovery. METHODS: Three clustering and two validation algorithms were applied to two cancer tumor datasets. Recent studies confirm that there is no universal pattern recognition and clustering model to predict molecular profiles across different datasets. Thus, it is useful not to rely on one single clustering or validation method, but to apply a variety of approaches. Therefore, combination of these methods may be successfully used for the estimation of the number of clusters. RESULTS: The methods implemented in this research may contribute to the validation of clustering results and the estimation of the number of clusters. The results show that this estimation approach may represent an effective tool to support biomedical knowledge discovery and healthcare applications. CONCLUSION: The methods implemented in this research may be successfully used for the estimation of the number of clusters.

A total of 762 predominantly voided urine specimens with a cytologic diagnosis of polyoma virus-type change were retrieved from the cytopathology files of the Johns Hopkins Hospital over a 15-year period (1988-2003). Biopsies were available for 33 cases (29 patients) following or preceding the urinary cytology (mean interval, 210 days). The biopsies originated primarily from bladder (n=31) with one biopsy each from renal pelvis and urethra. Representative paraffin blocks were chosen from each case for immunoperoxidase staining with SV40 large T antigen. There were 22 males and 7 females with an age range of 34 to 79 years (mean, 64.7 years). The histologic diagnoses of the 33 tissue biopsies were: benign urothelium (n=9), urothelial carcinoma (n=21) and 1 case each of dysplasia, small cell carcinoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia involving lamina propria of the bladder. Only 3 of 33 biopsies on hematoxylin-stained sections showed morphologic changes of polyoma virus, which lacked sufficient tissue to perform immunohistochemistry for SV40 large T antigen (LTag). Immunohistochemical staining for LTag was positive in 7 cases. Only 2 cases showed strong/diffuse and moderate/focal staining for LTag with both representing invasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma (where no inclusions were seen on hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections) and both demonstrating positive immunostaining for p53. One of these 2 cases was from an organ transplant recipient and the other from a patient with no known immunosuppression. Our data lead to the following conclusions: 1) cytology appears to be more sensitive than histology in detecting cells with polyoma virus; 2) cytohistologic discordance might be due to: a) polyoma (BK) virus infected cells are shed from the tissue and collected in the urine; b) polyoma virus changes may be focal and not sampled in directed tissue biopsies; c) polyoma virus changes may originate from sites in the genitourinary tract other than the bladder; d) the lack of a ""gold standard"" to confirm the cytologic diagnoses of polyoma virus; and e) the discordance in time between the biopsy and cytology specimens in the current retrospective study. 3) Because some cytologically benign cases of polyoma virus were associated with malignant biopsies, careful morphologic evaluation is required to avoid false-negative urinary cytology samples. This investigation further examined the immunohistochemical staining pattern for SV40 LTag and p53 in noninvasive low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma using a tissue microarray constructed from bladder biopsies of 79 randomly selected patients.

The molecular mechanisms and biological significance of this proteolytic process have remained obscure. Here, we show that TFIIA is a substrate of taspase 1 as reported for the trithorax group mixed-lineage leukemia protein. We demonstrate that recombinant taspase 1 cleaves TFIIA in vitro. Transfected taspase 1 enhances cleavage of TFIIA, and RNA interference knockdown of endogenous taspase 1 diminishes cleavage of TFIIA in vivo. In taspase 1-/- MEF cells, only uncleaved TFIIA is detected. In Xenopus laevis embryos, knockdown of TFIIA results in phenotype and expression defects. Both defects can be rescued by expression of an uncleavable TFIIA mutant. Our study shows that uncleaved TFIIA is transcriptionally active and that cleavage of TFIIA does not serve to render TFIIA competent for transcription. We propose that cleavage fine tunes the transcription regulation of a subset of genes during differentiation and development.","['Zhou, Huiqing', 'Spicuglia, Salvatore', 'Hsieh, James J-D', 'Mitsiou, Dimitra J', 'Hoiby, Torill', 'Veenstra, Gert Jan C', 'Korsmeyer, Stanley J', 'Stunnenberg, Hendrik G']","['Zhou H', 'Spicuglia S', 'Hsieh JJ', 'Mitsiou DJ', 'Hoiby T', 'Veenstra GJ', 'Korsmeyer SJ', 'Stunnenberg HG']","['NCMLS, Department of Molecular Biology, 191, Radboud University of Nijmegen, P.O.

The stem cell leukemia gene (SCL/tal 1) encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is essential for the normal development of blood progenitors and blood vessels. We have previously characterized a panel of SCL enhancers including the +19 element, which directs expression to hematopoietic stem cells and endothelium. Here we demonstrate that SCL is expressed in bone primordia during embryonic development and in adult osteoblasts. Despite consistent expression in cells of the osteogenic lineage, SCL protein is not required for bone specification of embryonic stem cells. In transgenic mice, the SCL +19 core enhancer directed reporter gene expression to vascular smooth muscle and bone in addition to blood and endothelium. A 644-bp fragment containing the SCL +19 core enhancer was active in both blood and bone cell lines and was bound in vivo by a common array of Ets and GATA transcription factors. Taken together with the recent observation that a common progenitor can give rise to blood and bone cells, our results suggest that the SCL +19 enhancer targets a mesodermal progenitor capable of generating hematopoietic, vascular, and osteoblastic progeny.","['Pimanda, John E', 'Silberstein, Lev', 'Dominici, Massimo', 'Dekel, Benjamin', 'Bowen, Mark', 'Oldham, Scott', 'Kallianpur, Asha', 'Brandt, Stephen J', 'Tannahill, David', 'Gottgens, Berthold', 'Green, Anthony R']","['Pimanda JE', 'Silberstein L', 'Dominici M', 'Dekel B', 'Bowen M', 'Oldham S', 'Kallianpur A', 'Brandt SJ', 'Tannahill D', 'Gottgens B', 'Green AR']","['Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 2XY, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ELF1 protein, human)', '0 (Elf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/deficiency/*genetics', 'Blood/*metabolism', 'Bone and Bones/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*genetics', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Osteogenesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/*genetics', 'Skeleton', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics']",2006/03/16 09:00,2006/04/25 09:00,['2006/03/16 09:00'],"['2006/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/7/2615 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.26.7.2615-2625.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2006 Apr;26(7):2615-25. doi: 10.1128/MCB.26.7.2615-2625.2006.,,,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],PMC1430329,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated time trends in childhood leukemia by using Poisson regression methods to analyze data from the National Registry of Childhood Tumours, a long-standing high-quality registry that covers the whole childhood population of Britain. During 1974-2000, the average annual percentage change in rate (AAC) of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Britain was 0.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.4 to 1.0). This increase was apparently driven by the ""common"" subtype (expressing the CD10 antigen) of precursor B-cell ALL, for which the estimated AAC during 1980-1996 was 1.4% (95% CI = 0.8 to 2.0). There was no statistically significant time trend in other subtypes of ALL combined (1980-1996) or in acute myeloid leukemia (1974-2000). Small peaks in incidence of ALL in 1976 and 1990 coincided with years immediately following influenza epidemics. These results are consistent with hypotheses that some childhood leukemia may be triggered by infection occurring close to the time of diagnosis of leukemia, particularly in conditions of low herd immunity, and raise the possibility that contact with influenza shortly before the diagnosis of leukemia may sometimes be involved.","['Kroll, Mary E', 'Draper, Gerald J', 'Stiller, Charles A', 'Murphy, Michael F G']","['Kroll ME', 'Draper GJ', 'Stiller CA', 'Murphy MF']","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom. mary.kroll@ccrg.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/epidemiology/virology', 'Child', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Influenza, Human/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Registries', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2006/03/16 09:00,2006/03/22 09:00,['2006/03/16 09:00'],"['2006/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['98/6/417 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djj095 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2006 Mar 15;98(6):417-20. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djj095.,,,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 2006 Dec 6;98(23):1746; author reply 1746-7.

We hypothesized that DNA methylation and histone acetylation of the C/EBPalpha promoter may modulate C/EBPalpha expression in lung cancer. METHODS: We analyzed C/EBPalpha expression in 15 human lung cancer cell lines and in 122 human lung primary tumors by northern blotting, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry. C/EBPalpha promoter methylation was assessed using bisulfite sequencing, combined bisulfite restriction analysis, methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, and Southern blotting. We examined the acetylation status of histones H3 and H4 at the C/EBPalpha promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Binding of methyl-CpG-binding proteins MeCP2 and MBD2 and upstream stimulatory factor (USF) to the C/EBPalpha promoter was assayed in cell lines that were untreated or treated with histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A and demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) by chromatin immunoprecipitation and by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. RESULTS: DNA methylation and histone acetylation in the upstream region (-1422 to -896) of the C/EBPalpha promoter were associated with low or absent C/EBPalpha expression in 12 of 15 lung cancer cell lines and in 81 of 120 primary lung tumors. MeCP2 and MBD binding to the upstream C/EBPalpha promoter was detected in C/EBPalpha-nonexpressing cell lines; USF binding was detected in C/EBPalpha-expressing cell lines; however, in C/EBPalpha-nonexpressing cell lines USF binding was detected only after trichostatin A and 5-aza-dC treatment. CONCLUSIONS: DNA hypermethylation of the upstream C/EBPalpha promoter region, not the core promoter region as previously reported, is critical in the regulation of C/EBPalpha expression in human lung cancer.","['Tada, Yasuhiro', 'Brena, Romulo Martin', 'Hackanson, Bjorn', 'Morrison, Carl', 'Otterson, Gregory A', 'Plass, Christoph']","['Tada Y', 'Brena RM', 'Hackanson B', 'Morrison C', 'Otterson GA', 'Plass C']","['Division of Human Cancer Genetics, Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics, The Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (MBD2 protein, human)', '0 (MECP2 protein, human)', '0 (Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2)', '0 (Upstream Stimulatory Factors)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', ""66642-55-5 (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine-5'-monophosphate)"", 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*analysis/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lung Neoplasms/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Upstream Stimulatory Factors/drug effects/*metabolism']",2006/03/16 09:00,2006/03/22 09:00,['2006/03/16 09:00'],"['2006/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['98/6/396 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djj093 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2006 Mar 15;98(6):396-406. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djj093.,,,,,['P30CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the temporal association between the oral presentation of the results from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) Study 9344 at the May 1998 meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which showed that paclitaxel improves survival of women with lymph node-positive breast cancer, and use of taxane chemotherapy for breast cancer. METHODS: We studied chemotherapy use in 3341 women identified through the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database who were diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer in 1994-1999 at age 65 years or older and received adjuvant chemotherapy, as identified through claims data, within 1 year of diagnosis. We assessed the temporal association between the CALBG presentation and taxane use with piecewise regression analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine which patient characteristics were associated with taxane use. RESULTS: The use of taxanes increased substantially after the CALGB presentation, with absolute rates of taxane use of 5.2% before May 1998 and 23.6% in May 1998 and later. Initially, this increase was confined to patients with lymph node-positive disease (40% of whom were receiving taxanes by the end of 1999), but over time it extended to patients with lymph node-negative disease (15% of whom were receiving taxanes by the end of 1999). In multivariable analysis, patients who were treated in May 1998 or later were statistically significantly more likely to have received a taxane than patients treated before this date (estimated relative risk = 6.84, 95% confidence interval = 5.71 to 8.07). Younger patient age, larger number of lymph nodes involved, higher tumor grade, and larger tumor size were also independently associated with adjuvant taxane use. CONCLUSIONS: The oral presentation of a single study at a national conference was temporally associated with an increase in the use of taxanes for primary breast cancer, even before study publication or Food and Drug Administration approval.","['Giordano, Sharon H', 'Duan, Zhigang', 'Kuo, Yong-Fang', 'Hortobagyi, Gabriel N', 'Freeman, Jean', 'Goodwin, James S']","['Giordano SH', 'Duan Z', 'Kuo YF', 'Hortobagyi GN', 'Freeman J', 'Goodwin JS']","['Department of Breast Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.

Treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor LBH589 (Novartis) depletes Bcr-Abl levels. We determined the effects of AMN107 and/or LBH589 in Bcr-Abl-expressing human K562 and LAMA-84 cells, as well as in primary chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells. AMN107 was more potent than imatinib mesylate (IM) in inhibiting Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase (TK) activity and attenuating p-STAT5, p-AKT, Bcl-x(L), and c-Myc levels in K562 and LAMA-84 cells. Cotreatment with LBH589 and AMN107 exerted synergistic apoptotic effects with more attenuation of p-STAT5, p-ERK1/2, c-Myc, and Bcl-x(L) and increases in p27 and Bim levels.

We hypothesized that, in patients with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), cells with this phenotype detected early in treatment should be leukemic rather than normal. We therefore developed a simple and inexpensive flow cytometric assay for such cells and prospectively applied it to bone marrow samples collected on day 19 from 380 children with B-lineage ALL. In 211 patients (55.5%), these cells represented 0.01% or more of the mononuclear cells; results correlated remarkably well with those of more complex flow cytometric and molecular minimal residual disease (MRD) evaluations. Among 84 uniformly treated children, the 10-year incidence of relapse or remission failure was 28.8% +/- 7.1% (SE) for the 42 patients with 0.01% or more leukemic cells on day 19 detected by the simplified assay versus 4.8% +/- 3.3% for the 42 patients with lower levels (P = .003). These assay results were the strongest predictor of outcome, even after adjustment for competing clinicobiologic variables. Thus, this new assay would enable most treatment centers to identify a high proportion of children with ALL who have an excellent early treatment response and a high likelihood of cure.","['Coustan-Smith, Elaine', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Stow, Patricia', 'Zhou, Yinmei', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Rivera, Gaston K', 'Pedrosa, Francisco', 'Campana, Dario']","['Coustan-Smith E', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Stow P', 'Zhou Y', 'Pui CH', 'Rivera GK', 'Pedrosa F', 'Campana D']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, and International Outreach Progrm, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/03/16 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2006/03/16 09:00'],"['2006/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)64924-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-01-0066 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jul 1;108(1):97-102. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-01-0066.

To explore the impact of widespread constitutive MYC expression in the hematopoietic compartment, we have used a vector containing regulatory elements of the Vav gene to generate transgenic mice. VavP-MYC mice are highly tumor-prone and the level of MYC was found to influence both the kinetics and nature of the malignancies that developed. Whereas aggressive T-cell lymphomas rapidly overwhelmed the highest-expressing line, late-onset monocytic tumors greatly predominated in 2 low-expressing lines. These monocytic tumors most likely arise from abnormal macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-dependent progenitor cells having enhanced self-generative capacity. There appears to be a sharp threshold for MYC-induced T-cell lymphomagenesis because merely doubling the MYC level in a low-expressing line by breeding homozygous transgenic animals switched the phenotype from primarily monocytic tumors to exclusively T-cell tumors. Even the low level of MYC, however, clearly affected T-cell cycling, size, and sensitivity to apoptosis, and coexpression of a BCL2 transgene promoted efficient T-cell lymphomagenesis. The implication is that MYC level affects the spontaneous acquisition of synergistic oncogenic mutations.","['Smith, Darrin P', 'Bath, Mary L', 'Metcalf, Donald', 'Harris, Alan W', 'Cory, Suzanne']","['Smith DP', 'Bath ML', 'Metcalf D', 'Harris AW', 'Cory S']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '114100-40-2 (Bcl2 protein, mouse)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*etiology/genetics/*pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/etiology/pathology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/analysis/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",2006/03/16 09:00,2006/08/23 09:00,['2006/03/16 09:00'],"['2006/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52819-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-01-0172 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jul 15;108(2):653-61. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-01-0172.

How HTLV-1 Gag targeting occurs is not well understood. The PPPY and PTAP motifs were previously shown to be involved in HTLV-1 particle release with PTAP playing a more subtle role in virus budding. These L domains function through the interaction with host cellular proteins normally involved in multivesicular body (MVB) morphogenesis. The plasma membrane pathway rather than the MVB pathway was found to be the primary pathway for HTLV-1 particle release in HeLa cells. Intriguingly, disruption of the PTAP motif led to a defect in the targeting of Gag from the plasma membrane to CD63-positive MVBs. Particles or particle buds were observed to be associated with MVBs by electron microscopy, implying that Gag targeting to the MVB resulted in particle budding. Blocking clathrin-dependent endocytosis was found not to influence localization of the HTLV-1 Gag PTAP mutant, indicating that Gag did not reach the MVBs through clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Our observations imply that the interaction between Gag and TSG101 is not required for Gag targeting to the MVB. Overexpression of dynamitin p50 increased particle release, suggesting that there was an increase in the intracellular transport of MVBs to the cell periphery by the utilization of the dynein-dynactin motor complex. Intriguingly, virus particle release with this mutant was reduced by 20-fold compared to that of wild type in HeLa cells, which is in marked contrast to the less-than-twofold defect observed for particle production of the HTLV-1 Gag PTAP mutant from 293T cells. These results indicate that the role of the PTAP motif in L domain function is cell type dependent.","['Dorweiler, Irene J', 'Ruone, Susan J', 'Wang, Huating', 'Burry, Richard W', 'Mansky, Louis M']","['Dorweiler IJ', 'Ruone SJ', 'Wang H', 'Burry RW', 'Mansky LM']","['Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (DCTN2 protein, human)', '0 (Dynactin Complex)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Golgin subfamily A member 2)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Transferrin)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)', '0 (early endosome antigen 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Autoantigens', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism/virology', 'Dynactin Complex', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Genetic Markers', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/chemistry/genetics/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Plasmids', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transfection', 'Transferrin/metabolism', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins', 'Virion/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Virus Assembly']",2006/03/16 09:00,2006/04/14 09:00,['2006/03/16 09:00'],"['2006/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/7/3634 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.80.7.3634-3643.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Apr;80(7):3634-43. doi: 10.1128/JVI.80.7.3634-3643.2006.,,,,,"['K02 AI057735/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 AI053155/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI057735/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'SI053155/PHS HHS/United States']",PMC1440400,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, zero of six rabbits inoculated with 729.ACH.p13 cells failed to establish viral infection, whereas six of six rabbits inoculated with wild-type HTLV-1-expressing cells (729.ACH) were infected as measured by antibody responses, proviral load, and HTLV-1 p19 matrix antigen production from ex vivo-cultured PBMC.

However, since there is no rodent animal model for human immunodeficiency virus, the antiviral effect of IFN-alpha and IFN-beta in retroviral infections is not well characterized. In the current study we have used the Friend virus (FV) model to determine the activity of type I interferons against a murine retrovirus. After FV infection of mice, IFN-alpha and IFN-beta could be measured between 12 and 48 h in the serum. The important role of type I IFN in the early immune defense against FV became evident when mice deficient in IFN type I receptor (IFNAR(-/-)) or IFN-beta (IFN-beta(-/-)) were infected. The levels of FV infection in plasma and in spleen were higher in both strains of knockout mice than in C57BL/6 wild-type mice. This difference was induced by an antiviral effect of IFN-alpha and IFN-beta and was most likely mediated by antiviral enzymes as well as by an effect of these IFNs on T-cell responses.

In murine cells expressing cyclin T1, a posttranscriptional block exists such that small amounts of capsid and little infectious virus are released. This block is relieved in part by fusion with human cells. Here we have tested a panel of mouse-human somatic cell hybrids for production of infectious virus. Only those containing human chromosome 2 were permissive, which correlated with capsid production. The effect was specific to HIV in that release of murine leukemia virus was minimally affected by the presence of chromosome 2. Although expression of Vpu markedly increased capsid production in the absence of chromosome 2, it did not result in a corresponding increase in infectious HIV. The presence of chromosome 2 did not have consistent effects on the amount of unspliced viral RNA, whereas the amount of cell-associated Gag p55 was increased a fewfold. These results suggest that processing of HIV Gag can be corrected by one or more genes present on human chromosome 2 to allow production of infectious HIV from murine cells.","['Coskun, Ayse K', 'van Maanen, Marc', 'Nguyen, Van', 'Sutton, Richard E']","['Coskun AK', 'van Maanen M', 'Nguyen V', 'Sutton RE']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (HIV Core Protein p24)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'DNA, Viral/analysis/genetics', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Products, gag/metabolism', 'Genes, vpu', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'HIV Core Protein p24/metabolism', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat/genetics', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'RNA, Viral/analysis/genetics', 'Species Specificity', 'Virus Assembly']",2006/03/16 09:00,2006/04/14 09:00,['2006/03/16 09:00'],"['2006/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/7/3406 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.80.7.3406-3415.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Apr;80(7):3406-15. doi: 10.1128/JVI.80.7.3406-3415.2006.,,,,,,PMC1440379,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are four subgroups of FeLV, A, B, C, and T, each of which has a distinct receptor requirement. The receptors for all but the FeLV-A subgroup have been defined previously. Here, we report the identification of the cellular receptor for FeLV-A, which is the most transmissible form of FeLV. The receptor cDNA was isolated using a gene transfer approach, which involved introducing sequences from a feline cell line permissive to FeLV-A into a murine cell line that was not permissive. The feline cDNA identified by this method was approximately 3.5 kb, and included an open reading frame predicted to encode a protein of 490 amino acids. This feline cDNA conferred susceptibility to FeLV-A when reintroduced into nonpermissive cells, but it did not render these cells permissive to any other FeLV subgroup. Moreover, these cells specifically bound FeLV-A-pseudotyped virus particles, indicating that the cDNA encodes a binding receptor for FeLV-A. The feline cDNA shares approximately 93% amino acid sequence identity with the human thiamine transport protein 1 (THTR1). The human THTR1 receptor was also functional as a receptor for FeLV-A, albeit with reduced efficiency compared to the feline orthologue. On the basis of these data, which strongly suggest the feline protein is the orthologue of human THTR1, we have named the feline receptor feTHTR1. Identification of this receptor will allow more detailed studies of the early events in FeLV transmission and may provide insights into FeLV pathogenesis.","['Mendoza, Ramon', 'Anderson, Maria M', 'Overbaugh, Julie']","['Mendoza R', 'Anderson MM', 'Overbaugh J']","['Program in Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Washington, Seattle, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', 'X66NSO3N35 (Thiamine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Virus/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Thiamine/*metabolism']",2006/03/16 09:00,2006/04/14 09:00,['2006/03/16 09:00'],"['2006/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/7/3378 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.80.7.3378-3385.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Apr;80(7):3378-85. doi: 10.1128/JVI.80.7.3378-3385.2006.,,,,,"['R01 CA051080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 51080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA09229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1440375,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notably, only about half of the infected astrocytes die in these cultures, while the other half survive, continue to proliferate, and continue to produce virus. To determine how these astrocytes survive ts1 infection in culture, we established a chronically infected subline of the living cells remaining after the death of all acutely infected cells in an infected C1 cell culture (C1-ts1-S). We report here that C1-ts1-S cells proliferate more slowly, produce less virus, show reduced H2O2 levels, increase their uptake of cystine, and maintain higher levels of intracellular GSH and cysteine compared to acutely infected or uninfected C1 cells. C1-ts1-S cells also upregulate their thiol antioxidant defenses by activation of the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its target genes. Interestingly, despite maintenance of higher levels of intracellular reduced thiols, C1-ts1-S cells are more sensitive to cystine deprivation than uninfected C1 cells. We conclude that some ts1-infected astrocytes survive and adapt to virus-induced oxidative stress by successfully mobilizing their thiol redox defenses.","['Qiang, Wenan', 'Kuang, Xianghong', 'Liu, Jinrong', 'Liu, Na', 'Scofield, Virginia L', 'Reid, Amy J', 'Jiang, Yuhong', 'Stoica, Gheorghe', 'Lynn, William S', 'Wong, Paul K Y']","['Qiang W', 'Kuang X', 'Liu J', 'Liu N', 'Scofield VL', 'Reid AJ', 'Jiang Y', 'Stoica G', 'Lynn WS', 'Wong PK']","['Department of Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas M.

However, progressive growth of lymphoid tumors was invariably recorded when irradiated angiogenic cells from Kaposi's sarcoma (KS-IMM) were locally coinjected with MOLT-3 cells or administered later. The persistence of KS-IMM cells in vivo was tracked by flow cytometry and real-time PCR analysis, and it was limited to a few days, during which angiogenesis was induced and preceded tumor growth. The engraftment of other types of poorly tumorigenic cancer cells was also greatly improved by irradiated KS-IMM cells. Moreover, short-term treatment with angiogenic factors, including basic FGF or VEGF, either given as recombinant factors or delivered by retroviral vectors, also accelerated tumor growth. These findings may emphasize that tumor angiogenesis is a process requiring a higher amount of angiogenic factors for its induction than maintenance.","['Indraccolo, Stefano', 'Stievano, Laura', 'Minuzzo, Sonia', 'Tosello, Valeria', 'Esposito, Giovanni', 'Piovan, Erich', 'Zamarchi, Rita', 'Chieco-Bianchi, Luigi', 'Amadori, Alberto']","['Indraccolo S', 'Stievano L', 'Minuzzo S', 'Tosello V', 'Esposito G', 'Piovan E', 'Zamarchi R', 'Chieco-Bianchi L', 'Amadori A']","['Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences, University of Padova, 35128 Padova, Italy. stefano.indraccolo@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*blood supply', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*etiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/*blood supply', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/pharmacology']",2006/03/16 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/03/16 09:00'],"['2006/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['0506200103 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0506200103 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Mar 14;103(11):4216-21. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0506200103.

The dysfunction of integrin beta1 might accelerate the growth of CML ph+ cells. This study was to explore the effects of integrin alpha5 and beta1 on the proliferation inhibition of K562 cells induced by IFNalpha-2b. METHODS: The expression indexes of integrin alpha5 and beta1 on K562 cells, the binding capability of K562 cells to fibronectin (FN), and K562 cell-FN binding blocking induced by integrin alpha5 and beta1 antibodies were evaluated by flow cytometry (FCM). The viability of K562 cells, treated with IFNalpha-2b (10,000 u/ml), was observed by MTT assay. The mRNA level of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in K562 cells was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 48 h after treatment of interferon alpha-2b (IFNalpha-2b). RESULTS: The positive rates of integrin alpha5 and beta1 were significantly higher on K562 cells than on bone marrow mononuclear cells from healthy donors [(97.59+/-1.04)% vs. (64.05+/-2.38)%, (99.24+/-0.52)% vs. (72.40+/-3.56)%, P<0.05). IFNalpha-2b could not change the expression of integrin alpha5 and beta1 on K562 cells, but improved the binding capability of K562 cells to FN, which could be blocked by anti-alpha5 and/or anti-beta1 antibodies. IFNalpha-2b enhanced the expression of FAK gene, and inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells. The anti-alpha5 and anti-beta1 antibodies improved the inhibitory effect of IFNalpha-2b on the proliferation of K562 cells, and blocked IFNalpha-2b-induced increase of FAK gene expression.

Since then, the main characteristics of these viruses, commonly referred to as HTLV-1/2, have been thoroughly studied. Central and South America and the Caribbean are areas of high prevalence of HTLV-1 and HTVL-2 and have clusters of infected people. The major modes of transmission have been through sexual contact, blood, and mother to child via breast-feeding. HTLV-1 is associated with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), HTLV-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), and HTLV-associated uveitis as well as infectious dermatitis of children. More clarification is needed in the possible role of HTLV in rheumatologic, psychiatric, and infectious diseases. Since cures for ATL and HAM/TSP are lacking and no vaccine is available to prevent HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 transmission, these illnesses impose enormous social and financial costs on infected individuals, their families, and health care systems. For this reason, public health interventions aimed at counseling and educating high-risk individuals and populations are of vital importance. In the Americas this is especially important in the areas of high prevalence.","['Carneiro-Proietti, Anna Barbara F', 'Catalan-Soares, Bernadette C', 'Castro-Costa, Carlos M', 'Murphy, Edward L', 'Sabino, Ester C', 'Hisada, Michie', 'Galvao-Castro, Bernardo', 'Alcantara, Luiz C J', 'Remondegui, Carlo', 'Verdonck, Kristien', 'Proietti, Fernando A']","['Carneiro-Proietti AB', 'Catalan-Soares BC', 'Castro-Costa CM', 'Murphy EL', 'Sabino EC', 'Hisada M', 'Galvao-Castro B', 'Alcantara LC', 'Remondegui C', 'Verdonck K', 'Proietti FA']","['Fundacao Hemominas, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. annaproietti@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Rev Panam Salud Publica,Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,9705400,,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Donors', 'Breast Feeding', 'Caribbean Region/epidemiology', 'Central America/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*epidemiology/prevention & control/transmission', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/epidemiology/prevention & control/transmission', 'HTLV-II Infections/epidemiology/prevention & control/transmission', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/epidemiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'South America/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology']",2006/03/16 09:00,2006/04/11 09:00,['2006/03/16 09:00'],"['2006/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1020-49892006000100007 [pii]', '10.1590/s1020-49892006000100007 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Panam Salud Publica. 2006 Jan;19(1):44-53. doi: 10.1590/s1020-49892006000100007.,,,,,,,70,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the effect of dendrimer end-functionality on the activity of polyamido amine (PAMAM) dendrimer-methotrexate (MTX) conjugates in MTX-sensitive and MTX-resistant human acute lymphoblastoid leukemia (CCRF-CEM) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. Two amide-bonded PAMAM dendrimer-MTX conjugates were prepared using a dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) coupling reaction: one between a carboxylic acid-terminated G2.5 dendrimer and the amine groups of the MTX (conjugate A) and another between an amine-terminated G3 dendrimer and the carboxylic acid group of the MTX (conjugate B). Our studies suggest that conjugate A showed an increased drug activity compared to an equimolar amount of free MTX toward both sensitive and resistant cell lines, whereas conjugate B did not show significant activity on any of the cell lines. Despite substantially impaired MTX transport by MTX-resistant CEM/MTX and RII cells, conjugate A showed sensitivity increases of approximately 8- and 24-fold (based on IC50 values), respectively, compared to free MTX. Co-incubation of the cells with adenosine and thymidine along with either conjugate A or MTX resulted in almost complete protection, suggesting that the conjugate achieves its effect on dihyrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzyme through the same mechanism as that of MTX. The differences in cytotoxicity of these amide-bonded conjugates may be indicative of differences in the intracellular drug release from the cationic dendrimer (conjugate B) versus the anionic dendrimer (conjugate A), perhaps due to the differences in lysosomal residence times dictated by the surface functionality. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using dendrimers as drug delivery vehicles for achieving higher therapeutic effects in chemotherapy, especially in drug-resistant cells.","['Gurdag, Sezen', 'Khandare, Jayant', 'Stapels, Sarah', 'Matherly, Larry H', 'Kannan, Rangaramanujam M']","['Gurdag S', 'Khandare J', 'Stapels S', 'Matherly LH', 'Kannan RM']","['Department of Chemical Engineering and Material Science, and Biomedical Engineering, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan 48202, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Dendrimers)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Cricetinae', '*Dendrimers/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Drug Delivery Systems', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', '*Methotrexate/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Molecular Structure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/03/16 09:00,2006/07/13 09:00,['2006/03/16 09:00'],"['2006/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bc0501855 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2006 Mar-Apr;17(2):275-83. doi: 10.1021/bc0501855.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microarray hybridization and subsequent fluidic handling and reactions (including a number of washing and labeling steps) were performed in this fully automated and miniature device before fluorescent image scanning of the microarray chip. Electrochemical micropumps were integrated into the cartridge to provide pumping of liquid solutions. The device was completely self-contained: no external pressure sources, fluid storage, mechanical pumps, mixers, or valves were necessary for fluid manipulation, thus eliminating possible sample contamination and simplifying device operation. Fluidic experiments were performed to study the on-chip washing efficiency and uniformity. A single-color transcriptional analysis of K562 cells with a series of calibration controls (spiked-in controls) to characterize this new platform with regard to sensitivity, specificity, and dynamic range was performed. The device detected sample RNAs with a concentration as low as 0.375 pM. Experiment also showed that the performance of the integrated microfluidic device is comparable with the conventional hybridization chambers with manual operations, indicating that the on-chip fluidic handling (washing and reaction) is highly efficient and can be automated with no loss of performance.

METHODS: Twenty-five patients with nonenterococcal gram-positive bloodstream infection, which was refractory to vancomycin therapy, were identified by reviewing the Infectious Diseases consultation database at the tertiary care cancer center. Among these, 8 patients in whom vancomycin-tolerance was documented are described. Antibiotic tolerance was defined as a > 32 times increase in minimum bactericidal concentration compared with minimum inhibitory concentration. RESULTS: Eight patients with persistent fever and bacteremia of > 72 hours' duration after the initiation of vancomycin therapy were treated. The median age of these patients, which included 3 men and 5 women, was 44 years +/- 11 years. Solid tumors were more common (6 patients) and 2 patients had acute leukemia. Six patients (75%) were neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count < 500/mm3), including 2 breast cancer patients who had undergone autologous stem cell transplantation. The causative organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3 patients), group G streptococci (n = 2 patients), and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus sanguis (1 patient each). All isolates demonstrated a minimum bactericidal concentration for vancomycin that was at least 32 times greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration. Rapid defervescence (< or = 24 h) and resolution of bacteremia occurred with the addition of gentamicin (4 patients) or gentamicin plus rifampin (4 patients). None of these infections recurred after discontinuation of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of clinical and/or microbiologic response to vancomycin should raise the suspicion of possible infection due to Vt gram-positive bacteria, and alternative bactericidal therapy should be instituted early, especially in patients with underlying immune suppression.","['Safdar, Amar', 'Rolston, Kenneth V I']","['Safdar A', 'Rolston KV']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control, and Employee Health, The University of Texas M.

CML28, a recently discovered cancer-testis (CT) antigen from chronic myelogenous leukemia, is considered to be a promising target of tumor-specific immunotherapy. Because HLA-A*0201 is one of the most common histocompatibility molecule in Chinese, we aim at identifying CML28 peptides presented by HLA-A*0201. A panel of CML28-derived antigenic peptides was predicted using a computer-based program. Four peptides with highest predicted score were synthesized and tested for their binding affinities to HLA-A*0201 molecule. Then these peptides were assessed for their immunogenicity to elicit specific immune responses mediated by CTLs both in vitro, from PBMCs sourced from four healthy HLA-A*0201(+) donors, and in vivo, in HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice. One of the tested peptides, CML28((173-181)), induced peptide-specific CTLs in vitro as well as in vivo, which could specifically secrete IFN-gamma and lyse major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched tumor cell lines endogenously expressing CML28 antigen and CML28((173-181) )pulsed Jurkat-A2/Kb cells, respectively. These results demonstrate that CML28((173-181) )is a naturally processed and presented CTL epitope with HLA-A*0201 motif and has a promising immunogenicity both in vitro and in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case of ATLL and peripheral neuropathy in which a nerve biopsy was performed. In our patient, the marked perivascular inflammatory infiltrates mainly consisting of T lymphocytes suggested either immune-mediated vasculitis or tumor invasion.

The incidence of invasive aspergillosis has increased significantly in recent decades in parallel with the increasing number and improved survival of immunocompromised patients. IA in adults has been well characterized; however, only a few small studies of IA in children have been reported. Therefore, the objective of this study was to describe the incidence and outcomes of children with IA. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using the 2000 Kids Inpatient Database, a national database of hospital inpatient stays during 2000. IA was defined as aspergillosis that occurred in a child with malignancy (solid tumor, leukemia, or lymphoma), hematologic/immunologic deficiency, or transplant (bone marrow or solid organ). Discharge weighting was applied to the data to obtain nationally representative estimates of disease. RESULTS: During 2000, there were an estimated 666 pediatric cases of IA among 152,231 immunocompromised children, yielding an annual incidence of 437/100,000 (0.4%) among hospitalized immunocompromised children. Children with malignancy accounted for the majority (74%) of cases of IA. The highest incidence of IA was seen in children who had undergone allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (4.5%) and those with acute myelogenous leukemia (4%). The overall in-hospital mortality of immunocompromised children with IA was 18%. Children with malignancy and IA were at higher risk for death than children with malignancy and without IA. Pediatric patients with IA had a significantly longer median length of hospital stay (16 days) than immunocompromised children without IA (3 days). The median total hospital charges for patients with IA were $49309 compared with immunocompromised children without IA ($9035). CONCLUSIONS: The impact of IA on increases in mortality, length of hospital stay, and the burden of cost in the hospital setting underscores the need for improved means of diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of IA in immunocompromised children.","['Zaoutis, Theoklis E', 'Heydon, Kateri', 'Chu, Jaclyn H', 'Walsh, Thomas J', 'Steinbach, William J']","['Zaoutis TE', 'Heydon K', 'Chu JH', 'Walsh TJ', 'Steinbach WJ']","[""Division of Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA. zaoutis@email.chop.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aspergillosis/*economics/*epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Opportunistic Infections/*economics/*epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology']",2006/03/15 09:00,2006/05/11 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['peds.2005-1161 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2005-1161 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2006 Apr;117(4):e711-6. doi: 10.1542/peds.2005-1161.

Tumor cells that enter the subarachnoid space adhere to the leptomeninges and form tumor deposits. It is largely unknown which adhesion molecules mediate tumor cell adhesion to leptomeninges. We studied the role of integrin expression and activation in the progression of leptomeningeal metastases. For this study, we used a mouse acute lymphocytic leukemic cell line that was grown in suspension (L1210-S cell line) to develop an adherent L1210 cell line (L1210-A) by selectively culturing the few adherent cells in the cell culture. beta1, beta2, and beta3 integrins were in a constitutively high active state on L1210-A cells and in a low, but inducible, active state on L1210-S cells. Expression levels of these integrins were comparable in the two cell lines. Static adhesion levels of L1210-A cells on a leptomeningeal cell layer were significantly higher than those of L1210-S cells. All mice that were injected intrathecally with L1210-A cells died rapidly of leptomeningeal leukemia. In contrast, 45% long-term survival was seen after intrathecal injection of mice with L1210-S cells. Our data indicate that constitutive integrin activation on leukemic cells promotes progression of leptomeningeal leukemia by increased tumor cell adhesion to the leptomeninges. We argue that an aberrantly regulated inside-out signaling pathway underlies constitutive integrin activation on the adherent leukemic cell population.","['Brandsma, Dieta', 'Ulfman, Laurien', 'Reijneveld, Jaap C', 'Bracke, Madelon', 'Taphoorn, Martin J B', 'Zwaginga, Jaap Jan', 'Gebbink, Martijn F B', 'de Boer, Hetty', 'Koenderman, Leo', 'Voest, Emile E']","['Brandsma D', 'Ulfman L', 'Reijneveld JC', 'Bracke M', 'Taphoorn MJ', 'Zwaginga JJ', 'Gebbink MF', 'de Boer H', 'Koenderman L', 'Voest EE']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands. d.brandsma@umcutrecht.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Neuro Oncol,Neuro-oncology,100887420,['0 (Integrins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Progression', 'Integrins/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*metabolism/*secondary', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology']",2006/03/15 09:00,2006/06/03 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['15228517-2005-013 [pii]', '10.1215/15228517-2005-013 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuro Oncol. 2006 Apr;8(2):127-36. doi: 10.1215/15228517-2005-013.

The translocation leads to the juxtaposition of BCL3 to the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene locus, resulting in high-level expression of the BCL3 transcript. The Bcl-3 protein includes 7 tandem copies of the ankyrin repeat element in the central domain, a structure that is characteristic of the IkappaB family of inhibitors of the nuclear factor kappaB transcription factors. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a subtype of aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that is characterized by expression of CD30 and the NPM/ALK chimeric protein, which is generated by t(2;5)(p23;q35). We compared the gene expression profiles of ALCL with those of another CD30+ neoplasm, Hodgkin's disease (HD), and found that BCL3 is expressed at higher levels in ALCL than in HD. A comparison by real-time polymerase chain reaction assay revealed that t(2;5)+ ALCL expresses a high level of BCL3 messenger RNA relative to the levels expressed in other hematologic tumors, and the level in ALCL is comparable to or even higher than that in t(14;19)+ B-CLL. An immunohistochemical analysis of ALCL tumor tissues showed that the lymphoma cells exhibited strong nuclear staining by a monoclonal antibody against Bcl-3. We suggest that Bcl-3 sequestrates the (p50)2 homodimer to the nucleus and that the kappaB sites are occupied by the (p50)2/Bcl-3 ternary complex. Future studies should identify the relationships among the 3 independent molecules (ie, NPM/ALK, CD30, and Bcl-3) that are activated in t(2;5)+ ALCL.","['Ohno, Hitoshi', 'Nishikori, Momoko', 'Maesako, Yoshitomo', 'Haga, Hironori']","['Ohno H', 'Nishikori M', 'Maesako Y', 'Haga H']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Takeda General Hospital, 28-1 Mori-minami-cho, Ishida, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto 601-1495, Japan. hohno@k2.dion.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (BCL3 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2006/03/15 09:00,2006/05/13 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['05F37MPERH9WUL8A [pii]', '10.1532/IJH97.05045 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2005 Dec;82(5):397-405. doi: 10.1532/IJH97.05045.,,,,,,,59,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of studies have involved the mouse because the ease with which repopulation studies can be carried out with this animal model allows the assay of complete lineage development from stem cells. In the past decade, advances in repopulation assays for human stem cells using xenotransplantation have greatly enhanced our understanding of human stem cell biology. Importantly, the xenotransplantation methodology has also been used to identify the cancer stem cell that initiates and sustains leukemic proliferation, providing key evidence for the cancer stem cell hypothesis. This hypothesis argues that cancer cells are functionally heterogeneous and hierarchically organized such that only specific cells are capable of sustaining tumor growth and continuously producing the cells that make up the bulk of the tumor. Recent studies have also brought into focus the importance of the intimate relationship between the stem cell (normal or leukemic) and its microenvironment. Coming into view are the molecular players involved in stem cell homing, migration, and adhesion, as well as the cellular components of the microenvironmental niche.

Which database to choose when determining the IgVH hypermutation status in chronic lymphocytic leukemia?,ELT01,"It has been accepted that the hypermutation status of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (IgVH) is one of the most important independent prognostic factors in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). According to the degree ofIgVH hypermutaion, CLL patients can be stratified into prognostic groups. Given the impact ofIgVH mutation status on clinical setting, it has become highly desirable to standardize the laboratory methodologies used for IgVH mutation status determination. To check the reliability of our laboratory results, we performed a random interlaboratory testing. From 10 CLL samples tested, in 9 cases identical results were obtained in both laboratories. In one case, the result was discordant. The discrepancy was caused by theIgVH database used. This finding prompted us to double-check our cohort of 624 CLL patients, using IgBLAST and IMGT databases. The results showed 7.5% (47/624) discrepancies between both databases. In 21 out of 47 cases, the degree of hypermutation has changed in regard to the database used, resulting in major changes in the prognostic subgroup. Other irregularities between both databases were identified, with yet to be determined significance. In the light of presented data we would like to stress the necessity to identify/compile the most comprehensiveIgVH database to be used for the determination ofIgVH mutation status in CLL.","['Pekova, Sona', 'Baran-Marszak, Fanny', 'Schwarz, Jipi', 'Matoska, Vaclav']","['Pekova S', 'Baran-Marszak F', 'Schwarz J', 'Matoska V']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Letter']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['*Databases, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin/*genetics']",2006/03/15 09:00,2006/08/25 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2006 Mar;91(3):ELT01.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Outcomes were analyzed for 13,416 patients, with a median age of 36 years (range 1-71 years); 60% were male. The analysis considered three time cohorts, 1980 to 1990, 1991 to 1999 and 2000 to 2003. Survival, transplant-related mortality and relapse incidence were assessed at 20 years for the first cohort and compared at 2 years between the three cohorts. The numbers of HSCT for CML increased from 540 allogeneic HSCT in 1990 to 1,396 HSCT in 1999 and declined to 802 in 2004. One third of all patients and half of those with a low risk were alive at 20 years. Survival at 2 years has improved from 53% to 61% in the most recent years due to a reduction in transplant-related mortality from 41% to 30% in all patients and from 31% to 17% in low-risk patients. Stage, donor type, time interval, age and donor-recipient sex combination remain the main risk factors; patients with a risk score of 0 or 1 have a survival probability of 80% at 2 years. HSCT remains an important treatment option for patients with CML. The data describe the current status of this option and the outcome a patient can expect today.

The methanol extract of the stripped barks (3kg) of Albizzia julibrissin was evaporated, dissolved in water, and then sequentially extracted by chloroform, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol. The substance in the butanol extract containing the most cytotoxic activity was further purified by a series of preparative column chromatography. The active substance obtained (723mg) was designated as HaBC18. When Jurkat T cells were treated with HaBC18 (0.5-2microg/ml), apoptosis along with several biochemical events such as mitochondrial cytochrome c release, activation of caspase-9 and -3, degradation of PARP, and DNA fragmentation was induced in a dose-dependent manner. However, the HaBC18-induced apoptosis was abrogated by an ectopic overexpression of Bcl-xL, which is known to block mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Primary cultures of human PBMC were less sensitive to the cytotoxicity relative to Jurkat T cells. These results demonstrate that the cytotoxicity of HaBC18 toward Jurkat T cells is attributable to apoptosis mediated by mitochondria-dependent death-signaling pathway regulated by Bcl-xL.","['Won, Hae Jeung', 'Han, Chang Hee', 'Kim, Young Ho', 'Kwon, Hyun Ju', 'Kim, Byung Woo', 'Choi, Jae Soo', 'Kim, Kwang-Hyeon']","['Won HJ', 'Han CH', 'Kim YH', 'Kwon HJ', 'Kim BW', 'Choi JS', 'Kim KH']","['Department of Life Science and Biotechnology, College of Natural Science, Dongeui University, Busan 614-714, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['*Albizzia', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2006/03/15 09:00,2006/08/31 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2005/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2006/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-8741(06)00052-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2006.01.027 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2006 Jul 19;106(3):383-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2006.01.027.

ES cells are known to be pluripotent because of their capability to differentiate into cell types of all three germ layers including germ cells. Here, we show that ES cells differentiate into renal cell types in vitro. We found that genes were expressed during EB cultivation, which have been previously described to be involved in renal development. Marker molecules characteristic for terminally differentiated renal cell types were found to be expressed predominantly during late stages of EB cultivation, while marker molecules involved in the initiation of nephrogenesis were already expressed during early steps of EB development. On the cellular level--using immunostaining--we detected cells expressing podocin, nephrin and wt-1, characteristic for differentiated podocytes and other cells, which expressed Tamm-Horsfall protein, a marker for distal tubule epithelial cells of kidney tissue. Furthermore, the proximal tubule marker molecules renal-specific oxido reductase, kidney androgen-related protein and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3alpha-hydroxylase were found to be expressed in EBs. In particular, we could demonstrate that cells expressing podocyte marker molecules assemble to distinct ring-like structures within the EBs. Because the differentiation efficiency into these cell types is still relatively low, application of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 in combination with leukaemia inhibitory factor was tested for induction, but did not enhance ES cell-derived renal differentiation in vitro.","['Kramer, Jan', 'Steinhoff, Jurgen', 'Klinger, Matthias', 'Fricke, Lutz', 'Rohwedel, Jurgen']","['Kramer J', 'Steinhoff J', 'Klinger M', 'Fricke L', 'Rohwedel J']","['Department of Medical Molecular Biology, University of Lubeck, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany.

Technical and clinical data obtained after bone marrow (BM) processing with a continuous-flow cell separator (Cobe Spectra, Gambro BCT) are reported. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: RBC depletion and recovery of nucleated cells, CD3+ cells, CD34+ cells, and colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage were calculated. Bacteriologic contaminations, side effects of graft infusion, and hematopoietic recovery were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 114 BM samples were processed. The mean volume collected was 1099 mL (range, 390-2450 mL). Initial and residual mean RBCs volumes were 309.9 and 4.0 mL corresponding to a depletion of 98.6 +/- 0.78 percent. Before processing, the mean numbers of nucleated cells, granulocytes, CD3+ cells, CD34+ cells, and CFU-GM were 20.28 x 10(9), 12.79 x 10(9), 1.96 x 10(9), 356.7 x 10(6), and 195.6 x 10(5), respectively. The mean corresponding recoveries after processing were 33.66, 48.98, 82.02, 82.2, and 93.9 percent. Limited side effects were observed in 14 patients without correlation with residual RBCs volume.

At the same time, she developed xanthomatous patches on the face, neck, and shoulders (Fig. 1). The cutaneous lesions were xanthomatous nodules and plaques, affecting the periorbital regions. Later, the whole face was affected, followed by ulcerated lesions on the scalp, chest, back, and extremities (Fig. 2). The skin lesions became painful, pruritic, ulcerated tumors (Fig. 3). In July 1998, computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest and abdomen with contrast medium showed pretracheal, bilateral axillary, right retrochural, paracaval, aortocaval, and para-aortic lymph node enlargement. These findings were suggestive of lymphoma. CT scan also showed slight heterogeneous hypodensity in the upper part of the right lobe of the liver, suggesting fatty infiltration. The spleen, pancreas, and suprarenal glands appeared normal. One cervical and two left axillary lymph nodes were excised. They revealed total replacement of the nodular architecture by a diffuse proliferation of mature lymphoid cells having small nuclei and a crumbled chromatin pattern, and very rare mitosis. It was concluded from the lymph node biopsies that these changes were typical of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, diffuse and small cell type, of low-grade malignancy. A bone marrow aspirate showed a marrow heavily infiltrated by lymphoid cells with some immaturity. The megakaryopoiesis was adequate. Trephine biopsies showed similar changes. Iron stores appeared to be absent. The bone marrow picture was consistent with diffuse, well-differentiated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, developing into chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Endoscopy showed antral-type gastric mucosa exhibiting mild chronic gastritis. Skin biopsy from a fresh lesion on the back showed a diffuse inflammatory cell infiltrate with collections of histiocytic cells. It also showed necrobiotic foci, surrounded by mixed inflammatory cells, dark palisaded foamy histiocytes, and a few Touton giant cells. These findings are compatible with necrobiotic xanthogranuloma (NXG) (Figs 4 and 5). Blood film showed normochromic, normocytic erythrocytes with anisopoikilocytotic leukocytes and normal platelets. The sedimentation rate was 90 mm in the first hour. The blood picture also showed monoclonal IgG paraprotein (3170 mg/dL) of the kappa light chain type. The patient was treated by the oncologist for her lymphoma, and was given Cytoxan, prednisolone, endoxan, Leukeran, and melphalan. She showed an excellent response to pulsed treatment with steroids (60 mg prednisolone orally daily for 5 days, repeated every month for 6 months). She also responded to Leukeran at a dose of 5 mg daily for 5 days every month for 6 months, and showed regression in the size of the lymph nodes. The treatment of her skin lesions was unsatisfactory in spite of the fact that she was given cyclosporine and both systemic and topical corticosteroids.","['Oumeish, Oumeish Youssef', 'Oumeish, Isam', 'Tarawneh, Musleh', 'Salman, Thaher', 'Sharaiha, Asem']","['Oumeish OY', 'Oumeish I', 'Tarawneh M', 'Salman T', 'Sharaiha A']","['Amman Clinic and the Department of Surgical Pathology - Medical Laboratories, Jordan. oumeishdermatolol@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Int J Dermatol,International journal of dermatology,0243704,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Granuloma/etiology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Necrobiotic Disorders/etiology/*pathology', 'Paraproteinemias/*etiology', 'Skin Diseases/etiology/pathology', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xanthomatosis/etiology/*pathology']",2006/03/15 09:00,2006/07/11 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['IJD2575 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-4632.2006.02575.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Dermatol. 2006 Mar;45(3):306-10. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-4632.2006.02575.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: HOX11L2 mRNA was analyzed by RT-PCR and real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) on paraffin-embedded tissues in 54 cases of T-LBL. RESULTS: HOX11L2 expression was observed in 7 cases (13.0%). The age ranged from 5 to 15 years, with a median of 9 years. All of the HOX11L2 expressed patients had prior mediastinal masses, and 5 of them expressed high level of Ki67 antigen (PI> or =80%). Symptoms of CNS invasion were diagnosed in 2 cases. Significant differences in the age ratio (P < 0.05), the level of Ki67 antigen (P < 0.05) and the incidence of mediastinal involvement (P < 0.05) were observed between patients positive or negative for HOX11L2.

Decitabine indirectly depletes methylcytosine and causes hypomethylation of target gene promoters. METHODS: A total of 170 patients with MDS were randomized to receive either decitabine at a dose of 15 mg/m2 given intravenously over 3 hours every 8 hours for 3 days (at a dose of 135 mg/m2 per course) and repeated every 6 weeks, or best supportive care. Response was assessed using the International Working Group criteria and required that response criteria be met for at least 8 weeks. RESULTS: Patients who were treated with decitabine achieved a significantly higher overall response rate (17%), including 9% complete responses, compared with supportive care (0%) (P < .001). An additional 12 patients who were treated with decitabine (13%) achieved hematologic improvement. Responses were durable (median, 10.3 mos) and were associated with transfusion independence. Patients treated with decitabine had a trend toward a longer median time to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) progression or death compared with patients who received supportive care alone (all patients, 12.1 mos vs. 7.8 mos [P = 0.16]; those with International Prognostic Scoring System intermediate-2/high-risk disease, 12.0 mos vs. 6.8 mos [P = 0.03]; those with de novo disease, 12.6 mos vs. 9.4 mos [P = 0.04]; and treatment-naive patients, 12.3 mos vs. 7.3 mos [P = 0.08]).

Among 10 cases of t(3;21)-associated acute myeloid leukemia, 8 were secondary tumors after chemotherapy for other neoplasms that had been treated with regimens including fludarabine and 5-fluorouracil in 3 patients each and etoposide in 2 patients. The immunophenotype of the blasts in all 22 tested cases was similar, with uniform expression of myeloid markers and CD34 and variable expression of CD7 and CD9, but minimal morphological myeloid maturation. Dysplastic micromegakaryocytes and bone marrow fibrosis were observed predominantly in CMPD cases. RT-PCR followed by DNA sequencing showed that the AML1-/MDS1-/EVI1 (AME) fusion transcript was detected in all 5 cases assessed. Among the patients with CMPD, 8 died of disease (at a median of 6.5 mos) and 5 achieved disease remission with bone marrow transplantation. Among patients with acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome, 7 died of disease (at a median of 2 mos) and 2 had persistent leukemia with short follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Activation of AME through t(3;21) defines a highly aggressive, therapy-related leukemic blast syndrome. Prior treatment with hydroxyurea or other antimetabolites is implicated as a contributory cause.","['Yin, C Cameron', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Barkoh, Bedia', 'Hayes, Kimberly', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Jones, Dan']","['Yin CC', 'Cortes J', 'Barkoh B', 'Hayes K', 'Kantarjian H', 'Jones D']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.

The current study was designed to determine response rates to docetaxel in various strata of recurrent solid tumors of childhood and to assess toxicity in a group of patients who were assigned to receive it. METHODS: Docetaxel was given at a dose of 125 mg/m2 once every 21 days as a 1-hour intravenous infusion for a maximum of 12 courses. From January 1997 to November 2001, 109 male patients and 68 female patients (total, 177 patients) were enrolled, and 173 patients were eligible. The median patient age at entry was 13 years (range, 1-27 yrs). One hundred sixty patients were evaluable for response. RESULTS: There were no deaths attributable to study drug. Hematologic toxicity was common during therapy. Dermatologic, neurologic, pulmonary, and infectious side effects as well as edema were significant. One patient each had acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoid leukemia, and high-grade glioma reported as secondary malignancies. One patient with osteosarcoma and 1 patient with rhabdomyosarcoma achieved a complete response. Partial responses were observed in patients with Ewing sarcoma (3 patients), osteosarcoma (1 patient), squamous cell carcinoma (1 patient), and medulloblastoma (1 patient). Seventeen patients had stable disease. The 1-year and 5-year overall survival rates for the 160 evaluable patients were 24% (standard error = 4%) and 6% (standard error = 2%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Docetaxel demonstrated activity in patients with recurrent Ewing sarcoma but was found to be ineffective for treating the other types of recurrent solid tumors that were studied.","['Zwerdling, Ted', 'Krailo, Mark', 'Monteleone, Philip', 'Byrd, Rebecca', 'Sato, Judith', 'Dunaway, Rose', 'Seibel, Nita', 'Chen, Zhengjia', 'Strain, John', 'Reaman, Gregory']","['Zwerdling T', 'Krailo M', 'Monteleone P', 'Byrd R', 'Sato J', 'Dunaway R', 'Seibel N', 'Chen Z', 'Strain J', 'Reaman G']","['Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology, University of California-Davis, Sacramento, California 95817, USA. theodore.zwerdling@ucdmc.ucdavis.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Taxoids)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Docetaxel', 'Female', 'Glioma/*drug therapy/*secondary', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy', 'Sarcoma/*drug therapy/*secondary', 'Taxoids/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",2006/03/15 09:00,2006/05/25 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21779 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2006 Apr 15;106(8):1821-8. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21779.,,"[""Children's Oncology Group""]",,,,,,['2006 American Cancer Society'],,,,,,,,,,,

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 and type 2 (HTLV-1 and HTLV-2) encode the Tax viral transactivator (Tax1 and Tax2, respectively). Tax1 possesses an oncogenic potential and is responsible for cell transformation both in vivo and in vitro. We and others have recently discovered the existence of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 3. However, there is currently no evidence for the presence of a Tax protein in HTLV-3-infected individuals. We show that the serum of an HTLV-3 asymptomatic carrier and the sera of two STLV-3-infected monkeys contain specific anti-Tax3 antibodies. We also show that tax3 mRNA is present in the PBMCs obtained from an STLV-3-infected monkey, demonstrating that Tax3 is expressed in vivo. We further demonstrate that Tax3 intracellular localization is very similar to that of Tax1 and that Tax3 binds to both CBP and p300 coactivators. Using purified Tax3, we show that the protein increases transcription from a 4TxRE G-free cassette plasmid in an in vitro transcription assay. In all cell types tested, including transiently transfected lymphocytes, Tax3 activates its own promoter STLV-3 long terminal repeat (LTR), which contains only two Tax Responsive Elements (TREs), and activates also HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 LTRs. In addition, Tax3 also activates the NF-kappaB pathway. We also show that Tax3 possesses a PDZ-binding sequence at its C-terminal end. Our results demonstrate that Tax3 is a transactivator, and that its properties are more similar to that of Tax1, rather than of Tax2. This suggests the possible occurrence of lymphoproliferative disorders among HTLV-3-infected populations.","['Chevalier, S A', 'Meertens, L', 'Pise-Masison, C', 'Calattini, S', 'Park, H', 'Alhaj, A A', 'Zhou, M', 'Gessain, A', 'Kashanchi, F', 'Brady, J N', 'Mahieux, R']","['Chevalier SA', 'Meertens L', 'Pise-Masison C', 'Calattini S', 'Park H', 'Alhaj AA', 'Zhou M', 'Gessain A', 'Kashanchi F', 'Brady JN', 'Mahieux R']","[""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cercopithecinae', 'Gene Products, tax/biosynthesis/chemistry/*genetics/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*chemistry/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Primate T-lymphotropic virus 3/*chemistry/physiology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",2006/03/15 09:00,2006/11/10 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209472 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209472 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Jul 27;25(32):4470-82. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209472.

To study the intrinsic oncogenic properties of persistent STAT5 activation, we generated transgenic mice in which a constitutively activated point mutant of STAT5A, STAT5A(S711F), was expressed at physiological level in their lymphoid compartment. In this model, persistent STAT5 activation is weakly oncogenic, leading to the late emergence of clonal B-cell lymphoma/leukemia at a low incidence. In contrast, STAT5(S711F) was found to cooperate with the loss of function of the p53 tumor suppressor gene to both accelerate disease onset and to skew the large tumor spectrum that normally characterize p53-deficient mice to strongly favor B-cell lymphoma/leukemia. The emergence of STAT5A(S711F)-induced B-cell tumors is associated with the activation of STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA-binding activity, indicating that activation of STAT5 oncogenic properties in transgenic STAT5A (TgSTAT5A) (S711F) mice involves the deregulation of STAT5 phosphorylation dynamics.","['Joliot, V', 'Cormier, F', 'Medyouf, H', 'Alcalde, H', 'Ghysdael, J']","['Joliot V', 'Cormier F', 'Medyouf H', 'Alcalde H', 'Ghysdael J']","['Institut Curie, CNRS UMR146, Centre Universitaire, Orsay, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Lineage', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",2006/03/15 09:00,2006/08/26 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209480 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209480 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Aug 3;25(33):4573-84. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209480.

This cell line carries human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2.1, HLA-A3, and HLA-B44, which cover most of the caucasian population, and it could therefore be used as an off-the-shelf allogeneic DC-based vaccine. Signal transduction and activation of transcription (STAT) 5b is involved in cytokine signal transduction, particularly of cytokines involved in DC precursor growth and differentiation. The constitutively active form of STAT5b induced cytokine-independent growth of MUTZ-3 cells. Furthermore, STAT5b-transduced cells differentiated into mature DCs in 3 to 4 days after stimulation with DC differentiation-inducing cytokines, reducing the culture period to obtain mature DCs with 5 days compared with unmodified MUTZ-3-derived mature DC cultures. Both DC types expressed DC maturation markers and were equally effective in inducing primary T-cell responses. DCs derived from the STAT5b-transduced cells had a more stable mature phenotype after cytokine deprivation, which was reflected in a better performance in functional assays. In conclusion, these results show that STAT5b-transduced MUTZ-3 can be propagated in cytokine-free medium and rapidly differentiated into functional mature DCs that sustain a mature phenotype over a period of 3 to 5 days in the absence of differentiation-inducing cytokines. The simplified propagation and rapid differentiation into mature DCs may facilitate clinical application of this cell line as an allogeneic DC-based vaccine.","['Bontkes, Hetty J', 'Ruizendaal, Janneke J', 'Kramer, Duco', 'Santegoets, Saskia J A M', 'Scheper, Rik J', 'de Gruijl, Tanja D', 'Meijer, Chris J L M', 'Hooijberg, Erik']","['Bontkes HJ', 'Ruizendaal JJ', 'Kramer D', 'Santegoets SJ', 'Scheper RJ', 'de Gruijl TD', 'Meijer CJ', 'Hooijberg E']","['Department of Pathology, Vrije Universiteit University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. hj.bontkes@vumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5B protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD', 'Cancer Vaccines/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/immunology']",2006/03/15 09:00,2006/05/26 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.cji.0000197095.00359.67 [doi]', '00002371-200603000-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,J Immunother. 2006 Mar-Apr;29(2):188-200. doi: 10.1097/01.cji.0000197095.00359.67.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The same chimeric CD19 antibody was produced in Sf21 insect cells, human 293 T cells, and 293 T cells expressing a co-transfected beta1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII). The N-glycan structures and the cytolytic potential of the antibodies produced in these three systems were directly compared. After expression in insect cells, the antibody carried paucimannosidic N-linked oligosaccharides, distinct from the complex biantennary carbohydrate moieties attached to the product from human cells. After co-expression with GnTIII in human cells, the antibody carried an eightfold greater percentage of oligosaccharides with a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (78.7% versus 9.6%) and a 30-fold increased proportion of bisecting, defucosylated oligosaccharides (15.9% versus 0.5%). The insect cell product triggered stronger antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of a human leukemia-derived cell line than the product from non-re-engineered 293 T cells and was equally effective at 50- to 100-fold lower concentrations. The antibody from glyco-engineered 293 T cells had comparable lytic activity as the insect cell product. Both mediated significant ADCC at lower effector-to-target cell ratios than the antibody from non-re-engineered 293 T cells, and both were highly effective against primary blasts from pediatric leukemia patients. The data demonstrate the influence of the N-glycosylation pattern on the ADCC activity of chimeric CD19 antibodies and point to the importance of suitable expression systems for the production of highly active therapeutic antibodies.","['Barbin, Karin', 'Stieglmaier, Julia', 'Saul, Domenica', 'Stieglmaier, Kristin', 'Stockmeyer, Bernhard', 'Pfeiffer, Matthias', 'Lang, Peter', 'Fey, Georg H']","['Barbin K', 'Stieglmaier J', 'Saul D', 'Stieglmaier K', 'Stockmeyer B', 'Pfeiffer M', 'Lang P', 'Fey GH']","['Genetics, University of Erlangen--Nuremberg, D 91058 Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*chemistry/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/immunology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2006/03/15 09:00,2006/05/26 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.cji.0000175684.28615.7b [doi]', '00002371-200603000-00002 [pii]']",ppublish,J Immunother. 2006 Mar-Apr;29(2):122-33. doi: 10.1097/01.cji.0000175684.28615.7b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Ph1 chromosome forms a chimeric gene that encodes an abnormal P210 mRNA transcript in most CML patients. Surveillance for minimal residual disease by detection of BCR/ABL transcripts is currently done mostly by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Quantitation of BCR/ABL transcripts can monitor tumor load and the outcome of therapy. Absolute quantification determines the input copy number of the transcript of interest, usually by plotting the amount of PCR product onto a standard curve based on serial dilutions of the same product cloned in plasmids. Relative quantification describes the change in expression of the target gene in the patient sample relative to that of a control transcript by using the 2-DeltaDeltaCt calculation. The results of real-time RT-PCR for BCR/ABL transcripts are often analyzed by using plasmid DNA standard curves. In the present study, 79 BCR/ABL transcript-positive samples from CML patients who were being monitored for minimal residual disease by real-time quantitative RT-PCR were studied to determine whether the 2-DeltaDeltaCt approach was equivalent to the plasmid standard curve method. BCR/ABL P210 transcripts were quantitated using both the plasmid standard curve method and the 2-DeltaDeltaCt calculation. The comparison of both methods revealed a highly significant and linear correlation between the plasmid standard curve method and the 2-DeltaDeltaCt calculation (R2=0.98, P<0.0001). Furthermore, there was a reduction of preparation time, contamination risk, and reagent usage. The 2-DeltaDeltaCt calculation is a convenient alternative method to derive accurate quantitative information from real time PCR assays.","['Arocho, Alaina', 'Chen, Beiyun', 'Ladanyi, Marc', 'Pan, Qiulu']","['Arocho A', 'Chen B', 'Ladanyi M', 'Pan Q']","['Laboratory of Diagnostic Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",United States,Diagn Mol Pathol,"Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B",9204924,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2006/03/15 09:00,2006/04/15 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['00019606-200603000-00009 [pii]', '10.1097/00019606-200603000-00009 [doi]']",ppublish,Diagn Mol Pathol. 2006 Mar;15(1):56-61. doi: 10.1097/00019606-200603000-00009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to expand on the utility of flow cytometry in the study of B-cell malignancies we have used the most reliable quantitative methodology, QIFI (quantitative indirect immunofluorescence assay), to study the expression of CD5, CD10, CD11c, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD23, and CD79b in 384 cases of several common B-lineage malignancies, including: B-ALL, CLL, SLL, hairy cell leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma. The impetus behind this extensive, single institution study of surface antigens was two-fold: evaluating similarities and differences of antigen expression between B-cell neoplasms and finding additional clinical utility for the quantitative flow cytometric data generated. Our results show that each distinct malignant histology has its own quantitative pattern of surface antigen expression. In most cases, these quantitative patterns do not increase the ability of flow cytometry to distinguish between them. However, a high expression of specific antigens on a given B-cell malignancy may potentially identify optimal therapeutic targets for current and/or future monoclonal antibody-based therapies.","['Olejniczak, Scott H', 'Stewart, Carleton C', 'Donohue, Kathleen', 'Czuczman, Myron S']","['Olejniczak SH', 'Stewart CC', 'Donohue K', 'Czuczman MS']","['Department of Immunology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Immunol Invest,Immunological investigations,8504629,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluoroimmunoassay', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/*immunology']",2006/03/15 09:00,2006/05/05 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['J0113317401524V2 [pii]', '10.1080/08820130500496878 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Invest. 2006;35(1):93-114. doi: 10.1080/08820130500496878.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Non-malignant cells including leukocytes also express P-glycoprotein, but physiologic functions for P-glycoprotein are poorly defined. Recently, P-glycoprotein expression has been described in human mononuclear phagocytes and Langerhans cells. It has been shown to play a role in phagocytic cell transmigration through endothelial-lined vessels in an ablumenal-lumenal direction, a process that mimics their migration into lymphatic vessels. Using the monoclonal antibody 4E3, and the P-glycoprotein antagonist, verapamil, the expression of P-glycoprotein on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells was evaluated. Dendritic cells used in this study were CD1a+, CD11c+, CD14-, CD80+, CD83+, CD86+ and MHC-II(High). The expression of these markers increased significantly as the cells matured. P-glycoprotein expression was upregulated as the dendritic cells matured as well as in the presence of the ""inflammatory stress"" of the pathogenic bacteria Strept. pyogenes. Addition of verapamil or Strept. pyogenes to the culture medium during the final 24 hours significantly upregulated P-glycoprotein expression. Immortalized cell lines did not upregulate P-glycoprotein in the presence of verapamil. Evaluation of other normal cells showed that P-glycoprotein upregulation in the presence of verapamil was also a characteristic of macrophages. This novel observation of the upregulation of P-glycoprotein in the presence of verapamil appears to be a characteristic of activated myeloid derived antigen presenting cells and suggest that P-glycoprotein is essential for these cells as when it is blocked, they respond by increasing expression of this protein. In summary, this work describes that human dendritic cells generated from plastic-adherent monocytes rapidly upregulate expression of P-glycoprotein as they mature, and in the presence of inflammatory stress and the pharmacological agent verapamil, which blocks P-glycoprotein activity, suggesting that P-glycoprotein may play a role in activation as well as in migration of dendritic cells.","['Ishri, Raj K', 'Menzies, Scott', 'Halliday, Gary M']","['Ishri RK', 'Menzies S', 'Halliday GM']","['Dermatology Laboratories, Melanoma and Skin Cancer Research Institute, Sydney Cancer Centre, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital at University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Immunol Invest,Immunological investigations,8504629,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dendritic Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/microbiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/drug effects/metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Rhodamine 123/metabolism', 'Streptococcus pyogenes/pathogenicity', '*Up-Regulation', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology']",2006/03/15 09:00,2006/05/05 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['G12T7K1X7565830U [pii]', '10.1080/08820130500496746 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Invest. 2006;35(1):1-18. doi: 10.1080/08820130500496746.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, mechanisms by which this GVHD-associated graft-versus-leukemia effect is exerted are poorly understood. In this study, we simultaneously traced the kinetics of normal donor-derived and leukemic recipient-derived B-lymphopoiesis comparing patients with or without GVHD. DESIGN AND METHODS: We used multiparameter flow-cytometry to quantify pro-B (CD19+CD10+CD34+), pre-B (CD19+CD10+CD34-) precursors and malignant lymphoblasts identified by leukemia-associated markers in 161 prospective marrow samples from 39 consecutive B-ALL patients after allogeneic SCT. Chimerism analysis was performed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction of null alleles and insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms. RESULTS: Acute GVHD of grades II-IV is associated with a strong inhibition of normal donor-derived pro-B and pre-B precursors at days +30 and +60 post-SCT. Patients who develop chronic GVHD have lower percentages of marrow B-cell precursors during the first year after SCT. Likewise, recipient-derived leukemia B cells were absent at days +30 and +60 in patients with acute GVHD grades II-IV and were less likely to be detected in patients with chronic GVHD. Induction of GVHD as treatment of increasing amounts of leukemia cells causes inhibition of both normal and malignant B compartments even in the absence of steroid therapy. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the development of GVHD after allogeneic SCT is associated with a non-specific inhibition of B-lymphopoiesis.","['Sanchez-Garcia, Joaquin', 'Serrano, Josefina', 'Gomez, Pedro', 'Martinez, Francisco', 'Martin, Carmen', 'Roman-Gomez, Jose', 'Rodriguez, Antonia', 'Herrera, Concepcion', 'Garcia, Jose M', 'Alvarez, Miguel A', 'Torres, Antonio']","['Sanchez-Garcia J', 'Serrano J', 'Gomez P', 'Martinez F', 'Martin C', 'Roman-Gomez J', 'Rodriguez A', 'Herrera C', 'Garcia JM', 'Alvarez MA', 'Torres A']","['Hematology and Bone Marrow transplantation Department, University Hospital Reina Sofia, Avda.

In order to gain insight into the characteristics of these complex B-CLPD we examined two cohorts of patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One cohort had two phenotypically distinct B-cell populations (group A; n= 9) and the other, two B-cell subsets showing different DNA contents and/or light scatter properties, but a similar immunophenotype (group B; n= 7). RESULTS: Fluorescent in situ hybridization studies revealed the presence of genetic abnormalities in six cases from group A, either in one (n=5) or the two co-existing B-cell populations (n=1); in all these cases the two B-cell populations showed unrelated IgH gene rearrangements. In all seven cases from group B, the B-cell population showing higher DNA contents had additional chromosomal abnormalities as compared to the other subset; molecular analysis confirmed the monoclonal nature of these cases.

We therefore investigated CD52 expression and campath-1H-mediated lysis of ALL cells in vitro. DESIGN AND METHODS: Complement-mediated cytotoxicity assays were performed on freshly isolated neoplastic cells and cell lines using human serum. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) was performed by calcein-AM release assays. RESULTS: CD52 was expressed in four out of eight ALL cell lines studied. Among 61 freshly isolated ALL samples CD52 was expressed at varying levels in 87% of cases. Whereas ADCC was equivalent in different CD52+ lines, complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) was variable. The REH cell line bearing the t(12;21) translocation showed 47-60% lysis when treated with 10 microg/mL campath-1H compared to 0-6% for the other cell lines expressing equivalent amounts of CD52. Furthermore all nine ALL samples with t(12;21) showed very high CDC (mean 97%) compared to the other 24 CD52+cases (mean 24%)(p<0.0001). In t(12;21) samples, efficient CDC was obtained with as little as 1 microg/mL campath-1H. CDC correlated in part with CD52 levels, suggesting that CD52 expression and other yet undefined factors contribute to the particular sensitivity of t(12;21) cells. The resistance of non t(12;21) ALL cases could be overcome to a limited extent by increasing the concentration of campath-1H, blocking the CD55 and CD59 complement inhibitors, and more effectively by combining campath-1H with fludarabine. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that most ALL samples express CD52 to a variable level and that campath-1H has cytotoxic activity against CD52+ALL, alone or in combination with cytotoxic drugs.","['Golay, Josee', 'Cortiana, Chiara', 'Manganini, Massimiliano', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Salvi, Anna', 'Spinelli, Orietta', 'Bassan, Renato', 'Barbui, Tiziano', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Introna, Martino']","['Golay J', 'Cortiana C', 'Manganini M', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Salvi A', 'Spinelli O', 'Bassan R', 'Barbui T', 'Biondi A', 'Rambaldi A', 'Introna M']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Gene Therapy G.

Here, we describe for the first time a fusion between NKX2-5 and the T-cell receptor delta locus (TRD) resulting in NKX2-5 activation in a case of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). DESIGN AND METHODS: Genomic DNA from a T-ALL patient with an atypical rearrangement, detected by Southern blotting, was analyzed by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with TRD-specific primers. Expression of NKX2-5 was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR in the T-ALL case with the NKX2-5-TRD rearrangement, 18 other cases of T-ALL, three T-ALL derived cell lines, two non-hematopoietic cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from six healthy individuals and sorted thymocyte subsets. RESULTS: Sequence analysis of ligation-mediated PCR products revealed a novel rearrangement between the third diversity segment of the TRD locus (TRDD3) and a region on chromosome 5q35.1 located 32 kb downstream of the NKX2-5/CSX gene. As a result of this recombination NKX2-5 was placed under influence of the TRD enhancer, resulting in strong ectopic NKX2-5 expression. High NKX2-5 expression was also found in the T-cell lines PEER and CCRF-CEM, which harbor an NKX2-5-BCL11B rearrangement, and in the embryonic kidney cell line 293. NKX2-5 was not expressed in any of the major thymocyte subsets, in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or in the majority (17/18) of the other cases of T-ALL.

To date, it is still not clear whether CD34 expression identifies a subset of APL patients with peculiar characteristics. We, therefore, conducted a detailed analysis of CD34 expression at diagnosis in 136 adults with de novo APL. DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated 136 newly diagnosed APL patients from four Italian Institutions. All 136 cases were tested for CD34 and CD2 expression: 124 (91%) cases were classified as hypergranular (M3) and 12 (9%) as the hyporgranular M3 variant (M3v). The parameters considered were white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts, hemoglobin levels, percentage of peripheral blood leukemic promyelocytes (PBLP), CD15, CD56 and HLA-DR expression, and the PML/RARalpha isoform, to assess their relationship with CD34 and CD2 expression. RESULTS: CD34 expression was associated with the M3v subtype and higher proportion of HLA-DR+ and CD2+ cases. Moreover, compared with CD34- APL patients, CD34+ APL patients had a significantly higher percentage of PBLP at presentation, were more frequently female and had a higher proportion of bcr3 expression. Among the 136 APL cases, 24 (17.6%) and 80 (58.8%) were identified as CD34+CD2+ and CD34-CD2-, respectively. The two groups showed statistically significant differences in terms of M3vfrequency, WBC and platelet counts, percentage of PBLP, and bcr3 expression.

We developed two 6-MP- and 6-TG-resistant cell lines from the human T-lymphoblastic cell line (MOLT-4) by prolonged exposure to these drugs. The resistant cells were highly cross resistant to 6-MP and 6-TG, and exhibited marked reduction in cellular uptake of 6-MP (70% and 80%, respectively). No significant modification of the activities of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase, thiopurine methyltransferase or inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase was observed. Real-time PCR of concentrative nucleoside transporter 3 (CNT3) and equilibrative nucleoside transporter 2 (ENT2) of resistant cells showed substantial reductions in expression of messenger RNAs. Small interfering RNA designed to silence the CNT3 and ENT2 genes down-regulated the expression of these genes in leukemia cells. These decreases were accompanied by reduction of transport of 6-MP (47% and 21%, respectively) as well as its cytocidal effect (30% and 21%, respectively). Taken together these results show that CNT3 and ENT2 play a key role in the transport of 6-MP and 6-TG by leukemia cells. From a clinical point of view determination of CNT3 and ENT2 levels in leukemia cells may be useful in predicting the efficacy of thiopurine treatment.","['Fotoohi, Alan Kambiz', 'Lindqvist, Malin', 'Peterson, Curt', 'Albertioni, Freidoun']","['Fotoohi AK', 'Lindqvist M', 'Peterson C', 'Albertioni F']","['Department of Oncology and Pathology, Cancer Center Karolinska, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1)', '0 (Equilibrative-Nucleoside Transporter 2)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (SLC29A1 protein, human)', '0 (SLC29A2 protein, human)', '0 (cif nucleoside transporter)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/genetics', 'Equilibrative-Nucleoside Transporter 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/metabolism', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mercaptopurine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Thioguanine/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2006/03/15 09:00,2006/05/25 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2006/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(06)00436-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.02.134 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2006 Apr 28;343(1):208-15. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.02.134.

We report that the transcription factor known as MEF (or ELF4), which is targeted by the t(X;21)(q26;q22) in acute myelogenous leukemia, regulates the proliferation of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells at steady state, controlling their quiescence. Mef null HSCs display increased residence in G0 with reduced 5-bromodeoxyuridine incorporation in vivo and impaired cytokine-driven proliferation in vitro. Due to their increased HSC quiescence, Mef null mice are relatively resistant to the myelosuppressive effects of chemotherapy and radiation. Thus, MEF plays an important role in the decision of stem/primitive progenitor cells to divide or remain quiescent by regulating their entry to the cell cycle.","['Lacorazza, H Daniel', 'Yamada, Takeshi', 'Liu, Yan', 'Miyata, Yasuhiko', 'Sivina, Mariela', 'Nunes, Juliana', 'Nimer, Stephen D']","['Lacorazza HD', 'Yamada T', 'Liu Y', 'Miyata Y', 'Sivina M', 'Nunes J', 'Nimer SD']","['Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, New York 10021, USA. hdl@bcm.tmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Cell,Cancer cell,101130617,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Elf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Bone and Bones/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2006/03/15 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2005/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/23 00:00 [revised]', '2006/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1535-6108(06)00054-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ccr.2006.02.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Cell. 2006 Mar;9(3):175-87. doi: 10.1016/j.ccr.2006.02.017.,,,,,"['KO1-CA099156/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK52208/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review focuses on the role of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), the principal endogenous metabolite of vitamin A (retinol) and its metabolism in oncology and dermatology. ATRA has been used successfully in differentiated therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia, skin cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and also in the treatment of acne and psoriasis. However, its usefulness is limited by the rapid emergence of acquired ATRA resistance involving multifactoral mechanisms. A key mechanism of resistance involves ATRA-induced catabolism of ATRA. Thus, a novel strategy to overcome the limitation associated with exogenous ATRA therapy has been to modulate and/or increase the levels of endogenous ATRA by inhibiting the cytochrome P450-dependent ATRA-4-hydroxylase enzymes (particularly CYP26s) responsible for ATRA metabolism. These inhibitors are also referred to as retinoic acid metabolism blocking agents (RAMBAs). This review highlights development in the design, synthesis, and evaluation of RAMBAs.

Unlike most forms of leukemia, the pattern of bone marrow infiltration in TLGL may be subtle and the cytopenias are often lineage specific, with neutropenia dominating. Both granulocytic survival and proliferation defects are observed and are mediated by humoral and cell-mediated mechanisms respectively. Splenic production of immune complexes induces a neutrophil survival defect, where as Fas expression by leukemic CTL results in a marrow based proliferation defect. These humoral and cell-mediated pathways induce granulocytic apoptosis through independent intracellular mechanisms which are not mutually exclusive and may be observed concurrently in individual patients with either TLGL or FS. A variety of therapeutic interventions have been utilized in the management of TLGL and Felty syndrome, including methotrexate, cyclosporine A, cyclophosphamide, glucocorticoids, myeloid colony stimulating factors and splenectomy. Their efficacy and mechanisms of action are reviewed.","['Burks, Eric J', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr']","['Burks EJ', 'Loughran TP Jr']","[""Harvard School of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Department of Pathology, Boston, MA 02115, USA. ejburks@partners.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Arthritis, Rheumatoid/immunology', 'Felty Syndrome/drug therapy/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Splenectomy']",2006/03/15 09:00,2006/10/20 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0268-960X(06)00004-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.blre.2006.01.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2006 Sep;20(5):245-66. doi: 10.1016/j.blre.2006.01.003.

CD8 is expressed as both heterodimeric CD8alphabeta and homodimeric CD8alphaalpha isoforms, which have distinct physiological roles and exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns. CD8alphaalpha has previously been crystallized in complex with class I pMHC and, more recently, with the mouse class Ib thymic leukemia antigen (TL). Here, we present the crystal structure of a soluble form of mouse CD8alphaalpha in complex with rat monoclonal antibody YTS 105.18 Fab fragment at 2.88 A resolution. YTS 105.18, which is commonly used in the blockade of CD8+ T-cell activation in response to peptide antigen, is specific for mouse CD8alpha. The YTS 105.18 Fab is one of only five rat IgG Fab structures to have been reported to date. Analysis of the YTS 105.18 Fab epitope on CD8alpha reveals that this antibody blocks CD8 activity by hydrogen bonding to residues that are critical for interaction with both class I pMHC and TL. Structural comparison of the liganded and unliganded forms of soluble CD8alphaalpha indicates that the mouse CD8alphaalpha immunoglobulin-domain dimer does not undergo significant structural alteration upon interaction either with class I pMHC or TL.","['Shore, D A', 'Teyton, L', 'Dwek, R A', 'Rudd, P M', 'Wilson, I A']","['Shore DA', 'Teyton L', 'Dwek RA', 'Rudd PM', 'Wilson IA']","['Department of Molecular Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 antigen, alpha chain)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*chemistry/metabolism', 'CD8 Antigens/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Dimerization', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/metabolism', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*chemistry']",2006/03/15 09:00,2006/05/31 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2005/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/02 00:00 [revised]', '2006/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(06)00185-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2006.02.016 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2006 Apr 28;358(2):347-54. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2006.02.016.

The Moloney murine leukemia retroviral (MMLV) vector pLNHX was modified to incorporate EGFP or luciferase reporter genes under control of schistosome endogenous gene promoters from the spliced leader RNA and HSP70 genes. These constructs and a plasmid encoding vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) were utilized along with GP2-293 cells to produce replication incompetent retrovirus particles pseudotyped with the VSVG envelope. Exposure of several developmental stages, including sporocysts, of Schistosoma mansoni to these virions was facilitated by incubation with polybrene and/or by centrifugation. The early stages of binding and uptake of virus to the parasite tegument were demonstrated by the immunofluorescence colocalization of VSVG envelope and retroviral capsid proteins. Southern hybridization analysis indicated the integration of proviral forms of the MMLV constructs in genomic DNA isolated from the virus exposed schistosomes. Furthermore, analysis of RNA isolated from virus treated parasites demonstrated the presence of transcripts encoding reporter transgenes. Together these results indicated productive transduction by VSVG pseudotyped MMLV of cultured schistosomes, and suggest a tractable route forward towards heritable schistosome transgenesis.","['Kines, Kristine J', 'Mann, Victoria H', 'Morales, Maria E', 'Shelby, Bryan D', 'Kalinna, Bernd H', 'Gobert, Geoffrey N', 'Chirgwin, Sharon R', 'Brindley, Paul J']","['Kines KJ', 'Mann VH', 'Morales ME', 'Shelby BD', 'Kalinna BH', 'Gobert GN', 'Chirgwin SR', 'Brindley PJ']","['Department of Tropical Medicine and Center for Infectious Diseases, Tulane University, Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Parasitol,Experimental parasitology,0370713,"['0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomphalaria', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique/methods', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/physiology', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Schistosoma mansoni/*genetics/physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/chemistry/*genetics', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/*genetics', 'Virus Integration']",2006/03/15 09:00,2006/04/19 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2006/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/30 00:00 [revised]', '2006/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4894(06)00029-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exppara.2006.02.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Parasitol. 2006 Apr;112(4):209-20. doi: 10.1016/j.exppara.2006.02.003.

Recently, a second factor, Wnt, with similar activity was found. However, the relationship between these completely different signals mediating the overlapping functions is still unclear. Here, we report that the conditioned medium of L cells expressing Wnt3a maintains ES cells in the undifferentiated state in feeder-free culture, followed by expression of stem cell markers and their ability to generate germline chimaeras. However, although the activity of this conditioned medium is dependent on Wnt3a, recombinant Wnt3a protein cannot maintain ES cells in the undifferentiated state. As supplementation with Wnt3a to the sub-threshold level of LIF alone was not sufficient to maintain ES self-renewal, the results of maintenance of the undifferentiated state indicated the synergistic action of Wnt and LIF. Induction of constitutively activated beta-catenin alone is unable to maintain ES self-renewal but shows a synergistic effect with LIF. These observations indicate that the Wnt signal mediated by the canonical pathway is not sufficient but enhances the effect of LIF to maintain self-renewal of mouse ES cells.","['Ogawa, Kazuya', 'Nishinakamura, Ryuichi', 'Iwamatsu, Yuko', 'Shimosato, Daisuke', 'Niwa, Hitoshi']","['Ogawa K', 'Nishinakamura R', 'Iwamatsu Y', 'Shimosato D', 'Niwa H']","['Laboratory for Pluripotent Cell Studies, RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, 2-2-3 Minatojima-Minamimachi, Chuo-ku, Kobe 650-0047, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Wnt3 Protein)', '0 (Wnt3A Protein)', '0 (Wnt3a protein, mouse)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Wnt Proteins/analysis/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Wnt3 Protein', 'Wnt3A Protein', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",2006/03/15 09:00,2006/05/25 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2006/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(06)00400-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.02.127 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2006 Apr 28;343(1):159-66. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.02.127.

IgV(H) mutational status, chromosomal aberrations, CD38 expression and ZAP-70 expression are prognostic markers in CLL, however, they are not exclusively confined to this disease. We recently identified a novel CLL-specific gene (CLL upregulated gene1, CLLU1) that is exclusively upregulated in CLL cells. Here we describe our evaluation of the prognostic significance of CLLU1 in CLL. METHODS: A cohort of 59 previously untreated CLL patients was studied. We determined the expression levels of two CLLU1 transcripts, cDNA1 and CDS, by quantitative RT-PCR. The relation between CLLU1 expression and time to therapy, overall survival and presence or absence of ZAP-70, CD38, chromosomal aberrations or IgV(H) mutations in the 59 patients was analyzed. RESULTS: Analyzed as a continuous, quantitative parameter CLLU1 levels significantly predicted time from diagnosis to initiation of therapy (P < or = 0.0003) Analyzed as a categorical parameter, by segregation of the patients into groups with cDNA1 or CDS expression above or below the median, the CLLU1 levels significantly predicted time from diagnosis to initiation of therapy (P = 0.001) and predicted overall survival with borderline significance (P < or = 0.05). Patient stratification according to clinical stage, cytogenetics, IgV(H) mutational status, ZAP-70 and CD38, demonstrated significantly increased CLLU1 expression in all investigated CLL poor risk groups. CLLU1 expression levels contributed additional prognostic information to ZAP-70-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: CLLU1 is the first identified CLL specific gene. The CLLU1 mRNA expression level can predict time to initiation of treatment and survival in CLL patients.","['Buhl, Anne Mette', 'Jurlander, Jesper', 'Geisler, Christian Hartmann', 'Pedersen, Lone Bredo', 'Andersen, Mette Klarskov', 'Josefsson, Par', 'Petersen, Jorgen Holm', 'Leffers, Henrik']","['Buhl AM', 'Jurlander J', 'Geisler CH', 'Pedersen LB', 'Andersen MK', 'Josefsson P', 'Petersen JH', 'Leffers H']","['Department of Hematology, The Leukemia Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Denmark. am.buhl@ge2net.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CLLU1 lncRNA, human)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA, Complementary/analysis', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Organ Specificity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Up-Regulation', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/biosynthesis/genetics']",2006/03/15 09:00,2006/07/20 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH635 [pii]', '10.1111/j.0902-4441.2005.t01-1-EJH2530.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2006 Jun;76(6):455-64. doi: 10.1111/j.0902-4441.2005.t01-1-EJH2530.x.

Thirty-four patients with CMML [18 MDS-CMML and 16 myeloproliferative disorder (MPD)-CMML], 90 with MDS, 41 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 19 with chronic MPD and 25 control subjects were studied. In normal samples survivin was never detectable. In CMML survivin levels higher than in MDS and AML (P < 0.0001), but similar to those found in MPD were observed. In CMML and MDS apoptosis was significantly higher compared to normal controls and all other subtypes of leukemias (P < 0.0001). Proliferation did not differ significantly in normal controls, MDS and CMML; the lowest levels were observed in AML and MPD (P < 0.0001). In CMML there was no correlation between survivin expression and blast cell percentage, apoptosis or proliferation, FAB or WHO subgroup. Proliferation was higher in MDS-CMML and tended to correlate with overall survival. CMML-2 cases with higher survivin expression showed higher evolution rate and shorter survival. In conclusion, CMML is characterized by high proliferation and apoptosis. Survivin overexpression, by disrupting the balance between cell proliferation/differentiation and apoptosis, may play an important role in its pathophysiology. The detection of survivin-deregulated expression may provide a useful tool for diagnosis, prognosis and a possible target for experimental treatments.","['Invernizzi, Rosangela', 'Travaglino, Erica', 'Benatti, Chiara', 'Malcovati, Luca', 'Della Porta, Matteo', 'Cazzola, Mario', 'Ascari, Edoardo']","['Invernizzi R', 'Travaglino E', 'Benatti C', 'Malcovati L', 'Della Porta M', 'Cazzola M', 'Ascari E']","['Institute of Internal Medicine and Medical Oncology, University of Pavia, IRCCS Policlinico S.

Factors that that have been reported to influence prognosis include the pattern and extent of marrow infiltration and histological discordance between the primary site and the bone marrow. METHODS: Bone marrow biopsies from 172 patients with newly diagnosed DLCL entered in two consecutive trials of the Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group were analyzed. Progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated according to the absence or presence of bone marrow involvement (BMI), the extent of lymphomatous infiltration and the presence of histological discordance between the primary site and the bone marrow. RESULTS: Of 172 patients with DLCL accrued between 1982 and 1990, who were treated with CHOP or CHOP-like regimens, 47 (27%) demonstrated marrow involvement on examination of multiple levels. Seventy two percent (34/47) of patients had discordant marrow involvement (<50% large cells) and 28 had minimal (<10%) involvement; these latter patients with minimal marrow involvement (<10%) had similar PFS & OS to the 113 patients without involvement. Within the group of 47 patients with marrow involvement, an increasing percentage of BM involvement was significantly associated with an increasing percentage of concordant histology and a decreasing PFS & OS. CONCLUSIONS: Minimal BMI, seen in the majority of patients with DLCL with marrow infiltration, appears not to influence the PFS & OS. However, an increasing degree of marrow involvement is associated with an increasing component of large cells and a poorer prognosis in DLCL patients, independent of other risk factors.","['Campbell, Janine', 'Seymour, John F', 'Matthews, Jane', 'Wolf, Max', 'Stone, Janey', 'Juneja, Surender']","['Campbell J', 'Seymour JF', 'Matthews J', 'Wolf M', 'Stone J', 'Juneja S']","[""Division of Laboratory Services, Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Biopsy/methods', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination/methods', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Analysis']",2006/03/15 09:00,2006/07/20 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH644 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00644.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2006 Jun;76(6):473-80. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00644.x.

In addition to direct cellular effects, antibodies can carry substances to the targeted cells, such as radioactive isotopes, toxins, and antineoplastic agents. At present monoclonal antibodies, directed against both lymphoid antigens (CD 20 and CD 52) and a myeloid antigen (CD33) are available for clinical use. In ALL, rituximab, a humanized anti CD20 antibody, has been combined to chemotherapy mainly in mature B-ALL and Burkitt's lymphoma and preliminary results are promising. Alemtuzumab is an anti-CD52 humanized antibody, which showed anti-tumour activity in CLL; clinical effects were observed in some patients with relapsed adult ALL. Monoclonal antibodies against myeloid antigens have been prevalently used in acute myeloid leukaemias (AML), where the most utilised immunological target is CD33. The CD33 molecule is expressed by approximately 90% of AMLs but not on CD34(+) bone marrow-resident hematopoietic stem cells. The humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody HuM195 has only modest activity against overt AML, but it can eliminate minimal residual disease. Radioimmunotherapy with beta-particle-emitting isotopes targeting CD33 shows a major efficacy. Targeted chemotherapy with the anti-CD33-calicheamicin construct gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) has produced remissions as a single agent in patients with relapsed AML and appears promising when used in combination with standard chemotherapy. GO is composed of a humanized immunoglobulin G(4) (IgG(4)) monoclonal antibody (mAb), targeting the CD33 antigen and linked to a calicheamicin derivative, a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic. GO has been approved by FDA as second-line therapy in older patients with AML.

The advent of imatinib mesylate, an inhibitor of the molecular defect driving CML, the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, has rewritten treatment algorithms for this disease and has shifted focus away from allografting. Despite advances in stem cell transplantation, such as broader availability with the use of modified conditioning regimens, use of allografting has diminished. Also, the nearly universal patient exposure to imatinib or other kinase inhibitors before transplantation may affect the biology of the disease that is currently being treated with an allograft and ultimately may affect outcomes. Exceedingly high rates of meaningful and stable response with longer follow-up continue to drive enthusiasm for imatinib use, and understanding of resistance mechanisms has driven rapid investigation of second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors to address imatinib failure and suboptimal response. In most patients, imatinib reduces CML to a minimal residual disease state in which options to further deepen remission, such as immunotherapy, are sought; monitoring techniques and interpretation of response advance in parallel to meet demands; and uncertainty remains as a new natural history of CML is defined in an era of kinase inhibitor therapy. This review summarizes the state of transplant and nontransplant therapy for CML and discusses the decision making for patients with an aim to optimize the use of our best therapies for CML in an era of uncertainty.","['Mauro, Michael J', 'Maziarz, Richard T']","['Mauro MJ', 'Maziarz RT']","['Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Oregon Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, UHN73C, Portland, OR 97239, USA. maurom@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Mayo Clin Proc,Mayo Clinic proceedings,0405543,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/etiology/*therapy', 'Patient Selection', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/03/15 09:00,2006/04/12 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0025-6196(11)61471-7 [pii]', '10.4065/81.3.404 [doi]']",ppublish,Mayo Clin Proc. 2006 Mar;81(3):404-16. doi: 10.4065/81.3.404.,,,,,,,94,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because TNF-alpha has been shown to induce the activation and maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), we investigated the efficacy of DC-based leukemia vaccine for eradication of residual disease when administered following cytoreductive therapy. Immunization with DC cells loaded with 32Dp210 myeloid leukemia cells (32Dp210 vaccine) was far more effective in preventing the development of leukemia compared to immunization with irradiated leukemia cells alone. The resistance to leukemia could be adoptively transferred to naive mice with the spleen cells of mice immunized with DC-32Dp210 vaccine, and splenic cells responsible for adoptive transfer of resistance were identified as CD90 + T lymphocytes. Development of immunity in vaccinated mice was associated with the generation of leukemia specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and secretion of cytokines TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. Further, immunization with DC-32Dp210 vaccine following cytoreductive therapy with Cytoxan was effective in eradicating residual disease in approximately 50 percent of the animals. However, eradication of residual disease was significantly improved (approximately 74%) when animals were treated with DC-32Dp210 vaccine in which DCs were activated with TNF-alpha prior to loading of 32Dp210 leukemia cells. Cured mice were in molecular remission since Bcr/Abl oncogene could not be amplified from the DNA isolated from the marrow, spleen, or liver of cured mice. Taken together, these data demonstrate the efficacy of DC-based leukemia vaccine for eradication of residual disease and prevention of relapse.","['Deeb, Dorrah', 'Gao, Xiaohua', 'Jiang, Hao', 'Divine, George', 'Dulchavsky, Scott A', 'Gautam, Subhash C']","['Deeb D', 'Gao X', 'Jiang H', 'Divine G', 'Dulchavsky SA', 'Gautam SC']","['Department of Surgery, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, Ml 48202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Exp Ther Oncol,Journal of experimental therapeutics & oncology,9604933,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*immunology/metabolism']",2006/03/15 09:00,2006/05/23 09:00,['2006/03/15 09:00'],"['2006/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Exp Ther Oncol. 2006;5(3):183-93.,,,,,['CA 85976/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, obtaining high titers of infective MoMLV retroviral vectors is difficult due to the vector inherent instability. In this work the effect of the cell culture medium osmotic pressure upon the virus stability was studied. The osmolality of standard medium was raised from 335 up to 500 mOsm/kg using either ionic (sodium chloride) or non-ionic osmotic agents (sorbitol and fructose). It was observed that, independently of the osmotic agent used, the infectious vector inactivation rate was inversely correlated with the osmolality used in the production media; therefore, the use of high medium osmolalities enhanced vector stability. For production purposes a balance must be struck between cell yield, cell productivity and retroviral stability. From the conditions tested herein sorbitol addition, ensuring osmolalities between 410 and 450 mOsm/kg, yields the best production conditions; NaCl hampered the viral infectious production while fructose originates lower cell yields. Lipid extractions were performed for cholesterol and phospholipid analyses showing that more stable viral vectors had a 10% reduction in the cholesterol content. A similar reduction in cholesterol was observed in the producer cells. A detailed analysis of the major phospholipids composition, type and fatty acid content, by mass spectrometry did not show significant changes, confirming the decrease in the cholesterol to phospholipids ratio in the viral membrane as the major reason for the increased vector stability.","['Coroadinha, A S', 'Silva, A C', 'Pires, E', 'Coelho, A', 'Alves, P M', 'Carrondo, M J T']","['Coroadinha AS', 'Silva AC', 'Pires E', 'Coelho A', 'Alves PM', 'Carrondo MJ']","['IBET/ITQB, Apartado 12, P-2781-901 Oeiras, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '30237-26-4 (Fructose)', '451W47IQ8X (Sodium Chloride)', '506T60A25R (Sorbitol)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cholesterol/analysis', 'Culture Media/chemistry', 'Fructose/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Genetic Vectors/chemistry/*drug effects/physiology', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Osmotic Pressure/drug effects', 'Phospholipids/analysis', 'Retroviridae/chemistry/*drug effects/physiology', 'Sodium Chloride/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Sorbitol/chemistry/*pharmacology']",2006/03/11 09:00,2006/06/30 09:00,['2006/03/11 09:00'],"['2006/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bit.20847 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2006 Jun 5;94(2):322-9. doi: 10.1002/bit.20847.,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about the etiology of this heterogeneous group of diseases despite the fact they constitute the major cause of death by disease among this population. Because of its relatively high prevalence, most of the work done in pediatric oncogenetics has been focused on leukemias, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Although it is now well accepted that genetic variation plays a significant role in determining individual's cancer susceptibility, few studies have explored genetic susceptibility to childhood leukemia with respect to common polymorphisms. The biochemical and genetic mechanisms contributing to cancer susceptibility are numerous and can be grouped into broad categories: (1) cellular growth and differentiation, (2) DNA replication and repair, (3) metabolism of carcinogens (4) apoptosis, (5) oxidative stress response and (6) cell cycle. To evaluate whether candidate genes in these pathways are involved in childhood leukemogenesis, we conducted case-control studies. We showed that leukemogenesis in children may be associated with DNA variants in some of these genes and that the combination of genotypes seems to be more predictive of risk than either of them independently. We also observed that, at least at some loci, the parental genetics might be important in predicting the risk of cancer in this pediatric model of a complex disease. Taken together, these results indicate that the investigation of a single enzyme and/or a single genotype might not be sufficient to explain the etiology of childhood leukemia because of the complexity of the environment and that of the inter-individual variability in cancer susceptibility.","['Sinnett, Daniel', 'Labuda, Damian', 'Krajinovic, Maja']","['Sinnett D', 'Labuda D', 'Krajinovic M']","[""Service d'Hematologie-Oncologie, Centre de Cancerologie Charles-Bruneau, Centre de Recherche, Hopital Sainte-Justine, Departement de Pediatrie, Universite de Montreal, 3175 Cote Ste-Catherine, H3T 1C5, Montreal (Quebec), Canada. daniel.sinnett@umontreal.ca""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Fam Cancer,Familial cancer,100898211,"['9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*epidemiology', 'Genotype', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Oxidative Stress/*physiology', 'Pediatrics', 'Pedigree', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment']",2006/03/11 09:00,2006/06/23 09:00,['2006/03/11 09:00'],"['2006/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10689-005-2574-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Fam Cancer. 2006;5(1):35-47. doi: 10.1007/s10689-005-2574-4.,,,,,,,136,,,,,,,,,,,,

A linear two-compartment model with linear elimination best described the data. Setting mean parameters values and variabilities to population values, we obtained Bayesian prediction of MTX pharmacokinetic parameters and concentrations. The predictive performance was evaluated by comparing the Bayesian estimated and observed concentrations and the Bayesian estimated parameters with the individual final model estimated parameters.

Finally, these nonsecosteroidal VDRMs were less calcemic in vivo, and LY2108491 exhibited more than 270-fold improved therapeutic index over the naturally occurring VDR ligand 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] in an in vivo preclinical surrogate model of psoriasis.","['Ma, Yanfei', 'Khalifa, Berket', 'Yee, Ying K', 'Lu, Jianfen', 'Memezawa, Ai', 'Savkur, Rajesh S', 'Yamamoto, Yoko', 'Chintalacharuvu, Subba R', 'Yamaoka, Kazuyoshi', 'Stayrook, Keith R', 'Bramlett, Kelli S', 'Zeng, Qing Q', 'Chandrasekhar, Srinivasan', 'Yu, Xiao-Peng', 'Linebarger, Jared H', 'Iturria, Stephen J', 'Burris, Thomas P', 'Kato, Shigeaki', 'Chin, William W', 'Nagpal, Sunil']","['Ma Y', 'Khalifa B', 'Yee YK', 'Lu J', 'Memezawa A', 'Savkur RS', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Chintalacharuvu SR', 'Yamaoka K', 'Stayrook KR', 'Bramlett KS', 'Zeng QQ', 'Chandrasekhar S', 'Yu XP', 'Linebarger JH', 'Iturria SJ', 'Burris TP', 'Kato S', 'Chin WW', 'Nagpal S']","['Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, Indiana 46285, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Acetates)', '0 (Arylsulfonates)', '0 (LY 2108491)', '0 (LY 2109866)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '0 (dihydroxy-vitamin D3)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Acetates/chemical synthesis/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Arylsulfonates/chemical synthesis/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Calcitriol/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colonic Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/metabolism', 'Intestines', 'Keratinocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Mice, Hairless', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Models, Biological', 'Osteoblasts/drug effects/metabolism', 'Psoriasis/drug therapy', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/agonists/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Species Specificity', 'Thiophenes/chemical synthesis/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2006/03/11 09:00,2006/05/17 09:00,['2006/03/11 09:00'],"['2005/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI25901 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2006 Apr;116(4):892-904. doi: 10.1172/JCI25901.

This effect was reduced in cells expressing BCR/ABL(Y177F) mutant, which does not elevate ROS. Inhibition of ROS in leukemia cells by the antioxidants pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and vitamin E (VE) decreased the mutagenesis rate and frequency of IM resistance. Simultaneous administration of IM and an antioxidant exerted better antimutagenic effect than an antioxidant alone.

These profiles showed many similarities to reported interferon-gamma-induced gene expression in normal CD34+ cells; indeed the 2 most up-regulated genes, IFIT1 and IFITM1, are interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Alterations in the expression of ISGs may play a role in the hematologic features of MDS, such as peripheral blood cytopenias. Up-regulation of IFIT1 is a potential diagnostic marker for MDS. We determined whether distinct gene expression profiles were associated with specific FAB and cytogenetic groups. CD34+ cells from patients with refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) showed a particular gene expression profile characterized by up-regulation of mitochondrial-related genes and, in particular, of those of heme synthesis (eg, ALAS2). CD34+ cells from patients with the del(5q) had a distinct gene expression profile, characterized by down-regulation of genes assigned to 5q, and up-regulation of the histone HIST1 gene cluster at chromosome 6p21 and of genes related to the actin cytoskeleton.

The risk of CLL was significantly increased among subjects with a personal history of pernicious anemia (OR = 1.94; 1.18-3.18), mainly in the 0- to 1-year latency period. A significantly decreased risk of CLL was found among individuals with a personal history of chronic rheumatic heart disease (OR = 0.55; 0.33-0.93), particularly persons with a long latency (10+ years) between the 2 conditions. We found no association between personal or familial occurrence of other autoimmune or related disorders and CLL.

Conventional cytogenetics revealed a 6q deletion in 46% of lymphomas, including two cases that showed 6q deletion as the sole chromosome anomaly. Interphase FISH analysis demonstrated allelic loss of 6q regions in 33 out of 35 cases (94.2%); the deletions were discontinuous, involving nonadjacent molecular regions. Although 6q deletion is a common event in all types of lymphomas, specific deletion patterns seem to characterize different histological types, suggesting that different tumor suppressor genes play different roles in different types of lymphomas.

Sf-Stk provides signals that cooperate with EpoR signals to effect expansion of erythroid progenitors. The latter phase of disease is characterized by a clonal expansion of transformed leukemic cells causing an acute erythroleukemia in mice. Signaling by Sf-Stk and EpoR mediated by gp55 renders erythroid progenitors Epo independent through the activation of the EpoR downstream pathways such as PI3K, MAPK and JAK/STAT. Previous work has shown that Src family kinases also play an important role in erythropoiesis. In particular, mutation of Src and Lyn can affect erythropoiesis. In this report we analyze the role of the Lyn tyrosine kinase in the pathogenesis of Friend virus. We demonstrate that during FV infection of primary erythroblasts, Lyn is not required for expansion of viral targets. Lyn deficient bone marrow and spleen cells are able to form Epo independent FV colonies in vitro. In vivo infection of Lyn deficient animals also results in a massive splenomegaly characteristic of the virus. However, we observe differences in the pathogenesis of Friend erythroleukemia in Lyn-/- mice. Lyn-/- mice infected with the polycythemia inducing strain of FV, FVP, do not develop polycythemia suggesting that Lyn-/- infected erythroblasts have a defect in terminal differentiation. Furthermore, the expansion of transformed cells in the spleen is reduced in Lyn-/- mice. Our data show that Lyn signals are not required for susceptibility to Friend erythroleukemia, but Lyn plays a role in later events, the terminal differentiation of infected cells and the expansion of transformed cells.","['Subramanian, Aparna', 'Hegde, Shailaja', 'Correll, Pamela H', 'Paulson, Robert F']","['Subramanian A', 'Hegde S', 'Correll PH', 'Paulson RF']","['Graduate Program in Biochemistry, Microbiology and Molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology/virology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/genetics', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism/virology', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/*genetics/virology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology/*genetics', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', '*Mutation', 'Phosphotransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/enzymology/*genetics', 'Spleen/enzymology/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/enzymology/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/*genetics']",2006/03/11 09:00,2006/09/13 09:00,['2006/03/11 09:00'],"['2005/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/24 00:00 [revised]', '2006/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(06)00064-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2006.02.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2006 Sep;30(9):1141-9. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2006.02.006.

To elucidate the molecular mechanism responsible for nerve regeneration, hundreds of nerve regeneration-associated genes have been hunted using differential display polymerase chain reaction (DD-PCR), random cloning, microarray and proteomics. Damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase (DINE) is a newly identified nerve regeneration-related molecule derived from normal and axotomized hypoglosssal nuclei using DD-PCR. After full-length cloning, we have found that DINE is a neuron-specific membrane-bound metalloprotease. Damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase shares homology with neprilysin and endothelin-converting enzyme, which degrade or process neuropeptides. Although DINE has some neuroprotective effects, the physiological function of, as well as the substrate for, DINE remains obscure. The most intriguing property of DINE is its extreme transcriptional response against various types of nerve injuries, including that of the peripheral and central nervous systems. Thus, a more detailed expression profile of DINE mRNA was investigated using the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) after sciatic nerve injury. In the DRG, DINE mRNA was observed in small-sized DRG neurons after axotomy. This expression profile was similar to that of the neuropeptide galanin. Both in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that leukemia inhibitory factor and nerve growth factor withdrawal additively enhanced the expression of DINE, as well as that of galanin. Damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase and galanin may use common transcriptional regulation machinery. Although functional correlation of these molecules remains unclear, their simultaneous induction may provide more successful protection for injured neurons.","['Kiryu-Seo, Sumiko']",['Kiryu-Seo S'],"['Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Osaka City University, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan. skiryu@med.osaka-cu.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Japan,Anat Sci Int,Anatomical science international,101154140,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '88813-36-9 (Galanin)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ECEL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Galanin/physiology', 'Interleukin-6/physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Metalloendopeptidases/genetics/*isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Nerve Regeneration/genetics', 'Peripheral Nerve Injuries', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",2006/03/11 09:00,2006/05/26 09:00,['2006/03/11 09:00'],"['2006/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1447-073X.2006.00136.x [doi]'],ppublish,Anat Sci Int. 2006 Mar;81(1):1-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1447-073X.2006.00136.x.,,,,,,,30,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kip1/p27 is the main cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, which arrests cell division inhibiting G1-S transition. Kip1/p27 seems to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of several human malignancies and its lower expression has been shown to correlate with a poor prognosis in adult solid tumors. METHODS: Bone marrow blasts from 49 children with leukemia, 37 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and 12 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were studied. Exon 3 of Kip1/p27 was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction technique (PCR). Single strand conformational polymorphism and heterodouplex analysis were performed to detect DNA sequence with altered conformations and were subsequently sequenced to document mutations. RESULTS: Mutations in Kip1/p27 gene were detected in 2 out of 3 T-ALL, 6 out of 12 AML patients, and only 1 out of 34 B lineage ALL cases. Although the patient groups are small, a highly significant relation of the mutation status with the type of leukemia (P = 0.0037) and the risk group according to treatment protocols (P = 0.00021) was estimated.

Anti-proliferative activity of XP-180 was observed on all of these cancer cell lines with comparable efficiency and in a dose-dependent manner. Morphological investigation further suggested that common features of apoptosis, including cell shrinkage and rounding, are present in XP-180 treated cells. Loss of adhesion properties of these solid tumour cell lines was observed upon XP-180 incubation. Anchorage-dependent clonogenicity assay on solid tumour cell lines and semi-solid methylcellulose colony formation assay on leukaemia cell line further revealed that XP-180 strongly inhibited the regeneration potential of these cancer cells. Using KG1a as an experimental model system, XP-180 was shown to stimulate the activity of caspase 3, 8 and 9 without significant change in caspase 6 activity. Furthermore, XP-180 readily induced collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential after 2 h of incubation. However, the use of the generic caspase specific inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK does not significantly reverse XP-180 mediated cell death. The results obtained suggest that XP-180-mediated cancer cell death could involve mitochondria and both caspase-dependent and -independent pathways. Therefore, XP-180 is an efficient anti-cancer regimen in vitro.","['Chui, Chung Hin', 'Gambari, Roberto', 'Lau, Fung Yi', 'Cheng, Gregory Yin Ming', 'Wong, Raymond Siu Ming', 'Kok, Stanton Hon Lung', 'Tang, Johnny Cheuk On', 'Teo, Ivy Tuang Ngo', 'Cheung, Filly', 'Cheng, Chor Hing', 'Ho, Kwok Ping', 'Chan, Albert Sun Chi', 'Wong, Alfonso']","['Chui CH', 'Gambari R', 'Lau FY', 'Cheng GY', 'Wong RS', 'Kok SH', 'Tang JC', 'Teo IT', 'Cheung F', 'Cheng CH', 'Ho KP', 'Chan AS', 'Wong A']","['Anti-Cancer Research Center, State Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicine and Molecular Pharmacology, Department of Applied Biology, and Chemical Technology, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biological Products)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bacteria/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Biological Products/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fermentation', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/physiology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2006/03/10 09:00,2006/08/08 09:00,['2006/03/10 09:00'],"['2006/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2006 Apr;17(4):675-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is often difficult to obtain good karyotypes, especially of cells from cases with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) because of poor morphology and spreading. Thus, detailed karyotyping can be hampered and even in case of a 'normal karyotype' according to banding cytogenetics doubts remain if the result is reliable. In order to address this problem a series of 37 ALL cases without any detectable numerical or structural chromosomal defects was selected and studied by two recently developed multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) approaches: 1) multitude multicolor banding (mMCB) is a FISH-banding technique, which allows the analyses of inter- and intra-chromosomal rearrangements of the whole human karyotype in one single experiment; 2) chromosome-specific subcentromere/subtelomere-specific multicolor (subCTM-)FISH applies locus-specific subtelomeric and subcentromic probes and enables the characterization of the subtelomeric and peri-centric regions of the chromosomes, not analyzable by other FISH-approaches. Thus, we detected the following recurrent cryptic chromosomal aberrations: del(12)(pter) [8 cases], del(9)(qter) [3 cases], and del(11)(pter) [2 cases]. Moreover, cryptic changes in additional nine subtelomeric and in two subcentromeric regions were observed one time, each. In summary, mMCB and subCTM were proven to be powerful methods in the screening for new cryptic chromosomal aberrations, which considerably increased the accuracy of cytogenetic diagnosis.","['Karst, Constanze', 'Gross, Madeleine', 'Haase, Detlef', 'Wedding, Ulrich', 'Hoffken, Klaus', 'Liehr, Thomas', 'Mkrtchyan, Hasmik']","['Karst C', 'Gross M', 'Haase D', 'Wedding U', 'Hoffken K', 'Liehr T', 'Mkrtchyan H']","['Institut fur Humangenetik und Anthropologie, D-07743 Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Spectral Karyotyping/*methods', 'Telomere/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2006/03/10 09:00,2006/06/07 09:00,['2006/03/10 09:00'],"['2006/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2006 Apr;28(4):891-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report that transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta)/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) inhibits the bone marrow transformation capability of Hoxa9 and Nup98-Hoxa9, the chimeric fusion form of Hoxa9 identified in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), through Smad4, the common Smad (Co-Smad) in the TGFbeta/BMP signaling pathway. Smad4 interacts directly with the homeodomain of Hoxa9 and blocks the ability of Nup98-Hoxa9 to bind DNA, thereby suppressing its ability to regulate downstream gene transcription. Mapping data revealed that the amino-terminus of Smad4 mediates this interaction and overexpression of the Hoxa9 interaction domain of Smad4 was sufficient to inhibit the enhanced serial replating ability of primary bone marrow cells induced by Nup98-Hoxa9. These studies establish a novel mechanism by which TGFbeta/BMP regulates hematopoiesis and suggest that modification of Hox DNA-binding activity may serve as a novel therapeutic intervention for those leukemias that involve deregulation of Hox.","['Wang, Ning', 'Kim, Hyung-Gyoong', 'Cotta, Claudiu V', 'Wan, Mei', 'Tang, Yi', 'Klug, Christopher A', 'Cao, Xu']","['Wang N', 'Kim HG', 'Cotta CV', 'Wan M', 'Tang Y', 'Klug CA', 'Cao X']","['Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Smad4 Protein)', '0 (Smad4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/*metabolism', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smad4 Protein/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism']",2006/03/10 09:00,2006/05/26 09:00,['2006/03/10 09:00'],"['2005/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['7601037 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.emboj.7601037 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2006 Apr 5;25(7):1469-80. doi: 10.1038/sj.emboj.7601037.

Strong and constitutive nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation is a characteristic of CLL cells. We examined the effects of a new NF-kappaB inhibitor, dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ), on CLL cells. Dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin completely abrogated constitutive NF-kappaB activity and induced apoptosis of CLL cells. Apoptosis induced by DHMEQ was accompanied by downregulation of NF-kappaB-dependent antiapoptotic genes: c-IAP, Bfl-1, Bcl-X(L) and c-FLIP. Dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin also inhibited NF-kappaB induced by CD40 and enhanced fludarabine-mediated apoptosis of CLL cells.

In a patient who received DLI for relapsed CML, we observed persisting molecular disease despite a hematological and cytogenetic remission in the absence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). To determine the nature of this immune response, we isolated leukemia-reactive donor T-cell clones from the bone marrow (BM) of the patient at the time of clinical response. Four different types of CD8+ HLA class I restricted T-cell clones were obtained that were cytotoxic against Ebstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell lines (EBV-LCL) of the patient, but not the donor, indicating recognition of minor histocompatibility antigens (mHags). By using survival studies with CFSE labelled BM cells populations, a hematopoietic progenitor cell inhibition assay and direct morphological examination we showed that the T-cell clones recognized mature monocytic and myeloid cells, whereas immature BM progenitor cells were insufficiently lysed. This patient's refractoriness for DLI appears to be caused by inadequate lysis of progenitor cells by these cytotoxic T cells. These findings support the hypothesis that for eradication of CML a cytotoxic T-cell response against leukemic progenitor cells is essential.","['von dem Borne, P A', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs, S A P', 'Heemskerk, M H M', 'Jedema, I', 'Mulder, A', 'Willemze, R', 'Falkenburg, J H F']","['von dem Borne PA', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs SA', 'Heemskerk MH', 'Jedema I', 'Mulder A', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. petborne@xs4all.nl']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Differentiation/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Lineage/immunology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/methods', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2006/03/10 09:00,2006/10/31 09:00,['2006/03/10 09:00'],"['2006/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404169 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404169 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Jun;20(6):1040-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404169.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, patients often relapse due to ATRA-resistance. The molecular basis of APL alterations indicates that addition of a histone deacetylase inhibitor to ATRA may restore the sensitivity to retinoids. We explored the in vitro and in vivo effects of a novel retinoic/butyric hyaluronan ester (HBR) on a retinoic acid (RA)-sensitive human myeloid cell line, NB4, and on its RA-resistant subclone, NB4.007/6. In vitro, HBR induced growth arrest and terminal differentiation in RA-sensitive NB4 cells (as confirmed by an increased expression of CD11 family members and nitroblue tetrazolium assay), whereas it inhibited the growth of RA-resistant cells by apoptosis, paralleled by an increase in the levels of caspase 3 and 7. In vivo, HBR treatment of NB4-inoculated severe combined immunodeficient mice resulted in a statistically significant increase in survival time (P<0.0001), comparable to that induced by a maximum tolerated dose of RA alone. Also on P388-inoculated mice, HBR was active in contrast to RA that was completely ineffective. Present findings suggest that, owing to the simultaneous presence of RA and an histone deacetylases inhibitor, HBR might be useful in controlling the proliferation of RA-resistant cells and the differentiation of RA-sensitive cells.","['Coradini, D', 'Pellizzaro, C', 'Scarlata, I', 'Zorzet, S', 'Garrovo, C', 'Abolafio, G', 'Speranza, A', 'Fedeli, M', 'Cantoni, S', 'Sava, G', 'Daidone, M G', 'Perbellini, A']","['Coradini D', 'Pellizzaro C', 'Scarlata I', 'Zorzet S', 'Garrovo C', 'Abolafio G', 'Speranza A', 'Fedeli M', 'Cantoni S', 'Sava G', 'Daidone MG', 'Perbellini A']","['Unit of Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Experimental Department, Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori, Milano, Italy. danila.coradini@istitutotumori.mi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (Esters)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Butyric Acid/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/drug effects/metabolism', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Esters/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Histones/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/drug effects', 'Protein Binding', 'Tretinoin/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/03/10 09:00,2006/09/13 09:00,['2006/03/10 09:00'],"['2006/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404179 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404179 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 May;20(5):785-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404179.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, some new prognostic factors, such as IgVH mutational status, ZAP-70 and the expression of CD38 in leukaemic cells were introduced to identify attenuated versus progressive types of CLL bearing the potential to facilitate risk-adapted treatment strategies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To evaluate the clinical value of ZAP-70 and CD38 as predictors of disease progression we assessed the expression of these markers by the flow cytometry method in 156 B-CLL patients. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Both ZAP-70 and CD38 expression were shown to predict the clinical course of the disease, while ZAP-70 expression appeared to be more predictive than CD38 expression and more relevant in defining the cases of B-CLL responsive or refractory to first line chemotherapy. A simultaneous evaluation of ZAP-70 and CD38 expression allowed distinguishing the patients groups with the most favourable prognosis as well as those with the worst. Taken together we recommend assessing both ZAP-70 and CD38 protein expression for the definition of prognostic subgroups in patients with B-CLL.","['Hus, I', 'Podhorecka, M', 'Bojarska-Junak, A', 'Rolinski, J', 'Schmitt, M', 'Sieklucka, M', 'Wasik-Szczepanek, E', 'Dmoszynska, A']","['Hus I', 'Podhorecka M', 'Bojarska-Junak A', 'Rolinski J', 'Schmitt M', 'Sieklucka M', 'Wasik-Szczepanek E', 'Dmoszynska A']","['Department of Haemato-oncology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland. iwohus@wp.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*metabolism']",2006/03/10 09:00,2006/09/28 09:00,['2006/03/10 09:00'],"['2006/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0923-7534(19)57556-1 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdj120 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2006 Apr;17(4):683-90. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdj120.

The purpose of this study was to examine the pathophysiological role of AM in the development of human abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that vascular smooth muscle cells in the media were positive for AM in the early stage of atherosclerotic aorta. Intense immunoreactivity was observed in mast cells of the outer media and adventitia of AAA, and the number of mast cells was greater (p < 0.01) in AAA than in atherosclerotic aorta without any aneurysmal change. To determine the role of AM in mast cells, we examined cultured human mast cell leukemia line-1 (HMC-1) and fibroblasts isolated from AAA patients. Cultured HMC-1 cells were found to express preproAM gene and release AM peptide into the cultured media. When assessed by collagenase-sensitive [3H]proline incorporation and procollagen type I C-peptide secretion, collagen synthesis in co-culture of HMC-1 and the fibroblasts was reduced by 10(-6) mol/L synthetic AM, while conversely, it increased following blockade of the action of endogenous AM with 10 microg/mL anti-AM monoclonal antibody. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests an anti-fibrotic role for AM released from mast cells, providing new insight into the biological actions of mast cell-derived AM in the development of AAA.","['Tsuruda, Toshihiro', 'Kato, Johji', 'Hatakeyama, Kinta', 'Yamashita, Atsushi', 'Nakamura, Kunihide', 'Imamura, Takuroh', 'Kitamura, Kazuo', 'Onitsuka, Toshio', 'Asada, Yujiro', 'Eto, Tanenao']","['Tsuruda T', 'Kato J', 'Hatakeyama K', 'Yamashita A', 'Nakamura K', 'Imamura T', 'Kitamura K', 'Onitsuka T', 'Asada Y', 'Eto T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Medical College, University of Miyazaki, Japan. ttsuruda@med.miyazaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cardiovasc Res,Cardiovascular research,0077427,"['0 (Peptides)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (preproadrenomedullin)', '148498-78-6 (Adrenomedullin)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Adrenomedullin', 'Aorta, Abdominal/*immunology', 'Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal/immunology/*metabolism', 'Atherosclerosis/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Fibrosis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Peptides/analysis/*physiology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Precursors/analysis/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2006/03/10 09:00,2006/08/23 09:00,['2006/03/10 09:00'],"['2005/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/26 00:00 [revised]', '2006/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0008-6363(06)00061-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.02.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Cardiovasc Res. 2006 Apr 1;70(1):158-64. doi: 10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.02.003.

Although chimeric fusion genes usually provide early and essential steps in the development of leukemia, they are not in themselves sufficient, requiring additional genetic events. The nature of these secondary, cooperating genetic events is not known. The advent of genome wide microarray-based methods for assessing copy number changes made it possible to search for cytogenetically invisible regions of chromosome imbalance. We used BAC microarrays with a resolution of 1 Mb to determine whether cryptic regions of deletion or gain were associated with specific leukemia-associated fusion genes in a series of cell lines. To complement the array analysis, we also applied 24-color karyotyping by M-FISH. This revealed cryptic chromosomal translocations and regions of loss or gain in all the cell lines studied. The chromosomal origin of previously unidentified marker chromosomes was revealed. In all cases, chromosomes described as monosomic were shown to be involved in unbalanced translocations with concurrent loss and/or gain of chromosomal material. The extent of these amplified and deleted regions was more accurately defined. Finally, small regions of deletion and amplification, often including genes known to be involved in leukemia progression (for example MYC, TP53, CDKN2A, and KIT), were identified.","['Horsley, Sharon W', 'Mackay, Alan', 'Iravani, Marjan', 'Fenwick, Kerry', 'Valgeirsson, Haukur', 'Dexter, Tim', 'Ashworth, Alan', 'Kearney, Lyndal']","['Horsley SW', 'Mackay A', 'Iravani M', 'Fenwick K', 'Valgeirsson H', 'Dexter T', 'Ashworth A', 'Kearney L']","['Section of Haemato-Oncology, Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Gene Fusion', 'Genomics/methods', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Genetic', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2006/03/09 09:00,2006/07/20 09:00,['2006/03/09 09:00'],"['2006/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20317 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2006 Jun;45(6):554-64. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20317.,,,,,['BREAST CANCER NOW RESEARCH CENTRE/BBC_/Breast Cancer Now/United Kingdom'],,,"['(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

In 31/55 patients with known karyotype, the sole t(9;22)(q34;q11) abnormality had been diagnosed; in one patient, variant translocation t(4;9;22)(q21q31.1;q34;q11), and additional abnormalities in 23 (42%) patients, had been diagnosed. The characteristics of the patients with Ph chromosome and additional abnormalities were not significantly different when compared with the entire analyzed group. Out of 77 patients, 54 (70%) achieved first complete remission (CR1) after one or more induction cycles. The overall survival (OS) probability of 2 years was 63, 43, and 17% for patients treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT), autologous SCT, and chemotherapy, respectively (log rank p=0.002). Median OS from the time of alloSCT was significantly longer for patients transplanted in CR1 compared with alloSCT in CR >1 (p=0.032).

To clarify the role of STAT5 signaling in P210(BCR/ABL) leukemogenesis, P210 was introduced into primary murine STAT5A-deficient (STAT5A(-/-)) bone marrow (BM) cells, which, unlike STAT5A/5B double knockout BM cells, have no major intrinsic hematopoietic defects. Interestingly, only 21% of mice reconstituted with P210-transduced STAT5A(-/-) BM cells developed classic CML, compared with 80% to 100% of P210/STAT5A(+/+) and P210/STAT5A(+/-)-reconstituted animals. The remainder of P210/STAT5A(-/-) animals died from an acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-like disease (32%) or a CML/ALL mix (47%), reflecting impairment in the induction and maintenance of CML, which normally predominates in this mouse model. Of mice that ultimately developed CML, P210/STAT5A(-/-) animals had prolonged survival and increased myeloid immaturity. Importantly, reconstitution of wild-type mice with BM cells coexpressing P210 and dominant-negative STAT5 also profoundly reduced the incidence of CML, without impairing the induction of ALL. Altogether, these findings indicate that STAT5 and STAT5A play an important role in the pathogenesis of the CML-like disease in mice. A greater understanding of the STAT5 target genes involved in CML induction may lead to new therapeutic targets that influence CML progenitor cell biology.","['Ye, Dan', 'Wolff, Nicholas', 'Li, Li', 'Zhang, Shumin', 'Ilaria, Robert L Jr']","['Ye D', 'Wolff N', 'Li L', 'Zhang S', 'Ilaria RL Jr']","['Department of Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat5a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drug Design', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', '*Genes, abl/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/*metabolism']",2006/03/09 09:00,2006/08/15 09:00,['2006/03/09 09:00'],"['2006/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)63377-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-10-4110 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jun 15;107(12):4917-25. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-10-4110.

Classification trees and tree-structured survival analysis (TSSA) were used to identify important cytogenetic groups, and their prognostic significance was then assessed in multivariable analysis (MVA). Overall, 48.5% achieved complete remission (CR); 6.6% survived at 5 years. Complex karyotypes with at least 3 abnormalities (complex > or = 3) and a group including ""rare aberrations"" predicted lower CR rates (25% and 30%) versus other patients (56%). Compared with complex > or = 3, the odds of CR were significantly higher for noncomplex karyotypes without rare aberrations on MVA. Cytogenetically, complex > or = 5 predicted inferior disease-free survival on TSSA, remaining significant on MVA together with white blood cell count (WBC), sex, and age. For survival, complex > or = 5, rare aberrations, and core-binding factor (CBF) abnormalities were prognostic (P < .001), with 5-year survivals of 0%, 0%, and 19.4%, respectively, and 7.5% for remaining patients. Together with WBC, marrow blasts, sex, and age, the cytogenetic groups remained significant on MVA. In conclusion, pretreatment cytogenetics adds to other prognostic factors in older AML patients. Patients with complex > or = 5 appear to benefit minimally from current treatment and are better suited for investigational therapy or supportive care.","['Farag, Sherif S', 'Archer, Kellie J', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Vardiman, James W', 'Pettenati, Mark J', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Qumsiyeh, Mazin B', 'Koduru, Prasad R', 'Ning, Yi', 'Mayer, Robert J', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Farag SS', 'Archer KJ', 'Mrozek K', 'Ruppert AS', 'Carroll AJ', 'Vardiman JW', 'Pettenati MJ', 'Baer MR', 'Qumsiyeh MB', 'Koduru PR', 'Ning Y', 'Mayer RJ', 'Stone RM', 'Larson RA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. sherif.farag@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/03/09 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2006/03/09 09:00'],"['2006/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)64920-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-11-4354 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jul 1;108(1):63-73. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-11-4354.

Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) provides an accurate measure of the total leukemiacell mass and the degree to which BCR-ABL transcripts are reduced by therapy correlates with progression-free survival. Because a rising level of BCR-ABL is an early indication of loss of response and thus the need to reassess therapeutic strategy, regular molecular monitoring of individual patients is clearly desirable. Here we summarize the results of a consensus meeting that took place at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda in October 2005. We make suggestions for (1) harmonizing the differing methodologies for measuring BCR-ABL transcripts in patients with CML undergoing treatment and using a conversion factor whereby individual laboratories can express BCR-ABL transcript levels on an internationally agreed scale; (2) using serial RQ-PCR results rather than bone marrow cytogenetics or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the BCR-ABL gene to monitor individual patients responding to treatment; and (3) detecting and reporting Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-positive subpopulations bearing BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations.

Therefore, in vivo modification of Treg function by immunosuppressant drugs has broad implications for transplantation biology, autoimmunity, and vaccination strategies. In vivo bioluminescence imaging demonstrated reduced early proliferation of donor-derived luciferase-labeled conventional T cells in animals treated with Treg cells after major histocompatibility complex mismatch bone marrow transplantation. Combining Treg cells with cyclosporine A (CSA), but not rapamycin (RAPA) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), suppressed Treg function assessed by increased T-cell proliferation, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) severity, and reduced survival. Expansion of Treg and FoxP3 expression within this population was lowest in conjunction with CSA, suggesting that calcineurin-dependent interleukin 2 (IL-2) production is critically required for Treg cells in vivo. The functional defect of Treg cells after CSA exposure could be reversed by exogenous IL-2. Further, the Treg plus RAPA combination preserved graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effector function against leukemia cells. Our data indicate that RAPA and MMF rather than CSA preserve function of Treg cells in pathologic immune responses such as GVHD without weakening the GVT effect.","['Zeiser, Robert', 'Nguyen, Vu H', 'Beilhack, Andreas', 'Buess, Martin', 'Schulz, Stephan', 'Baker, Jeanette', 'Contag, Christopher H', 'Negrin, Robert S']","['Zeiser R', 'Nguyen VH', 'Beilhack A', 'Buess M', 'Schulz S', 'Baker J', 'Contag CH', 'Negrin RS']","['Center for Clinical Science Research, Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Calcineurin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4 Antigens/*biosynthesis', 'Calcineurin/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Species Specificity', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*drug effects/*immunology']",2006/03/09 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2006/03/09 09:00'],"['2006/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)64962-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-01-0329 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jul 1;108(1):390-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-01-0329.

It is not understood what factors control the expression of INGAP. In this study, factors that regulate the expression of INGAP promoter activity are reported. To determine factors that regulate INGAP expression, we previously cloned the promoter region for INGAP. Analysis of the INGAP promoter suggested that candidate regulators of INGAP expression include the transcription factors PDX-1, NeuroD, PAN-1, STAT and AP-1. Using gene addition experiments in the 293 cell line the activity of these transcription factors on an INGAP-promoter construct linked to the beta-galactosidase reporter has been determined. Induction of AP-1 activity or STAT activity using PMA or LIF stimulation respectively, or direct expression of PAN-1 specifically up-regulates INGAP promoter activity. In contrast, co-expression of PDX-1 but not NeuroD inhibits activation of the INGAP-promoter driven by PAN-1, PMA or LIF stimulation. PDX-1 binds directly to the INGAP promoter as determined in electromobility shift and antibody supershift assays. Expression of the INGAP-promoter-reporter construct in the HIT-T15 beta-cell line, a cell line that expresses endogenous PDX-1, did not reveal PMA-mediated stimulation of INGAP promoter activity. HIT-T15 cells however did efficiently transfect (> 68%) and respond (2-fold) to PMA-induced signal transduction to a transfected AP-1-CAT reporter. Partial reduction of PDX-1 expression in HIT-T15 cells was associated with recovery of PMA induced INGAP promoter activity. These data suggest that expression of PDX-1 is associated with a repression of stimulus-induced INGAP promoter activity that appears to be mediated by a direct DNA interaction. These findings implicate PDX-1 in a possible feedback loop to block unbridled islet expansion.","['Taylor-Fishwick, David A', 'Shi, Wenjing', 'Pittenger, Gary L', 'Vinik, Aaron I']","['Taylor-Fishwick DA', 'Shi W', 'Pittenger GL', 'Vinik AI']","['Department of Medicine, Strelitz Diabetes Institutes, Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, Virginia 23510, USA. taylord@evms.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Endocrinol,The Journal of endocrinology,0375363,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Pancreatitis-Associated Proteins)', '0 (REG3A protein, human)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '0 (TCF Transcription Factors)', '0 (TCF7L1 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 protein)', '169238-82-8 (Neurogenic differentiation factor 1)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics/metabolism', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay/methods', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Lectins, C-Type/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/pharmacology', 'Pancreatitis-Associated Proteins', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'TCF Transcription Factors/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Transfection/methods']",2006/03/09 09:00,2006/05/09 09:00,['2006/03/09 09:00'],"['2006/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['188/3/611 [pii]', '10.1677/joe.1.06108 [doi]']",ppublish,J Endocrinol. 2006 Mar;188(3):611-21. doi: 10.1677/joe.1.06108.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of GH replacement on cardiovascular risk factors and cardiac function in former CO ALL patients. DESIGN: Eighteen former CO ALL patients (aged 19-32 yr) treated with cranial radiotherapy (18-24 Gy) and chemotherapy and with confirmed GHD were studied at baseline and after 12 (n = 18) and 24 months (n = 13) of GH treatment (median 0.5 mg/d). A group of 18 age- and sex-matched subjects served as controls. RESULTS: After 12 months of GH treatment, a significant decrease in serum leptin (P = 0.002), leptin per kilogram fat mass (FM) (P = 0.01), plasma glucose (P = 0.004), FM (P = 0.002), and hip (P = 0.04) and waist (P = 0.02) circumference and increased muscle mass (P = 0.004) were recorded in the patients. Before GH treatment six patients had a metabolic syndrome, but after 12 months only one had it and after 24 months none. After 24 months of GH treatment, an increase in left ventricular mass index (P = 0.06) and significant improvements in cardiac systolic function, measured as fractional shortening (P = 0.03) and ejection fraction (P = 0.03), were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in cardiac systolic function and reduced prevalence of metabolic syndrome were recorded after 2 yr of GH replacement in former CO ALL patients with GHD.

Recent studies have shown that the expression of certain gene products mediate the development of resistance to chemotherapeutic agents.

This study was planned to study the expression of P-glycoprotein/170 in patients with acute leukemia and the effect of Cyclosporin A (CSA) as a modulator of P-glycoprotein functional activity. The study was carried out on 20 patients with acute leukemia (14 AML cases and 6 ALL cases). In addition, 6 normal individuals served as a reference group. Flow cytometric analysis of P-gp/170 surface expression was performed using UIC-2 MoAb together with the functional assay using Rhodamine 123 (Rh 123) and Cyclosporin A as a modulator.P-gp/170 was expressed on the leukemic cells of 37.5% of relapsed patients (40.0% of AML and 33.3% of ALL cases), whereas 27.2% of de novo patients expressed P-gp/170 (33.3% of AML cases and 0% of ALL cases). The functional activity of MDR-1 gp was 71.4% in AML and 33.3% in ALL patients compared with16.6% in normal lymphocytes. From this study, it is clear that P-gp/170 is expressed to a higher degree in leukemic cells and this is greater in relapsed compared to de novo cases and more in AML than ALL blasts.

Over expression of cyclin D1 protein has been reported in several solid tumors and certain lymphoid malignancies, but little is known about the involvement of cyclin D1 in acute leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the expression of cyclin D1 at protein level in, 40 newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 10 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and 11 normal controls using flow cytometry. RESULTS: The expression of cyclin D1 was not significantly different in AML group as compared to normal controls. On the other hand, over expression of cyclin D1 was evident in ALL group (4/10) as compared to that in healthy control.

Lentiviral vectors pseudotyped by the envelopes from either the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) or the RD114 feline endogenous virus (RD114) specifically transduced hESCs to similar extents as VSV-G pseudotyped vectors, but did not transduce MEF.

Retrospective studies which used (semi-) quantitation of clone-specific immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor (Ig/TCR) rearrangements have documented the feasibility and practicality of this technique. This approach has also been disputed due to the occurrence of clonal evolution and generally high MRD levels prior to HSCT. PROCEDURE: In our prospective study, MRD before and after HSCT was monitored using quantitative real-time PCR in a cohort of 36 children with ALL consecutively transplanted in our center between VIII/2000 and VII/2004. RESULTS: In 25 of 36 patients, MRD level prior HSCT was assessed. Seventeen patients were classified as MRD-negative and eight were MRD-positive up to 9 x 10(-2). In MRD-positive subgroup, seven events (six relapses) occurred post-transplant in striking contrast to only one relapse in MRD-negative subgroup (event-free survival (EFS) log-rank P < 0.0001). MRD proved to be the only significant prognostic factor in a multivariate analysis (P < 0.0001). Adoptive immunotherapy including donor lymphocyte infusions in patients with adverse dynamics of MRD after HSCT had only limited and/or temporary effect. Clonal evolution did not present a problem precluding MRD monitoring in any of patients suffering a post-transplant relapse. CONCLUSIONS: We show that MRD quantitation using clonal Ig/TCR rearrangements successfully assesses the risk in pediatric ALL patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. As our ability to treat detectable MRD levels after HSCT is very limited, alternative strategies for MRD-positive patients prior HSCT are necessary.","['Sramkova, Lucie', 'Muzikova, Katerina', 'Fronkova, Eva', 'Krejci, Ondrej', 'Sedlacek, Petr', 'Formankova, Renata', 'Mejstrikova, Ester', 'Stary, Jan', 'Trka, Jan']","['Sramkova L', 'Muzikova K', 'Fronkova E', 'Krejci O', 'Sedlacek P', 'Formankova R', 'Mejstrikova E', 'Stary J', 'Trka J']","['CLIP-Childhood Leukemia Investigation Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/mortality', 'Infant', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/mortality', 'Male', '*Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics/*mortality', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/03/08 09:00,2007/02/22 09:00,['2006/03/08 09:00'],"['2006/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20794 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Jan;48(1):93-100. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20794.,,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Jan;48(1):1-2.

RESULTS: Hypoxia (2% O2) induced 4-HPR resistance in the tested two ALL cell lines (Molt-4 and Molt-3), with at least a 2.8-fold increase in IC50 values (P<0.01) compared with the IC50 values in normoxia (20% O2). Apoptotic detection showed that 2% O2 significantly suppressed 4-HPR-induced apoptosis and the percentages of 4-HPR-induced apoptotic cells at 12 and 24 h were 1.2 and 11.0%, respectively, compared with 12.6 and 76.3% in 20% O2. In addition, in 20% O2, but not in 2% O2, 4-HPR obviously downregulated the protein expression of procaspase-3, ERK1/2 and XIAP, and increased the cleavage of PARP. Also, a significant DeltaPsim loss in response to 4-HPR was observed in normoxia, but not in hypoxia. CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxia is able to induce 4-HPR resistance in Molt-4 cells and the mechanism may be involved in the inhibition of 4HPR-induced DeltaPsim depolarization and regulation of mitochondrial pathway-related proteins associated in signaling apoptosis.","['Yang, Bo', 'Fan, Lingling', 'Fang, Liang', 'He, Qiaojun']","['Yang B', 'Fan L', 'Fang L', 'He Q']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, 310031, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China. yang924@zju.edu.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', '*Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fenretinide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mitochondrial Membranes', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*metabolism']",2006/03/08 09:00,2006/08/25 09:00,['2006/03/08 09:00'],"['2005/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-006-0197-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2006 Oct;58(4):540-6. doi: 10.1007/s00280-006-0197-6.

Although 14q11 abnormalities are found in about 10% of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cases, until now there has been no direct evidence showing involvement of the TCR locus in ATL-a malignancy closely associated with HTLV-1 infection. The breakpoints of T-cell malignancies most commonly occur within the Jalpha or Jdelta region of the TCR locus. In ATL, however, despite extensive searching no breakpoint has yet been found in that region. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization with a panel of cosmid and bacterial artificial chromosome probes derived from chromosome 14, including the variable region of the TCRalpha locus, comprehensive analysis of an ATL patient carrying inv(14)(q11q32) revealed that the TCR locus was indeed involved in this inversion. Molecular cloning of the breakpoint revealed the juxtaposition of TCR Valpha to the 14q24 region as a result of two consecutive inversions: inv(14)(q11q32) and inv(14)(q11q24). We also found a gene near the breakpoint at the 14q24 region that is downregulated in this ATL patient and is assigned in the database as a pseudogene of ADAM21 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 21). Our expression analysis, however, showed that this pseudogene was actually expressed and was capable of encoding a protein similar to ADAM21; thus we have named this gene ADAM21-like (ADAM21-L).","['Haider, Shawkat', 'Hayakawa, Kousuke', 'Itoyama, Takahiro', 'Sadamori, Naoki', 'Kurosawa, Nobuyuki', 'Isobe, Masaharu']","['Haider S', 'Hayakawa K', 'Itoyama T', 'Sadamori N', 'Kurosawa N', 'Isobe M']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Department of Materials and Biosystem Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Toyama University, 3190 Gofuku, Toyama, 930-8555, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Department of Materials and Biosystem Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Toyama University, 3190 Gofuku, Toyama, 930-8555, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Department of Materials and Biosystem Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Toyama University, 3190 Gofuku, Toyama, 930-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Nursing, Siebold University of Nagasaki, Nagasaki, 851-2195, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Department of Materials and Biosystem Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Toyama University, 3190 Gofuku, Toyama, 930-8555, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Department of Materials and Biosystem Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Toyama University, 3190 Gofuku, Toyama, 930-8555, Japan. isobe@eng.toyama-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,J Hum Genet,Journal of human genetics,9808008,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM12 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM12 protein, human)']",IM,"['ADAM Proteins/metabolism', 'ADAM12 Protein', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'COS Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', '*Chromosome Inversion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'DNA/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, T-Cell Receptor', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transfection']",2006/03/08 09:00,2006/05/18 09:00,['2006/03/08 09:00'],"['2005/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10038-006-0364-y [doi]', '10.1007/s10038-006-0364-y [pii]']",ppublish,J Hum Genet. 2006;51(4):326-334. doi: 10.1007/s10038-006-0364-y.

MUTZ-3, a myeloid leukemia cell line, responds to GM-CSF, IL-4 and TNF-alpha, and acquires a phenotype similar to immature monocyte-derived DC (MoDC). In the present study, MUTZ-3-derived DC (MuDC) showed high level expression of HLA class II molecules, CD80 and CD86, and were able to function as potent antigen presenting cells as previously reported. Interestingly, MuDC maturation was induced by CD40- mediated stimulation, but not by LPS stimulation. We analyzed CCR1, CCR7 and Toll-like receptor (TLR) expressions in MuDC, and measured IL-10 and IL-12 production after maturation stimuli. Although MuDC expressed the mRNA for TLR4, a major component of the LPS receptor system, they did not show an enhanced level of CCR7 or cytokine production after LPS stimulation. In contrast, they responded to CD40 stimulation, which resulted in increased levels of CD83, CD86 and CCR7. Moreover, while LPS- stimulated MoDC could potently stimulate NK cells in a DC-NK cell co-culture, LPS-stimulated MuDC failed to stimulate primary NK cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that, although MuDC express TLR4, unlike TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, LPS does not stimulate MuDC to acquire mature phenotypes, and they may have impaired activity to initiate innate immune response.","['Kim, Kwang Dong', 'Choi, Seung-Chul', 'Noh, Young-Woock', 'Kim, Jong Wan', 'Paik, Sang-Gi', 'Yang, Young', 'Kim, Keun 2nd', 'Lim, Jong-Seok']","['Kim KD', 'Choi SC', 'Noh YW', 'Kim JW', 'Paik SG', 'Yang Y', 'Kim K 2nd', 'Lim JS']","[""Department of Biological Sciences, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 140-742, Korea.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Mol Med,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,"['B7-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'B7-2 Antigen/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD40 Antigens/metabolism/pharmacology', 'CD40 Ligand/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dendritic Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-12/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Killer Cells, Natural/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2006/03/08 09:00,2006/04/21 09:00,['2006/03/08 09:00'],"['2006/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['200602289 [pii]', '10.1038/emm.2006.9 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Med. 2006 Feb 28;38(1):72-84. doi: 10.1038/emm.2006.9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of 2,456 patients with NHL who were first treated from 1973 to 2000 and were younger than 60 years from centers in the British National Lymphoma Investigation were observed, and occurrences of second malignancy was compared with expectations based on general population cancer rates in England and Wales. RESULTS: In total, 123 second malignancies occurred. Relative risks (RRs) were significantly elevated for all malignancies combined (RR = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.6) and for leukemia (RR = 8.8; 95% CI, 5.1 to 14.1) and lung cancer (RR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.3). RRs of malignancy overall diminished significantly with increasing age at first treatment. Leukemia risk was significantly increased after chemotherapy (RR = 10.5; 95% CI, 5.0 to 19.3) and mixed-modality treatment (RR = 13.0; 95% CI, 5.2 to 26.7). Relative risks of lung (RR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.1) and colorectal (RR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.6) cancers were significantly raised following chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: NHL patients are at elevated risk of developing second malignancy, particularly leukemia and lung cancer. The relative risk is greater with patients who are younger at first treatment. Chemotherapy predisposes patients toan increased risk of leukemia, and possibly lung and colorectal cancers. The role of specific drug treatments in the etiology of solid cancers after NHL deserves further investigation.","['Mudie, Nadejda Y', 'Swerdlow, Anthony J', 'Higgins, Craig D', 'Smith, Paul', 'Qiao, Zongkai', 'Hancock, Barry W', 'Hoskin, Peter J', 'Linch, David C']","['Mudie NY', 'Swerdlow AJ', 'Higgins CD', 'Smith P', 'Qiao Z', 'Hancock BW', 'Hoskin PJ', 'Linch DC']","['Section of Epidemiology, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, United Kingdom. nadejda.mudie@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Breast Neoplasms/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",2006/03/08 09:00,2006/04/14 09:00,['2006/03/08 09:00'],"['2006/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.04.2200 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.04.2200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Apr 1;24(10):1568-74. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.04.2200.

Early studies combining fludarabine and chlorambucil were abandoned owing to increased toxicity from overlapping myelosuppression and immunosuppression. Of the purine analogs active in CLL, pentostatin appears to be the least myelosuppressive. We previously reported that pentostatin and cyclophosphamide (PC) is active and well-tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. Subsequently, we added rituximab, and now report on this three-drug combination. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated 46 patients with either previously treated CLL (32 patients) or other low-grade B-cell neoplasms (14 patients). Patients received pentostatin 4 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, and rituximab 375 mg/m2 (PCR). All drugs were administered on the same day (rituximab omitted from cycle 1), and patients received six cycles at 3-week intervals. Filgrastim, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and acyclovir were administered prophylactically. RESULTS: The median age was 62 years (range, 30 to 80 years). The median number of prior regimens was two (range, one to seven). For CLL patients, there were 24 responses (75%), including eight complete responses (25%). In fludarabine-refractory patients, 75% responded. Toxicity was acceptable, with grade 3/4 infections (including fever of unknown origin) in 28%. The regimen was well tolerated, with 72% of patients receiving the planned treatment at full dose. CONCLUSION: PCR is safe and effective in previously treated patients with CLL. In comparison with our prior two-drug regimen, we find that rituximab did not seem to add significantly to the toxicity, but did appear to confer a survival advantage. Based on these results, we are currently studying PCR as initial therapy for patients with CLL.","['Lamanna, Nicole', 'Kalaycio, Matt', 'Maslak, Peter', 'Jurcic, Joseph G', 'Heaney, Mark', 'Brentjens, Renier', 'Zelenetz, Andrew D', 'Horgan, Denise', 'Gencarelli, Alison', 'Panageas, Katherine S', 'Scheinberg, David A', 'Weiss, Mark A']","['Lamanna N', 'Kalaycio M', 'Maslak P', 'Jurcic JG', 'Heaney M', 'Brentjens R', 'Zelenetz AD', 'Horgan D', 'Gencarelli A', 'Panageas KS', 'Scheinberg DA', 'Weiss MA']","['Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pentostatin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Rituximab']",2006/03/08 09:00,2006/04/14 09:00,['2006/03/08 09:00'],"['2006/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.04.3836 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.04.3836 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Apr 1;24(10):1575-81. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.04.3836.

We used this system in a functional cDNA screening to isolate and confirm that the glucose transporter protein 1 (GLUT-1) is a receptor for HTLV-1. GLUT-1 is a ubiquitously expressed plasma membrane glycoprotein with 12 transmembrane domains and 6 extracellular loops (ECL). We demonstrate for the first time that peptide antibodies (GLUT-IgY) raised in chicken to the large extracellular loop (ECL1) detect GLUT-1 at the cell surface and inhibit envelope (Env)-mediated fusion and infection. Efficient GLUT-IgY staining was detected with peripheral blood CD4(+) lymphocytes purified by positive selection. Further, GLUT-IgY caused efficient inhibition of Env-mediated fusion and infection of CD4(+) T and significantly lower inhibition of CD8(+) T lymphocytes. The specificity of GLUT-IgY antibodies to GLUT-1 was demonstrated by ECL1 peptide competition studies. Grafting ECL1 of GLUT-1 onto the receptor-negative GLUT-3 conferred significant receptor activity. In contrast, grafting ECL1 of GLUT-3 onto GLUT-1 resulted in a significant loss of the receptor activity. The ECL1-mediated receptor activity was efficiently blocked with four different human monoclonal antibody (HMab) to HTLV-1 Env. The ECL1-derived peptide blocked HTLV-1 Env-mediated fusion with several nonhuman mammalian cell lines. The results demonstrate the utilization of cell surface GLUT-1 in HTLV-1 infection of CD4(+) T lymphocytes and implicate a critical role for the ECL1 region in viral tropism.","['Jin, Qingwen', 'Agrawal, Lokesh', 'VanHorn-Ali, Zainab', 'Alkhatib, Ghalib']","['Jin Q', 'Agrawal L', 'VanHorn-Ali Z', 'Alkhatib G']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Walther Cancer Institute, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202-5114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 3)', '0 (IgY)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Cell Line', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1/analysis/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'Glucose Transporter Type 3/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/metabolism', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Staining and Labeling', 'beta-Galactosidase/analysis/genetics']",2006/03/08 09:00,2006/07/04 09:00,['2006/03/08 09:00'],"['2005/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2006/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(06)00076-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2006.01.045 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2006 May 25;349(1):184-96. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2006.01.045.

METHODS: Fifty-three patients (23 women, 30 men, median age 59 yr) with hyperleukocytic AML [white blood count (WBC) above 50 x 10(9)/L] were graded for the probability of clinical leukostasis according to the severity of neurologic, pulmonary and other symptoms possibly caused by leukostasis using a recently published scoring system. Age, WBC, absolute blast count, haemoglobin, cytogenetic risk group, infection, relative CD56 expression and absolute count of CD56 positive blasts were analyzed in multivariate stepwise backward logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In patients with acute monocytic leukaemia (AML M4/M5) the absolute count of leukaemic blasts expressing CD56/NCAM was highly associated with the development of symptoms graded as highly probable leukostasis and all three patients succumbing to early death were CD56 positive. Only the absolute count of CD56 positive blasts was a significant predictor of risk of severe leukostasis (P = 0.020). This was not found in AML without monocytic involvement (AML M1, M2, M3v). CONCLUSIONS: The expression of CD56/NCAM, a surface marker used in routine immunophenotyping of AML, may help to predict severe and potentially fatal leukostasis in hyperleukocytic acute myelomonocytic leukaemia. These results emphasize the usefulness of this four-stage clinical grading scale for analysing the factors, which lead to severe leukostasis in hyperleukocytic patients. We extend previous findings that the mechanisms of leukostasis are different depending on the involvement of the monocytic lineage.","['Novotny, J R', 'Nuckel, H', 'Duhrsen, U']","['Novotny JR', 'Nuckel H', 'Duhrsen U']","['Department of Haematology, University Hospital of Essen, Essen, Germany. juergen.novotny@medizin.uni-essen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['0 (CD56 Antigen)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD56 Antigen/*blood', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*blood/complications/mortality', 'Leukocyte Count/methods', 'Leukostasis/*blood/complications/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging/methods/mortality', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index']",2006/03/08 09:00,2006/05/06 09:00,['2006/03/08 09:00'],"['2006/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH607 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00607.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2006 Apr;76(4):299-308. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00607.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the association of ZAP-70 expression with IgVH mutational status in B-CLL by quantifying ZAP-70 mRNA, to evaluate its use as a surrogate marker for mutational status. The aim of this study was to develop a quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) assay for the detection of ZAP-70 expression in a group of patients whose mutational status and cytogenetics had been determined previously. METHODS: RQ-PCR was used to analyse ZAP-70 expression from 42 B-CLL patients. B cells were purified using CD19 magnetic bead system and total RNA was isolated. RQ-PCR was performed using Taqman PCR. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (60%) had mutated and 17 (40%) had unmutated IgVH genes; 94% (16/17) of patients with unmutated IgVH gene were ZAP-70 positive as assessed by RQ-PCR and 92% (23/25) of patients with mutated IgVH gene were ZAP-70 negative. In three patients, ZAP-70 expression and IgVH mutational status were discordant. CONCLUSION: This paper describes an RQ-PCR assay for the detection of ZAP-70 expression and confirms that IgV(H) unmutated CLL cells have a high expression of ZAP-70 in comparison with IgVH mutated CLL. This robust method acts as a surrogate marker for IgVH mutational status albeit with <100% concordance. However, it does provide better concordance with mutational status than that reported using flow cytometry.","['Catherwood, Mark A', 'Matthews, Christine', 'Niblock, Roberta', 'Dobbin, Edwina', 'Morris, T C M', 'Alexander, H Denis']","['Catherwood MA', 'Matthews C', 'Niblock R', 'Dobbin E', 'Morris TC', 'Alexander HD']","['Department of Haematology, Belfast City Hospital, Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK. mark.catherwood@bll.n-i.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/biosynthesis/*genetics']",2006/03/08 09:00,2006/05/06 09:00,['2006/03/08 09:00'],"['2006/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH619 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00619.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2006 Apr;76(4):294-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00619.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To assess the presence of persistent HCs after treatment, as detected by immunohistochemistry, and to evaluate the correlation between the level of MRD and clinical outcome. DESIGN: Percentages of DBA.44-positive HCs were assessed on 116 biopsy specimens from 17 patients. The patients had a median follow-up of 55.4 months. RESULTS: Minimal residual disease was seen in 3 patterns. Group 1 (7 patients) had MRD levels ranging from ""rare scattered suspicious HCs"" to less than 1%. The MRD levels were stable throughout follow-up, and all patients remained in complete remission. Group 2 (6 patients) had MRD levels ranging from 1% to 5%, and 3 patients were in complete remission at 77.9, 63.8, and 108.0 months. Another patient showed evidence of disease activity (partial remission) at 47.6 months. Two other patients relapsed at 12.3 months and at 25.7 months, respectively, with greater than 1% HCs. Group 3 (4 patients) had MRD levels greater than 5%. Three patients relapsed at 11.3, 12.1, and 29.6 months, respectively, with greater than 5% HCs. The fourth patient had MRD levels of 5% at 14.6 months and 2% at 20.0 months but was subsequently lost to follow-up.

Given the association between NS and an increased risk of some malignancies, notably leukemia and probably some solid tumors including neuroblastoma (NB) and rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), recent studies have reported that gain-of-function somatic mutations in PTPN11 occur in some hematological malignancies, especially de novo juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and in some solid tumors such as NB, although at a low frequency. In a screen for mutations of PTPN11 in 7 cell lines and 30 fresh tumors of RMS and in 25 cell lines and 40 fresh tumors of NB, we identified a missense mutation (A72T) in an embryonal RMS patient. In the RMS samples, we also detected mutations of NRAS in 1 cell line and 1 patient; both mutations were in embryonal RMSs and had no PTPN11 mutations. No mutations of PTPN11 were detected in NB. In 95 leukemia cell lines and 261 fresh leukemia samples including 22 JMMLs, 9 kinds of missense mutations were detected in 17 leukemia samples, which included 11 (50.0%) mutations in JMML samples and lower frequencies in other hematological malignancies. Furthermore, we identified 4 (18.2%) NRAS mutations and 1 (4.5%) KRAS mutation in 5 JMML samples, 1 of which had a concomitant PTPN11 mutation. Our data suggest that mutations of PTPN11 as well as RAS play a role in the pathogenesis of not only myeloid hematological malignancies but also a subset of RMS malignancies.","['Chen, Yuyan', 'Takita, Junko', 'Hiwatari, Mitsuteru', 'Igarashi, Takashi', 'Hanada, Ryoji', 'Kikuchi, Akira', 'Hongo, Teruaki', 'Taki, Tomohiko', 'Ogasawara, Mizuho', 'Shimada, Akira', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide']","['Chen Y', 'Takita J', 'Hiwatari M', 'Igarashi T', 'Hanada R', 'Kikuchi A', 'Hongo T', 'Taki T', 'Ogasawara M', 'Shimada A', 'Hayashi Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'ras Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",2006/03/07 09:00,2006/07/20 09:00,['2006/03/07 09:00'],"['2006/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20322 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2006 Jun;45(6):583-91. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20322.,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, unlike pediatric ALL, recurrence is common in adult ALL, and the ability to predict at an early stage which patients are most likely to experience recurrence may help in devising new therapeutic approaches to prevent recurrence. METHODS: Peripheral blood plasma from 57 patients with confirmed ALL was obtained before induction therapy for proteomic analysis. Follow-up continued for a median period of 71 weeks. For each plasma sample, 4 fractions eluted from a strong anion column were applied to 3 different ProteinChip array surfaces, and 12 surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) spectra were generated. Peaks that correlated with recurrence were identified and decision trees were constructed and evaluated, using only 2 peaks per predictive tree. RESULTS: The best decision trees provided strong positive prediction of recurrence, with correct predictions 84% to 92% of the time, whereas negative prediction of patients who did not experience recurrence was less robust, with 62% to 74% accuracy. Prediction of recurrence was independent of cytogenetics, bone marrow blast count, lactate dehydrogenase, beta-2-microglobulin, or surface markers. Positive prediction of L3 morphological classification was achieved in 80% of test cases. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral blood plasma is adequate to predict clinical behavior in ALL patients irrespective of the percentage of bone marrow blasts. Proteomic analysis of plasma offers a useful approach for profiling patients with ALL.","['Albitar, Maher', 'Potts, Steven J', 'Giles, Francis J', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Keating, Michael', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Clarke, Charlotte', 'Jilani, Iman', 'Aguilar, Christine', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Albitar M', 'Potts SJ', 'Giles FJ', ""O'Brien S"", 'Keating M', 'Thomas D', 'Clarke C', 'Jilani I', 'Aguilar C', 'Estey E', 'Kantarjian H']","['Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA 92690, USA. x.albitar@questdiagnostics.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child, Preschool', '*Decision Trees', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*genetics/*pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Array Analysis', '*Proteomics', 'Recurrence']",2006/03/07 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/03/07 09:00'],"['2006/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21770 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2006 Apr 1;106(7):1587-94. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21770.,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2006 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,

The increase in viral load due to the genetic transmission of integrated HHV-6 could have been misinterpreted as substantial active infection and, thus, led to the administration of toxic antiviral therapy. We suggest that the confounding influence of integration be considered in laboratory investigations associating HHV-6 with disease.","['Clark, Duncan A', 'Nacheva, Elisabeth P', 'Leong, Hoe Nam', 'Brazma, Diana', 'Li, Ying Ting', 'Tsao, Edward H F', 'Buyck, Hubertus C E', 'Atkinson, Claire E', 'Lawson, Heather M', 'Potter, Michael N', 'Griffiths, Paul D']","['Clark DA', 'Nacheva EP', 'Leong HN', 'Brazma D', 'Li YT', 'Tsao EH', 'Buyck HC', 'Atkinson CE', 'Lawson HM', 'Potter MN', 'Griffiths PD']","['Centre for Virology, Division of Infection and Immunity, Royal Free and University College Medical School, London, United Kingdom. duncan.clark@bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Infect Dis,The Journal of infectious diseases,0413675,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosomes, Human/virology', 'DNA, Viral/analysis/genetics', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/*genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Roseolovirus Infections/*transmission/virology', 'Viral Load', '*Virus Integration']",2006/03/07 09:00,2006/04/18 09:00,['2006/03/07 09:00'],"['2005/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['JID35180 [pii]', '10.1086/500838 [doi]']",ppublish,J Infect Dis. 2006 Apr 1;193(7):912-6. doi: 10.1086/500838.

We employed a phase I/II design to determine feasibility, define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and explore the impact of biologic modulation on response and time to progression (TTP) in 20 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL and NHL. Eight patients were enrolled in cohort I. They demonstrated a response rate (RR) of 28% and a 16.5-month TTP after receiving a median of two cycles. A 50% RR was observed in this cohort when patients with adverse histologies were excluded. Because of myelotoxicity, this dose level defined the MTD, and de-escalation occurred. All 12 patients in cohort II received 20 mg/m(2) chlorambucil. A 50% RR and an 18-month TTP were observed after a median of 5.5 cycles. An RR of 47% and a complete remission (CR) of 5% were observed for the entire group, although responses and TTP varied greatly by histology. Significant activity was observed in patients with B-cell CLL and follicular lymphoma (FL). RR and TTP for fludarabine-sensitive/naive and fludarabine-refractory (FR) B-cell CLL patients were 66 vs 25% and 20 vs 8.5 months, respectively. Both FL patients responded (one with partial remission and one with CR), with a 22.5-monthly median TTP. For responding patients, median TTP and overall survival (OS) was 21 and 69 months, respectively, compared to a median TTP of 2 months and an OS of 13.5 months for nonresponders.

Because of the shared molecular and genetic features, the World Health Organization classification of lymphoid diseases recognizes the lymphomatous and leukemic phases of BL as a single entity: a mature B cell neoplasm, subtype Burkitt lymphoma/Burkitt cell leukemia. Because BL frequently appears in the stomach, we investigated the clinical presentation and outcome of gastric BL. We discovered 21 patients with gastric BL through a survey of our NHL registry, and retrospectively analyzed the distinct features of BL, including the St Jude/Murphy staging, other extranodal involvement, morphology and immunophenotype, response to treatment, and clinical outcome. The patients' median age was 48 years (range, 7-75), and the male-to-female ratio was 2.5. Stage 1 was found in five patients, stage 2 in five patients, and stage 4 in 11 patients. The stomach body and antrum were most frequently involved. All 21 patients were treated with systemic intensive chemotherapy, producing a 71% (15/21) rate of complete response (CR) to chemotherapy. Both the 2-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 55%. All ten patients in BL stages 1 and 2 showed outstanding outcomes, and nine of the ten patients exhibited CR and long-term survival. These data show that a high proportion of patients with gastric BL have a localized disease that is limited to stage 1 and 2, and that these localized BLs have outstanding outcomes. These findings suggest that these BLs could represent a distinct subtype that might have a different biology, which needs to be defined.","['Park, Yeon Hee', 'Kim, Won Seog', 'Kang, Hye Jin', 'Na, Im Il', 'Ryoo, Baek-Yeol', 'Yang, Sung Hyun', 'Lee, Seung-Sook', 'Uhm, Ji Eun', 'Kim, Kihyun', 'Jung, Chul Won', 'Park, Keunchil', 'Ko, Young H']","['Park YH', 'Kim WS', 'Kang HJ', 'Na II', 'Ryoo BY', 'Yang SH', 'Lee SS', 'Uhm JE', 'Kim K', 'Jung CW', 'Park K', 'Ko YH']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Korea Cancer Center Hospital, Korea Institute of Radiological & Medical Sciences, 215-4, Gongneung-Dong, Nowon-Gu, 139-706, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/*mortality/pathology', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stomach Neoplasms/drug therapy/*mortality/pathology', 'Survival Rate']",2006/03/07 09:00,2007/01/26 09:00,['2006/03/07 09:00'],"['2005/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-005-0050-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2006 May;85(5):285-90. doi: 10.1007/s00277-005-0050-8.

To search its substrates and regulatory proteins, hPFTAIRE1 was fused to LexA and used as a bait to screen a human brain LexA two-hybrid library. In this screening, seven hPFTAIRE1 interacting proteins, including promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), were obtained. The interaction between PLZF and hPFTAIRE1 was confirmed by beta-galactosidase assay and Leu growth activity. PLZF encodes a transcription factor belonging to the POZ/BTB domain and Krupel zinc finger (POK) family. The highly conserved POZ/BTB domain plays a critical role in protein-protein interaction. We deleted the POZ/BTB and Krupel zinc finger domains, respectively, and observed the interaction between hPFTAIRE1 and truncated PLZFs by liquid beta-galactosidase activity assay. A weak interaction was detected between hPFTAIRE1 and PLZF. We also observed the interaction between PLZF and another Cdc2-related kinase, PCTAIRE1. A similar result was observed. The interaction between PLZF and hPFTAIRE1 or PCTAIRE1 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assay in a yeast system. PLZF is a phosphoprotein and plays multiple roles during cell growth. Our results suggest that hPFTAIRE1 and PCTAIRE1 may play important roles in the functional regulation of PLZF.","['Gao, Yan-Kun', 'Jiang, Mei', 'Yang, Tao', 'Chen, Jiang-Ye']","['Gao YK', 'Jiang M', 'Yang T', 'Chen JY']","['State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai),Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,101206716,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (LexA protein, Bacteria)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Brain/cytology/metabolism', 'CDC2-CDC28 Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation/methods', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Serine Endopeptidases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Yeasts', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",2006/03/07 09:00,2006/06/03 09:00,['2006/03/07 09:00'],"['2006/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1745-7270.2006.00145.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai). 2006 Mar;38(3):164-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1745-7270.2006.00145.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD5-positive CLL cells were once assumed to originate from immature, immunologically incompetent B lymphocytes, and to passively accumulate due to increased life time. In 1999, two research groups demonstrated that CLL, which is a morphologically uniform but clinically heterogenous disease, can be classified into two major subgroups on the basis of the mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes. It was also suggested that these two groups both originate from mature cells that have passed the antigen selection process. This hypothesis was confirmed by gene expression studies indicating a uniform pattern characteristic to memory cells, as well as specific B-cell receptor (BCR) structures supporting the existence of a functional antigen selection. The differences in the BCR signal transduction mechanisms may underlie the different clinical behavior in which zeta-associated tyrosine kinase (ZAP-70) may play a pivotal role, since elevated ZAP-70 expression is likely to be an unfavorable prognostic factor in CLL. The diagnostic testing for ZAP-70 expression plays an important role in the therapeutic decisions.","['Szepesi, Agota']",['Szepesi A'],"['SE I. sz.

The WT1 gene is alternatively spliced at two sites, yielding four isoforms: 17AA(+)KTS(+), 17AA(+)KTS(-), 17AA(-)KTS(+), and 17AA(-)KTS(-). Here, we showed that 17AA(+)WT1-specific siRNA induced apoptosis in three WT1-expressing leukemia cell lines (K562, HL-60, and Kasumi-1), but not in WT1-non-expressing lymphoma cell line (Daudi). 17AA(+)WT1-specific siRNA activated caspase-3 and -9 in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway but not caspase-8 in the extrinsic one. On the other hand, 17AA(-)WT1-specific siRNA did not induce apoptosis in the three WT1-expressing cell lines. The apoptosis was associated with activation of proapoptotic Bax, which was activated upstream of the mitochondria. Constitutive expression of 17AA(+)WT1 isoforms inhibited apoptosis of K562 leukemia cells induced by apoptosis-inducing agents, etoposide and doxorubicin, through the protection of mitochondrial membrane damages, and DNA-binding zinc-finger region of 17AA(+)WT1 isoform was essential for the antiapoptotic functions. We further studied the gene(s) whose expression was altered by the expression of 17AA(+)WT1 isoforms and showed that the expression of proapoptotic Bak was decreased by the expression of 17AA(+)KTS(-)WT1 isoform. Taken together, these results indicated that 17AA(+)WT1 isoforms played antiapoptotic roles at some points upstream of the mitochondria in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway.","['Ito, K', 'Oji, Y', 'Tatsumi, N', 'Shimizu, S', 'Kanai, Y', 'Nakazawa, T', 'Asada, M', 'Jomgeow, T', 'Aoyagi, S', 'Nakano, Y', 'Tamaki, H', 'Sakaguchi, N', 'Shirakata, T', 'Nishida, S', 'Kawakami, M', 'Tsuboi, A', 'Oka, Y', 'Tsujimoto, Y', 'Sugiyama, H']","['Ito K', 'Oji Y', 'Tatsumi N', 'Shimizu S', 'Kanai Y', 'Nakazawa T', 'Asada M', 'Jomgeow T', 'Aoyagi S', 'Nakano Y', 'Tamaki H', 'Sakaguchi N', 'Shirakata T', 'Nishida S', 'Kawakami M', 'Tsuboi A', 'Oka Y', 'Tsujimoto Y', 'Sugiyama H']","['Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mitochondria/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'WT1 Proteins/genetics/*physiology']",2006/03/07 09:00,2006/08/29 09:00,['2006/03/07 09:00'],"['2006/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209455 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209455 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Jul 13;25(30):4217-29. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209455.

Since 1998, eight cases of acute leukemia (AL) have been described. We report two new cases of myeloid AL that occurred during treatment with Mx. OBSERVATIONS: The first case concerned a women who was treated with Mx for 3 months. In spite of a very low total dose (58.32 mg), she developed promyelocytic AL. The second patient died of myeloid AL, 27 months after the last injection of Mx. DISCUSSION: All the reported cases of AL occurring after Mx respond to the criteria of leukemia induced by anti-topoisomerases II. Epidemiological data and those from animal experiments suggest that Mx has direct role in the occurrence of leukemia. CONCLUSION: It must be remembered that even if the risk of Mx-induced leukemia is low, blood cell counts must be closely monitored for at least five years after the last injection of this treatment.","['Nollet, S', 'Berger, E', 'Deconinck, E', 'Baldauf, E', 'Rumbach, L']","['Nollet S', 'Berger E', 'Deconinck E', 'Baldauf E', 'Rumbach L']","['Service de Neurologie, Hopital Jean Minjoz, Besancon. nolletsylvain@yahoo.fr']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Rev Neurol (Paris),Revue neurologique,2984779R,"['0 (Analgesics)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Analgesics/*adverse effects', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/*adverse effects', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*complications/*drug therapy']",2006/03/07 09:00,2006/05/04 09:00,['2006/03/07 09:00'],"['2006/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['MDOI-RN-02-2006-162-2-0035-3787-101019-200509615 [pii]', '10.1016/s0035-3787(06)74999-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Neurol (Paris). 2006 Feb;162(2):195-9. doi: 10.1016/s0035-3787(06)74999-2.,,,['Rev Neurol (Paris). 2006 Feb;162(2):157-9.

We evaluated different diagnostic tests and compared them with the widely used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of p27 in the diagnosis of FeLV. Blood samples from 445 cats were tested for the presence of provirus by real-time PCR and plasma and saliva specimens from those cats were tested for the presence of viral RNA by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and for the presence of p27 by ELISA. In comparison to conventional ELISA, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the detection of salivary FeLV RNA by real-time RT-PCR were found to be 98.1 and 99.2%, respectively. Detection of viral RNA in saliva had a positive predictive value of 94.6% and a negative predictive value of 99.7%. The kappa value was 0.96, demonstrating an almost perfect agreement between both tests. Furthermore, we confirmed previous results showing that a number of cats which tested negative for the presence of p27 in plasma were in fact positive for the presence of DNA provirus in blood specimens (5.4%). However, 96.4% of these latently infected cats did not shed viral RNA in saliva; therefore, we assume that these cats are of relatively low clinical importance at the time of testing. This study shows considerable diagnostic value of the detection of saliva FeLV RNA in naturally infected cats.

Predominant induction of one or the other cell death modality depends on differences in mitochondrial membrane perturbation induced by attenuated and virulent strains. Infection of macrophages with the attenuated H37Ra or the virulent H37Rv causes mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization characterized by cytochrome c release from the mitochondrial intermembrane space and apoptosis. Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization is transient, peaks 6 h after infection, and requires Ca(2+) flux and B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2-associated protein X translocation into mitochondria. In contrast, only the virulent H37Rv induces significant mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Deltapsi(m)) loss caused by mitochondrial permeability transition. Dissipation of Deltapsi(m) also peaks at 6 h after infection, is transient, is inhibited by the classical mitochondrial permeability transition inhibitor cyclosporine A, has a requirement for mitochondrial Ca(2+) loading, and is independent of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma translocation into the mitochondria.

In this study an in vitro assay was developed to investigate the suppression of CD8+ T cells by Friend retrovirus (FV)-induced Tregs. CD4+CD25+ T cells isolated from mice chronically infected with the FV suppressed the development of effector function in naive CD8+ T cells without affecting their ability to proliferate or up-regulate activation markers. In vitro restimulation was not required for suppression by FV-induced Tregs, correlating with their high activation state in vivo. Suppression was mediated by direct T cell-T cell interactions and occurred in the absence of APCs. Furthermore, suppression occurred irrespective of the TCR specificity of the CD8+ T cells. Most interestingly, FV-induced Tregs were able to suppress the function of CD8+ effector T cells that had been physiologically activated during acute FV infection.

Trophoblast stem (TS) cells possess the ability to differentiate into trophoblast subtypes in vitro and contribute to the trophoblast lineage in vivo. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) is a negative regulator of cytokine signaling. Targeted disruption of SOCS3 revealed embryonic lethality on E12.5; it was caused by placental defect with enhanced leukemia inhibitory factor receptor signaling. A complementation of the wild-type (WT) placenta by using tetraploid rescue technique showed that the embryonic lethality in SOCS3-deficient embryo was due to the placental defect. Here we demonstrate that TS cells supplementation rescues placental defect in SOCS3-deficient embryos. In the rescued placenta, TS cells were integrated into the placental structure, and a substantial structural improvement was observed in the labyrinthine layer that was disrupted in the SOCS3-deficient placenta. Importantly, by supplying TS cells, living SOCS3-deficient embryos were detected at term. These results indicate a functional contribution of TS cells in the placenta and their potential application.","['Takahashi, Yutaka', 'Dominici, Massimo', 'Swift, John', 'Nagy, Cristie', 'Ihle, James N']","['Takahashi Y', 'Dominici M', 'Swift J', 'Nagy C', 'Ihle JN']","[""Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biochemistry, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA. takahash@med.kobe-u.ac.jp""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Socs3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Placenta/abnormalities/*embryology', '*Placenta Diseases/pathology/prevention & control', 'Pregnancy', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Trophoblasts/*transplantation']",2006/03/07 09:00,2006/07/06 09:00,['2006/03/07 09:00'],"['2006/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)46643-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.C600015200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Apr 28;281(17):11444-5. doi: 10.1074/jbc.C600015200.

To define the mechanism contributing to cell death in those heterogenous cell populations, the authors used two different types of neuroblastoma cells, SH-SY5Y and SK-N-AS, to compare the pathways that mediate death response to arsenic trioxide. With arsenic trioxide exposure, both cell lines were arrested at the S-G2/M phase with the increase of cyclin B expression and CDK1 activity. Although caspase 3 was activated in both cell lines, the NF-kappaB activity and the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, and p27 were different.

All-trans retinoic acid induces clinical remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia by inhibiting cell growth and inducing differentiation and apoptosis of the leukemic blasts. An important role of the cell cycle regulatory protein, cyclin A1, in the development of acute myeloid leukemia has previously been demonstrated in a transgenic mouse model. We have recently shown that there was a direct interaction between cyclin A1 and a major all-trans retinoic acid receptor, RAR alpha, following all-trans retinoic acid treatment of leukemic cells. In the present study, we investigated whether cyclin A1 might be involved in all-trans retinoic acid-induced apoptosis in U-937 leukemic cells. We found that all-trans retinoic acid-induced apoptosis was associated with concomitant increase in cyclin A1 expression. However, there was no induction of cyclin A1 mRNA expression following the all-trans retinoic acid-induced apoptosis. Treatment of cells with a caspase inhibitor was not able to prevent all-trans retinoic acid-induced up-regulation of cyclin A1 expression. Interestingly, induced cyclin A1 expression in U-937 cells led to a significant increase in the proportion of apoptotic cells. Further, U-937 cells overexpressing cyclin A1 appeared to be more sensitive to all-trans retinoic acid-induced apoptosis indicating the ability of cyclin A1 to mediate all-trans retinoic acid-induced apoptosis. Induced cyclin E expression was not able to initiate cell death in U-937 cells.

To this end, a set of dialkyl bisphosphonates bearing isoprenoid chains of varying lengths has been synthesized. Some of these compounds were found to have biological activity on post-translational processing of the oncogenic small GTPases, Ras and Rap1a, in human-derived K562 leukemia cells. Most importantly, these compounds impair protein geranylgeranylation and not protein farnesylation.","['Shull, Larry W', 'Wiemer, Andrew J', 'Hohl, Raymond J', 'Wiemer, David F']","['Shull LW', 'Wiemer AJ', 'Hohl RJ', 'Wiemer DF']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242-1294, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Terpenes)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Diphosphonates/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Molecular Structure', 'Protein Prenylation/drug effects', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Terpenes/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins/*drug effects', 'ras Proteins/*drug effects']",2006/03/07 09:00,2006/08/09 09:00,['2006/03/07 09:00'],"['2005/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/03 00:00 [revised]', '2006/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0968-0896(06)00161-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2006.02.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2006 Jun 15;14(12):4130-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2006.02.010.

This double Michael reaction acceptor reacts directly with Keap1, the sensor protein for inducers, leading to enhanced transcription of phase 2 genes and protection against oxidant and electrophile toxicities. In our efforts to identify potent chemoprotective agents, we found that in rapidly growing murine leukemia cells (L1210) low concentrations (in the submicromolar range) of bis(2-hydroxybenzylidene)acetone markedly increased the activities of NAD(P)H:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and glutathione reductase, and the levels of total glutathione, three markers of the phase 2 response. In contrast, at high concentrations (in the micromolar range) the same compound caused G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Importantly, a mutant L1210 cell line (Y8), selected for resistance to deoxyadenosine and lacking expression of p53 protein, was considerably more sensitive to the apoptotic effects of bis(2-hydroxybenzylidene)acetone. When caspase activities were evaluated in cell-free extracts prepared from treated wild type or mutant L1210 cells, the activities of caspase-3, the terminal caspase in the cascade leading to apoptosis, and caspase-10 were found to be markedly elevated. The activities of other caspases measured, caspase-1, -6 and -8, were not appreciably affected. Thus, both induction of the phase 2 response and p53-independent, caspase-3-mediated apoptosis could act cooperatively in chemoprotection. The concentration-dependent differential effects on these two pathways should be carefully considered in mechanistic explanations and strategic designs.","['Dinkova-Kostova, Albena T', 'Cory, Ann H', 'Bozak, Richard E', 'Hicks, Ronald J', 'Cory, Joseph G']","['Dinkova-Kostova AT', 'Cory AH', 'Bozak RE', 'Hicks RJ', 'Cory JG']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, The Lewis B. and Dorothy Cullman Cancer Chemoprotection Center, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, 725 North Wolfe Street, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA. adkostov@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Ac-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartyl-aminomethylcoumarin)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzyl Compounds)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bis(2-hydroxybenzylidene)acetone)', '1364PS73AF (Acetone)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (Nqo1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.6.99.1 (NADPH Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Acetone/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzyl Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coumarins/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia L1210/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)', 'NADPH Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",2006/03/07 09:00,2007/04/06 09:00,['2006/03/07 09:00'],"['2005/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/18 00:00 [revised]', '2006/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(06)00074-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2006.01.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2007 Jan 8;245(1-2):341-9. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2006.01.024.

Specifically, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1) and glutathione S-transferase Ya subunit (Gst ya) are key enzymes involved in cellular defense against reactive forms of oxygen and the inhibition of carcinogenesis. As(3+), which induces these enzymes, has been proven to have a role in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Ascorbic acid (AA) potentiates the anticancer effect of As(3+) and thus it is expected that this antioxidant will have a paradoxical effect on the ability of heavy metals, specifically As(3+), to induce Nqo1 and Gst ya. We have shown that As(3+) and Cd(2+) induce heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), Nqo1 and Gst ya mRNA levels but Cr(6+) decreases Nqo1 and Gst ya mRNA. Surprisingly, AA superinduced the induction of HO-1, Nqo1 and Gst ya mRNA by As(3+), while inhibiting the induction of HO-1 mRNA by Cd(2+) and Cr(6+).

After 72 h of incubation in the presence of Tl(+) (5-100 microM), no significant changes in cell viability were observed, although the average cell size was decreased as evaluated by steady-state light scattering. Tl(+) (5-100 microM) caused a significant increase in the concentration of cellular oxidants as measured with the probe 5(6)-carboxy-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCDCDHF). Similarly, a higher lipid oxidation products release was observed as measured by TBARS production. Both Tl(+)-mediated DCDCDHF oxidation and TBARS production were prevented when cells were supplemented with 2mM Trolox. Tl(+) (5-100 microM) also induced a concentration-dependent increase in plasma membrane fluidity, evaluated with the probe 6-(9-anthroyloxy)stearic acid (6-AS). This effect of Tl(+) was neither associated to the externalization of phosphatidylserine, nor observed in Trolox-supplemented cells. Significant correlations were found between the increase in plasma membrane fluidity and TBARS production and DCDCDHF oxidation. Together, the present results suggest that the increase in cellular oxidants caused by Tl(+) could oxidize membrane fatty acids, resulting in an increase in membrane fluidity. These effects could underlie the pathology associated with Tl(+) toxicity.","['Verstraeten, Sandra Viviana']",['Verstraeten SV'],"['Department of Biological Chemistry-IQUIFIB (UBA-CONICET), School of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina. @ffyb.uba.ar']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Toxicology,Toxicology,0361055,"['0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances)', 'AD84R52XLF (Thallium)']",IM,"['Cell Membrane/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Fluidity/*drug effects', 'Oxidants/*biosynthesis', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Thallium/*toxicity', 'Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances/metabolism']",2006/03/07 09:00,2006/06/09 09:00,['2006/03/07 09:00'],"['2005/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0300-483X(06)00083-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tox.2006.01.028 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicology. 2006 May 1;222(1-2):95-102. doi: 10.1016/j.tox.2006.01.028.

The high-affinity form of this receptor is expressed on activated T lymphocytes, activated B lymphocytes, and activated macrophages. A number of leukemias and lymphomas, including cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, express a component of the receptor. Ex vivo studies have shown that denileukin diftitox interacts with the high- and intermediate-affinity IL-2 receptor on the cell surface and undergoes internalization. Subsequent cleavage in the endosome releases the diphtheria toxin into the cytosol, which then inhibits cellular protein synthesis, resulting in rapid cell death.

Here, we study the underlying principles and the feasibility for the adjuvant therapy of human B cell chronic-lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). CLL cells and allogeneic DC were only mixed or additionally fused. Using a combination of FACS and fluorescence microscopic analyses, we show that DC-CLL hybrids can be successfully generated. However, fusion frequencies have to be critically evaluated because the number of fused cells is overestimated when based on FACS analyses alone. The capability of activating patients' PBMC was examined by measuring cytokine secretion in co-culture assays. We made a systematic comparison of the immunostimulatory capacities of different stimulator cell populations, including DC-CLL fusion samples, unfused mixtures of DC and CLL cells as well as DC or tumor cells alone. Surprisingly, even unfused mixtures had a pronounced tumor-directed immunostimulatory effect. This could be explained by the capture of antigens from surrounding leukemia cells by DC during co-cultivation. Although fusion frequencies were low, PBMC stimulation was significantly more effective when the mixtures were subjected to cell fusion. The most potent stimulus was provided by DC-CLL fusion samples derived from mature DC, probably due to their enhanced costimulatory capacity. In summary, DC-tumor cell hybrids might be feasible in the treatment of B-CLL. It should be considered that FACS analysis is not sufficient to assess fusion frequencies and that interactions between unfused DC and CLL cells also result in PBMC activation.","['Allgeier, Thomas', 'Garhammer, Silke', 'Nossner, Elfriede', 'Wahl, Ulrich', 'Kronenberger, Konrad', 'Dreyling, Martin', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Mocikat, Ralph']","['Allgeier T', 'Garhammer S', 'Nossner E', 'Wahl U', 'Kronenberger K', 'Dreyling M', 'Hallek M', 'Mocikat R']","['GSF-Institut fur Molekulare Immunologie, Marchioninistr. 25, D-81377 Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD11c Antigen)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (CD83 antigen)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'B7-1 Antigen/analysis', 'B7-2 Antigen/analysis', 'CD11c Antigen/analysis', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'CD5 Antigens/analysis', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells/immunology', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2006/03/07 09:00,2007/04/06 09:00,['2006/03/07 09:00'],"['2005/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2006/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(06)00054-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2006.01.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2007 Jan 8;245(1-2):275-83. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2006.01.019.

In three leukemias, K562, HL-60, and multidrug resistant (MDR) HL-60, cytotoxicity of topotecan was potentiated by amlodipine, while topotecan alone was resistant to MDR HL-60 cells. In two selected K562 or MDR HL-60 cells, the apoptotic effects were increased by addition of amlodipine, showing a dose-dependent manner. The activities of caspase 3 and 7 (marked as caspase 3/7), and caspase 8 were significantly activated by topotecan with amlodipine co-treated as the stealth liposomes. The deletions of intracellular Ca2+ stores induced by amlodipine correlated with the activated activities of caspase 3/7, or 8, respectively. In xenograft model with MDR HL-60 in nude mice, antitumor activity of stealth liposomal topotecan with amlodipine was significantly enhanced as compared to that of stealth liposomal topotecan or topotecan alone. In conclusion, apoptotic effect is associated with deletion of intracellular Ca2+ by amlodipine through activation of caspase 8 and then 3/7 activities. The enhanced antitumor activities by stealth liposomal topotecan with amlodipine are mainly due to the potentiating apoptotic effect and reversing the resistance by amlodipine. Stealth liposomal encapsulation of anticancer agent with a modulator may provide a novel strategy for improving the chemotherapeutic effects.","['Li, Xing', 'Ruan, Guo-Rui', 'Lu, Wan-Liang', 'Hong, Hai-Yan', 'Liang, Gong-Wen', 'Zhang, Yu-Teng', 'Liu, Yang', 'Long, Chuan', 'Ma, Xi', 'Yuan, Lan', 'Wang, Jian-Cheng', 'Zhang, Xuan', 'Zhang, Qiang']","['Li X', 'Ruan GR', 'Lu WL', 'Hong HY', 'Liang GW', 'Zhang YT', 'Liu Y', 'Long C', 'Ma X', 'Yuan L', 'Wang JC', 'Zhang X', 'Zhang Q']","['Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University, Xueyuan Road 38, Beijing 100083, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,"['0 (Liposomes)', '1J444QC288 (Amlodipine)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amlodipine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Liposomes', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Topotecan/administration & dosage/pharmacology']",2006/03/07 09:00,2006/07/11 09:00,['2006/03/07 09:00'],"['2005/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2006/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0168-3659(06)00038-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jconrel.2006.01.007 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2006 May 15;112(2):186-98. doi: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2006.01.007.

MCP-1 has been previously shown to have a major role in the migration of monocytes towards human leukemic cells, yet it cannot increase cytotoxic effects of monocytes on human leukemic cells. AIM: To determine levels of MCP-1 in the CSF of children during various stages of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 19 children with ALL and without known CNS involvement were enrolled in the study. CSF samples were aliquoted at different stages of therapy (diagnosis, induction, and maintenance) and were frozen at -70 degrees C until use. MCP-1 was measured with a sandwich enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. RESULTS: Mean MCP-1 levels in the CSF were 1762.38 pg/ml (range 522-5000 pg/ml). In children without CNS involvement at diagnosis, CSF MCP1 levels did not change over time and remained within this range throughout the diagnosis and treatment stages. CNS involvement was associated with an increased MCP-1 level following chemotherapy, in patients with CNS involvement from 840 to 3990 pg/ml (P<0.0001), and in patients without CNS involvement from 1134 to 1943 pg/ml (P-value of 0.0322). White blood cells found in the CSF at diagnosis have vanished after induction. CONCLUSIONS: CNS involvement in ALL is associated with significantly higher levels of MCP1 during therapy. This significant rise in MCP-1 levels might be one of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of CNS leukemia. Since chemokines target specific leukocyte subsets, inhibition of a single Chemokine ligand or receptor may have a circumscribed effect, endowing the inhibitor with a limited side effect profile. Chemokines should be considered as possible targets for therapeutic intervention.","['Eisenkraft, Arik', 'Keidan, Ilan', 'Bielorai, Bela', 'Keller, Nathan', 'Toren, Amos', 'Paret, Gideon']","['Eisenkraft A', 'Keidan I', 'Bielorai B', 'Keller N', 'Toren A', 'Paret G']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Safra Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel. aizenkra@017.net.il""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/cerebrospinal fluid/epidemiology', 'Chemokine CCL2/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*cerebrospinal fluid/*drug therapy/pathology']",2006/03/07 09:00,2006/11/10 09:00,['2006/03/07 09:00'],"['2005/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2006/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(06)00053-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2006.01.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2006 Oct;30(10):1259-61. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2006.01.017.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical siblings has improved the survival of patients with unfavorable cytogenetics, but has not improved the survival of intermediate- or favorable-risk patients. If an HLA-identical sibling donor is not available, alternative sources of stem cells may be sought. HLA mismatched transplants are associated with an increased risk of graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease, and lower survival. Since large registries of HLA-typed volunteer donors have been established and the newer and more sensitive tissue typing technology can more clearly differentiate between matched and unmatched donors, some AML patients without an HLA-matched sibling have received transplants from an HLA-matched unrelated donor while in first remission. Data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research indicate that survival of patients with unfavorable cytogenetics appears at least as good with unrelated donor grafts as previously reported for matched sibling grafts, and better than consolidation chemotherapy.

Morphology remains the foundation for the diagnosis. However, additional diagnostic studies, including immunophenotyping, cytogenetic evaluation, and molecular genetic studies, are necessary to develop treatments because specific subtypes of AML can now be approached with targeted therapy. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), defined by a single molecular abnormality, is now treated with specific targeted therapy, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and this subtype of AML is now highly curable. Currently, a number of agents have been explored in AML, including anti-CD33 antibodies and immunoconjugate drugs, inhibitors of multidrug resistance proteins, farnesyl transferase inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, anti-Bcl-2 transcription agents, and inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). New alkylating agents, and purine analogs such as Cloretazine and clofarabine, affect DNA and ribonucleoside reductases, respectively. These agents have shown promise in small studies. Large phase III studies will address whether these are effective in inducing complete responses. Combining targeted agents with chemotherapy may improve the response rates. The plan for the future is to find therapeutic strategies that are specific for patients based on the specific biology of the disease. Future studies will investigate combinations of targeted therapies with each other and with chemotherapies to maximize the inhibition of multiple pathways present in AML. Additionally, evaluation of the identified prognostic factors and gene mutations will enable further pathologic classification of patients with AML.","['Tallman, Martin S']",['Tallman MS'],"['Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Robert H.

MDS is most prevalent among older individuals, many of whom also suffer from other medical conditions. MDS is classified according to World Health Organization criteria and the International Prognostic Scoring System. Supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy. Those with low-risk MDS can often be monitored for an extended period of time without specific therapy, whereas those with intermediate- or high-risk MDS benefit from treatment. Currently, only azacitidine is approved for the treatment of MDS. Several new agents are being tested, including inhibitors of angiogenesis (thalidomide, lenalidomide), farnesyl transferase inhibitors (lonafarnib, tipifarnib), and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (azacitidine, decitabine). Lenalidomide appears particularly effective in patients with low-risk MDS with the deletion of chromosome 5q31. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is an alternative for high-risk MDS.

Hematopoietic malignancy is no exception, and considerable evidence substantiates the role of genetic factors in the risk for leukemia. In a few instances, leukemia runs in families as a single gene, Mendelian disorder. Only a few genes conferring heritable risk for leukemia are known, however, and most are responsible for bone marrow failure syndromes. Thus, the identification of additional genetic risk factors for leukemia represents both a challenge and an opportunity. The high frequency of leukemia and transient leukemia in Down syndrome is beginning to yield the secrets of its unique clinical properties. The apparent phenomenon of anticipation (a declining of age of onset with each passing generation) in familial forms of bone marrow failure and leukemia is now affirmed through its association with mutations in genes responsible for maintaining telomere length. And, for the majority of leukemia cases, as with other common diseases that are not under the influence of a single, major gene, but rather result from the additive interactions of complex genetic and environmental factors, common variants in metabolic enzymes, and other genes awaiting discovery, are being teased out.","['Benson, Kathleen F', 'Horwitz, Marshall']","['Benson KF', 'Horwitz M']","['Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Box 357720, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

It is well established that the exquisite DNA-binding specificity that allows different Hox proteins to specify distinct structures along the body axis is frequently dependent on interactions with other DNA-binding proteins which act as Hox cofactors. These include the PBC and MEIS classes of TALE (Three Amino acid Loop Extension) homeodomain proteins. The PBC class comprises fly Extradenticle (Exd) and vertebrate Pbx homeoproteins, whereas the MEIS class includes fly Homothorax (Hth) and vertebrate Meis and Prep homeoproteins. Exd was first implicated as a Hox cofactor based on mutant phenotypes in the fly. In vertebrates, PBC and MEIS homeobox proteins play important roles in development and disease. In this review, we describe the evidence that these functions reflect a requirement for Pbx and Meis/Prep proteins as Hox cofactors. However, there is mounting evidence that, like in the fly, Pbx and Meis/Prep proteins function more broadly, and we also discuss how ""Hox cofactors"" function as partners for other, non-Hox transcription factors during development. Conversely, we review the evidence that Hox proteins have functions that are independent of Pbx and Meis/Prep cofactors and discuss the possibility that other proteins may participate in the DNA-bound Hox complex, contributing to DNA-binding specificity in the absence of, or in addition to, Pbx and Meis/Prep.","['Moens, Cecilia B', 'Selleri, Licia']","['Moens CB', 'Selleri L']","['Division of Basic Science and HHMI, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98115, USA. cmoens@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PKNOX1 protein, human)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (exd protein, Drosophila)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Drosophila Proteins/physiology', '*Embryonic Development', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/physiology']",2006/03/07 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/03/07 09:00'],"['2005/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/17 00:00 [revised]', '2005/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0012-1606(05)00760-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.10.032 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 2006 Mar 15;291(2):193-206. doi: 10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.10.032.

The objective of this work is to increase the production titers of retroviral vectors by manipulating the sugar carbon sources used in bioreaction. Four sugars were tested (glucose, galactose, sorbitol, and fructose) on an established Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) producer cell line. Galactose and sorbitol did not support cell growth or vector production. Glucose supplemented at 25 mM supported the highest cell growth; however, the use of glucose or fructose at 83 and 140 mM have shown to improve the infectious vector titer three to fourfold. The reasons for the titer improvements were further analyzed and, although, the cell-specific productivity in viral transgene RNA and reverse transcriptase were augmented 5- and 6-fold for glucose at 140 mM and 14- and 16-fold for fructose at 140 mM, comparing with glucose at 25 mM, these increases did not seem sufficient to account for the 14- (140 mM glucose) and 32- (140 mM fructose) fold increment obtained for the infectious particles-specific productivity. Further accounting the enhancement in the titers was the improvement in the viral stability, the half-life of the vectors was enhanced by 30-60%. This resulted in a product quality with a superior ratio of infectious to total particles, thus reducing the most problematic contaminant in the production of retroviral vectors, non-infectious retroviral particles.","['Coroadinha, A S', 'Ribeiro, J', 'Roldao, A', 'Cruz, P E', 'Alves, P M', 'Merten, O-W', 'Carrondo, M J T']","['Coroadinha AS', 'Ribeiro J', 'Roldao A', 'Cruz PE', 'Alves PM', 'Merten OW', 'Carrondo MJ']","['IBET/ITQB, Apartado 12, P-2781-901 Oeiras, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,"['0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Culture Media)', '30237-26-4 (Fructose)', '506T60A25R (Sorbitol)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",IM,"['Carbohydrates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Culture Media/*chemistry', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fructose/pharmacology', 'Galactose/pharmacology', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/*physiology', 'Glucose/pharmacology', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/physiology', 'Retroviridae/*physiology', 'Sorbitol/pharmacology', 'Transgenes', 'Virus Assembly/*drug effects']",2006/03/04 09:00,2006/06/16 09:00,['2006/03/04 09:00'],"['2006/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bit.20778 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2006 May 5;94(1):24-36. doi: 10.1002/bit.20778.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although there have been many reports describing genes that are regulated by PTH in osteoblast cells, the goal of this study was to utilize a well-established in vivo PTH anabolic treatment regimen to identify genes that mediate bone anabolic effects of PTH. We identified a gene we named PTH anabolic induced gene in bone (PAIGB) that has been reported as brain and acute leukemia cytoplasmic (BAALC). Therefore, using the latter nomenclature, we have discovered that BAALC is a PTH-regulated gene whose mRNA expression was selectively induced in rat tibiae nearly 100-fold (maximal) by a PTH 1-34 anabolic treatment regimen in a time-dependent manner. Although BAALC is broadly expressed, PTH did not regulate BAALC expression in other PTH receptor expressing tissues and we find that the regulation of BAALC protein by PTH in vivo is confined to mature osteoblasts. Further in vitro studies using rat UMR-106 osteoblastic cells show that PTH 1-34 rapidly induces BAALC mRNA expression maximally by 4 h while the protein was induced by 8 h. In addition to being regulated by PTH 1-34, BAALC expression can also be induced by other bone forming factors including PGE(2) and 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D(3). We determined that BAALC is regulated by PTH predominantly through the cAMP/PKA pathway. Finally, we demonstrate in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells that BAALC overexpression regulates markers of osteoblast differentiation, including downregulating alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin expression while inducing osteopontin expression. We also demonstrate that these transcriptional responses mediated by BAALC are similar to the responses elicited by PTH 1-34. These data, showing BAALC overexpression can mimic the effect of PTH on markers of osteoblast differentiation, along with the observations that BAALC is induced selectively with a bone anabolic treatment regimen of PTH (not a catabolic treatment regimen), suggest that BAALC may be an important mediator of the PTH anabolic action on bone cell function.","['Robinson, John A', 'Susulic, Vedrana', 'Liu, Yao-Bin', 'Taylor, Chanda', 'Hardenburg, Jill', 'Gironda, Virginia', 'Zhao, Weiguang', 'Kharode, Yogendra', 'McLarney, Sean', 'Bai, Yuchen', 'Malone, Daniel P', 'Murrills, Richard', 'Bex, Fred']","['Robinson JA', 'Susulic V', 'Liu YB', 'Taylor C', 'Hardenburg J', 'Gironda V', 'Zhao W', 'Kharode Y', 'McLarney S', 'Bai Y', 'Malone DP', 'Murrills R', 'Bex F']","[""Women's Health Research Institute, Wyeth Research, 500 Arcola Road, Collegeville, PA 19426, USA. robinsj@wyeth.com""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Baalc protein, rat)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PTH protein, human)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Dinoprostone/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Osteoblasts/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Osteogenesis/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Parathyroid Hormone/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction']",2006/03/04 09:00,2006/09/09 09:00,['2006/03/04 09:00'],"['2006/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.20822 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2006 Aug 1;98(5):1203-20. doi: 10.1002/jcb.20822.,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: We reviewed clinical records of all T-ALL patients from 1987 to 2002 and all T-NHL patients from 1977 to 2002, seen at a single institution. RESULTS: Of 48 T-ALL patients, 15 suffered from a relapse, 6 (40%) were asymptomatic at the time of relapse. T-ALL (13/30) with mediastinal enlargement at first diagnosis relapsed versus 2/16 of those without mediastinal enlargement. However, at relapse, only one patient had a mediastinal mass, which in addition was symptomatic. Of 39 T-NHL patients, 6 patients relapsed. Forty percent of relapsed T-ALL and 17% of relapsed T-NHL were asymptomatic. The seven asymptomatic relapses were detected by CSF (n = 4), BM (n = 2) or blood count (n = 1) examinations. All T-ALL and T-NHL patients with a mediastinal relapse were symptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that routine CSF examinations during treatment can detect relapses of T-ALL and T-NHL before onset of symptoms, which might be of clinical value. Relapses are rarely detected by BM or blood examinations and whether this translates in a clinical benefit is unlikely. Routine chest X-rays are not useful.","['Huang, L', 'Lequin, M', 'Pieters, R', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, M M']","['Huang L', 'Lequin M', 'Pieters R', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM']","[""Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnostic Tests, Routine', 'Disease Management', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/pathology', 'Mediastinum/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Radiography', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies']",2006/03/04 09:00,2007/04/28 09:00,['2006/03/04 09:00'],"['2006/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20813 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Apr;48(4):468-72. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20813.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied Ngn3 expression during in vitro generation of beta-cells from adult rat exocrine pancreas tissue treated with epidermal growth factor and leukaemia inhibitory factor. This treatment induced a transient expression of both Ngn3 and its upstream activator hepatocyte nuclear factor 6. Inhibition of EGF and LIF signalling by pharmacological antagonists of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, or knockdown of Ngn3 by RNA interference prevented the generation of new insulin-positive cells. This study demonstrates that in vitro growth factor stimulation can induce recapitulation of an embryonic endocrine differentiation pathway in adult dedifferentiated exocrine cells.

Lyl-1 encodes a transcription factor containing a basic helix-hoop-helix (bHLH) motif closely related to scl/tal, which controls numerous decisions in embryonic and adult hematopoiesis. We report here that Lyl-1 null mice are viable and display normal blood cell counts, except for a reduced number of B cells resulting from a partial block after the pro-B stage. Nevertheless, the deletion of Lyl-1 results in a diminution in the frequency of immature progenitors (Lin(-), CD34(-), sca-1(+), c-kit(+) [LSK], and LSK-side population [LSK-SP]) and in S(12) colony-forming unit (CFU-S(12)) and long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) content in embryonic day 14 fetal liver (E14 FL) and adult bone marrow (BM). More important, Lyl-1(-/-) E14 FL cells and BM are severely impaired in their competitive reconstituting abilities, especially with respect to B and T lineage reconstitution. Thus, ablation of Lyl-1 quantitatively and functionally affects HSCs, a cell population that transcribes Lyl-1 more actively than their differentiated progenies. Our results demonstrate for the first time that Lyl-1 functions are important for HSC properties and B-cell differentiation and that they are largely distinct from scl functions.","['Capron, Claude', 'Lecluse, Yann', 'Kaushik, Anna Lila', 'Foudi, Adlen', 'Lacout, Catherine', 'Sekkai, Dalila', 'Godin, Isabelle', 'Albagli, Olivier', 'Poullion, Isabelle', 'Svinartchouk, Fedor', 'Schanze, Elisabeth', 'Vainchenker, William', 'Sablitzky, Fred', 'Bennaceur-Griscelli, Annelise', 'Dumenil, Dominique']","['Capron C', 'Lecluse Y', 'Kaushik AL', 'Foudi A', 'Lacout C', 'Sekkai D', 'Godin I', 'Albagli O', 'Poullion I', 'Svinartchouk F', 'Schanze E', 'Vainchenker W', 'Sablitzky F', 'Bennaceur-Griscelli A', 'Dumenil D']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicicale (INSERM) U362, Institut Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Lyl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Lineage/*physiology', 'Embryonic Development/physiology', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology']",2006/03/04 09:00,2006/08/15 09:00,['2006/03/04 09:00'],"['2006/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)63347-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-08-3145 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jun 15;107(12):4678-86. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-08-3145.

QT and corrected QT (QTc) were significantly longer during As2O3-ON than in As2O3-OFF, but QT and QTc dispersions were comparable. The patients' 24-hour heart rates were higher during As2O3-ON than in As2O3-OFF. QTc intervals at each hour were longer during As2O3-ON than in As2O3-OFF. However, QTc prolongation of more than 30 milliseconds only occurred at one time point (2 hours) after oral As2O3, resulting in QTc of more than 500 milliseconds in 3 of 16 patients, all within 4 hours of oral As2O3. Although the standard deviation of normal RR interval was lower during As2O3-ON, ratios of low frequency to high frequency power for As2O3-ON and As2O3-OFF were comparable.

We reported previously that NF-kappaB contributes to chemoresistance of CEM human T leukemic cells in part through its ability to induce p21(waf1/cip1). Here, we provide evidence that sequential NF-kappaB-activating signals induce heightened NF-kappaB DNA binding and p21(waf1/cip1) induction in CEM and additional T leukemic cell lines. This response arises from exceedingly low basal expression of the p105/p50 NF-kappaB subunit encoded by the NFKB1 gene in these cell lines. An initial NF-kappaB activation event enhances the recruitment of p65 and ELF1 to the NFKB1 promoter, leading to p65- and ELF1-dependent synthesis of p105/p50, which promotes an exchange of NF-kappaB complexes to p50-containing complexes with an increased DNA-binding activity to certain NF-kappaB target elements. Subsequent stimulation of these cells with an anticancer agent, etoposide, results in augmented NF-kappaB-dependent p21(waf1/cip1) induction and increased chemoresistance of the leukemia cells. Thus, we propose that low basal NFKB1 expression coupled with sequential NF-kappaB activation events can promote increased chemoresistance in certain T leukemic cells.","['Chang, Pei-Yun', 'Miyamoto, Shigeki']","['Chang PY', 'Miyamoto S']","['Program in Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, Department of Pharmacology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 301 Medical Sciences Center, 1300 University Avenue, Madison, WI 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelA/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/03/04 09:00,2006/04/19 09:00,['2006/03/04 09:00'],"['2006/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['4/2/101 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-05-0259 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2006 Feb;4(2):101-12. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-05-0259.,,,,,"['CA081065/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA077474/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He had developed intra-abdominal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and in 1992 had received 3 courses of combination chemotherapy with doxorubicin (Adriamycin), cyclophosphamide, vincristine, methotrexate, bleomycin, and prednisolone. The patient was orally given prednisolone (10 mg/day) and cyclophosphamide (50 mg/day) as HES treatment without a subsequent improvement of the eosinophilia. In May 2003, anemia (hemoglobin, 7.9 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia (65 x 10(9)/L) manifested with progressive eosinophilia (21.0 x 10(9)/L) and a small number of blasts.

DNA sequence analysis demonstrated that the breakpoints of the FIP1L1 and PDGFRalpha genes were present in exon 9 and exon 12, respectively.

Among them DNA vaccination and anti-IgE antibody have shown promising results. Herewith, a combination of both strategies is proposed to minimize IgE production while inducing high levels of blocking IgG and strong Th1 immune responses. A bicistronic expression plasmid including an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) can express both, allergen and a single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody against human IgE within antigen presenting cells (APCs) including B cells. Presentation of allergen derived peptides via MHC I and MHC II stimulates specific Th1 responses resulting in high levels of IFN-gamma and IgG. Anti-IgE scFv antibody binds to newly synthesized IgE molecules within B cell cytoplasm and also to free serum IgE, thereby inhibiting attachment of IgE to its receptors on basophils and mast cells. Also, IgE-anti-IgE complex functions as blocking antibody and neutralizes allergens entering the body. Additionally, anti-IgE scFv antibody binds to membrane bound IgE (mIgE) on B cells and interferes with IgE expression. Using assays, such as enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IgG and IgE production in response to this expression system can be evaluated. Also, rat basophil leukemia cell assay (using RBL-2H3 cells) can show the amount of functional IgE in sera as basophil mediator release is regarded as an indicator of the allergic hypersensitive reactions. The proposed approach may result in high levels of blocking IgG and low levels of IgE secretion from B cells. Additionally, it can inhibit activity of IgE in degranulation of basophils and mast cells.","['Bandbon Balenga, Nariman Aghaei', 'Thalhamer, Josef', 'Weiss, Richard']","['Bandbon Balenga NA', 'Thalhamer J', 'Weiss R']","['Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Science, University of Tehran, Enghelab Ave., P.O.

Nevertheless, the molecular determinants governing sensitivity towards TRAIL remain to be defined. Acknowledging the previously demonstrated deregulation of prostate-apoptosis-response-gene-4 (par-4) in ex vivo cells of patients suffering from acute and chronic lymphatic leukemia, we here tested the hypothesis that expression of par-4 influences sensitivity to TRAIL. Evaluating this hypothesis we show, that par-4-transfected T-lymphoblastic Jurkat cells exhibit a considerably increased rate of apoptosis upon incubation with an agonistic TRAIL-antibody as compared to their mock-transfected counterparts. Defining the underlying molecular mechanisms we provide evidence, that par-4 enhances sensitivity towards TRAIL by employing crucial members of the extrinsic pathway. Thus, par-4-overexpressing Jurkat clones show an enforced cleavage of c-Flip(L) together with an increased activation of the initiator caspases-8 and -10. In addition, expression of par-4 enables cells to down-regulate the inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins cIAP-1, cIAP-2, XIAP and survivin with a concomitantly enhanced activation of the executioner caspases-6 and -7. Supporting the crucial role of caspase-8 in par-4-promoted apoptosis we demonstrate that inhibition of caspase-8 considerably reduces TRAIL-induced apoptosis in par-4 and mock-transfected Jurkat clones and reverses the described molecular changes. In conclusion, we here provide first evidence that expression of par-4 in neoplastic lymphocytes augments sensitivity to TRAIL-induced cell death and outline the responsible molecular mechanisms, in particular the crucial role of caspase-8 activation.","['Boehrer, Simone', 'Nowak, Daniel', 'Puccetti, Elena', 'Ruthardt, Martin', 'Sattler, Nicole', 'Trepohl, Bettina', 'Schneider, Bernd', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Mitrou, Paris S', 'Chow, Kai Uwe']","['Boehrer S', 'Nowak D', 'Puccetti E', 'Ruthardt M', 'Sattler N', 'Trepohl B', 'Schneider B', 'Hoelzer D', 'Mitrou PS', 'Chow KU']","['Department of Medicine II, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University Hospital, Theodor-Stern-Kai-7, 60590 Frankfurt, Germany.

COX-2 induction was found to be due to transcriptional enhancement dependent on p42/44, p38 MAPK, and JNK activation, whereas Mcl-1 induction resulted from bile acid-mediated protein stabilization in a Raf-1-dependent manner. Moreover, the inhibitions of either COX-2 activity by celecoxib or Mcl-1 induction by siRNA transfection rendered HSCs susceptible to bile acid-induced apoptosis.

Various pre-processing techniques, such as dChip, GCRMA, RMA and MAS have been developed for this purpose. This study assesses the effect of applying different pre-processing methods on the results of analyses of large Affymetrix datasets. By focusing on practical applications of microarray-based research, this study provides insight into the relevance of pre-processing procedures to biology-oriented researchers. RESULTS: Using two publicly available datasets, i.e., gene-expression data of 285 patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML, Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChip) and 42 samples of tumor tissue of the embryonal central nervous system (CNS, Affymetrix HuGeneFL GeneChip), we tested the effect of the four pre-processing strategies mentioned above, on (1) expression level measurements, (2) detection of differential expression, (3) cluster analysis and (4) classification of samples. In most cases, the effect of pre-processing is relatively small compared to other choices made in an analysis for the AML dataset, but has a more profound effect on the outcome of the CNS dataset. Analyses on individual probe sets, such as testing for differential expression, are affected most; supervised, multivariate analyses such as classification are far less sensitive to pre-processing. CONCLUSION: Using two experimental datasets, we show that the choice of pre-processing method is of relatively minor influence on the final analysis outcome of large microarray studies whereas it can have important effects on the results of a smaller study. The data source (platform, tissue homogeneity, RNA quality) is potentially of bigger importance than the choice of pre-processing method.","['Verhaak, Roel G W', 'Staal, Frank J T', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Reinders, Marcel J T', 'de Ridder, Dick']","['Verhaak RG', 'Staal FJ', 'Valk PJ', 'Lowenberg B', 'Reinders MJ', 'de Ridder D']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. r.verhaak@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software', 'Software Validation']",2006/03/04 09:00,2006/07/21 09:00,['2006/03/04 09:00'],"['2005/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2105-7-105 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-7-105 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2006 Mar 2;7:105. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-7-105.,20060302,,,,,PMC1481623,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thorough characterization is required to demonstrate the existence of these transcripts and gain insight into their role in retrovirus biology. RESULTS: This report provides the first complete characterization of an antisense retroviral transcript that encodes the previously described HTLV-I HBZ protein. In this study, we show that HBZ-encoding transcripts initiate in the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR) at several positions and consist of two alternatively spliced variants (SP1 and SP2). Expression of the most abundant HBZ spliced variant (SP1) could be detected in different HTLV-I-infected cell lines and importantly in cellular clones isolated from HTLV-I-infected patients. Polyadenylation of HBZ RNA occurred at a distance of 1450 nucleotides downstream of the HBZ stop codon in close proximity of a typical polyA signal. We have also determined that translation mostly initiates from the first exon located in the 3' LTR and that the HBZ isoform produced from the SP1 spliced variant demonstrated inhibition of Tax and c-Jun-dependent transcriptional activation. CONCLUSION: These results conclusively demonstrate the existence of antisense transcription in retroviruses, which likely plays a role in HTLV-I-associated pathogenesis through HBZ protein synthesis.","['Cavanagh, Marie-Helene', 'Landry, Sebastien', 'Audet, Brigitte', 'Arpin-Andre, Charlotte', 'Hivin, Patrick', 'Pare, Marie-Eve', 'Thete, Julien', 'Wattel, Eric', 'Marriott, Susan J', 'Mesnard, Jean-Michel', 'Barbeau, Benoit']","['Cavanagh MH', 'Landry S', 'Audet B', 'Arpin-Andre C', 'Hivin P', 'Pare ME', 'Thete J', 'Wattel E', 'Marriott SJ', 'Mesnard JM', 'Barbeau B']","['Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec, Pavillon CHUL, Quebec, G1V 4G2, Canada. marie-helene.cavanagh@crchul.ulaval.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'DNA, Antisense/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Leucine Zippers/genetics', 'Poly A/*genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics']",2006/03/04 09:00,2006/08/15 09:00,['2006/03/04 09:00'],"['2005/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-3-15 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-3-15 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2006 Mar 2;3:15. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-3-15.,20060302,,,,,PMC1459196,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently reported positive skin reactions and histamine release from basophils in response to autologous sweat in patients with AD. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the biochemical and immunological properties of the substance in sweat that evokes histamine release and to study the usability of the basophil-histamine release test with the sweat antigen for AD. METHODS: Sweat collected from healthy volunteers was purified using chromatographies. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E of four patients with AD were purified using an affinity-chromatography column with anti-IgE antibodies. The amount of semi-purified sweat antigen (138 ng protein/ml) that induced a half-maximum reaction of basophils of a patient with AD was utilized for the basophil histamine release test. The involvement of specific IgE and high-affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) in the reactions was examined using basophils of healthy volunteers, a human mast cell line (LAD2), and a rat basophilic leukemia cell line transfected with human alpha-subunit of FcepsilonRI (RBL-48). RESULTS: The semi-purified sweat antigen induced histamine release from the basophils of 47 of 61 (74.6%) patients with AD and four of 46 (8.7%) healthy controls. Both basophils and mast cells sensitized with the patient-derived IgE showed degranulation upon stimulation with the sweat antigen. However, no reaction was observed when cells were sensitized with myeloma IgE or the antigen was treated with proteases. CONCLUSION: The semi-purified standardized sweat antigen consists of a protein that induces degranulation of basophils and mast cells via antigen-specific IgE and FcepsilonRI in patients with AD.","['Tanaka, A', 'Tanaka, T', 'Suzuki, H', 'Ishii, K', 'Kameyoshi, Y', 'Hide, M']","['Tanaka A', 'Tanaka T', 'Suzuki H', 'Ishii K', 'Kameyoshi Y', 'Hide M']","['Department of Dermatology, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Exp Dermatol,Experimental dermatology,9301549,"['0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Basophils/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Dermatitis, Atopic/*immunology/physiopathology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Histamine Release', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, IgE/physiology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sweat/*immunology', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/metabolism']",2006/03/04 09:00,2006/07/20 09:00,['2006/03/04 09:00'],"['2006/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['EXD404 [pii]', '10.1111/j.0906-6705.2006.00404.x [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Dermatol. 2006 Apr;15(4):283-90. doi: 10.1111/j.0906-6705.2006.00404.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although IgV intraclonal variation was detected at all time points, its level decreased with time and a parallel emergence of two more represented V(H)DJ(H) clones was observed. They differed by nine nucleotide substitutions one of which only caused a conservative replacement aminoacid change. In addition, one V(L)J(L) rearrangement became more represented over time.

Electrochemical micropumps were integrated in the cartridge to provide pumping of liquid solutions. A micromixing technique based on gas bubbling generated by electrochemical micropumps was developed. Low-cost check valves were implemented in the cartridge to prevent cross-talk of the stored reagents.

Several protocols for extracting and handling membrane proteins for shotgun proteomics experiments have been reported, but few direct comparisons of different protocols have been reported. We compare four methods for preparing membrane proteins from human cells, using acid labile surfactants (ALS), urea, and mixed organic-aqueous solvents. These methods were compared with respect to their efficiency of protein solubilization and proteolysis, peptide and protein recovery, membrane protein enrichment, and peptide coverage of transmembrane proteins. Overall, approximately 50-60% of proteins recovered were membrane-associated, identified from Gene Ontology annotations and transmembrane prediction software. Samples extracted with ALS, extracted with urea followed by dilution, or extracted with urea followed by desalting yielded comparable peptide recoveries and sequence coverage of transmembrane proteins. In contrast, suboptimal proteolysis was observed with organic solvent. Urea extraction followed by desalting may be a particularly useful approach, as it is less costly than ALS and yields satisfactory protein denaturation and proteolysis under conditions that minimize reactivity with urea-derived cyanate. Spectral counting was used to compare datasets of proteins from membrane samples with those of soluble proteins from K562 cells, and to estimate fold differences in protein abundances. Proteins most highly abundant in the membrane samples showed enrichment of integral membrane protein identifications, consistent with their isolation by differential centrifugation.","['Ruth, Mariah C', 'Old, William M', 'Emrick, Michelle A', 'Meyer-Arendt, Karen', 'Aveline-Wolf, Lauren D', 'Pierce, Kevin G', 'Mendoza, Alex M', 'Sevinsky, Joel R', 'Hamady, Micah', 'Knight, Robin D', 'Resing, Katheryn A', 'Ahn, Natalie G']","['Ruth MC', 'Old WM', 'Emrick MA', 'Meyer-Arendt K', 'Aveline-Wolf LD', 'Pierce KG', 'Mendoza AM', 'Sevinsky JR', 'Hamady M', 'Knight RD', 'Resing KA', 'Ahn NG']","['Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510, USA']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,"['0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Extracts/*analysis', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*chemistry', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",2006/03/04 09:00,2007/03/09 09:00,['2006/03/04 09:00'],"['2006/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/pr050313z [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2006 Mar;5(3):709-19. doi: 10.1021/pr050313z.,,,,,"['T32 GM008759/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA87648/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM142607/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM48521/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA47883/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM065103/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Basal cell markers, such as the 34betaE12 antibody and antibodies directed against cytokeratin 5 and 6 or p63, are very useful for demonstration of basal cells as their presence argues against a diagnosis of invasive prostatic carcinoma (PC). However, several benign mimickers of PC, including atrophy, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), nephrogenic adenoma, and mesonephric hyperplasia, can stain negatively with these markers, and thus, a negative basal cell marker immunostain alone does not exclude a diagnosis of benignancy. Although there are examples in the literature of high grade PC that stain focally with some of the basal cell markers, these cases are usually readily diagnosed based on H&E appearances and are unlikely to be confused with these benign mimickers. Alpha-methylacyl-coenzyme-A racemase (AMACR) is a sensitive marker of PC (except for a few uncommon variants: atrophic, foamy gland, and pseudohyperplastic variants), and its detection by immunohistochemical staining in atypical prostatic lesions can be very useful in confirming an impression of adenocarcinoma. AMACR expression can also be identified in high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), prostatic atrophy, AAH, and benign prostatic glands, and accordingly, a diagnosis of PC should not be based solely on a positive AMACR immunostain, especially when the luminal staining is weak and/or noncircumferential. The use of AMACR/basal cell antibody cocktails has been found to greatly facilitate the distinction between PC and its benign mimickers, especially when only limited tissue is available for staining. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) and prostate specific acid phosphatase (PSAP) are both quite sensitive and fairly specific markers of PC (there are a few nonprostatic tumors that can express one or both), and are both very helpful in establishing or confirming the diagnosis of PC when the differential diagnosis includes other tumors that can involve the prostate such as urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma. 34betaE12, p63, thrombomodulin, and uroplakin III are additional urothelial associated markers useful in this differential diagnosis. CDX2 and villin are useful markers to diagnostically separate colonic adenocarcinoma from PC. AMACR positivity and negative basal cell marker reactions are useful to confirm the presence of residual PC after hormonal or radiation therapy. Pan-cytokeratin, PSA, and PSAP can also highlight subtle infiltrates of PC with hormonal or radiation therapy effect. PSA and PSAP immunohistochemical stains are valuable in confirming metastatic carcinoma as being of prostatic origin and should always be utilized in the diagnostic evaluation of metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary origin in males.","['Hameed, Omar', 'Humphrey, Peter A']","['Hameed O', 'Humphrey PA']","['Lauren V Ackerman Laboratory of Surgical Pathology, Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University Medical Center, St Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Diagn Pathol,Seminars in diagnostic pathology,8502262,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Carcinoma/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/diagnosis/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', '*Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology/therapy', 'Sarcoma/diagnosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/diagnosis']",2006/03/04 09:00,2006/04/01 09:00,['2006/03/04 09:00'],"['2006/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0740-2570(05)00055-9 [pii]', '10.1053/j.semdp.2005.11.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Diagn Pathol. 2005 Feb;22(1):88-104. doi: 10.1053/j.semdp.2005.11.001.,,,,,,,192,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the flow cytometric staining patterns of 3 commercial monoclonal antibodies for monocytes and granulocytes in clinically healthy dogs and in dogs with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Mouse antihuman macrophage antibody (MAC387), mouse anti-human myeloperoxidase (MPO), and a canine neutrophil-specific antibody (NSA) were evaluated using flow cytometry on blood from 6 clinically healthy control dogs, and on blood (n = 7) and/or bone marrow (n = 2) from 8 dogs with AML. A diagnosis of acute leukemia was confirmed by >30% blasts in bone marrow or >30% blasts in peripheral blood, together with bi- or pancytopenia, circulating CD34-positive blast cells, and clinical signs of disease. Leukemic samples also were evaluated using a wide panel of monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: MAC387 stained neutrophils and monocytes from control dogs, although the staining profiles for the 2 cell types differed. MPO and NSA resulted in strong positive staining of neutrophils; MPO also stained monocytes weakly. Lymphocytes did not stain with any of the antibodies. One case was classified as AML of granulocytic lineage (AML-M1), 6 cases were classified as acute monocytic leukemia (AML-M5), and 1 case was classified as acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AML-M4). Neoplastic myeloblasts in the dog with granulocytic AML were positive for MPO, NSA, MAC387, and CD4. All monoblasts from the dogs with AML-M5 were positive for CD14, 5 of 6 were positive for MAC387, and 2 were positive for MPO. NSA staining was negative in the 2 dogs with AML-M5 in which it was evaluated. In the dog with AML-M4 variable percentages of blast cells were positive for CD14, MPO, MAC387, CD4, and NSA. CONCLUSIONS: Antigens identified by antibodies to MAC387, MPO, and NSA were expressed not just by normal mature neutrophils and monocytes, but also by neoplastic myeloblasts and monoblasts.

However, the paucity of specific antibodies for myeloid cells and B lymphocytes and of labeled antibodies for multicolor techniques limits the ability to detect all leukocyte subpopulations. This is especially true for neoplastic and precursor cells. CD18 and CD45 are expressed on all leukocytes and are involved in cell activation, and together could be useful in helping determine cell lineage. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to double label canine blood for CD18 and CD45 and to use the differential expression of antigens to identify leukocyte populations in dogs with non-neoplastic and neoplastic hematologic diseases. METHODS: A template was developed using blood samples from 10 clinically healthy dogs and a back-gating technique. Differential leukocyte counts obtained with the template were compared with those obtained by manual and automated methods on blood samples from 17 additional healthy dogs. Blood samples obtained from 9 dogs with non-neoplastic (reactive) hematologic diseases and 27 dogs with hemic neoplasia were double stained for CD18 and CD45 using mouse anticanine CD18 monoclonal antibody (mAb) plus phycoerythrin-conjugated rat anticanine CD45 mAb and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit antimouse IgG. Hemic neoplasms were diagnosed by cell morphology, and immunophenotypic and cytochemical markers. RESULTS: With the double label, neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and T- and B-lymphocytes were identified. In reactive disorders, a population of activated neutrophils with high CD45 and CD18 expression was detected. In hemic neoplasia, cell lineage was easily determined, even in acute leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Double labeling for CD18/CD45 may be useful as a screening method to evaluate hematologic diseases and help determine cell lineage, and to aid in the selection of a panel of antibodies that would be useful for further analysis.","['Comazzi, Stefano', 'Gelain, M Elena', 'Spagnolo, Valentina', 'Riondato, Fulvio', 'Guglielmino, Roberta', 'Sartorelli, Paola']","['Comazzi S', 'Gelain ME', 'Spagnolo V', 'Riondato F', 'Guglielmino R', 'Sartorelli P']","['Department of Veterinary Pathology, Hygiene and Health, University of Milan, Italy. stefano.comazzi@unimi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Vet Clin Pathol,Veterinary clinical pathology,9880575,"['0 (CD18 Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD18 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Dog Diseases/*blood/*diagnosis', 'Dogs', 'Flow Cytometry/*veterinary', 'Hematologic Diseases/blood/diagnosis/*veterinary', 'Leukemia/blood/diagnosis/*veterinary', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes', 'Staining and Labeling']",2006/03/03 09:00,2006/05/06 09:00,['2006/03/03 09:00'],"['2006/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1939-165x.2006.tb00088.x [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Clin Pathol. 2006 Mar;35(1):47-54. doi: 10.1111/j.1939-165x.2006.tb00088.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present data of the molecular characterization of 414 samples obtained from 272 pediatric and 142 adult leukemia patients. The precise localization of genomic breakpoints within the MLL gene and the involved translocation partner genes (TPGs) was determined and several new TPGs were identified. The combined data of our study and published data revealed a total of 87 different MLL rearrangements of which 51 TPGs are now characterized at the molecular level. Interestingly, the four most frequently found TPGs (AF4, AF9, ENL and AF10) encode nuclear proteins that are part of a protein network involved in histone H3K79 methylation.

We characterize hyperdiploid-MM (H-MM) in terms of its clinical and prognostic features in a cohort of 220 H-MM patients entered into clinical trials. Hyperdiploid-myeloma is associated with male sex, kappa immunoglobulin subtype, symptomatic bone disease and better survival compared to nonhyperdiploid-MM (median overall survival 48 vs 35 months, log-rank P = 0.023), despite similar response to treatment. Among 108 H-MM cases with FISH studies for common genetic abnormalities, survival is negatively affected by the existence of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) translocations, especially those involving unknown partners, while the presence of chromosome 13 deletion by FISH did not significantly affect survival (median overall survival 50 vs 47 months, log-rank P = 0.47). Hyperdiploid-myeloma is therefore a unique genetic subtype of MM associated with improved outcome with distinct clinical features. The existence of IgH translocations but not chromosome 13 deletion by FISH negatively impacts survival and may allow further risk stratification of this population of MM patients.","['Chng, W J', 'Santana-Davila, R', 'Van Wier, S A', 'Ahmann, G J', 'Jalal, S M', 'Bergsagel, P L', 'Chesi, M', 'Trendle, M C', 'Jacobus, S', 'Blood, E', 'Oken, M M', 'Henderson, K', 'Kyle, R A', 'Gertz, M A', 'Lacy, M Q', 'Dispenzieri, A', 'Greipp, P R', 'Fonseca, R']","['Chng WJ', 'Santana-Davila R', 'Van Wier SA', 'Ahmann GJ', 'Jalal SM', 'Bergsagel PL', 'Chesi M', 'Trendle MC', 'Jacobus S', 'Blood E', 'Oken MM', 'Henderson K', 'Kyle RA', 'Gertz MA', 'Lacy MQ', 'Dispenzieri A', 'Greipp PR', 'Fonseca R']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Mayo Clinic Scottsdale, AZ 85259, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genes, p53/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*genetics', '*Polyploidy', 'Prognosis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/03/03 09:00,2006/09/13 09:00,['2006/03/03 09:00'],"['2006/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404172 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404172 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 May;20(5):807-13. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404172.,,,,,"['CA21115-25C/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA62242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100707-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA83724-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BLES03 shows no detectable sequence similarity to any functionally characterized proteins using state-of-the-art sequence-comparison tools. The structure of BLES03 adopts a fold similar to that of eukaryotic transcription initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), a protein involved in the recognition of the cap structure of eukaryotic mRNA. In addition to fold similarity, the electrostatic surface potentials of BLES03 and eIF4E show a clear conservation of basic and acidic patches. In the crystal lattice, the acidic amino-terminal helices of BLES03 monomers are bound within the basic cavity of symmetry-related monomers in a manner analogous to the binding of mRNA by eIF4E. Interestingly, the gene locus encoding BLES03 is located between genes encoding the proteins DRAP1 and FOSL1, both of which are involved in transcription initiation.

We show here that beta-cat and APC have opposing actions at Wnt target genes in vivo. The beta-cat C-terminal activation domain associates with TRRAP/TIP60 and mixed-lineage-leukemia (MLL1/MLL2) SET1-type chromatin-modifying complexes in vitro, and we show that beta-cat promotes H3K4 trimethylation at the c-Myc gene in vivo. H3K4 trimethylation in vivo requires prior ubiquitination of H2B, and we find that ubiquitin is necessary for transcription initiation on chromatin but not nonchromatin templates in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that beta-cat recruits Pygopus, Bcl-9/Legless, and MLL/SET1-type complexes to the c-Myc enhancer together with the negative Wnt regulators, APC, and betaTrCP. Interestingly, APC-mediated repression of c-Myc transcription in HT29-APC colorectal cancer cells is initiated by the transient binding of APC, betaTrCP, and the CtBP corepressor to the c-Myc enhancer, followed by stable binding of the TLE-1 and HDAC1 corepressors. Moreover, nuclear CtBP physically associates with full-length APC, but not with mutant SW480 or HT29 APC proteins. We conclude that, in addition to regulating the stability of beta-cat, APC facilitates CtBP-mediated repression of Wnt target genes in normal, but not in colorectal cancer cells.","['Sierra, Jose', 'Yoshida, Tomonori', 'Joazeiro, Claudio A', 'Jones, Katherine A']","['Sierra J', 'Yoshida T', 'Joazeiro CA', 'Jones KA']","['Regulatory Biology Laboratory, The Salk Insitute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'HT29 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Wnt Proteins/*genetics', 'beta Catenin/chemistry/*metabolism']",2006/03/03 09:00,2006/03/28 09:00,['2006/03/03 09:00'],"['2006/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['20/5/586 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.1385806 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2006 Mar 1;20(5):586-600. doi: 10.1101/gad.1385806.,,,,,"['P01 CA054418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM067127/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM067127-03/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA054418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1410807,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It plays a critical role in neoplastic transformation. In fact, blockage of HMGA1 synthesis prevents rat thyroid cell transformation by murine transforming retroviruses, and an adenovirus carrying the HMGA1 gene in the antisense orientation induces apoptotic cell death in anaplastic human thyroid carcinoma cell lines, but not in normal thyroid cells. Moreover, both in vitro and in vivo studies have established the oncogenic role of the HMGA1 gene. In this study, to define HMGA1 function in vivo, we examined the consequences of disrupting the Hmga1 gene in mice. Both heterozygous and homozygous mice for the Hmga1-null allele show cardiac hypertrophy due to the direct role of HMGA1 on cardiomyocytic cell growth regulation. These mice also developed hematologic malignancies, including B cell lymphoma and myeloid granuloerythroblastic leukemia. The B cell expansion and the increased expression of the RAG1/2 endonuclease, observed in HMGA1-knockout spleen tissues, might be responsible for the high rate of abnormal IgH rearrangements observed in these neoplasias. Therefore, the data reported here indicate the critical role of HMGA1 in heart development and growth, and reveal an unsuspected antioncogenic potential for this gene in hematologic malignancies.","['Fedele, Monica', 'Fidanza, Vincenzo', 'Battista, Sabrina', 'Pentimalli, Francesca', 'Klein-Szanto, Andres J P', 'Visone, Rosa', 'De Martino, Ivana', 'Curcio, Antonio', 'Morisco, Carmine', 'Del Vecchio, Luigi', 'Baldassarre, Gustavo', 'Arra, Claudio', 'Viglietto, Giuseppe', 'Indolfi, Ciro', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Fusco, Alfredo']","['Fedele M', 'Fidanza V', 'Battista S', 'Pentimalli F', 'Klein-Szanto AJ', 'Visone R', 'De Martino I', 'Curcio A', 'Morisco C', 'Del Vecchio L', 'Baldassarre G', 'Arra C', 'Viglietto G', 'Indolfi C', 'Croce CM', 'Fusco A']","['Istituto di Endocrinologia ed Oncologia Sperimentale del Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche c/o Dipartimento di Biologia e Patologia Cellulare e Molecolare, Universita di Napoli Federico II, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Rag2 protein, mouse)', '124544-67-8 (HMGA1a Protein)', '128559-51-3 (RAG-1 protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Cardiomegaly/*genetics/immunology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HMGA1a Protein/deficiency/*genetics/immunology', 'Haploidy', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",2006/03/03 09:00,2006/04/19 09:00,['2006/03/03 09:00'],"['2006/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/5/2536 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1889 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Mar 1;66(5):2536-43. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1889.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cancer Res. 2018 Dec 15;78(24):6908.

Given the interaction between human zyxin and p130CAS, these results suggest that zyxin indirectly enables the interaction of ZNF384 with p130CAS which is described in rat.","['Janssen, Hilde', 'Marynen, Peter']","['Janssen H', 'Marynen P']","['Human Genome Laboratory, Department of Human Genetics, University of Leuven, Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology (VIB), VIB4, Campus Gasthuisberg O&N 06, Herestraat 49 Box 602, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (BCAR1 protein, human)', '0 (Crk-Associated Substrate Protein)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (PCBP1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (TAF15 protein, human)', '0 (TATA-Binding Protein Associated Factors)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Vimentin)', '0 (ZNF384 protein, human)', '0 (ZYX protein, human)', '0 (Zyxin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Crk-Associated Substrate Protein/*metabolism', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'TATA-Binding Protein Associated Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Vimentin/metabolism', 'Zyxin']",2006/03/03 09:00,2006/05/17 09:00,['2006/03/03 09:00'],"['2005/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/24 00:00 [revised]', '2006/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(06)00042-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2006.02.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2006 Apr 15;312(7):1194-204. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2006.02.001.

In analogy with gene expression profiling, we have recently proposed a novel method to identify the immunophenotypic signature of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia subsets with different prognosis, named surface-antigen expression profiling. According to this approach, surface marker expression data can be analysed by data mining tools identical to those employed in gene expression profiling studies, including unsupervised and supervised algorithms, with the aim of identifying the immunophenotypic signature of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia subsets with different prognosis. Here we provide an overview of the overall strategy employed for the development of such an ""outcome class-predictor"" based on surface-antigen expression signatures. In addition, we will also discuss how to transfer the obtained information into the routine clinical practice by providing a flow-chart indicating how to select the most relevant antigens and build-up a prognostic scoring system by weighing each antigen according to its predictive power. Although referred to B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the methodology discussed here can be also useful in the study of diseases other than B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, when the purpose is to identify novel prognostic determinants.","['Zucchetto, Antonella', 'Sonego, Paolo', 'Degan, Massimo', 'Bomben, Riccardo', 'Dal Bo, Michele', 'Bulian, Pietro', 'Benedetti, Dania', 'Rupolo, Maurizio', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Campanini, Renato', 'Gattei, Valter']","['Zucchetto A', 'Sonego P', 'Degan M', 'Bomben R', 'Dal Bo M', 'Bulian P', 'Benedetti D', 'Rupolo M', 'Del Poeta G', 'Campanini R', 'Gattei V']","['Clinical and Experimental Hematology Research Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy. antonellazucchetto@libero.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,,,,2006/03/03 09:00,2006/03/03 09:01,['2006/03/03 09:00'],"['2005/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:01 [medline]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['1479-5876-4-11 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-4-11 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2006 Mar 1;4:11. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-4-11.,20060301,,,,,PMC1457000,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To overcome drug resistance, we synthesized a novel class of disaccharide analogues of DNR against drug-resistant leukemia. In these disaccharide analogues (1-6) the first (inner) sugar in the carbohydrate chain is a 3-azido-2,3,6-trideoxy-L-lyxo-alpha-hexopyranose; the second (outer) sugars that are linked via alpha(1-->4) to the first sugar are a series of uncommon sugars. Their cytotoxicities were examined in drug-sensitive leukemia cells K562 and doxorubicin-resistant K562/Dox cells by MTS assay. In drug-sensitive cells, compounds 1-6 were found to be active against leukemia K562 cells with IC50 in the nanomolar range (200-1100 nM), while compounds 2-5 with 2,6-dideoxy sugars showed better activity than compounds 1 and 6 with 2,3,6-trideoxy sugars. In doxorubicin-resistant K562/Dox cells, compounds 1, 3, and 5 exhibited much better activities (with IC50 between 0.29 and 2.0 microM) than DNR (with IC50 > 5 microM). Compound 3 emerged as the most active compound, showing at least 17-fold higher activity against drug-resistant cells than parent compound DNR. The IC50 values of compound 3 in both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells are identical, which indicates that compound 3 completely overcomes drug resistance. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies showed that the substitution and orientation of the 3-OH group in the second sugar significantly influence its activity against drug-resistant leukemia. These results suggest that sugar modifications of anthracyclines change their activity and overcome drug resistance.","['Zhang, Guisheng', 'Fang, Lanyan', 'Zhu, Lizhi', 'Zhong, Yanqiang', 'Wang, Peng George', 'Sun, Duxin']","['Zhang G', 'Fang L', 'Zhu L', 'Zhong Y', 'Wang PG', 'Sun D']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Azides)', '0 (Disaccharides)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Azides/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Disaccharides/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute']",2006/03/03 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/03/03 09:00'],"['2006/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm050916m [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2006 Mar 9;49(5):1792-9. doi: 10.1021/jm050916m.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New studies have shown, however, that earlier analyses of this gene have had technical limitations and also that the genetic behavior of mutant PMS2 alleles is unusual, in that, unlike MLH1 or MSH2 mutations, PMS2 mutations show low heterozygote penetrance. As a result, a dominantly inherited cancer predisposition has not been a feature reported in families with PMS2 mutations. Such families have instead been ascertained through childhood-onset cancers in homozygotes or through apparently sporadic colorectal cancer in heterozygotes. We present further information on the phenotype associated with homozygous PMS2 deficiency in 13 patients from six families of Pakistani origin living in the United Kingdom. This syndrome is characterized by cafe-au-lait skin pigmentation and a characteristic tumor spectrum, including leukemias, lymphomas, cerebral malignancies (such as supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors, astrocytomas, and glioblastomas), and colorectal neoplasia with an onset in early adult life. We present evidence for a founder effect in five families, all of which carried the same R802-->X mutation (i.e., arginine-802 to stop) in PMS2.

Here we used a system of conditional transformation by an inducible mixed lineage leukemia-eleven-nineteen leukemia (MLL-ENL) oncoprotein to overexpress Hoxa9 and Meis1 in primary hematopoietic cells. Arrays identified c-Myb and a c-Myb target (Gstm1) among the genes with the strongest response to Hoxa9/Meis1. c-Myb overexpression was verified by Northern blot and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Also MLL-ENL activated c-Myb through up-regulation of Hoxa9 and Meis1. Consequently, short-term suppression of c-Myb by small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) efficiently inhibited transformation by MLL-ENL but did not impair transformation by transcription factor E2A-hepatic leukemia factor (E2A-HLF). The anti c-Myb siRNA effect was abrogated by coexpression of a c-Myb derivative with a mutated siRNA target site. The introduction of a dominant-negative c-Myb mutant had a similar but weaker effect on MLL-ENL-mediated transformation. Hematopoietic precursors from mice homozygous for a hypo-morphic c-Myb allele were more severely affected and could be transformed neither by MLL-ENL nor by E2A-HLF. Ectopic expression of c-Myb induced a differentiation block but c-Myb alone was not transforming in a replating assay similar to Hoxa9/Meis1. These results suggest that c-Myb is essential but not sufficient for Hoxa9/Meis1 mediated transformation.","['Hess, Jay L', 'Bittner, Claudia B', 'Zeisig, Deniz T', 'Bach, Christian', 'Fuchs, Uta', 'Borkhardt, Arndt', 'Frampton, Jon', 'Slany, Robert K']","['Hess JL', 'Bittner CB', 'Zeisig DT', 'Bach C', 'Fuchs U', 'Borkhardt A', 'Frampton J', 'Slany RK']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Up-Regulation']",2006/03/02 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2006/03/02 09:00'],"['2006/03/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)64950-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-12-5014 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jul 1;108(1):297-304. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-12-5014.

The treatment lasted until natural death, at which time all deceased animals underwent complete necropsy. Histopathologic evaluation of all pathologic lesions and of all organs and tissues collected was routinely performed on each animal of all experimental groups. The results of the study show for the first time that APM, in our experimental conditions, causes a) an increased incidence of malignant-tumor-bearing animals with a positive significant trend in males (p < or = 0.05) and in females (p < or = 0.01), in particular those females treated at 50,000 ppm (p < or = 0.01); b) an increase in lymphomas and leukemias with a positive significant trend in both males (p < or = 0.05) and females (p < or = 0.01), in particular in females treated at doses of 100,000 (p < or = 0.01), 50,000 (p < or = 0.01), 10,000 (p < or = 0.05), 2,000 (p < or = 0.05), or 400 ppm (p < or = 0.01); c) a statistically significant increased incidence, with a positive significant trend (p < or = 0.01), of transitional cell carcinomas of the renal pelvis and ureter and their precursors (dysplasias) in females treated at 100,000 (p < or = 0.01), 50,000 (p < or = 0.01), 10,000 (p < or = 0.01), 2,000 (p < or = 0.05), or 400 ppm (p < or = 0.05); and d) an increased incidence of malignant schwannomas of peripheral nerves with a positive trend (p < or = 0.05) in males.

METHODS: HL-60 cells were stimulated with 4x10(-6) mol/L CPT. Apoptosis and necrosis of HL-60 cells were detected by annexin V-FITC/PI staining. Mitochondrial mass and membrane potential (deltapsi(m)) were measured by NAO and DiOC(6)(3) stanings, respectively. RESULTS: After 12 hour treatment with 4x10(-6) mol/L CPT, the early apoptotic rate of HL-60 cells was significantly increased compared with the control group (12.75+/-4.61)% vs (2.88+/-2.49)%,(P<0.01), and the necrotic rate was significantly elevated too, (3.48+/-1.67)% and (0.71+/-1.10)%, (P<0.01). The result of PI staining showed that the apoptotic rate of HL-60 cells at late phase (12 h) in CPT group was (3.52+/-1.07)%, whereas that in control group was (0.46+/-1.06)%. At the same time, we observed that the cells in G(2)/M phase were arrested. The percentage of cells in G(2)/M phase in CPT group and the control was (13.45+/-1.91)% and (22.46+/-2.19)% (P<0.01) respectively. The percentage of cells with low mitochondrial mass in CPT and control groups was (25.74+/-2.09)% and (4.53+/-1.26)%, respectively (P<0.01). Mitochondrial membrane potential in CPT group and control group was (17.71+/-5.23)% and (1.64+/-2.00)%, respectively.

DESIGN: Prospective study. ANIMALS: Thirty-two 9-week-old domestic shorthair cats. PROCEDURE: Cats received 2 doses of the FeLV-k vaccine SC, 21 days apart (n = 11); 1 dose of the FeLV-k vaccine SC and, 21 days later, 1 dose of the rCP-FeLV vaccine transdermally (11); or 2 doses of physiologic saline (0.9% NaCl) solution (control; 10). Four weeks after the second vaccine dose, all cats were challenged with FeLV by means of oronasal administration.

Direct sequencing of products obtained from RT-PCR, performed on total RNA isolated from the parental and 5-fluoro-dUrd-resistant cells, proved both nucleotide sequences to be identical to the mouse thymidylate synthase coding sequence published earlier (NCBI protein database access no. NP_067263). This suggests that the altered properties of TSr are caused by a factor different than protein mutation, presumably posttranslational modification. As a possibility of rat thymidylate synthase phosphorylation has been recently demonstrated (Samsonoff et al. (1997) J Biol Chem 272: 13281), the mouse enzyme amino-acid sequence was analysed, revealing several potential phosphorylation sites. In order to test possible influence of the protein phosphorylation state on enzymatic properties, endogenous TSp and TSr were purified in the presence of inhibitors of phosphatases.

We therefore examined whether and how these lipoproteins affected interleukin (IL)-1beta release and mRNA expression for IL-1beta and IL-18 in THP-1 cells, a human monocyte cell line. Chylomicron remnants increased IL-1beta release into the conditioned medium by THP-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. At concentrations up to 1 microg/ml, chylomicron remnants increased IL-1beta release by 4-fold compared with the control. Neither native LDL nor oxidized LDL (OxLDL) significantly increased IL-1beta release. Chylomicron remnants increased IL-1beta mRNA expression by 3 times. Native LDL or OxLDL did not increase IL-1beta mRNA, while neither these lipoproteins nor chylomicron remnants increased IL-18 mRNA. Chylomicron remnants also increased the activities of caspase-1 and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB significantly, while native LDL or OxLDL did not.

METHODS: A selected panel of immunohistochemical markers against mast cell and basophil related antigens, including CD25, CD34, CD117/Kit, and the 2D7 antigen (which is found only in basophilic granulocytes) on a total of 410 routinely processed bone marrow biopsy specimens (including 88 cases of systemic mastocytosis (SM), 20 cases of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), 92 cases of myeloid neoplasms other than CML, and 210 controls with normal/reactive bone marrows). RESULTS: In total, 17 cases with TROCI-BM could be identified: 11 SM (including two cases of well-differentiated SM and two mast cell leukaemias; MCL), 2 myelomastocytic leukaemia (MML), 2 CML with excess of basophils (secondary basophilic leukaemia (CMLba)), and 2 tryptase positive acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Regarding the cell types involved, TROCI-BM cells were found to express CD117/Kit in all cases of SM and MCL. In MML and tryptase postitive AML, TROCI-BM cells were found to coexpress CD34 and Kit. The basophil specific antigen 2D7 was only detected in CD34/Kit negative TROCI-BM cells in two patients with CMLba. The activating point mutation D816V was detected in 8/11 patients with SM but not in any of the other haematological malignancies.

This report contributes to the differential diagnosis of ISM by demonstrating that such lymphocytic aggregates may be neoplastic. METHODS: Biopsy specimens (bone marrow and gastrointestinal mucosa) of a 69 year old woman with mild blood lymphocytosis and a history of urticaria pigmentosa-like skin lesions that had disappeared a few years earlier, were investigated immunohistochemically using antibodies against CD3, CD5, CD20, CD23, CD25, CD34, CD117, chymase, and tryptase. Rearrangements of the IgH and TCRy genes were studied by seminested PCR. Mutation analysis of c-kit was performed by melting point analysis of nested PCR using amplified DNA from pooled microdissected single cells (MC and B cells) of both sites. RESULTS: The histomorphological features of the bone marrow corresponded to that of ISM with multifocal accumulations of MC surrounded by clusters of lymphocytes of mature appearance. However, these lymphocytes revealed an aberrant immunophenotype with coexpression of CD5, CD20, and CD23, thus enabling the final diagnosis of SM with an associated clonal haematological non-MC lineage disease, in particular SM with associated B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (SM-CLL). Monoclonality for both ISM and B-CLL could be confirmed by demonstrating the typical activating c-kit point mutation D816V in bone marrow MC, and a monoclonal IgH rearrangement in bone marrow B cells. CONCLUSIONS: Usually, focal accumulations of lymphocytes around MC infiltrates in the bone marrow of patients with SM are reactive in nature (lymphocytosis). However, a low grade malignant lymphoma should also be included in the differential diagnosis. We describe here the first case, to our knowledge, with synchronous diagnosis of SM and associated B-CLL. This diagnosis could only be established by application of appropriate immunohistochemical and molecular techniques, as the bone marrow histology on first investigation resembled that of typical ISM.","['Horny, H-P', 'Sotlar, K', 'Stellmacher, F', 'Valent, P', 'Grabbe, J']","['Horny HP', 'Sotlar K', 'Stellmacher F', 'Valent P', 'Grabbe J']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Lubeck, Germany. horny@patho.mu-luebeck.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD20/analysis', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'CD5 Antigens/analysis', 'Duodenum', 'Female', 'Gastric Mucosa/pathology', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Intestinal Mucosa/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*complications/pathology', 'Point Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Receptors, IgE/analysis']",2006/03/01 09:00,2006/05/26 09:00,['2006/03/01 09:00'],"['2006/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['59/3/264 [pii]', '10.1136/jcp.2005.026989 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2006 Mar;59(3):264-8. doi: 10.1136/jcp.2005.026989.,,,,,,PMC1860346,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Toxicity was assessed in healthy mice following single (1,150, 1,650, or 1,850 mg/kg/d) or multiple doses (250 or 270 mg/kg/d). Efficacy was tested in mice with P388 leukemia receiving multiple doses (225 or 250 mg/kg/d). SDX-102 was administered at six circadian times 4 hours apart in mice synchronized with 12 hours of light alternating with 12 hours of darkness. MTAP expression was determined in liver, bone marrow, small intestinal mucosa, and P388 cells. Dosing at 19 hours after light onset reduced lethality 5-fold after single administration and 3-fold after multiple doses as compared with worst time [P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively (chi2 test)]. Neutropenia, lymphopenia, and bone marrow hemorrhagic lesions were significantly less in mice dosed at 19 hours after light onset as compared with 7 hours after light onset. SDX-102 at 7 hours after light onset transiently ablated the 24-hour patterns in body temperature and activity. A circadian rhythm characterized small intestinal MTAP expression with a maximum at 6:30 hours after light onset (P = 0.04). A minor survival improvement was found in MTAP-deficient P388 mice receiving SDX-102 at 7 or 23 hours after light onset as compared with other times (P = 0.03, log-rank test). In conclusion, the therapeutic index of SDX-102 was improved by the delivery of SDX-102 in the mid to late activity span.

The goal of the present analysis was to evaluate whether genotype of activating KIRs of the donor may have an impact on the outcome of URD-HCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five URD-HCT recipients with hematological malignancies, mean age 27 years (range, 14-43 years), were included in the analysis. The conditioning regimen was myeloablative and based on chemotherapy alone (n = 20) or total body irradiation (n = 5). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine, methotrexate, and pretransplant antithymocyte globulin. Patients were grouped according to their donors' activating KIR genotype including two loci: KIR2DS1 and KIR2DS2. RESULTS: The presence of KIR2DS1 in the donor (n = 16/25) was not demonstrated to influence outcome. In contrast, the presence of KIR2DS2 (n = 13/25 donors) was associated with decreased probability of overall survival (0% vs 92%, P = .04) and disease-free survival (0% vs 92%, P = .046). The reason for failures in the KIR2DS2-positive group was chronic GVHD (n = 4), acute GVHD (n = 2), and relapse (n = 1). The cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality equaled 90% for the KIR2DS2-positive group and 8% for the KIR2DS2-negative group (P = .09).

Here, we examined the species-specific barrier of HTLV-1 by establishing rat cell lines, including both adherent and CD4(+) T cells, which express human CRM1 at physiological levels. We demonstrated that expression of human CRM1 in rat cells is not harmful to cell growth and is sufficient to restore the synthesis of the viral structural proteins, Gag and Env, at levels similar to those in human cells. Gag precursor proteins were efficiently processed to the mature forms in rat cells and released into the culture medium as sedimentable viral particles. An HTLV-1 pseudovirus infection system suggested that the released virus particles are fully infectious. Our newly developed reporter cell system revealed that Env proteins produced in rat cells are fully fusogenic, which is the basis for cell-cell HTLV-1 infection. Moreover, we show that the early steps in infection, from post-entry uncoating to integration into the host chromosomes, occur efficiently in rat cells. These results, in conjunction with reports describing efficient entry of HTLV-1 into rat cells, may indicate that HTLV-1 is unique in that its major species-specific barrier is determined by CRM1 at a viral RNA export step. These observations will enable us to construct a transgenic rat model expressing human CRM1 that is sensitive to HTLV-1 infection.","['Zhang, Xianfeng', 'Hakata, Yoshiyuki', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Shida, Hisatoshi']","['Zhang X', 'Hakata Y', 'Tanaka Y', 'Shida H']","['Institute for Genetic Medicine, Hokkaido University, Kita-15, Nishi-7, Kita-ku, Sapporo 060-0815, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,Microbes Infect,Microbes and infection,100883508,"['0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/virology', 'Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Karyopherins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/genetics/*metabolism', 'Species Specificity', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Replication/physiology']",2006/03/01 09:00,2006/07/27 09:00,['2006/03/01 09:00'],"['2005/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2005/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1286-4579(05)00377-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.micinf.2005.10.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Microbes Infect. 2006 Mar;8(3):851-9. doi: 10.1016/j.micinf.2005.10.009.

The processing of such data typically leads to lists of differentially-regulated genes. A common terminal data analysis step is to map pathways of potentially interrelated genes. METHODS: We applied a transcriptomics analysis tool to elucidate the underlying pathways of leukocyte maturation at the genomic level in an established cellular model of leukemia by examining time-course data in two subclones of U-937 cells. Leukemias such as Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) are characterized by a block in the hematopoietic stem cell maturation program at a point when expansion of clones which should be destined to mature into terminally-differentiated effector cells get locked into endless proliferation with few cells reaching maturation. Treatment with retinoic acid, depending on the precise genomic abnormality, often releases the responsible promyelocytes from this blockade but clinically can yield adverse sequellae in terms of potentially lethal side effects, referred to as retinoic acid syndrome. RESULTS: Briefly, the list of genes for temporal patterns of expression was pasted into the ABCC GRID Promoter TFSite Comparison Page website tool and the outputs for each pattern were examined for possible coordinated regulation by shared regelems (regulatory elements). We found it informative to use this novel web tool for identifying, on a genomic scale, genes regulated by drug treatment. CONCLUSION: Improvement is needed in understanding the nature of the mutations responsible for controlling the maturation process and how these genes regulate downstream effects if there is to be better targeting of chemical interventions. Expanded implementation of the techniques and results reported here may better direct future efforts to improve treatment for diseases not restricted to APL.","['Patton, G W', 'Stephens, R', 'Sidorov, I A', 'Xiao, X', 'Lempicki, R A', 'Dimitrov, D S', 'Shoemaker, R H', 'Tudor, G']","['Patton GW', 'Stephens R', 'Sidorov IA', 'Xiao X', 'Lempicki RA', 'Dimitrov DS', 'Shoemaker RH', 'Tudor G']","['Screening Technologies Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, NCI-Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702, USA. gpatton@ncifcrf.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,"['0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Databases, Factual', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Regulator', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Internet', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Proteins/chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology/toxicity', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation']",2006/03/01 09:00,2006/05/26 09:00,['2006/03/01 09:00'],"['2005/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2105-7-81 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-7-81 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2006 Feb 17;7:81. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-7-81.,20060217,,,,"['N01-CO-56000/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1395336,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventionally, AML is treated with aggressive cytotoxic therapy, in eligible patients followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. However, despite this aggressive treatment, many patients relapse and eventually die from the disease. Activating mutations in the coding sequence of the receptor tyrosine kinase Flt3 are found in leukaemic blasts from approximately 30% of AML patients. The mutations have been described to severely alter the signalling properties of this receptor and to have transforming activity in cell-line models and in primary mouse bone marrow. The prognosis of patients harbouring the most common Flt3 mutations tends to be worse than that of comparable patients without the mutations. Thus, Flt3 seems a promising target for therapeutic intervention. Several small molecules that inhibit Flt3 kinase activity are being evaluated for the treatment of AML in clinical trials. This review article discusses the signal transduction and biological function of Flt3 and its mutations in normal and malignant haematopoiesis and recent progress in drug development aiming at the inhibition of Flt3 kinases.","['Tickenbrock, Lara', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Serve, Hubert']","['Tickenbrock L', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Berdel WE', 'Serve H']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Interdisciplinary Centre of Clinical Research Munster (IZKF), University of Munster, Domagkstr. 3, 48149 Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs,Expert opinion on emerging drugs,101135662,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '71IA9S35AJ (Semaxinib)', 'DO989GC5D1 (lestaurtinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Carbazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Furans', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2006/03/01 09:00,2006/11/15 09:00,['2006/03/01 09:00'],"['2006/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1517/14728214.11.1.153 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs. 2006 Mar;11(1):153-65. doi: 10.1517/14728214.11.1.153.,,,,,,,112,,,,,,,,,,,,

From previous experience of treating cancer with mitoxantrone, it was expected that cardiotoxic effects and occasional malignancy would develop in some patients treated with this agent. From the earliest trials, reduction of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was seen in 2-3% of cases, and in some this effect may persist and less commonly there can be congestive heart failure and even death. There are also occasional reports of leukaemia developing in MS patients treated with this agent. Mitoxantrone has been shown to reduce relapses, the number of new lesions visualised on magnetic resonance imaging and stop or reduce the progression of the disease in many patients treated. The drug has found a place in MS therapy because in this progressing group of MS patients who are failing on the disease-modifying therapies with interferons or glatiramer acetate, trials have shown that mitoxantrone may arrest or even improve many patients.

The debate is based partly on the inherent uncertainties associated with phylogenetic reconstruction when only short sequences of closely related genotypes are available. However, a full analysis of what phylogenetic information is present in the mummy data has not previously been published, leaving open the question of what precisely is the range of admissible interpretation. To fulfill this need, we re-analyzed the mummy data in a new way. We first performed phylogenetic analysis of 188 published LTR DNA sequences from extant strains belonging to the HTLV-1 Cosmopolitan clade, using the method of statistical parsimony which is designed both to optimize phylogenetic resolution among sequences with little evolutionary divergence, and to permit precise mapping of individual sequence mutations onto branches of a divergence network. We then deduced possible phylogenetic positions for the two main categories of published Chilean mummy sequences, based on their published 157-nucleotide LTR sequences. The possible phylogenetic placements for one of the mummy sequence categories are consistent with a modern origin. However, one of these placements for the other mummy sequence category falls very close to the root of the Cosmopolitan clade, consistent with an ancient origin for both this mummy sequence and the Cosmopolitan clade.","['Coulthart, Michael B', 'Posada, David', 'Crandall, Keith A', 'Dekaban, Gregory A']","['Coulthart MB', 'Posada D', 'Crandall KA', 'Dekaban GA']","['Host Genetics and Prion Diseases Program, National Microbiology Laboratory, Health Canada, Winnipeg, MB, Canada R3E 3R2. mike_coulthart@hc-sc.gc.ca']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Infect Genet Evol,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",101084138,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Asians/history', 'Base Sequence', 'Chile', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Emigration and Immigration/history', 'HTLV-I Infections/genetics/*history/virology', 'History, Ancient', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*chemistry/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mummies/*virology', '*Phylogeny', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences']",2006/03/01 09:00,2006/05/13 09:00,['2006/03/01 09:00'],"['2004/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2005/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2005/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1567-1348(05)00026-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.meegid.2005.02.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Infect Genet Evol. 2006 Mar;6(2):91-6. doi: 10.1016/j.meegid.2005.02.001.

We performed a longitudinal spectratype analysis of 23 TCRBV families in 28 patients who underwent allogeneic T cell-depleted peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Sixteen patients subsequently developed acute GVHD. We recently developed statistical methods that bring increased power and flexibility to spectratype analysis and allow us to analyze TCRBV repertoire development under appropriately complex statistical models. Applying these methods, we found that patients with acute GVHD demonstrated TCRBV repertoire development statistically distinct from that repertoire development in patients without GVHD. Specifically, GVHD patients showed spectratypes indicative of lower diversity and greater deviation from the spectratypes expected in healthy individuals at intermediate times. Most individual TCRBV subfamilies had spectratypes statistically distinguishable between GVHD and non-GVHD patients at 6 months after transplantation. These results suggest that the T-cell receptor repertoire perturbations associated with acute GVHD are widely spread throughout the TCRBV families.","['Liu, Congxiao', 'He, Min', 'Rooney, Barbara', 'Kepler, Thomas B', 'Chao, Nelson J']","['Liu C', 'He M', 'Rooney B', 'Kepler TB', 'Chao NJ']","['The Division of Cellular Therapy, Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia/complications/genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/genetics/*immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/genetics/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/genetics/*immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/complications/genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/*immunology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2006/03/01 09:00,2006/06/23 09:00,['2006/03/01 09:00'],"['2005/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(05)00778-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.09.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2006 Mar;12(3):335-45. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.09.019.,,,,,"['2PO-1CA47741/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 P30 AI051445-03/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '5P-01HL67314/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 AI057157-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A method to deliver a more targeted dose of TBI preferentially to sites of greatest tumor burden is needed to reduce the dose to normal organs, reduce toxicities, and permit dose escalation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate, through a dosimetric analysis, the potential advantages and feasibility of selectively delivering targeted myeloablative doses of radiation to bone and marrow using a recently developed image-guided tomographic intensity-modulated radiation therapy delivery system (helical tomotherapy). Whole-body computed tomography datasets from 3 patients, age 5, 20, and 53 years, were used for treatment planning studies to evaluate 2 targeted TBI strategies: total marrow irradiation (TMI), in which the target region was defined as the skeletal bone, and total marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI), in which the target regions were defined as bone, major lymph node chains, liver, spleen, and sanctuary sites, such as brain. Organ doses and dose distributions were compared with those in conventional TBI. A 1.7- to 7.5-fold reduction in median organ doses was observed with TMI and TMLI compared with conventional TBI. With this more targeted approach, a dose-volume histogram analysis predicted the potential to escalate the dose to bone (and containing marrow) up to 20 Gy, while maintaining doses to normal organs at lower levels than in conventional TBI to 12 Gy. Results were similar for the adult and pediatric patients, indicating that this form of targeted TBI will be applicable to most patients regardless of frame size. TMI to 10 Gy was delivered as part of a tandem transplant regimen to the 53-year-old patient with multiple myeloma. Clinical results confirmed the treatment planning predictions. After TMI, the patient experienced the expected blood count nadir, followed by successful engraftment. Grade 2 nausea and grade 1 emesis occurred only briefly on day 2 of TMI. Skin erythema, oral mucositis, esophagitis, and enteritis were not observed. This report demonstrates the feasibility and potential dosimetric advantages of selectively delivering myeloablative doses of radiation to bone and marrow using an image-guided tomographic intensity-modulated radiation therapy delivery system. Organ doses are substantially lower than those associated with standard TBI and predict the potential to significantly reduce associated toxicities and allow for dose escalation. The results also suggest that this form of targeted TBI may have potential advantages over other forms of targeted TBI, such as radioimmunotherapy or bone-seeking radionuclide therapy. Ongoing clinical trials will define the maximum TMI and TMLI doses achievable and define the potential advantages and limitations of this new approach for patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Wong, Jeffrey Y C', 'Liu, An', 'Schultheiss, Timothy', 'Popplewell, Leslie', 'Stein, Anthony', 'Rosenthal, Joseph', 'Essensten, Mark', 'Forman, Stephen', 'Somlo, George']","['Wong JY', 'Liu A', 'Schultheiss T', 'Popplewell L', 'Stein A', 'Rosenthal J', 'Essensten M', 'Forman S', 'Somlo G']","['Division of Radiation Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center and Beckman Research Institute, Duarte, California 91010, USA. jwong@coh.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*diagnostic imaging', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*diagnostic imaging/*radiotherapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications/*diagnostic imaging/*radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2006/03/01 09:00,2006/06/23 09:00,['2006/03/01 09:00'],"['2005/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(05)00726-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.10.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2006 Mar;12(3):306-15. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.10.026.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the outcomes of 68 adult patients (median age, 37 years) with acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission with initially refractory disease who were treated with matched sibling (n=44) or unrelated donor (n=22) stem cell transplantation or who received transplants from other donors (n=2). Thirty-one patients took 2 courses of chemotherapy to achieve first complete remission, a further 31 took 3 courses, and 6 patients took 4 or 5 courses. Ten patients (15%) had adverse cytogenetics. Patients were mainly conditioned with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (87%). Four patients (6%) did not engraft by day 28; 2 of these engrafted at 47 and 60 days. Grades II to IV and III/IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were seen in 34% and 14% of patients, respectively. Chronic GVHD was seen in 50% of patients. The estimated actuarial disease-free and overall survivals were 34% and 37%, respectively, at 4 years. The performance status of survivors is good; 82% of patients have Karnofsky scores of 90 to 100. On multivariate analysis, overall and disease-free survival were associated with adverse cytogenetics (P=.055 and .023). Approximately one third of patients survived 4 years after allogeneic stem cell transplantation for initially refractory acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission: relapse and treatment-related mortality were the major causes of treatment failure.

In this study, we explored the therapeutic applicability of CRCL in the context of syngeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to treat preexisting leukemia. Our results demonstrate that tumor growth is significantly delayed in mice receiving syngeneic HCT from 12B1 tumor CRCL-immunized donors compared with animals receiving HCT from nonimmunized donors. CRCL immunization after immune HCT further hindered tumor growth when compared with immune HCT without posttransplantation vaccination. The magnitude of the immune response was consistent with the antitumor effects observed in vivo. Rechallenge of surviving mice with 12B1 or A20 cells in opposite groins confirmed that mice had developed long-term tumor-specific immunity against 12B1 tumor cells. In addition, we documented that both T cells and natural killer cells contributed to the antitumor effect of CRCL vaccination, because depletion of either subset hampered tumor growth delay. Thus, our results indicate that CRCL is a promising vaccine capable of generating specific immune responses. This antitumor immunity can be effectively transferred to a host via HCT and further enhanced after HCT with additional tumor CRCL immunizations.","['Chen, Xinchun', 'Zeng, Yi', 'Li, Gang', 'Larmonier, Nicolas', 'Graner, Michael W', 'Katsanis, Emmanuel']","['Chen X', 'Zeng Y', 'Li G', 'Larmonier N', 'Graner MW', 'Katsanis E']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Steele Children's Research Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona 85724-5073, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cancer Vaccines/*administration & dosage/immunology', 'Cell Extracts/*administration & dosage/chemistry/immunology', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Chaperones/*administration & dosage/chemistry/immunology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/therapy', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",2006/03/01 09:00,2006/06/23 09:00,['2006/03/01 09:00'],"['2005/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(06)00038-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2006.01.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2006 Mar;12(3):275-83. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2006.01.001.,,,,,['R01 CA104926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This chapter describes methods for detecting ITD and D835 mutations in the FLT3 gene.","['Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Kiyoi H', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Methods Mol Med,Methods in molecular medicine,101123138,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Point Mutation', 'Sequence Deletion', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2006/03/01 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2006/03/01 09:00'],"['2006/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1385/1-59745-017-0:189 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Med. 2006;125:189-97. doi: 10.1385/1-59745-017-0:189.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The term CEL is used when there is evidence that the disease is of clonal origin. We recently identified the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene in approx 50% of HES/CEL cases. Fusion of FIP1L1 to PDGFRA is the consequence of a deletion on chromosome 4, del(4)(q12q12), with the centromeric breakpoint in FIP1L1 and the telomeric breakpoint in PDGFRA. The breakpoints in FIP1L1 are diverse (introns 7 to 10), but the breakpoints in PDGFRA are always in exon 12 (encoding the juxtamembrane region). Because the chromosomal deletion is only 800 kb in size, it remains undetected with standard cytogenetics. In agreement with this, most patients with HES/CEL present with a normal karyotype. Here we describe three different techniques to detect the presence of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene in peripheral blood or bone marrow cells.","['Cools, Jan', 'Stover, Elizabeth H', 'Gilliland, D Gary']","['Cools J', 'Stover EH', 'Gilliland DG']","['Department of Human Genetics, Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology (VIB), University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Methods Mol Med,Methods in molecular medicine,101123138,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)']",IM,"['Centromere/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Chronic Disease', 'DNA/blood/genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA, Neoplasm/blood/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/blood/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Introns', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'RNA/blood/genetics/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Neoplasm/blood/genetics', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/*genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Telomere/genetics', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/*genetics']",2006/03/01 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2006/03/01 09:00'],"['2006/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1385/1-59745-017-0:177 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Med. 2006;125:177-87. doi: 10.1385/1-59745-017-0:177.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These improvements have been due mainly to the introduction of targeted therapies and improved methods for diagnosing and monitoring this disease. The underlying molecular lesion in APL involves a t(15:17) translocation which leads to the generation of PML-RARalpha fusion transcripts and proteins. The PML-RARalpha fusion transcripts have been shown to be useful markers for establishing the diagnosis and for monitoring the response to treatment. This manuscript describes the application of QZyme reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to the quantification of PML-RARalpha transcripts as a marker of APL. QZyme is a method for real time detection and quantification of target genes or transcripts. The principle of QZyme analysis is similar to other quantitative PCR systems; however, the mechanism is quite different. QZyme exploits the catalytic activity of DNAzymes (deoxyribozymes), which are oligonucleotides that can bind and cleave nucleic acid substrates. The approach is well suited to monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients with APL, as a result of its ability to detect low numbers of transcripts and accurately measure differences in concentration over a broad dynamic range. Further, its capacity for duplex analysis has multiple advantages for analysis of clinical specimens. Protocols for duplex, single-tube QZyme RT-PCR assays, which allow simultaneous quantification of PML-RARalpha fusion transcripts (either L-type and V-type, or S-type) and the internal control BCR transcript, are provided. These protocols can be used for analyzing patient RNA specimens and are suitable for clinical trial monitoring. For this type of work, it is recommended that investigators validate the assays to ensure reproducible, accurate, and specific results on the equipment in their own laboratories. Assay validation is critical for real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RQ-PCR) and is often overlooked. A guide to the steps involved in validation and recommendations for acceptance criteria is included in this chapter.","['Mokany, Elisa', 'Todd, Alison V', 'Fuery, Caroline J', 'Applegate, Tanya L']","['Mokany E', 'Todd AV', 'Fuery CJ', 'Applegate TL']","['Johnson & Johnson Research Pty Limited, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Methods Mol Med,Methods in molecular medicine,101123138,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/methods', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2006/03/01 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2006/03/01 09:00'],"['2006/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1385/1-59745-017-0:127 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Med. 2006;125:127-47. doi: 10.1385/1-59745-017-0:127.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, dual fusion probes that created a fusion signal on the derivative chromosome 9 in addition to the fusion sifnal on the Philadelphia chromosome or derivative chromosome 22 were developed. Using these second-generation probes, it was discovered that a significant proportion of CML cases has a sub-microscopic deletion at the site of the ABL-BCR fusion.

Direct sequencing of the BCR-ABL kinase domain is relatively rapid and allows detection of emerging mutations at a sensitivity of approx 20%. Mutations have been detected over a range of 242 amino acids, which spans the entire kinase domain. For optimal sensitivity, the kinase domain of the abnormal gene should be isolated by reverse-transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using primers that hybridize to the BCR and ABL genes. The quality of the RNA is assessed by real-time quantitative PCR prior to analysis, and BCR-ABL levels are determined. Only RNA of adequate quality is used to ensure accurate and reproducible mutation analysis. Depending on the level of BCR-ABL transcripts, a one- or two-step PCR is required to amplify the kinase domain.

Prognosis of BL and B-ALL has been poor with conventional NHL or ALL regimens, but has improved with dose-intensive regimens. METHODS: To evaluate the addition of rituximab, a CD20 monoclonal antibody, to intensive chemotherapy in adults with BL or B-ALL, 31 patients with newly diagnosed BL or B-ALL received the hyper-fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) regimen with rituximab. Their median age was 46 years; 29% were 60 years or older. Rituximab 375 mg/m(2) was given on Days 1 and 11 of hyper-CVAD courses and on Days 1 and 8 of methotrexate and cytarabine courses. RESULTS: Complete remission (complete response [CR]) was achieved in 24 of 28 (86%) evaluable patients; 3 had a partial response, and 1 had resistant disease. There were no induction deaths. The 3-year overall survival (OS), event-free survival, and disease-free survival rates were 89%, 80%, and 88%, respectively. Nine elderly patients achieved CR with all of them in continuous CR (except 1 death in CR from infection), with a 3-year OS rate of 89%. Multivariate analysis of current and historical (those treated with hyper-CVAD alone) groups identified age and treatment with rituximab as favorable factors. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of rituximab to hyper-CVAD may improve outcome in adult BL or B-ALL, particularly in elderly patients.","['Thomas, Deborah A', 'Faderl, Stefan', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Wierda, William G', 'Pierce, Sherry A', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Brandt, Mark', 'Hagemeister, Fredrick B', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Cabanillas, Fernando', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Thomas DA', 'Faderl S', ""O'Brien S"", 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Cortes J', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Giles FJ', 'Verstovsek S', 'Wierda WG', 'Pierce SA', 'Shan J', 'Brandt M', 'Hagemeister FB', 'Keating MJ', 'Cabanillas F', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, 77230, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'CVAD protocol']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Rituximab', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2006/02/28 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/02/28 09:00'],"['2006/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21776 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2006 Apr 1;106(7):1569-80. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21776.,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2006 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 193 survivors, diagnosed between 1970-1986, who were followed in our center's After Cancer Experience Program and are participants in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. Of these patients, 49% were female and 25% were racial/ethnic minorities. The primary outcome was determination of the cumulative percentage of patients having an abnormal CBC by 2 or 3 standard deviations (SDs). Four components of the CBC were examined and employed to define an abnormal CBC: low white blood cell count (WBC), high mean corpuscular volume (MCV), low platelet count, and low hemoglobin concentration. Association of treatment exposures to abnormal values was assessed with a multilevel logistic model. RESULTS: There were 1297 patient visits during 1401 person-years of follow-up. The mean number of visits per survivor was 6.7 (SD 4.2). The cumulative percentage of subjects with at least one abnormal CBC was 70%. The cumulative percent of subjects with a value abnormal by 2 SD was WBC = 23%, MCV = 37%, platelets = 9%, hemoglobin = 49%. For values abnormal by 3 SD, the frequencies were WBC = 3%, MCV = 20%, platelets = 1%, hemoglobin = 27%. None of the patients developed myelodysplastic syndrome or a secondary leukemia during the follow-up period. Exposure to epipodophyllotoxins was associated with an increased risk of having abnormally high MCV values. CONCLUSIONS: Mildly abnormal CBC values are common in survivors of childhood cancer. Abnormal values are often of questionable significance but seem to persist over time. Epipodophyllotoxin therapy was found to be associated with increased frequency of high MCV levels.","['Long, Zsofia B', 'Oeffinger, Kevin C', 'Brooks, Sandra L', 'Fischbach, Lori', 'Harris, T Robert', 'Eshelman, Debra A', 'Tomlinson, Gail E', 'Buchanan, George R']","['Long ZB', 'Oeffinger KC', 'Brooks SL', 'Fischbach L', 'Harris TR', 'Eshelman DA', 'Tomlinson GE', 'Buchanan GR']","['Department of Family Practice & Community Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*blood', 'Podophyllotoxin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', '*Survivors']",2006/02/28 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/02/28 09:00'],"['2006/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21771 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2006 Apr 1;106(7):1634-40. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21771.,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2006 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our study was to analyse the function of STAT5 proteins in the proliferation and apoptosis of selected cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cell lines (HUT 78; PB-1; HUT 102B), using antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) strategy. RT-PCR and Western blot were applied to analyse the expression of STAT5 after incubation with antisense ODN (AS ODN). The effect of ODN pretreatment on the cell clonogenecity was analysed in methylcellulose cultures. The process of apoptosis was estimated using two different flow cytometry (FACScan) methods: (1) combined Annexin V/propidium iodide staining, (2) the TUNEL method. Perturbation of STAT5 expression reduced the proliferation of the PB-1 cells after a 24-h exposure to antisense ODNs. Prolonged exposure (72 h) decreased the growth of each examined cell line, especially after antisense STAT5A (AS STAT5A) treatment. Incubation with AS STAT5 induced apoptosis in the population of HUT 78 and PB-1 cells. STAT5s may play a significant role in the growth and the process of apoptosis of selected human cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cells.","['Baskiewicz-Masiuk, Magdalena', 'Walczak, Mieczyslaw', 'Grzegrzolka, Ryszard', 'Rogowska, Danuta', 'Machalinski, Boguslaw']","['Baskiewicz-Masiuk M', 'Walczak M', 'Grzegrzolka R', 'Rogowska D', 'Machalinski B']","['Department of General Pathology, Pomeranian Medical University, Al.

We analyzed the expression of c-IAP1, c-IAP2 and XIAP, by immunocytochemistry, in 30 blood samples from B-CLL patients and correlated protein expression to fludarabine-induced apoptosis estimated by an annexin-V assay. Expression of c-IAP1, c-IAP2 and XIAP were found predominantly in the cytoplasm, and a wide range of staining intensities was observed among distinct samples. No correlation was found between the levels of IAPs expression and prognostic factors such as age, gender, lymphocyte doubling time, white blood cell count or previous treatment.

The mechanism by which curcumin inhibit cell proliferation remains poorly understood. In the present report, we investigated the effect of curcumin on the activation of apoptotic pathway in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) malignant cells. Our data demonstrate that curcumin causes dose dependent suppression of proliferation in several T cell lines. Curcumin treatment causes the de-phosphorylation/inactivation of constitutively active AKT, FOXO transcription factor and GSK3. Curcumin also induces release of cytochrome c accompanied by activation of caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. In addition, zVAD-fmk, a universal inhibitor of caspases, prevents caspase-3 activation and abrogates cell death induced by curcumin treatment. Finally, treatment of T-ALL cells with curcumin down-regulated the expression of inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAPs). Taken together, our finding suggest that curcumin suppresses constitutively activated targets of PI3'-kinase (AKT, FOXO and GSK3) in T cells leading to the inhibition of proliferation and induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis.","['Hussain, A R', 'Al-Rasheed, M', 'Manogaran, P S', 'Al-Hussein, K A', 'Platanias, L C', 'Al Kuraya, K', 'Uddin, S']","['Hussain AR', 'Al-Rasheed M', 'Manogaran PS', 'Al-Hussein KA', 'Platanias LC', 'Al Kuraya K', 'Uddin S']","[""King Fahad National Center for Children's Cancer and Research, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Time Factors']",2006/02/28 09:00,2006/06/16 09:00,['2006/02/28 09:00'],"['2006/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-006-3392-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2006 Feb;11(2):245-54. doi: 10.1007/s10495-006-3392-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dying cells show features of apoptosis but it is not clear if the apoptotic response explains tumor cell death. This study examined the contribution of apoptosis to cell death in response to HAMLET. Apoptotic changes like caspase activation, phosphatidyl serine externalization, chromatin condensation were detected in HAMLET-treated tumor cells, but caspase inhibition or Bcl-2 over-expression did not prolong cell survival and the caspase response was Bcl-2 independent. HAMLET translocates to the nuclei and binds directly to chromatin, but the death response was unrelated to the p53 status of the tumor cells. p53 deletions or gain of function mutations did not influence the HAMLET sensitivity of tumor cells. Chromatin condensation was partly caspase dependent, but apoptosis-like marginalization of chromatin was also observed. The results show that tumor cell death in response to HAMLET is independent of caspases, p53 and Bcl-2 even though HAMLET activates an apoptotic response. The use of other cell death pathways allows HAMLET to successfully circumvent fundamental anti-apoptotic strategies that are present in many tumor cells.","['Hallgren, O', 'Gustafsson, L', 'Irjala, H', 'Selivanova, G', 'Orrenius, S', 'Svanborg, C']","['Hallgren O', 'Gustafsson L', 'Irjala H', 'Selivanova G', 'Orrenius S', 'Svanborg C']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Glycobiology, Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9013-90-5 (Lactalbumin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Female', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Lactalbumin/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2006/02/28 09:00,2006/06/16 09:00,['2006/02/28 09:00'],"['2006/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-006-3607-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2006 Feb;11(2):221-33. doi: 10.1007/s10495-006-3607-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One member of the family, PADI4, plays an important role in immune cell differentiation and cell death. To elucidate the participation of PADI4 in haematopoietic cell death, we examine whether inducible overexpression of PADI4 enhances the apoptotic cell death. PADI4 reduced the viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner of human leukemia HL-60 cells and human acute T leukemia Jurkat cells. The apoptosis-inducing activities were determined by nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, sub-G1 appearance, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi(m)), release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into cytoplasm and proteolytic activation of caspase 9 and 3. Following PADI4 overexpression, cells arrest in G1 phase significantly before their entrance into apoptotic cell death. PADI4 increases tumor suppressor p53 and its downstream p21 to control cell cycle. In the detections of protein expression and kinase activity, all protein levels of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and cyclins are not reduced except cyclin D, however, CDK2 (G1 entry S phase) and CDK1 (G2 entry M phase) enzyme activities are inhibited by conditionally inducible PADI4. p53 also expands its other downstream Bax to induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria. According to these data, we suggest that PADI4 induces apoptosis mainly through cell cycle arrest and mitochondria-mediated pathway. Furthermore, p53 features in PADI4-induced apoptosis by increasing intracellular p21 to control cell cycle and by Bax accumulation to decline Bcl-2 function, destroy delta psi(m), release cytochrome c to cytoplasm and activate the caspase cascade.","['Liu, G-Y', 'Liao, Y-F', 'Chang, W-H', 'Liu, C-C', 'Hsieh, M-C', 'Hsu, P-C', 'Tsay, G J', 'Hung, H-C']","['Liu GY', 'Liao YF', 'Chang WH', 'Liu CC', 'Hsieh MC', 'Hsu PC', 'Tsay GJ', 'Hung HC']","['Institute of Immunology, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC. liugy@csmu.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['EC 3.- (Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.3.15 (PADI4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.3.15 (Protein-Arginine Deiminase Type 4)', 'EC 3.5.3.15 (Protein-Arginine Deiminases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrolases/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Protein-Arginine Deiminase Type 4', 'Protein-Arginine Deiminases', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects']",2006/02/28 09:00,2006/06/16 09:00,['2006/02/28 09:00'],"['2006/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-006-3715-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2006 Feb;11(2):183-96. doi: 10.1007/s10495-006-3715-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted cell culture studies to investigate the relationship between bioluminescent signal intensity and viable cell numbers in murine leukaemia model cells. METHODS: Interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3 was transduced with firefly luciferase to generate cells expressing luciferase stably under the control of a retroviral long terminal repeat. The luciferase-expressing cells were transduced with p190 BCR-ABL to give factor-independent proliferation. The cells were cultured under various conditions, and bioluminescent signal intensity was compared with viable cell numbers and the cell cycle stage. RESULTS: The Ba/F3 cells showed autonomous growth as well as stable luciferase expression following transduction with both luciferase and p190 BCR-ABL, and in vivo bioluminescence imaging permitted external detection of these cells implanted into mice. The bioluminescence intensities tended to reflect cell proliferation and responses to imatinib in cell culture studies. However, the luminescence per viable cell was influenced by the IL-3 concentration in factor-dependent cells and by the stage of proliferation and imatinib concentration in factor-independent cells, thereby impairing the proportionality between viable cell number and bioluminescent signal intensity. Luminescence per cell tended to vary in association with the fraction of proliferating cells. CONCLUSION: Although in vivo bioluminescence imaging would allow non-invasive monitoring of leukaemia model animals, environmental factors and therapeutic interventions may cause some discrepancies between tumour burden and bioluminescence intensity.","['Inoue, Yusuke', 'Tojo, Arinobu', 'Sekine, Rieko', 'Soda, Yasushi', 'Kobayashi, Seiichiro', 'Nomura, Akiko', 'Izawa, Kiyoko', 'Kitamura, Toshio', 'Okubo, Toshiyuki', 'Ohtomo, Kuni']","['Inoue Y', 'Tojo A', 'Sekine R', 'Soda Y', 'Kobayashi S', 'Nomura A', 'Izawa K', 'Kitamura T', 'Okubo T', 'Ohtomo K']","['Department of Radiology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan. inoueys-tky@umin.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",Germany,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,101140988,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Luciferases', 'Luminescent Measurements/*methods', 'Luminescent Proteins', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Prognosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2006/02/28 09:00,2006/10/25 09:00,['2006/02/28 09:00'],"['2006/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00259-005-0048-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. 2006 May;33(5):557-65. doi: 10.1007/s00259-005-0048-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Protein expression was correlated with annexin V expression, Rai modified clinical staging, lymphocyte doubling time, and previous treatment. Our main goal was to determine the predictive value of these proteins in CLL cells in terms of disease evolution. Bcl-2 expression decreased from a median fluorescence index (MFI) of 331.71 +/- 42.2 to 245.81 +/- 52.2 (P < 0.001) after fludarabine treatment, but there was no difference between viable cells (331.57 +/- 44.6 MFI) and apoptotic cells (331.71 +/- 42.2 MFI) before incubation (P = 0.859). Bax expression was higher in viable cells (156.24 +/- 32.2 MFI) than in apoptotic cells (133.56 +/- 35.7 MFI) before incubation, probably reflecting defective apoptosis in CLL (P = 0.001). Mcl-1 expression was increased in fludarabine-resistant cells and seemed to be a remarkable protein for the inhibition of the apoptotic process in CLL (from 233.59 +/- 29.8 to 252.04 +/- 35.5; P = 0.033). After fludarabine treatment, Bag-1 expression was increased in fludarabine-resistant cells (from 425.55 +/- 39.3 to 447.49 +/- 34.5 MFI, P = 0.012), and interestingly, this higher expression occurred in patients who had a short lymphocyte doubling time (P = 0.022). Therefore, we could assume that Bag-1 expression in such situation might identify CLL patients who will need treatment earlier.","['Faria, J R', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Faria, R M D', 'Kerbauy, J', 'Oliveira, J S R']","['Faria JR', 'Yamamoto M', 'Faria RM', 'Kerbauy J', 'Oliveira JS']","['Servico de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Hospital das Clinicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil. jrfaria@oi.com.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2-associated athanogene 1 protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2006/02/28 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/02/28 09:00'],"['2006/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0100-879X2006000300003 [pii]', '10.1590/s0100-879x2006000300003 [doi]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2006 Mar;39(3):327-33. doi: 10.1590/s0100-879x2006000300003.

We characterize a population of early mesoderm-specified (EM) progenitors that is generated from mouse ESCs by bone morphogenetic protein stimulation. We further show that pluripotent ESCs are actively regenerated from EM progenitors by the action of the divergent homeodomain-containing protein Nanog, which, in turn, is upregulated in EM progenitors by the combined action of leukemia inhibitory factor and the early mesoderm transcription factor T/Brachyury. These findings uncover specific roles of leukemia inhibitory factor, Nanog, and bone morphogenetic protein in the self-renewal of ESCs and provide novel insights into the cellular bases of ESC pluripotency.","['Suzuki, Atsushi', 'Raya, Angel', 'Kawakami, Yasuhiko', 'Morita, Masanobu', 'Matsui, Takaaki', 'Nakashima, Kinichi', 'Gage, Fred H', 'Rodriguez-Esteban, Concepcion', 'Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos']","['Suzuki A', 'Raya A', 'Kawakami Y', 'Morita M', 'Matsui T', 'Nakashima K', 'Gage FH', 'Rodriguez-Esteban C', 'Izpisua Belmonte JC']","['Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nat Clin Pract Cardiovasc Med,Nature clinical practice.

The promyelocytic leukemia gene product (PML) becomes conjugated in vivo to the small ubiquitin-like protein SUMO-1, altering its behavior and capacity to recruit other proteins to PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). In the NB4 cell line, which was derived from an APL patient and expresses PML:RARalpha, we observed a retinoic acid-dependent change in the modification of specific proteins by SUMO-1. To dissect the interaction of PML with the SUMO-1 modification pathway, we used the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system through expression of PML and human SUMO-1 (hSUMO-1). We found that PML stimulated hSUMO-1 modification in yeast, in a manner that was dependent upon PML's RING-finger domain. PML:RARalpha also stimulated hSUMO-1 conjugation in yeast. Interestingly, however, PML and PML:RARalpha differentially complemented yeast Smt3p conjugation pathway mutants. These findings point toward a potential function of PML and PML:RARalpha as SUMO E3 enzymes or E3 regulators, and suggest that fusion of RARalpha to PML may affect this activity.","['Quimby, B B', 'Yong-Gonzalez, V', 'Anan, T', 'Strunnikov, A V', 'Dasso, M']","['Quimby BB', 'Yong-Gonzalez V', 'Anan T', 'Strunnikov AV', 'Dasso M']","['Section on Cell Cycle Regulation, Laboratory of Gene Regulation and Development, NICHD/NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CDC11 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SMT3 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (SUMO1 protein, human)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Siz2 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Siz1 protein, S cerevisiae)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/metabolism', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Multiprotein Complexes/biosynthesis', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'SUMO-1 Protein', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Species Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism']",2006/02/28 09:00,2006/07/11 09:00,['2006/02/28 09:00'],"['2006/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209335 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209335 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 May 18;25(21):2999-3005. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209335.,,,,,['Z01 HD001902-13/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells from these colonies survived and grew continuously in the absence of growth factors and generated clonal cell-lines that were mainly composed of well-differentiated mast cells, with a low frequency of undifferentiated cells. When transplanted into sublethally irradiated syngeneic mice, four out of four such clones gave rise to a systemic mastocytosis and mast-cell leukemia. However, the donor clones also generated low percentages of cells with the morphological and cell-surface characteristics of erythrocytes, granulocytes, monocytes and T- and B-lymphocytes.

At the steady state, NPM localizes mainly in the nucleolus, where it forms a complex with different cellular proteins. One-third of acute myeloid leukemias (AML) are characterized by aberrant cytoplasmic localization of NPM, due to mutations within its last coding exon (exon 12) that cause a frameshift and the formation of novel C-termini. We report here our investigations on the molecular basis for the aberrant localization of mutated NPM. Alignment of the C-terminus of the various NPM mutants revealed the obligatory presence of four amino-acid residues that match a CRM1-dependent nuclear export signal (NES). Single alanine-substitutions at these sites provoked nuclear re-localization, while fusion of the mutated C-terminus to a heterologous nuclear protein induced CRM1-dependent cytoplasmic localization. Molecular characterization of one exceptional AML carrying cytoplasmic NPM and germ line exon 12 revealed a somatic mutation in the splicing donor site of exon 9 that caused the formation of a functional NES. It appears, therefore, that AMLs are frequently characterized by gain-of-function mutations of NPM that create functional NES, suggesting that alterations of nuclear export might represent a general mechanism of leukemogenesis and a novel target for therapeutic intervention.","['Mariano, A R', 'Colombo, E', 'Luzi, L', 'Martinelli, P', 'Volorio, S', 'Bernard, L', 'Meani, N', 'Bergomas, R', 'Alcalay, M', 'Pelicci, P G']","['Mariano AR', 'Colombo E', 'Luzi L', 'Martinelli P', 'Volorio S', 'Bernard L', 'Meani N', 'Bergomas R', 'Alcalay M', 'Pelicci PG']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Export Signals)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Export Signals/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin']",2006/02/28 09:00,2006/08/24 09:00,['2006/02/28 09:00'],"['2006/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209453 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209453 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Jul 20;25(31):4376-80. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209453.

The study population consisted of 311 adult patients who received a myeloablative HCT for chronic myelogenous leukemia, all four scheduled doses of MTX, and did not require leucovorin rescue. Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the relationships between folic acid intake (days 0-18 post-HCT) and oral mucositis index (OMI) scores, time to engraftment and risk of detectable acute GVHD. No statistically significant differences in mean OMI scores, time to engraftment, risk of acute GVHD, days to acute GVHD, risk of relapse or survival were observed when comparing patients taking, on average, <400 (14%), 400 (58%) or >400 microg (28%) folic acid per day.

A Canadian consensus panel has recently proposed guidelines to better define TRALI and its implications. The guidelines recommend classifying each suspected case in one of the following 3 categories: (1) ""TRALI,"" (2) ""Possible TRALI,"" or (3) ""Not TRALI."" We report the clinical presentation, laboratory evaluation, and management of 3 patients with respiratory failure (RF) following allogeneic blood transfusions. These patients all experienced RF within 6 hr post-transfusion. Based on a review of the clinical and laboratory data and applying the Canadian guidelines, the first patient, a 67-yr-old man with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, was diagnosed as ""TRALI"" due to the sudden onset of RF requiring intensive resuscitation. The second patient, a 55-yr-old man with aplastic anemia, was diagnosed as ""Possible TRALI"" due to pre-existing RF that worsened after blood transfusion. The third patient, a 1-yr-old male, was diagnosed as transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO) and ""Possible TRALI,"" although his RF improved after treatment with diuretics. In all 3 cases, the blood donor center was informed of the suspected TRALI reactions. The remaining blood products from the donors associated with these reactions were quarantined. After review of the clinical data, the donors associated with cases #1 and #3 were screened by the blood center for granulocyte and HLA antibodies. Using a Luminex flow bead array, the following class I and class II antibodies specific for patient #1 were identified in the respective donor: anti-A25, B8, B18, and anti-DR15, DR 17. Subsequently, donor #1 was permanently deferred. A non-specific IgM anti-granulocyte antibody was identified in the donor associated with case #3, and this donor was subsequently disqualified from plasma and platelet donations. In conclusion, the Canadian guidelines to categorize patients suspected of TRALI provide a useful framework for evaluation of these patients and their respective blood donors.","['Fontaine, Magali J', 'Malone, James', 'Mullins, Franklin M', 'Grumet, F Carl']","['Fontaine MJ', 'Malone J', 'Mullins FM', 'Grumet FC']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical Center, 300 Pasteur Drive, H1402, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. magalif@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,,IM,"['Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/blood/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/diagnosis/etiology', '*Transfusion Reaction']",2006/02/28 09:00,2006/07/11 09:00,['2006/02/28 09:00'],"['2006/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['36/1/53 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 2006 Winter;36(1):53-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the factors needed for their growth are largely undefined, they are propagated on feeder cells or with conditioned media from feeder cells. This is in contrast to mouse embryonic stem cells (MESCs) where addition of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) replaces the need for a feeder layer. Recently, the transcription factor Nanog was suggested to allow LIF and feeder-free growth of MESCs. Here, we show that NANOG overexpression in HESCs enables their propagation for multiple passages during which the cells remain pluripotent. NANOG overexpressing cells form colonies efficiently even at a very low density, an ability lost upon excision of the transgene. Cells overexpressing NANOG downregulate expression of markers specific to the ICM and acquire expression of a marker specific to the primitive ectoderm (the consecutive pluripotent population in the embryo). Examination of global transcriptional changes upon NANOG overexpression by DNA microarray analysis reveals new markers suggested to discriminate between these populations. These results are significant in the understanding of self-renewal and pluripotency pathways in HESCs, and of their use for modeling early development in humans.","['Darr, Henia', 'Mayshar, Yoav', 'Benvenisty, Nissim']","['Darr H', 'Mayshar Y', 'Benvenisty N']","['Department of Genetics, Institute of Life Sciences, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NANOG protein, human)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ectoderm/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",2006/02/28 09:00,2006/05/23 09:00,['2006/02/28 09:00'],"['2006/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['133/6/1193 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.02286 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2006 Mar;133(6):1193-201. doi: 10.1242/dev.02286.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many viruses target these structures during infection. The E4 Orf3 protein of adenovirus 5 (Ad5) rearranges ND10s, causing PML to colocalize with Orf3 in nuclear tracks or fibers. There are six different PML isoforms (I to VI) present at ND10s, all sharing a common N terminus but with structural differences at their C termini. In this study, PML II was the only one of these six isoforms that was found to interact directly and specifically with Ad5 E4 Orf3 in vitro and in vivo; these results define a new Orf3 activity. Three of a series of 18 mutant Orf3 proteins were unable to interact with PML II; these were also unable to cause ND10 rearrangement. Moreover, in PML-null cells that contained neoformed ND10s comprising a single PML isoform, only ND10s formed of PML II were rearranged by Orf3. These data show that the interaction between Orf3 and PML II is necessary for ND10 rearrangement to occur. Finally, Orf3 was shown to self-associate in vitro. This activity was absent in mutant Orf3 proteins that were unable to form tracks and to bind PML II. Thus, Orf3 oligomerization may mediate the formation of nuclear tracks in vivo and may also be important for PML II binding.","['Hoppe, Anne', 'Beech, Stephanie J', 'Dimmock, John', 'Leppard, Keith N']","['Hoppe A', 'Beech SJ', 'Dimmock J', 'Leppard KN']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Warwick, Gibbet Hill Road, Coventry CV4 7AL, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adenovirus E4 Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adenovirus E4 Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adenoviruses, Human/*pathogenicity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/pathology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2006/02/28 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2006/02/28 09:00'],"['2006/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/6/3042 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.80.6.3042-3049.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Mar;80(6):3042-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.80.6.3042-3049.2006.,,,,,['C12930/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom'],PMC1395473,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SSSV appears unique to simple retroviruses by not harboring sequences in the Atlantic salmon genome. Additionally, SSSV differs from other retroviruses in potentially utilizing a methionine tRNA primer binding site. SSSV-associated tumors contain high proviral copy numbers (greater than 30 per cell) and a polyclonal integration pattern. Phylogenetic analysis based on reverse transcriptase places SSSV with zebrafish endogenous retrovirus (ZFERV) between the Gammaretrovirus and Epsilonretrovirus genera. Large regions of continuous homology between SSSV and ZFERV Gag, Pol, and Env suggest that these viruses represent a new group of related piscine retroviruses.","['Paul, Thomas A', 'Quackenbush, Sandra L', 'Sutton, Claudia', 'Casey, Rufina N', 'Bowser, Paul R', 'Casey, James W']","['Paul TA', 'Quackenbush SL', 'Sutton C', 'Casey RN', 'Bowser PR', 'Casey JW']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, C4137 VMC, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Air Sacs/*virology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Fish Diseases/virology', 'Leiomyosarcoma/veterinary/*virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/*veterinary/virology', 'Retroviridae/*classification/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Retroviridae Infections/veterinary/virology', 'Salmo salar/*virology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*veterinary/virology']",2006/02/28 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2006/02/28 09:00'],"['2006/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/6/2941 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.80.6.2941-2948.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Mar;80(6):2941-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.80.6.2941-2948.2006.,,,,,"['T32 CA009682/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32CA09682/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1395439,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/DQ174103'],,,,,

We have previously shown that two separate domains in the HIV-2 envelope protein are required for this activity: a glycine-tyrosine-x-x-hydrophobic (GYxxtheta) motif in the cytoplasmic tail and an unmapped region in the ectodomain of the protein. We here report that the cellular partner of the GYxxtheta motif is the adaptor protein complex AP-2. The mutation of this motif or the depletion of AP-2 by RNA interference abrogated EVR activity and changed the cellular distribution of the Env from a predominantly punctate pattern to a more diffuse distribution. Since the L domain of equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) contains a Yxxtheta motif that interacts with AP-2, we used both wild-type and L domain-defective particles of HIV-1 and EIAV to examine whether the HIV-2 Env EVR function was analogous to L domain activity. We observed that the production of all particles was stimulated by HIV-2 Env or Vpu, suggesting that the L domain and EVR activities play independent roles in the release of retroviruses. Interestingly, we found that the cytoplasmic tail of the murine leukemia virus (MLV) Env could functionally substitute for the HIV-2 Env tail, but it did so in a manner that did not require a Yxxtheta motif or AP-2. The cellular distribution of the chimeric HIV-2/MLV Env was significantly less punctate than the wild-type Env, although confocal analysis revealed an overlap in the steady-state locations of the two proteins. Taken together, these data suggest that the essential GYxxtheta motif in the HIV-2 Env tail recruits AP-2 in order to direct Env to a cellular pathway or location that is necessary for its ability to enhance virus release but that an alternate mechanism provided by the MLV Env tail can functionally substitute.","['Noble, Beth', 'Abada, Paolo', 'Nunez-Iglesias, Juan', 'Cannon, Paula M']","['Noble B', 'Abada P', 'Nunez-Iglesias J', 'Cannon PM']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adaptor Protein Complex 2)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Protein Complex 2/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Gene Products, env/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'HIV-2/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2006/02/28 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2006/02/28 09:00'],"['2006/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/6/2924 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.80.6.2924-2932.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Mar;80(6):2924-32. doi: 10.1128/JVI.80.6.2924-2932.2006.,,,,,"['P01 CA059318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-59318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1395462,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of 18 insertional mutations in the N-terminal domain of the capsid protein (CA) identified 3 that were severely defective for viral assembly and release. Transmission electron microscopy of cells producing these mutants showed assembly of Gag proteins in large, flat or dome-shaped patches at the plasma membrane. Spherical cores were not formed, and viral particles were not released. This late assembly/release block was partially rescued by wild-type virus. All three mutations localized to the small loop between alpha-helices 4 and 5 of CA, analogous to the cyclophilin A-binding loop of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 CA. In the X-ray structure of the hexameric form of MLV CA, this loop is located at the periphery of the hexamer. The phenotypes of mutations in this loop suggest that formation of a planar lattice of Gag is unhindered by mutations in the loop. However, the lack of progression of these planar structures to spherical ones suggests that mutations in this loop may prevent formation of pentamers or of stable pentamer-hexamer interactions, which are essential for the formation of a closed, spherical core. This region in CA, focused to a few residues of a small loop, may offer a novel therapeutic target for retroviral diseases.","['Auerbach, Marcy R', 'Brown, Kristy R', 'Kaplan, Artem', 'de Las Nueces, Denise', 'Singh, Ila R']","['Auerbach MR', 'Brown KR', 'Kaplan A', 'de Las Nueces D', 'Singh IR']","['Department of Pathology, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Capsid Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Models, Molecular', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Transfection', 'Virion/metabolism', '*Virus Assembly']",2006/02/28 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2006/02/28 09:00'],"['2006/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/6/2884 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.80.6.2884-2893.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Mar;80(6):2884-93. doi: 10.1128/JVI.80.6.2884-2893.2006.,,,,,['R01 CA149719/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC1395457,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HIV-1 CA is similarly greeted by CypA soon after entry into rhesus macaque or African green monkey cells, where, paradoxically, the interaction decreases HIV-1 infectivity by facilitating TRIM5alpha-mediated restriction. These observations conjure a model in which CA recognition by the human TRIM5alpha orthologue is precluded by CypA. Consistent with the model, selection of a human cell line for decreased restriction of the TRIM5alpha-sensitive, N-tropic murine leukemia virus (N-MLV) rendered HIV-1 transduction of these cells independent of CypA. Additionally, HIV-1 virus-like particles (VLPs) saturate N-MLV restriction activity, particularly when the CA-CypA interaction is disrupted. Here the effects of CypA and TRIM5alpha on HIV-1 restriction were examined directly. RNA interference was used to show that endogenous human TRIM5alpha does indeed restrict HIV-1, but the magnitude of this antiviral activity was not altered by disruption of the CA-CypA interaction or by elimination of CypA protein. Conversely, the stimulatory effect of CypA on HIV-1 infectivity was completely independent of human TRIM5alpha. Together with previous reports, these data suggest that CypA protects HIV-1 from an unknown antiviral activity in human cells. Additionally, target cell permissivity increased after loading with heterologous VLPs, consistent with a common saturable target that is epistatic to both TRIM5alpha and the putative CypA-regulated restriction factor.","['Sokolskaja, Elena', 'Berthoux, Lionel', 'Luban, Jeremy']","['Sokolskaja E', 'Berthoux L', 'Luban J']","['Department of Microbiology, Columbia University, 701 West 168th Street, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antiviral Restriction Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Cyclophilin A)']",IM,"['Antiviral Restriction Factors', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclophilin A/genetics/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/genetics/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'RNA Interference', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Virion/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",2006/02/28 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2006/02/28 09:00'],"['2006/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/6/2855 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.80.6.2855-2862.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Mar;80(6):2855-62. doi: 10.1128/JVI.80.6.2855-2862.2006.,,,,,"['R01 AI036199/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI36199/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1395419,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although genetic studies provided evidence that both the UL112 and UL113 loci in the viral genome are required for efficient viral replication, whether the four proteins play specific roles or cooperate in replication is not understood. Here we present evidence, using in vitro and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation assays, that the four UL112-113 proteins both self-interact and interact with each other. A mapping study of the 84-kDa protein showed that the N-terminal region encompassing amino acids 1 to 125, which is shared in all UL112-113 proteins and highly conserved among betaherpesviruses, is required for both self-interaction and nuclear localization as foci. Further localization studies revealed that, unlike the 43-, 50-, and 84-kDa proteins, which were distributed as nuclear punctate forms, the 34-kDa form was located predominantly in the cytoplasm. However, when all four proteins were coexpressed simultaneously, all of the UL112-113 proteins were efficiently localized to the promyelocytic leukemia oncogenic domains. We also found that the ability of the UL112-113 proteins to relocate UL44 (the viral polymerase processivity factor) to prereplication foci relied on self-interaction and reached maximal levels when the four proteins were coexpressed. Therefore, our data suggest that interactions occurring among UL112-113 proteins via their shared N-terminal regions are important to both their intranuclear targeting and the recruitment of UL44 to subnuclear sites for viral replication.","['Park, Mi-Young', 'Kim, Young-Eui', 'Seo, Myong-Rang', 'Lee, Jae-Rin', 'Lee, Chan Hee', 'Ahn, Jin-Hyun']","['Park MY', 'Kim YE', 'Seo MR', 'Lee JR', 'Lee CH', 'Ahn JH']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, 300 Chunchundong Jangangu, Suwon, Kyonggido 440-746, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ICP36 protein, Cytomegalovirus)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphoproteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vero Cells', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",2006/02/28 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2006/02/28 09:00'],"['2006/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/6/2718 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.80.6.2718-2727.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Mar;80(6):2718-27. doi: 10.1128/JVI.80.6.2718-2727.2006.,,,,,,PMC1395424,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gfi-1 is a zinc finger transcriptional repressor that is required for granulopoiesis. How Gfi-1 acts in myeloid cells is poorly understood. We show here that the expression of Gfi-1 was up-regulated during G-CSF-induced granulocytic differentiation in myeloid 32D cells. Truncation of the carboxyl terminus of the G-CSF receptor, as seen in patients with acute myeloid leukemia evolving from severe congenital neutropenia, disrupted Gfi-1 up-regulation by G-CSF. Ectopic expression of a dominant negative Gfi-1 mutant, N382S, which was associated with severe congenital neutropenia, resulted in premature apoptosis and reduced proliferation of cells induced to differentiate with G-CSF. The expression of neutrophil elastase (NE) and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein epsilon (C/EBPepsilon) was significantly increased in 32D cells expressing N382S. In contrast, overexpression of wild type Gfi-1 abolished G-CSF-induced up-regulation of C/EBPepsilon but had no apparent effect on NE up-regulation by G-CSF. Notably, G-CSF-dependent proliferation and survival were inhibited upon overexpression of C/EBPepsilon but not NE. These data indicate that Gfi-1 down-regulates C/EBPepsilon expression and suggest that increased expression of C/EBPepsilon as a consequence of loss of Gfi-1 function may be deleterious to the proliferation and survival of early myeloid cells.","['Zhuang, Dazhong', 'Qiu, Yaling', 'Kogan, Scott C', 'Dong, Fan']","['Zhuang D', 'Qiu Y', 'Kogan SC', 'Dong F']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Toledo, Toledo, Ohio 43606, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Cebpe protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gfi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Myeloid Cells/*metabolism', 'Neutropenia/*congenital', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation', 'Zinc Fingers']",2006/02/28 09:00,2006/06/14 09:00,['2006/02/28 09:00'],"['2006/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)56248-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M510924200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Apr 21;281(16):10745-51. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M510924200.

These patients were initially treated for a variety of childhood cancers with a combination of radiation and chemotherapy. The pathology of the salivary gland tumors were mucoepidermoid carcinoma (10), adenoid cystic carcinoma (1) , and pleomorphic adenoma (1). All patients were treated with surgical excision of the primary tumor, and postoperative radiation was added in select patients. Eleven patients were alive with no evidence of disease at last follow-up, and 1 patient was alive with clinical evidence of pulmonary metastasis. CONCLUSION: Radiation and chemotherapy used to treat patients with childhood malignancies increases the risk of developing a second neoplasm of salivary gland origin. The majority of these neoplasms are malignant; mucoepidermoid carcinoma occurs most frequently. The treatment of these tumors includes surgical excision of the primary, with neck dissection in patients with clinical evidence of nodal metastasis, and postoperative radiation added for pathologies with adverse features.

IL-3 is an important developmental factor for myeloid progenitor cells in vivo and is required to maintain the undifferentiated state in the 32Dcl3 cell line. The mechanisms employed by IL-3 to block differentiation, however, are not well understood. 32Dcl3 cells are myeloid progenitor cells of murine origin with high basal levels of p21waf1/cip1 (p21) expression. Our laboratory has previously reported that p21 levels decreased as CD34+-derived myeloid progenitor cells underwent terminal granulopoiesis in vitro. The effect of p21 upon the expression of genes associated with granulocytic differentiation has been unexplored, however. Since IL-3 maintains high levels of p21 in 32Dcl3 cells, we tested the hypothesis that p21 is an inhibitor of myeloid differentiation. Our findings demonstrate that siRNA knockdown of murine p21 is correlated with premature expression of the primary granule proteins myeloperoxidase and proteinase-3, proteins not abundant in cells maintained as myeloblasts by IL-3. Rescue with human p21 in these cells suppressed premature granule protein expression. p21 knockdown was also found to accelerate morphologic granulocytic differentiation in 32Dcl3 cells stimulated with G-CSF. Since high expression levels of p21 and overexpression of the IL-3 receptor have been correlated with poor outcomes in acute myeloid leukemias (AML), differentiation blockade by p21 may be one mechanism that contributes to AML pathogenesis.","['Ghanem, Louis', 'Steinman, Richard A']","['Ghanem L', 'Steinman RA']","['University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasmids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2006/02/28 09:00,2006/11/10 09:00,['2006/02/28 09:00'],"['2005/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2005/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(06)00021-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2005.12.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2006 Oct;30(10):1285-92. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2005.12.023.

Nevertheless, several results suggested: (i) that P-gp-mediated drug efflux was not the only mechanism involved in resistance; (ii) that intracellular compartments could accumulate the drug, preventing it from reaching its nuclear targets; (iii) that agents able to reverse multidrug resistance may lead to intracellular drug redistribution. We have studied the localization of P-gp in mitochondria as well as its functional properties in this compartment. Using several monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) directed against different P-gp epitopes, a protein was detected in the cytoplasm of two doxorubicin-resistant K562 sublines and, by confocal laser scanning microscopy, this protein was shown to co-localize in the Golgi apparatus and in mitochondria, in equivalent proportions. Purified mitochondria were isolated from K562 cell variants; the presence of a protein of about 170 kDa and reacting with several anti-P-gp antibodies was assessed in MDR cells by Western blotting and flow cytometry. Functional assays have shown that mitochondrial P-gp was involved in doxorubicin accumulation inside the organelle but not in its efflux, suggesting an orientation of P-gp in the mitochondrial membrane inverse to that observed in the plasma membrane. A potential role for mitochondrial P-gp in MDR cells would be to protect the nucleus from doxorubicin. This is the first demonstration of the presence and functional activity of P-gp in mitochondria of MDR cells.","['Munteanu, Eliza', 'Verdier, Mireille', 'Grandjean-Forestier, Fabienne', 'Stenger, Christophe', 'Jayat-Vignoles, Chantal', 'Huet, Sylvie', 'Robert, Jacques', 'Ratinaud, Marie-Helene']","['Munteanu E', 'Verdier M', 'Grandjean-Forestier F', 'Stenger C', 'Jayat-Vignoles C', 'Huet S', 'Robert J', 'Ratinaud MH']","['Laboratoire de Physiologie Mitochondriale, EA 3842 Faculte de Medecine, Limoges, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism']",2006/02/28 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/02/28 09:00'],"['2005/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/19 00:00 [revised]', '2006/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(06)00036-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2006.01.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2006 Apr 14;71(8):1162-74. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2006.01.006.

Previous studies established that 15d-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) selectively inhibits Prm3 activity and TPbeta expression through a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma mechanism without affecting Prm1 activity or TPalpha expression in human megakaryocytic erythroleukemia (HEL) 92.1.7 cells. Herein, we investigated the effect of synthetic thiazolidinedione (TZD) PPARgamma ligands rosiglitazone and troglitazone on TP gene expression in HEL cells. Like 15d-PGJ2, both TZDs suppressed Prm3 activity, TPbeta mRNA expression and TP-mediated calcium mobilization without affecting Prm1 or TPalpha mRNA expression. However, unlike 15d-PGJ2, both TZDs mediated their PPARgamma-dependent effects through trans-repression of an activator protein-1 (AP-1) element, a site previously found to be critical for basal Prm3 activity. These data provide further evidence for the role of PPARgamma in regulating the human TP gene; they highlight further differences in TPalpha and TPbeta expression/regulation and point to essential differences between natural and synthetic PPARgamma agonists in mediating those effects.","['Coyle, Adrian T', 'Kinsella, B Therese']","['Coyle AT', 'Kinsella BT']","['School of Biomolecular and Biomedical Science, UCD Conway Institute of Biomolecular and Biomedical Research, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (15-deoxyprostaglandin J2)', '0 (Chromans)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Thromboxane A2, Prostaglandin H2)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptor alpha)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '05V02F2KDG (Rosiglitazone)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'I66ZZ0ZN0E (Troglitazone)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromans/*pharmacology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Luciferases', 'PPAR gamma/*agonists', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Prostaglandin D2/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Thromboxane A2, Prostaglandin H2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retinoid X Receptor alpha', 'Rosiglitazone', 'Thiazolidinediones/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Troglitazone']",2006/02/28 09:00,2006/05/23 09:00,['2006/02/28 09:00'],"['2005/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/20 00:00 [revised]', '2006/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(06)00062-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2006.01.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2006 Apr 28;71(9):1308-23. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2006.01.011.

The present report describes a qualitative method of evaluating height growth after SCT, using a growth chart. The patients were divided into three groups according to the shape of their growth chart: the normal growth chart group, the early-onset growth retardation group (E-group), in which a decreased growth rate was seen during the first year after SCT, and the late-onset growth retardation group (L-group), in which a decreased growth rate was seen more than 1 yr after the SCT. In the E-group, total body irradiation and prolonged steroid therapy were thought to contribute to the growth failure, whereas in the L-group, impaired pubertal development was thought to be responsible. The growth pattern in the L-group may, therefore, be of particular clinical importance, because the final stature of the subjects in this group can be improved by pharmacological adjustment of pubertal onset.

In this article, we describe its application to phase I trials of BAY 43-9006 in solid tumor and AML/MDS patients. METHODS: The previously described whole blood lysis method was used to monitor BAY 43-9006 effects on peripheral T-cells of solid tumor patients. A modified whole blood fixation protocol was developed for the AML/MDS trial, using the c-kit ligand stem cell factor (SCF) to activate ERK as an alternative to PMA, and incorporating immunophenotypic markers to identify leukemic blasts. RESULTS: At all dose levels of BAY 43-9006 used to treat solid tumor patients, ERK could be activated by PMA in peripheral T-cells and we were not able to show inhibition of raf kinase. A similar effect was seen in the lymphocytes of AML/MDS patients during treatment with BAY 43-9006. However, we found strong inhibition when ERK was activated via c-kit using SCF.

Like proteomics, flow cytometry (FCM) assesses concurrent expression of many proteins, with the advantage of using intact cells that may be differentially selected during analysis. However, FCM has generally been used for incremental marker validation or construction of predictive models based on known patterns, rather than as a tool for unsupervised class discovery. We undertook a retrospective analysis of clinical FCM data to assess the feasibility of a cell-based proteomic approach to FCM by unsupervised cluster analysis. METHODS: Multicolor FCM data on peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) lymphocytes from 140 consecutive patients with B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs), including 81 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLLs), were studied. Expression was normalized for CD19 totals, and recorded for 10 additional B-cell markers. Data were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis using complete linkage by Pearson's correlation. Analysis of CLL in PB samples (n = 63) discovered three major clusters. One cluster (14 patients) was skewed toward ""atypical"" CLL and was characterized by high CD20, CD22, FMC7, and light chain, and low CD23. The remaining two clusters consisted almost entirely (48/49) of cases recorded as typical BCLL. The smaller ""typical"" BCLL cluster differed from the larger cluster by high CD38 (P = 0.001), low CD20 (P = 0.001), and low CD23 (P = 0.016). These two typical BCLL clusters showed a trend toward a difference in survival (P = 0.1090). Statistically significant cluster stability was demonstrated by expanding the dataset to include BM samples, and by using a method of random sampling with replacement. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the concept that unsupervised immunophenotypic profiling of FCM data can yield reproducible subtypes of lymphoma/chronic leukemia. Expanded studies are warranted in the use of FCM as an unsupervised class discovery tool, akin to other proteomic methods, rather than as a validation tool.","['Habib, Luzette K', 'Finn, William G']","['Habib LK', 'Finn WG']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, 48109, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

The key molecular and cellular events responsible for this beneficial outcome are incompletely understood. In this article, we utilize murine autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) to focus on the effect of endogenously produced leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) upon mature oligodendrocyte survival after demyelinating injury. We show that the mRNA for LIF is markedly upregulated in the spinal cord in the context of acute inflammatory demyelination. After clinical disease onset, administration of neutralizing anti-LIF antibodies over a four day period significantly worsens disease severity in two different murine EAE models. We also show that administration of neutralizing antibodies results in reduced activation of the cognate LIF receptor components in the spinal cord. Histologically, anti-LIF antibody administration increases the extent of acute demyelination (P < 0.01) and doubles the oligodendrocyte loss already induced by EAE (P < 0.05), without altering the extent of inflammatory infiltration into the spinal cord. Although acute EAE induces a rapid, three-fold increase in the proliferation of NG2 positive oligodendrocyte progenitors (P < 0.001), this response is not diminished by antagonism of endogenous LIF. We conclude that endogenous LIF is induced in response to autoimmune demyelination in the spinal cord and protects mature oligodendrocytes from demyelinating injury and cell death, thereby resulting in attenuation of clinical disease severity.","['Butzkueven, Helmut', 'Emery, Ben', 'Cipriani, Tania', 'Marriott, Mark P', 'Kilpatrick, Trevor J']","['Butzkueven H', 'Emery B', 'Cipriani T', 'Marriott MP', 'Kilpatrick TJ']","['The MS Research Group, The Howard Florey Institute, University of Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Glia,Glia,8806785,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/adverse effects/immunology', 'Cell Death/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/chemically induced/*immunology/physiopathology', 'Interleukin-6/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*immunology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Multiple Sclerosis/genetics/immunology/physiopathology', 'Myelin Sheath/drug effects/*immunology/pathology', 'Oligodendroglia/drug effects/*immunology/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/drug effects/immunology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Spinal Cord/immunology/pathology/physiopathology', 'Stem Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Up-Regulation/genetics/immunology', 'Wallerian Degeneration/chemically induced/*immunology/physiopathology']",2006/02/25 09:00,2006/06/13 09:00,['2006/02/25 09:00'],"['2006/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/glia.20321 [doi]'],ppublish,Glia. 2006 May;53(7):696-703. doi: 10.1002/glia.20321.,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Different reports demonstrate the intrinsic activation of NF-kappaB in lymphoid and myeloid malignancies, including preneoplastic conditions such as myelodysplastic syndromes, underscoring its implication in malignant transformation. Targeting intrinsic NF-kappaB activation, as well as its upstream and downstream regulators, may hence constitute an additional approach to the oncologist's armamentarium. Several small inhibitors of the NF-kappaB-activatory kinase IkappaB kinase, of the proteasome, or of the DNA binding of NF-kappaB subunits are under intensive investigation. Currently used cytotoxic agents can induce NF-kappaB activation as an unwarranted side effect, which confers apoptosis suppression and hence resistance to these drugs. Thus, NF-kappaB inhibitory molecules may be clinically useful, either as single therapeutic agents or in combination with classical chemotherapeutic agents, for the treatment of hematological malignancies.","['Braun, T', 'Carvalho, G', 'Fabre, C', 'Grosjean, J', 'Fenaux, P', 'Kroemer, G']","['Braun T', 'Carvalho G', 'Fabre C', 'Grosjean J', 'Fenaux P', 'Kroemer G']","['Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, UMR8125, Institut Gustave Roussy, 39 rue Camille-Desmoulins, F-94805 Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,['0 (NF-kappa B)'],IM,"['Hematologic Neoplasms/metabolism/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2006/02/25 09:00,2006/08/12 09:00,['2006/02/25 09:00'],"['2006/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['4401874 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.cdd.4401874 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2006 May;13(5):748-58. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4401874.,,,,,,,107,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously demonstrated that, while pre-TCR is required for thymocytes proliferation and leukemogenesis, it is dispensable for thymocyte differentiation in Notch3-transgenic mice. Notch3-transgenic premalignant thymocytes and T lymphoma cells overexpress pTalpha/pre-TCR and display constitutive activation of NF-kappaB, providing survival signals for immature thymocytes. We provide genetic and biochemical evidence that Notch3 triggers multiple NF-kappaB activation pathways. A pre-TCR-dependent pathway preferentially activates NF-kappaB via IKKbeta/IKKalpha/NIK complex, resulting in p50/p65 heterodimer nuclear entry and recruitment onto promoters of Cyclin D1, Bcl2-A1 and IL7-receptor-alpha genes. In contrast, upon pTalpha deletion, Notch3 binds IKKalpha and maintains NF-kappaB activation through an alternative pathway, depending on an NIK-independent IKKalpha homodimer activity. The consequent NF-kappaB2/p100 processing allows nuclear translocation of p52/RelB heterodimers, which only trigger transcription from Bcl2-A1 and IL7-receptor-alpha genes. Our data suggest that a finely tuned interplay between Notch3 and pre-TCR pathways converges on regulation of NF-kappaB activity, leading to differential NF-kappaB subunit dimerization that regulates distinct gene clusters involved in either cell differentiation or proliferation/leukemogenesis.","['Vacca, Alessandra', 'Felli, Maria Pia', 'Palermo, Rocco', 'Di Mario, Giuseppina', 'Calce, Angelica', 'Di Giovine, Monica', 'Frati, Luigi', 'Gulino, Alberto', 'Screpanti, Isabella']","['Vacca A', 'Felli MP', 'Palermo R', 'Di Mario G', 'Calce A', 'Di Giovine M', 'Frati L', 'Gulino A', 'Screpanti I']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Pathology, University La Sapienza, Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p52 Subunit)', '0 (Nfkbia protein, mouse)', '0 (Notch3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptor, Notch3)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (pre-T cell receptor alpha)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '147337-75-5 (Transcription Factor RelB)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (Ikbkb protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (NF-kappa B kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'I-kappa B Kinase/metabolism', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B p52 Subunit/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch3', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelA/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelB/metabolism']",2006/02/25 09:00,2006/04/18 09:00,['2006/02/25 09:00'],"['2005/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['7600996 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.emboj.7600996 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2006 Mar 8;25(5):1000-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.emboj.7600996.
