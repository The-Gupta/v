Epub 2016 Jan 6.,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a causative retrovirus of adult T-cell leukemia and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy. Unlike HTLV-1, the same group of retrovirus HTLV-2 has not been found to be associated with these diseases. HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 encode transforming proteins Tax1 and Tax2, and a few distinct activities of Tax1 from those of Tax2 have been proposed to contribute to the HTLV-1-specific pathogenesis of disease. One significant difference of Tax1 from Tax2 is the activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB2/p100/p52. We found that Tax1 but not Tax2 induces the expression of OX40 ligand (OX40L) in a human T-cell line. To induce the OX40L expression, Tax1 but not Tax2 was observed to interact with NF-kappaB2/p100/p52 and RelB and the distinct interaction activity was mediated by the Tax1 amino acid region of 225-232. In addition, Tax1 but not Tax2 or Tax1/225-232 interacted with p65, p50, and c-Rel; however, the interactions were much less than those noted with NF-kappaB2/p100/p52 and RelB. OX40L is a T-cell costimulatory molecule of the tumor necrosis factor family, and its signal plays a critical role in establishing adaptive immunity by inducing the polarized differentiation of T-cells to cells such as T helper type 2 and T follicular helper cells. Therefore, the present findings suggest that Tax1 might alter the immune response to HTLV-1 and/or differentiation of HTLV-1-infected T-cells via OX40L induction, thereby acting as a factor mediating the distinct phenotypes and pathogenesis of HTLV-1 from that of HTLV-2.",['NOTNLM'],"['HTLV-1', 'NF-kappaB', 'OX40L', 'RelB', 'p52']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although there has been some progress in developing novel cancer therapies, no significant improvement was observed in the overall survival rate over the last decade. Selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors are known to inhibit tumor growth by exerting antimetastatic and antiangiogenic effects through inhibition of COX -dependent and independent pathways. The ability of two new triaryl-oxadiazole derivatives, compounds A (3-(4-chlorophenyl) -5-(4-flurophenyl)-4-Phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazole) and B (3,5-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-4-Phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazole), to induce apoptosis in human erythroleukemia K562 cells was evaluated and the upstream mechanism was investigated. METHODS: K562 cells were treated with compounds A and B at their IC50 concentrations and analyzed by DAPI staining and Annexin-V-FLUOS labelling solution. Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) activation was evaluated by TransAM kit. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), Caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, ferritin heavy chain (FHC), extra cellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p-ERK and early growth response protein-1 (Egr1) levels were determined using Western blotting, while c-Myc mRNA level was investigated by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Changes in nuclear morphology and the increased annexin-V/PI staining revealed the apoptotic cell death in compounds A- and B-treated K562 cells. A significant reduction in NF-kappaB activity as well as FHC and p-ERK levels were detected in these cells. No change was observed in the levels of Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, COX-2, c-Myc and Egr1, following treatment with the two compounds. Collectively, compounds A and B potentiate apoptosis as shown by DAPI staining, flowcytometry, FHC and p-ERK downregulation and NF-kappaB inactivation. CONCLUSION: Two compounds induce apoptosis in a COX-2-independent manner which also appears to be independent from mitochondria, caspase and c-Myc/Egr1 pathways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To facilitate viral spread, we have previously shown HCMV to extend the short 48-h life span of monocytes. Mechanistically, HCMV upregulated two specific cellular antiapoptotic proteins, myeloid leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) and heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), to block the two proteolytic cleavages necessary for the formation of fully active caspase 3 and the subsequent initiation of apoptosis. We now show that HCMV more robustly upregulated Mcl-1 than normal myeloid growth factors and that Mcl-1 was the only myeloid survival factor to rapidly induce HSP27 prior to the 48-h cell fate checkpoint. We determined that HCMV glycoproteins gB and gH signal through the cellular epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and alphavbeta3 integrin, respectively, during viral entry in order to drive the increase of Mcl-1 and HSP27 in an Akt-dependent manner. Although Akt is known to regulate protein stability and transcription, we found that gB- and gH-initiated signaling preferentially and cooperatively stimulated the synthesis of Mcl-1 and HSP27 through mTOR-mediated translation. Overall, these data suggest that the unique signaling network generated during the viral entry process stimulates the upregulation of select antiapoptotic proteins allowing for the differentiation of short-lived monocytes into long-lived macrophages, a key step in the viral dissemination strategy. IMPORTANCE: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is endemic within the human population. Although primary infection is generally asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals, HCMV is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised. The multiorgan inflammatory diseases associated with symptomatic HCMV infection are a direct consequence of the monocyte-mediated systemic spread of the virus. In order for peripheral blood monocytes to facilitate viral dissemination, HCMV subverts the short 48-h life span of monocytes by inducing the expression of cellular antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and HSP27. Here, we demonstrate that the rapid and simultaneous upregulation of Mcl-1 and HSP27 is a distinctive feature of HCMV-induced monocyte survival. Moreover, we decipher the signaling pathways activated during viral entry needed for the robust synthesis of Mcl-1 and HSP27. Identifying the virus-specific mechanisms used to upregulate select cellular factors required for the survival of HCMV-infected monocytes is important to the development of new classes of anti-HCMV drugs.",,,"['Copyright (c) 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Despite this efficacy, many patients are unable to receive T cell therapy because of failure of in vitro expansion, a necessary component of cell manufacture and a predictor of in vivo activity. To evaluate the biology underlying these functional differences, we investigated T cell expansion potential and memory phenotype during chemotherapy in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). We found that patients with T cell populations enriched for early lineage cells expanded better in vitro and that patients with ALL had higher numbers of these cells with a corresponding enhancement in expansion as compared to cells from patients with NHL. We further demonstrated that early lineage cells were selectively depleted by cyclophosphamide and cytarabine chemotherapy and that culture with interleukin-7 (IL-7) and IL-15 enriched select early lineage cells and rescued T cell expansion capability. Thus, early lineage cells are essential to T cell fitness for expansion, and enrichment of this population either by timing of T cell collection or culture method can increase the number of patients eligible to receive highly active engineered cellular therapies.",,,"['Copyright (c) 2016, American Association for the Advancement of Science.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified mutations that enhanced hexamer formation and complement activation by IgG1 antibodies against a range of targets on cells from hematological and solid tumor indications. IgG1 backbones with preferred mutations E345K or E430G conveyed a strong ability to induce conditional complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) of cell lines and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient tumor cells, while retaining regular pharmacokinetics and biopharmaceutical developability. Both mutations potently enhanced CDC- and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of a type II CD20 antibody that was ineffective in complement activation, while retaining its ability to induce apoptosis.

We hypothesized that the inclusion of antihuman T-lymphocyte immune globulin (ATG) in a myeloablative conditioning regimen for patients with acute leukemia would result in a significant reduction in chronic GVHD 2 years after allogeneic peripheral-blood stem-cell transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 3 study of ATG as part of a conditioning regimen. A total of 168 patients were enrolled at 27 centers. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive ATG or not receive ATG, with stratification according to center and risk of disease. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 24 months, the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 32.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.1 to 46.7) in the ATG group and 68.7% (95% CI, 58.4 to 80.7) in the non-ATG group (P<0.001). The rate of 2-year relapse-free survival was similar in the ATG group and the non-ATG group (59.4% [95% CI, 47.8 to 69.2] and 64.6% [95% CI, 50.9 to 75.3], respectively; P=0.21), as was the rate of overall survival (74.1% [95% CI, 62.7 to 82.5] and 77.9% [95% CI, 66.1 to 86.1], respectively; P=0.46). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of relapse, infectious complications, acute GVHD, or adverse events. The rate of a composite end point of chronic GVHD-free and relapse-free survival at 2 years was significantly higher in the ATG group than in the non-ATG group (36.6% vs. 16.8%, P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of ATG resulted in a significantly lower rate of chronic GVHD after allogeneic transplantation than the rate without ATG. The survival rate was similar in the two groups, but the rate of a composite end point of chronic GVHD-free survival and relapse-free survival was higher with ATG.

The HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) gene, which is encoded in the minus strand of HTLV-1, plays critical roles in pathogenesis. In this study, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses using HBZ transduced T cells revealed that HBZ upregulates the expression and promoter acetylation levels of a co-inhibitory molecule, T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT), in addition to those of regulatory T cells related genes, Foxp3 and Ccr4. TIGIT was expressed on CD4+ T cells from HBZ-transgenic (HBZ-Tg) mice, and on ATL cells and HTLV-1 infected CD4+ T cells of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) in vivo. Expression of Blimp1 and IL-10 was upregulated in TIGIT+CD4+ cells of HBZ-Tg mice compared with TIGIT-CD4+ T cells, suggesting the correlation between TIGIT expression and IL-10 production. When CD4+ T cells from HBZ-Tg mice were stimulated with TIGIT's ligand, CD155, their production of the inhibitory cytokine IL-10 was enhanced. Furthermore, dendritic cells from HBZ-Tg mice produced high levels of IL-10 after stimulation. These data suggest that HBZ alters immune system to suppressive state via TIGIT and IL-10. Importantly, TIGIT suppressed T-cell responses to another HTLV-1 virus protein, Tax, in vitro. Blocking of TIGIT and PD-1 slightly increased anti-Tax T-cell activity in some HAM/TSP patients. These results suggest that HBZ-induced TIGIT on HTLV-1 infected cells impairs T-cell responses to viral antigens. This study shows that HBZ-induced TIGIT plays a pivotal role in attenuating host immune responses and shaping a microenvironment favorable to HTLV-1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MDS is predominantly a disease of the elderly, with a median age in the UK of around 75. Approximately one third of MDS patients will develop secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) that has a very poor prognosis. Unfortunately, most standard cytotoxic agents are often too toxic for older patients. This means there is a pressing unmet need for novel therapies that have fewer side effects to assist this vulnerable group. This challenge was tackled using bioinformatic analysis of available transcriptomic data to establish a gene-based signature of the development and progression of MDS. This signature was then used to identify novel therapeutic compounds via statistically-significant connectivity mapping. This approach suggested re-purposing an existing and widely-prescribed drug, bromocriptine as a novel potential therapy in these disease settings. This drug has shown selectivity for leukemic cells as well as synergy with current therapies.",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'bromocriptine', 'myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)', 're-purposed', 'therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to evaluate the potential influence of FOXP3 rs3761548 polymorphism in the donor on the outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). A total of 171 patients were enrolled for this study and genotyped using direct sequencing. Patients with rs3761548 CC genotype had higher incidence of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (HVOD) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection than that of the individuals with AA or AC genotype (P=0.011, P=0.023). Treatment-related mortality (TRM) rate of patients with AA or AC genotype was lower than that of the patients with CC genotype (P=0.044) resulting in a difference in overall survival (OS). However, there was no difference in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) relapse or blood stream infection (BSI), depending on the genotype at rs3761548 locus. In multivariate analysis, CC genotype showed as a risk factor in the development of HVOD and CMV infection, with low OS. In conclusion, this is the first report on FOXP3 rs3761548 SNP in allo-HSCT and we suggest that this SNP be considered a candidate marker for predicting the development of HVOD and CMV infection after allo-HSCT.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'HSCT', 'Outcome', 'SNP', 'rs3761548']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Some of the used immunosuppressive drugs may affect the process of wound healing and thereby, impair the long-term success of surgical treatment. Therefore, this retrospective analysis aimed at the evaluation of the perioperative treatment and surgical outcome of immunocompromised patients undergoing different reconstructive procedures. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of 8 immunocompromised patients with different primary diseases who needed reconstructive surgery: 2 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 1 patient with an acute myeloid leukemia, 1 patient with colitis ulcerosa, 1 patient with liver cirrhosis, 1 patient with chronic polyarthritis, and 2 patients with malignant melanoma. RESULTS: In 7 of our 8 presented cases, multiple operations with wound debridements have been necessary to optimize the granulation of the wound bed before reconstructive surgery. 3 out of these 7 patients required further operations due to wound dehiscence or necrosis, with 2 of them as a result of increased immunosuppressive therapy. 5 out of 8 patients needed no further surgical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Both the perioperative drug therapy and the reconstructive surgery concept need to be determined carefully in each individual case of the immunocompromised patients. Thus, the appropriate point in time of operation to achieve the best possible wound healing as well as the complexity of the procedure will require the consideration of a 'less is more' strategy in selected cases.",['NOTNLM'],"['immunocompromised patients', 'plastic surgery', 'reconstructive surgery']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notably, non genomic inactivation of PTEN in myeloid malignancies could represent a challenging therapeutic opportunity for these diseases.

Epub 2016 Jan 5.,"PURPOSE: We evaluated efficacy and tolerability of the combination of ofatumumab and lenalidomide in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and explored whether immune system characteristics could influence the response to treatment. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty-four patients were enrolled in this phase II study. Ofatumumab was administered at a dose of 300 mg on day 1, 1,000 mg on days 8, 15, and 22 during course 1, 1,000 mg on day 1 during courses 3-6, and once every other course during courses 7-24 (28-day courses). Oral lenalidomide (10 mg daily) was started on day 9 and continued for as long as a clinical benefit was observed. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 71%. Eight patients (24%) achieved a complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete recovery of blood counts, including 9% with minimal residual disease-negative CR. The median progression-free survival was 16 months, and the estimated 5-year survival was 53%. The most common treatment-related toxicity was neutropenia (grade >2 in 18% of the 574 patient courses). The most frequent infectious complications were pneumonia and neutropenic fever (24% and 9% of patients, respectively). We observed that patients who achieved a CR had at baseline higher numbers and a better preserved function of T cells and natural killer cells compared with non-responders. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of ofatumumab and lenalidomide is a well-tolerated regimen that induces durable responses in the majority of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. Our correlative data suggest a role of competent immune system in supporting the efficacy of this treatment. Clin Cancer Res; 22(10); 2359-67.

Interferons are a superfamily of proinflammatory cytokines that play a role in host defence mechanisms. Interferons are used in the treatment of a variety of autoimmune (e.g. multiple sclerosis), viral (e.g. chronic hepatitis B and C), and malignant (e.g. malignant melanoma, hairy cell leukemia) disorders; depression, however, is a notable and clinically troublesome adverse effect. OBJECTIVE: This article seeks to present a simple explanation and update for the reader about what interferons are, how interferons are classified, the clinical conditions in which interferons are used, the occurrence of depression as a clinical adverse effect of interferon therapy, possible mechanisms that explain interferon-related depression, the treatment of interferon-related depression, and the prevention of interferon-related depression. METHODS: A qualitative literature review is presented. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Irrespective of the indication for IFN therapy, IFNs are associated with a 30- 70% risk of treatment-emergent depression. This risk could be due to the IFN, or to an interaction between the IFN and the indication for which it was prescribed. Various neurohormonal, neurochemical, neurohistological, and other mechanisms have been put forth to explain IFN-related depression. Prophylactic treatment with antidepressants reduces the risk of IFN-related depression; antidepressants also effectively treat the condition. Recent alternatives to IFNs have shown to decrease the risk of treatment-emergent depression.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Jan 6.,"P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is one of the major obstacles to efficiency of cancer chemotherapy. Here, we investigated whether combination of metformin and 2-deoxyglucose reverses the multidrug resistance (MDR) of K562/Dox cells and tried to elucidate the possible mechanisms. The combination of metformin and 2-deoxyglucose selectively enhanced the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin against K562/Dox cells. Metformin was not a substrate of P-gp but suppressed the elevated level of P-gp in K562/Dox cells. The downregulation of P-gp may be partly attributed to the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. The addition of 2-deoxyglucose to metformin initiated a strong metabolic stress in both K562 and K562/Dox cells. Combination of metformin and 2-deoxyglucose inhibited glucose uptake and lactate production in K562 and K562/Dox cells leading to a severe depletion in ATP and a enhanced autophagy. Above all, P-gp substrate selectively aggravated this ATP depletion effect and increased cell apoptosis in K562/Dox cells. In conclusion, metformin decreases P-gp expression in K562/Dox cells via blocking phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase. P-gp substrate increases K562/Dox cell apoptosis via aggravating ATP depletion induced by combination of metformin and 2-deoxyglucose. Our observations highlight the importance of combination of metformin and 2-deoxyglucose in reversing multidrug resistance.",['NOTNLM'],"['2-Deoxyglucose', 'Energy metabolism', 'Metformin', 'Multidrug resistance', 'P-glycoprotein']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From January 1st 2009 to December 31st 2010, an exploratory case-control study was conducted on childhood AL among children who were less than 15 years of age in Shanghai, China. A total of 131 patients with newly diagnosed AL were recruited from 3 Shanghai children hospitals. The controls selected from the same hospital were healthy children who attended the physical check-up held by the department of Children's Healthcare, or who visited the clinic of developmental pediatrics or orthopedics (excluding blood diseases and malignant tumors). 140 controls matched with cases in gender and age were included in this study. Chemical exposure were investigated by questionnaires, methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) was adopted to analyze the methylation or deletion status of 8 genes, and gene-environment interactions were analyzed by relative excess risk of interaction (RERI), attributable proportion of interaction (API) and synergy index (S). RESULTS: There were 131 and 140 subjects in case and control group, who were aged (6.9 +/- 3.8) and (6.9 +/- 3.9) years old (t = 0.01, P = 0.911), respectively. After adjusting age and other potential confounding factors, chemical substances' exposure of children/mother/father were all significantly higher in cases than that in controls (Children: OR = 3.90, 95% CI: 1.69-9.02; Mother: OR = 2.71, 95% CI: 1.12-6.52; Father: OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.05-3.47). For the 8 genes analyzed, the methylation status of DAPK and PTEN and P73 in case group were significantly higher than that in control group (cases: 3.1% (4 cases), 16.0% (21 cases), 7.6% (10 cases); controls: 0.7% (1 case), 2.9% (4 cases), 0.7% (1 case); chi(2): 7.11, 16.90, 11.38; P value: 0.029, 0.000, 0.003). The methylation status of P16 in case group was significantly lower than that in control group (cases: 3.8% (5 cases); controls: 8.6% (12 cases), chi(2) = 10.33, P = 0.007). The interactions of children chemical substances' exposure and 3 genes' (PTEN, P16 and P73) methylation status were probably existed after adjusted for confounding factors (PTEN: RERI = -7.01, API = -2.14, S = 0.24; P16: RERI = 4.08, API = 0.53, S = 2.59; P73: RERI = 4.32, API = 0.48, S = 2.19), we also found the potential interaction between maternal chemical substances' exposure and PTEN, P16 gene methylation status (PTEN: RERI = -1.30, API = -0.38, S = 0.65; P16: RERI = 1.70, API = 0.38, S = 1.97). CONCLUSION: The study suggested the strong combined effects of chemical substances exposure of children and abnormal methylation status were risk factors of childhood AL, and there existed different interaction between them, which may indicate the important role in the pathogenesis process of childhood AL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A 1:2 matched case-control study of childhood AL was conducted in Shanghai between April 2011 and January 2014. The study enrolled 66 cases aged < 15, diagnosed with AL and 132 controls matched by age, gender and residence. All of the controls had no hematological diseases or previous history of malignancy. Children who had been adopted and had congenital genetic syndromes such as Down's syndrome or a positive HIV test result were not eligible as either cases or controls. Information was obtained from standardized face-to-face interviews of their parents/guardians with detailed questions on demographic characteristics, lifestyle, and household environment. Conditional logistic regression models were used to analyze effecting factors of childhood AL, odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: Among 198 cases, 66 cases were aged (5.0 +/- 3.7) years old, and 132 controls were aged (6.0 +/- 3.8) years old (t = 0.48, P = 0.523).

Epub 2016 Jan 5.,"In the assessment of health risks after nuclear accidents, some health consequences require special attention. For example, in their 2013 report on health risk assessment after the Fukushima nuclear accident, the World Health Organisation (WHO) panel of experts considered risks of breast cancer, thyroid cancer and leukaemia. For these specific cancer types, use was made of already published excess relative risk (ERR) and excess absolute risk (EAR) models for radiation-related cancer incidence fitted to the epidemiological data from the Japanese A-bomb Life Span Study (LSS). However, it was also considered important to assess all other types of solid cancer together and the WHO, in their above-mentioned report, stated ""No model to calculate the risk for all other solid cancer excluding breast and thyroid cancer risks is available from the LSS data"". Applying the LSS models for all solid cancers along with the models for the specific sites means that some cancers have an overlap in the risk evaluations. Thus, calculating the total solid cancer risk plus the breast cancer risk plus the thyroid cancer risk can overestimate the total risk by several per cent. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to publish the required models for all other solid cancers, i.e. all solid cancers other than those types of cancer requiring special attention after a nuclear accident. The new models presented here have been fitted to the same LSS data set from which the risks provided by the WHO were derived. Although it is known already that the EAR and ERR effect modifications by sex are statistically significant for the outcome ""all solid cancer"", it is shown here that sex modification is not statistically significant for the outcome ""all solid cancer other than thyroid and breast cancer"". It is also shown here that the sex-averaged solid cancer risks with and without the sex modification are very similar once breast and thyroid cancers are factored out. Some other notable model differences between those already published for all solid cancers and those presented here for all other solid cancers are also given here. The models presented here can be used to improve on the methodology adopted by WHO after Fukushima and could contribute to emergency preparedness for future nuclear accidents.",['NOTNLM'],"['Fukushima risk assessment', 'Japanese A-bomb survivors', 'Radiation epidemiology', 'Risk models']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that a key nonsense-mediated RNA decay switch exon (NSE) in ATM is repressed by U2AF, PUF60 and hnRNPA1. The NSE activation was haplotype-specific and was most promoted by cytosine at rs609621 in the NSE 3' splice-site (3'ss), which is predominant in high cancer risk populations. NSE levels were deregulated in leukemias and were influenced by the identity of U2AF35 residue 34. We also identify splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) that exploit competition of adjacent pseudoexons to modulate NSE levels. The U2AF-regulated exon usage in the ATM signalling pathway was centred on the MRN/ATM-CHEK2-CDC25-cdc2/cyclin-B axis and preferentially involved transcripts implicated in cancer-associated gene fusions and chromosomal translocations. These results reveal important links between 3'ss control and ATM-dependent responses to double-strand DNA breaks, demonstrate functional plasticity of intronic variants and illustrate versatility of intronic SSOs that target pseudo-3'ss to modify gene expression.",,,,,,,,['Sci Rep. 2016 May 09;6:25256.

Epub 2015 Dec 28.,"INTRODUCTION: The etiology of acute lymphoblastic leukemia remains undisclosed in the majority of cases. A number of rare syndromic conditions are known to predispose to different forms of childhood cancer including ALL. The present study characterized the spectrum and clinical impact of preexisting diseases in a cohort of ALL patients from Germany, Austria and Switzerland with a focus on genetic diseases predisposing to cancer development. METHODS: Retrospective database and study chart review included all patients from Germany, Austria and Switzerland (n = 4939) enrolled into multicenter clinical trial AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000 between July 1999 and June 2009. Patients enrolled into study AIEOP-BFM ALL 2009 - which was initiated subsequent to AIEP-BFM ALL 2000 - who were reported with a cancer prone syndrome or chromosomal abnormality were additionally included in this study to increase conclusiveness of observations. RESULTS: A total of 233 patients with at least one reported condition could be identified. The following conditions were reported in more than one patient: Gilbert's disease (n = 13), neurofibromatosis type I (n = 8), ataxia telangiectasia (n = 8), thalassemia (n = 7), Nijmegen Breakage syndrome (n = 6), cystic fibrosis (n = 4), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (n = 4), Noonan syndrome (n = 2), Klinefelter syndrome (n = 2), alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (n = 2), primary ciliary dyskinesia (n = 2). Especially those syndromes with a known cancer predisposition (NF type I, Ataxia telangiectasia, Nijmegen Breakage syndrome etc.) were associated with certain general and ALL-related characteristics, high therapy-related toxicity and reduced survival. CONCLUSION: The spectrum of underlying diseases within ALL patients is dispersed. A small number of ALL patients are reported with cancer predisposition syndromes at initial diagnosis which are associated with high rates of therapy-related toxicity and a markedly reduced chance of survival. The true prevalence of these conditions within the ALL population remains unknown due to inapparent clinical presentation. A targeted clinical and/or genetic examination for certain diagnoses like NF type I, Ataxia telangiectasia or Nijmegen Breakage syndrome could identify patients who benefit from adjustment of antileukemic therapy or intensification of supportive care.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Ataxia telangiectasia', 'Cancer predisposition syndromes', 'Neurofibromatosis type I', 'Nijmegen breakage syndrome', 'Preexisting conditions']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We use this platform to generate whole-transcriptome profiles of primary, activated murine CD8+ T-cell and lymphocytic leukemia cell line lineages. Here we report that both cell types have greater intra- than inter-lineage transcriptional similarity. For CD8+ T-cells, genes with functional annotation relating to lymphocyte differentiation and function--including Granzyme B--are enriched among the genes that demonstrate greater intra-lineage expression level similarity. Analysis of gene expression covariance with matched measurements of time since division reveals cell type-specific transcriptional signatures that correspond with cell cycle progression. We believe that the ability to directly measure the effects of lineage and cell cycle-dependent transcriptional profiles of single cells will be broadly useful to fields where heterogeneous populations of cells display distinct clonal trajectories, including immunology, cancer, and developmental biology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pointing out a diagnosis of FUO often requires numerous noninvasive and invasive procedures. Peripheral blood (PB) smear examination frequently provides many timely and valuable diagnostic clues in various disorders. Few assessments of PB smear morphologic examinations used in the diagnostic evaluation of FUO have been reported. METHODS: To determine whether PB smears have important roles in exploring the causes of FUO, we collected PB smears of 2871 FUO patients from Beijing Chao-yang Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University from September 2012 to August 2014. Combined with relevant clinical data, we analyzed the PB morphologic features in all the FUO patients. RESULTS: We found the presence of atypical lymphocytes (64.33%), nuclear left shift (46.33%), toxic granulation, vacuolization, and 4 cases of malaria in FUO patients, markedly more than the health control group (p < 0.05), and morphologically consistent with the diagnosis of infectious diseases. Notably, the presence of blasts or immature cells in 26 cases (9%o) and the abnormal changes of leukocytes, erythrocytes or platelets in 4 cases provided predictive information for exploring the causes of FUO, followed by bone marrow smears and other procedures to further confirm the diagnosis as hematological diseases, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), Evans syndrome, agranulocytosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that a timely and careful observing of PB smears is helpful for clarifying the diagnosis and contributes to appropriate treatment in patients with FUO.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biomarkers obtained by PCR or flow cytometry are used for the diagnosis and subtyping of hematopoietic tumor cases. They are also used to predict the effectiveness of molecular-targeted therapies and detect minimal residual leukemia cells. In order to cure leukemia, it is necessary to eradicate leukemia stem cells. For that purpose, biomarkers to identify and characterize the leukemia stem cells in each case are needed. Therefore, we examined molecules involved in various stemness-related signaling pathways, especially NOTCH signaling in acute leukemia cells. In T-lymphoblastic leukemia cells, which often have activating NOTCH1 mutations, NOTCH works in oncogenic signaling. Although acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells express NOTCH and NOTCH ligands, it is still controversial whether NOTCH is oncogenic or tumor-suppressive. To utilize the expression and activation of NOTCH as a leukemia stem cell biomarker, further investigation is required. Other stemness-related signaling molecules such as WNT, HEDGEHOG, HIF, and mTOR are also under investigation to assess whether they can be used as stem cell biomarkers in a clinical setting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disturbed alternative splicing is frequently observed in cancers, but its precise mechanism remains largely unknown. FUSE-binding protein (FBP) -interacting repressor (FIR) is a transcriptional repressor of the c-myc gene. Previous studies indicated that a splice variant of FIR, FIRDeltaexon2, that lacks exon2 in the transcriptional repressor domain, was increased in colorectal cancers, hepatocellular carcinomas, and leukemia cells. Furthermore, FIRDeltaexon2 activated c-myc transcription by disabling wild-type FIR as a dominant-negative form of FIR. Recently, somatic mutations of the SF3B1 (SAP155) gene, a subunit of the SF3B spliceosome complex, were found in myelodysplastic leukemia. In this study, FIR heterozygous knockout (FIR(+/-)) was established as a dominant-negative model of FIR in the C57BL/6 mouse. FIR(+/-) mice showed an increased c-myc mRNA expression level, particularly in peripheral blood, although FIR(+/-) mice had no apparent pathogenic phenotype. Therefore, an increased c-myc mRNA expression level alone is not enough for leukemogenesis. Nevertheless, FIR(+/-)TP53(-/-) mice generated acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) with increased organ and/or bone marrow invasion. In conclusion, alternative splicing of FIR, generating FIRDeltaexon2, contributes to not only colorectal carcinogenesis but also leukemogenesis independent of the c-Myc activation pathway. Finally, we will discuss our hypothesis that FIRDeltaexon2 interferes with FBW7, that FIRDeltaexon2 inhibits PP1 in the EGFR pathway, and that FIR haploinsufficiency is potentially associated with protein expression through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past few years, small-molecule inhibitors against specific modulators, including the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) bromodomain family of acetylation readers, have shown early promise in the treatment of the genetically defined midline carcinoma and hematopoietic malignancies. We have recently developed a novel potent inhibitor of BET proteins, 1 (XD14[ Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2013, 52, 14055]), which exerts a strong inhibitory potential on the proliferation of specific leukemia cell lines. In the study presented here, we designed analogues of 1 to study the potential of substitutions on the 4-acyl pyrrole backbone to occupy additional sites within the substrate recognition site of BRD4(1). The compounds were profiled using ITC, DSF, and X-ray crystallography. We could introduce several substitutions that address previously untargeted areas of the substrate recognition site. This work may substantially contribute to the development of therapeutics with increased target specificity against BRD4-related malignancies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LIF withdrawal leads to heterogeneous differentiation of mESCs with a proportion of the differentiated cells apoptosising. During LIF withdrawal, cells sequentially enter a reversible and irreversible phase of differentiation during which LIF addition induces different effects. However the regulators and effectors of LIF-mediated reprogramming are poorly understood. By employing a LIF-dependent 'plasticity' test, that we set up, we show that Klf5, but not JunB is a key LIF effector. Furthermore PI3K signaling, required for the maintenance of mESC pluripotency, has no effect on mESC plasticity while displaying a major role in committed cells by stimulating expression of the mesodermal marker Brachyury at the expense of endoderm and neuroectoderm lineage markers. We also show that the MMP1 metalloproteinase, which can replace LIF for maintenance of pluripotency, mimics LIF in the plasticity window, but less efficiently. Finally, we demonstrate that mESCs maintain plasticity and pluripotency potentials in vitro under hypoxic/physioxic growth conditions at 3% O2 despite lower levels of Pluri and Master gene expression in comparison to 20% O2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through structure-based optimization, potent compounds were obtained with significantly improved activity. The two most potent compounds bind to the BRD4 bromodomain, with Kd values of 124 and 137 nM. Selected compounds exhibited high selectivity over other non-BET subfamily members. Notably, compound 85 demonstrated a reasonable antiproliferation effect on MV4;11 leukemia cells and exhibited a good pharmacokinetic profile with high oral bioavailability (75.8%) and moderate half-life (T1/2 = 3.95 h). The resulting lead molecule 85 represents a new, potent, and selective class of BET bromodomain inhibitors for the development of therapeutics to treat cancer and inflammatory diseases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This nationwide cohort study aimed to determine whether survival from childhood cancer in Sweden varies according to parental educational level and household income at the time of the child's diagnosis. METHODS: All children aged 1-14 years with a first primary diagnosis of cancer during 1991 to 2010 identified from the Swedish Cancer Register were included. Using Cox regression, the effects of parental educational level and household income on childhood cancer survival were estimated. RESULTS: For all diagnoses combined (n=4700), children of parents with compulsory or less education and upper-secondary education had poorer survival compared with children with parents who had the highest educational level, adjusted hazard ratios 1.28 (95% confidence interval 1.03-1.59) and 1.17 (1.00-1.38). Results for leukaemia and nervous system tumours showed a similar pattern but were not statistically significant in adjusted analyses. The observed differences began within the first year after diagnosis. Household income was not associated with survival. CONCLUSIONS: Also in Sweden, with universal health care, there are indications of inequalities in survival after childhood cancer diagnosis. Further studies are needed to determine which mechanisms explain the association.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 12.,"Potentiometric and spectrophotometric pH-titration of the multiprotic cytostatics bosutinib for dissociation constants determination were compared. Bosutinib treats patients with positive chronic myeloid leukemia. Bosutinib exhibits four protonatable sites in a pH range from 2 to 11, where two pK are well separated (DeltapK>3), while the other two are near dissociation constants. In the neutral medium, bosutinib occurs in the slightly water soluble form LH that can be protonated to the soluble cation LH4(3+). The molecule LH can be dissociated to still difficultly soluble anion L(-). The set of spectra upon pH from 2 to 11 in the 239.3-375.0nm was divided into two absorption bands: the first one from 239.3 to 290.5nm and the second from 312.3 to 375.0nm, which differ in sensitivity of chromophores to a pH change. Estimates of pK of the entire set of spectra were compared with those of both absorption bands. Due to limited solubility of bosutinib the protonation in a mixed aqueous-methanolic medium was studied. In low methanol content of 3-6% three dissociation constants can be reliably determined with SPECFIT/32 and SQUAD(84) and after extrapolation to zero content of methanol they lead to pKc1=3.43(12), pKc2=4.54(10), pKc3=7.56(07) and pKc4=11.04(05) at 25 degrees C and pKc1=3.44(06), pKc2=5.03(08) pKc3=7.33(05) and pKc4=10.92(06) at 37 degrees C. With an increasing content of methanol in solvent the dissociation of bosutinib is suppressed and the percentage of LH3(2+) decreases and LH prevails. From the potentiometric pH-titration at 25 degrees C the concentration dissociation constants were estimated with ESAB pKc1=3.51(02), pKc2=4.37(02), pKc3=7.97(02) and pKc4=11.05(03) and with HYPERQUAD: pKc1=3.29(12), pKc2=4.24(10), pKc3=7.95(07) and pKc4=11.29(05).",['NOTNLM'],"['Bosutinib', 'Dissociation constants', 'ESAB2M', 'HYPERQUAD', 'INDICES', 'PALLAS', 'Potentiometric Titration', 'SQUAD(84) SPECFIT/32', 'Spectrophotometric titration']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated the cytotoxicity of CuO NPs against K562 cell line (cancerous cell) and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (normal cell). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The toxicity was evaluated using cell viability, oxidative stress and apoptosis detection. In addition, the expression levels of P53, Caspase 3, Bcl-2, and Bax genes in K562 cells were studied by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. RESULTS: CuO NPs exerted distinct effects on cell viability via selective killing of cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner while not impacting normal cells in MTT assay. The dose-dependent cytotoxicity of CuO NPs against K562 cells was shown through reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The CuO NPs induced apoptosis was confirmed through acridine orange and propidium iodide double staining. Tumor suppressor gene P53 was up regulated due to CuO NPs exposure, and increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio suggested mitochondria-mediated pathway is involved in CuO NPs induced apoptosis. We also observed that Caspase 3 gene expression remained unchanged up to 24 hr exposure. CONCLUSION: These molecular alterations provide an insight into CuO NPs-caused inhibition of growth, generation of ROS, and apoptotic death of K562 cells.",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Bax/Bcl-2', 'CuO NPs', 'K562', 'P53', 'ROS']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate how Dnmt3b-mediated DNA methylation affects leukemogenesis, we analyzed leukemia development under conditions of high and physiological methylation levels in a tetracycline-inducible knock-in mouse model. High expression of Dnmt3b slowed leukemia development in serial transplantations and impaired leukemia stem cell (LSC) function. Forced Dnmt3b expression induced widespread DNA hypermethylation inMyc-Bcl2-induced leukemias, preferentially at gene bodies.MLL-AF9-induced leukemogenesis showed much less pronounced DNA hypermethylation upon Dnmt3b expression. Nonetheless, leukemogenesis was delayed in both models with a shared core set of DNA hypermethylated regions and suppression of stem cell-related genes. Acute myeloid leukemia patients with high expression of Dnmt3b target genes showed inferior survival. Together, these findings indicate a critical role for Dnmt3b-mediated DNA methylation in leukemia development and maintenance of LSC function.",,,['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,['Blood. 2016 Mar 24;127(12):1525-6.

Recently, aberrant histone methylation patterns caused by deregulated histone demethylases have been associated with carcinogenesis. However, the role of histone demethylases, particularly the histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase JMJD3, remains largely uncharacterized in melanoma. Here, we used human melanoma cell lines and a mouse xenograft model to demonstrate a requirement for JMJD3 in melanoma growth and metastasis. Notably, in contrast with previous reports examining T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and hepatoma cells, JMJD3 did not alter the general proliferation rate of melanoma cells in vitro. However, JMJD3 conferred melanoma cells with several malignant features such as enhanced clonogenicity, self-renewal, and transendothelial migration. In addition, JMJD3 enabled melanoma cells not only to create a favorable tumor microenvironment by promoting angiogenesis and macrophage recruitment, but also to activate protumorigenic PI3K signaling upon interaction with stromal components. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that JMJD3 transcriptionally upregulated several targets of NF-kappaB and BMP signaling, including stanniocalcin 1 (STC1) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), which functioned as downstream effectors of JMJD3 in self-renewal and macrophage recruitment, respectively. Furthermore, JMJD3 expression was elevated and positively correlated with that of STC1 and CCL2 in human malignant melanoma. Moreover, we found that BMP4, another JMJD3 target gene, regulated JMJD3 expression via a positive feedback mechanism. Our findings reveal a novel epigenetic mechanism by which JMJD3 promotes melanoma progression and metastasis, and suggest JMJD3 as a potential target for melanoma treatment.",,,['(c)2016 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVI1 is a haematopoietic stemness and transcription factor with chromatin remodelling activity. Interestingly, the EVI1 gene also shows overexpression in 6-11% of adult acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cases that do not carry any 3q aberrations. Deregulated expression of EVI1 is strongly associated with monosomy 7 and 11q23 abnormalities, which are known to be associated with poor response to treatment. However, EVI1 overexpression has been revealed as an important independent adverse prognostic marker in adult AML and defines distinct risk categories in 11q23-rearranged AML.

This is the first study to characterize the GI phenotype in BMMRD using both retrospective and prospective surveillance data. METHODS: The International BMMRD Consortium was created to collect information on BMMRD families referred from around the world. All patients had germline biallelic MMR mutations or lack of MMR protein staining in normal and tumor tissue. GI screening data were obtained through medical records with annual updates. RESULTS: Thirty-five individuals from seven countries were identified with BMMRD. GI data were available on 24 of 33 individuals (73%) of screening age, totaling 53 person-years. The youngest age of colonic adenomas was 7, and small bowel adenoma was 11. Eight patients had 19 colorectal adenocarcinomas (CRC; median age 16.7 years, range 8-25), and 11 of 18 (61%) CRC were distal to the splenic flexure. Eleven patients had 15 colorectal surgeries (median 14 years, range 9-25). Four patients had five small bowel adenocarcinomas (SBC; median 18 years, range 11-33). Two CRC and two SBC were detected during surveillance within 6-11 months and 9-16 months, respectively, of last consecutive endoscopy. No patient undergoing surveillance died of a GI malignancy. Familial clustering of GI cancer was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence and penetrance of GI neoplasia in children with BMMRD is high, with rapid development of carcinoma. Colorectal and small bowel surveillance should commence at ages 3-5 and 8 years, respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have shown that residual MM cells following bortezomib treatment are hypoxic. This combination of drug exposure and hypoxia down-regulates their CD138 expression, thereby making this marker unsuitable for detecting residual or other hypoxic MM cells, such as circulating tumour cells, in MM. Hence, we developed an alternative biomarker set which detects myeloma cells independent of their hypoxic and CD138 expression status in vitro, in vivo and in primary MM patients.

This disease manifests after a long clinical latency period of up to 2-3 decades. Two viral gene products, Tax and HBZ, have transforming properties and play a role in the pathogenic process. Genetic and epigenetic cellular changes also occur in HTLV-1-infected cells, which contribute to transformation and disease development. However, the role of cellular factors in transformation is not completely understood. Herein, we examined the role of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) on HTLV-1-mediated cellular transformation and viral gene expression. We found PRMT5 expression was upregulated during HTLV-1-mediated T-cell transformation, as well as in established lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma cell lines and ATLL patient PBMCs. shRNA-mediated reduction in PRMT5 protein levels or its inhibition by a small molecule inhibitor (PRMT5i) in HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes resulted in increased viral gene expression and decreased cellular proliferation. PRMT5i also had selective toxicity in HTLV-1-transformed T-cells. Finally, we demonstrated that PRMT5 and the HTLV-1 p30 protein had an additive inhibitory effect on HTLV-1 gene expression. Our study provides evidence for PRMT5 as a host cell factor important in HTLV-1-mediated T-cell transformation, and a potential target for ATLL treatment.",['NOTNLM'],"['ATLL', 'HBZ', 'HTLV-1', 'PRMT5', 'Tax', 'lymphoma', 'p30', 'transformation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Jan 5.,"Dexamethasone is a key component in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Despite playing a key role in the improved survival of ALL over several decades, intensification of dexamethasone therapy has also contributed to the increased toxicity associated with treatment, which is now seen to be at unacceptable levels given the favourable disease prognosis. Therefore the focus for treatment is now shifting towards reducing toxicity whilst maintaining current survival rates. As approximately 50% of patients were successfully treated on less intensive protocols of the 1980s, it has been questioned whether therapy intensification is necessary in all patients. Furthermore, there remains a subset of children who are still not cured of their disease. New strategies are therefore needed to identify patients who could benefit from dose reduction or intensification. However, adjusting a potentially life threatening therapy is a challenging task, particularly given the heterogeneous nature of ALL. This review focuses on the potential for patient stratification based on our current knowledge of dexamethasone pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenetics and the action of dexamethasone at the cellular level. A carefully designed, combined approach is needed if we are to achieve the aim of improved personalization of dexamethasone therapy for future patients.",['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'dexamethasone', 'personalized medicine', 'pharmacology', 'toxicity']",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1897-8678'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Abl family kinases Abl1 and Abl2 regulate diverse cellular processes during development and normal homeostasis, and their functions are subverted during inflammation, cancer and other pathologies. Abl kinases can be activated by multiple stimuli leading to cytoskeletal reorganization required for cell morphogenesis, motility, adhesion and polarity. Depending on the cellular context, Abl kinases regulate cell survival and proliferation. Emerging data support important roles for Abl kinases in pathologies linked to inflammation. Among these are neurodegenerative diseases and inflammatory pathologies. Unexpectedly, Abl kinases have also been identified as important players in mammalian host cells during microbial pathogenesis. Thus, the use of Abl kinase inhibitors might prove to be effective in the treatment of pathologies beyond leukemia and solid tumors.

The description of symptomatic large granular lymphocyte leukaemia in this setting may generate uncertainty, mostly in those cases in which the CTL expansion (CTLe) persists beyond the early transplantation period. We aimed to assess the nature of CTLe during the post-alloHSCT period in 154 adult patients with a long-term surveillance. We studied the longitudinal kinetics of those expansions, their relationship to clinical events, and their phenotypic and molecular features, including recently reported CTL leukaemia-STAT3 mutations. Persistent relative CTLe cases are frequent (49%), related with thymoglobulin prophylaxis (P </= 0.001), acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD, P = 0.02), and reduced intensity conditioning (P = 0.04).

Epub 2016 Jan 4.,"Histone modifications regulate key processes of eukaryotic genomes. Misregulation of the enzymes that place these modifications can lead to disease. An example of this is DOT1L, the enzyme that can mono-, di-, and trimethylate the nucleosome core on lysine 79 of histone H3 (H3K79). DOT1L plays a role in development and its misregulation has been implicated in several cancers, most notably leukemias caused by a rearrangement of the MLL gene. A DOT1L inhibitor is in clinical trials for these leukemias and shows promising results, yet we are only beginning to understand DOT1L's function and regulation in the cell. Here, we review what happens upstream and downstream of H3K79 methylation. H3K79 methylation levels are highest in transcribed genes, where H2B ubiquitination can promote DOT1L activity. In addition, DOT1L can be targeted to transcribed regions of the genome by several of its interaction partners. Although methylation levels strongly correlate with transcription, the mechanistic link between the two is unclear and probably context-dependent. Methylation of H3K79 may act through recruiting or repelling effector proteins, but we do not yet know which effectors mediate DOT1L's functions. Understanding DOT1L biology better will help us to understand the effects of DOT1L inhibitors and may allow the development of alternative strategies to target the DOT1L pathway.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Chromatin', '*DOT1L', '*H3K79 methylation', '*Histone', '*Transcription']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Loss of Hhex leads to expression of the Cdkn2a-encoded tumor suppressors p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF), which are required for growth arrest and myeloid differentiation following Hhex deletion. Mechanistically, we show that Hhex binds to the Cdkn2a locus and directly interacts with the Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to enable H3K27me3-mediated epigenetic repression.

Our aim was to find a new chemotherapy strategy that is more effective and less toxic. METHODS: MTT assays and a xenograft mouse model were employed to evaluate the synergistic activity of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) combined with topotecan (TPT). Drug-induced DNA damage and apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry analysis with PI and DAPI staining, the comet assay and Western blots. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and a RARalpha plasmid were used to determine whether RARalpha expression influenced DNA damage and apoptosis. RESULTS: We found that ATRA exhibited synergistic activity in combination with Topotecan in AML cells, and the enhanced apoptosis induced by Topotecan plus ATRA resulted from caspase pathway activation. Mechanistically, ATRA dramatically down regulated RARalpha protein levels and led to more DNA damage and ultimately resulted in the synergism of these two agents. In addition, the increased antitumor efficacy of Topotecan combined with ATRA was further validated in the HL60 xenograft mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated, for the first time, that the combination of TPT and ATRA showed potential benefits in AML, providing a novel insight into clinical treatment strategies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Originally identified as transcriptional regulators of the type I interferon system, IRFs play a pivotal role in adaptive immunity, cell growth, differentiation and tumorigenesis. Hence, understanding IRF biology has important implications in the host response to cancer development and progression. Many lines of evidence suggest that different IRFs are involved in the pathogenesis of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), a myeloproliferative disorder caused by the BCR-ABL oncoprotein. BCR-ABL displays constitutive tyrosine kinase activity that favors cell proliferation, inhibits apoptosis and allows cell survival even in the absence of proper adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Different BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors are currently available for CML treatment. These drugs are able to generate eight year CML-specific overall survival rates >90%, only a minority of patients will achieve molecular responses compatible with drug discontinuation. Thus, there is an unmet need for additional therapeutic targets that may lead to the cure of most patients diagnosed with CML. A growing body of evidence has suggested a role for both IRF4 and IRF8 in the pathogenesis of CML. Furthermore, IRF1 is consistently deleted at one or both alleles in patients with leukemia and myelodysplasia. Finally, we have recently demonstrated that IRF5 is a target of BCR-ABL kinase activity and reduces CML cell proliferation. In this article, we provide an update on the current knowledge of the role of the IRFs in CML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) for the years 2004-2010 was performed. All hospitalized leukemic patients aged 18 to 65 years were selected. The association between occurrence of gingivitis/periodontitis and infectious complications was examined by multivariable logistic regression models. A total of 135,692 hospitalizations were due to leukemias during the study period. Among these, gingivitis/periodontitis was present in 0.6%. Septicemia occurred in 27.8% of those who had gingivitis/periodontitis (compared to 19.6% in those without gingivitis/periodontitis), bacterial infections occurred in 19.5% of those who had gingivitis/periodontitis (compared to 10.1% in those without gingivitis/periodontitis), and mycoses occurred in 20.7% of those who had gingivitis/periodontitis (compared to 10.7% in those without gingivitis/periodontitis). Patients who had gingivitis/periodontitis were associated with significantly higher odds for septicemia (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.14-2.19, p = 0.01), bacterial infections (OR = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.51-3.07, p<0.01), mycoses (OR = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.43-3.28, p<0.01), or any infectious complication (OR = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.63-2.84, p<0.01) when compared to their counterparts following adjustment for multiple patient and hospital-level confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: Poor oral health (as defined by the presence of gingivitis/periodontitis) is an independent predictor of increased risk of infectious complications in hospitalized leukemic adults in the United States.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study compared treatment-related morbidity, mortality and cumulative hospitalization in children with AML who were discharged after chemotherapy completion (early discharge) and those who remained hospitalized. Chart abstraction data for 153 early discharge-eligible patients enrolled on a Children's Oncology Group trial were compared by discharge strategy. Targeted toxicities included viridans group streptococcal (VGS) bacteremia, hypoxia and hypotension. Early discharge occurred in 11% of courses post-Induction I. Re-admission occurred in 80-100%, but median hospital stay was 7 days shorter. Patients discharged early had higher rates of VGS (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.11-2.51), hypoxia (aRR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.06-3.48) and hypotension (aRR = 4.36, 95% CI = 2.01-9.46), but there was no difference in mortality.

In particular, early molecular response (EMR; BCR-ABL </=10% on the International Scale at 3 months) has become an accepted benchmark for evaluating whether patients with CML-CP are responding optimally to frontline TKI therapy. Failure to achieve EMR is considered an inadequate initial response according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines and a warning response according to the European LeukemiaNet recommendations. Here we review data supporting the importance of achieving EMR for improving patients' long-term outcomes and discuss key considerations for selecting a frontline TKI in light of these data. Because a higher proportion of patients achieve EMR with second-generation TKIs such as nilotinib and dasatinib than with imatinib, these TKIs may be preferable for many patients, particularly those with known negative prognostic factors at baseline. We also discuss other considerations for frontline TKI choice, including toxicities, cost-effectiveness, and the emerging goals of deep molecular response and treatment-free remission.",['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'early molecular response', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 42 reports (1850 patients) was included. The pooled estimates (95% confidence interval) for 6-month, 1-year, 2-year and 3-year RFS were 77 (59-91)%, 50 (42-57)%, 37 (31-43)% and 31 (25-37)%, respectively. The corresponding numbers for OS were 83 (75-91)%, 68 (62-74)%, 58 (52-64)% and 50 (41-58)%, respectively. There was statistical heterogeneity among studies in all outcomes. In meta-regression, accrual initiation year in 2000 or later was associated with higher 6-month (P=0.012) and 1-year OS (P=0.046), and pre-SCT remission with higher 2-year OS (P=0.047) and 1-year RFS (P=0.016). In conclusion, outcomes of allo-SCT in HL have improved over time, with 5-10% lower non-relapse mortality and relapse rates, and 15-20% higher RFS and OS in studies that initiated accrual in 2000 or later compared with earlier studies.

Furthermore, GI bleeding recurred after the re-administration of IM in one patient. Thus, we consider that the occurrence of GAVE in our patients was induced by IM. Although the precise mechanism of IM-GAVE is not understood, all patients took at least 400 mg/day of IM at the onset of GAVE. Thus, higher doses of IM (>/=400 mg/day) may be a risk factor for IM-GAVE.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated whether galangin could enhance TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in TRAIL resistant renal carcinoma Caki cells. Galangin alone and TRAIL alone had no effect on apoptosis, while combined treatment with galangin and TRAIL significantly induced apoptosis in renal carcinoma (Caki, ACHN and A498) but not normal cells (normal mouse kidney cells and human normal mesangial cells). Galangin induced down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein at the transcriptional level via inhibition of NF-kappaB activation but not p53 pathway. Furthermore, galangin induced down-regulation of cFLIP, Mcl-1 and survivin expression at the post-translational levels, and the over-expression of Bcl-2, cFLIP, Mcl-1 and survivin markedly reduced galangin-induced TRAIL sensitization. In addition, galangin increased proteasome activity, but galangin had no effect on expression of proteasome subunits (PSMA5 and PSMD4). In conclusion, our investigation suggests that galangin is a potent candidate for sensitizer of TRAIL resistant cancer cell therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we aimed to analyze the effects of miRNA-149* on in vitro T-ALL cells and to uncover the target for miRNA-149* in these cells. The miRNA-149* level was determined in multiple cell lines and bone marrow cells derived from patients with T-ALL, B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), and healthy donors. We found that miRNA-149* was highly expressed in T-ALL cell lines and T-ALL patients' bone marrow samples. JunB was identified as a direct target of miR-149*. miRNA-149* mimics downregulated JunB levels in Molt-4 and Jurkat cells, while miRNA-149* inhibitors dramatically upregulated JunB expression in these cells. miRNA-149* mimics promoted proliferation, decreased the proportion of cells in G1 phase, and reduced cell apoptosis in T-ALL cells, while miRNA-149* inhibitors prevented these effects. miRNA-149* mimics downregulated p21 and upregulated cyclinD1, 4EBP1, and p70s6k in Molt-4 and Jurkat cells. Again, inhibitors prevented these effects.

Epub 2015 Nov 27.,"BACKGROUND: Na(+)/H(+) exchanger-1 (NHE-1) is involved in pH regulation and is up-regulated in different malignancies. Activation of NHE-1 is one way for allowing cells to avoid intracellular acidification and protect them against apoptosis. Inhibitors of NHE-1 are able to decrease intracellular pH and induce apoptosis. Some statins can also act by partial inhibition of NHE-1. This review presents progress in understanding the mechanisms of action of these inhibitors, connections with certain genetic mutations and acquired treatment resistance, as well as new patents on them. METHODS: A MEDLINE search for original and review articles using key terms, Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, leukemia, cariporide, and amiloride. Recent patents with NHE-1 inhibitors published by United States Patent and Trademark Office are also presented. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib is used for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia patients carrying internal tandem duplication of fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3-ITD) mutation. 5-(N, N-hexamethylene)-amiloride can increase the suppression of FLT3 signaling by sorafenib. NHE-1 inhibitors are able to increase the sensitivity of chronic myeloid leukemia cells to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including through the inhibition of P-glycoprotein. NHE-1 inhibitors are promising adjuvant drugs for overcoming acquired resistance to treatment in various malignant hemopathies.",['NOTNLM'],"['BCR/ABL', 'FLT3/ITD', 'Na+/H+ exchanger', 'P-glycoprotein', 'amiloride', 'apoptosis', 'cariporide', 'heme oxygenase-1', 'imatinib mesylate', 'intracellular pH', 'isoprenylation', 'leukemia', 'lovastatin', 'sorafenib', 'statins']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vivo administration of SNAP 37889 (1-phenyl-3-[[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]imino]-1H-indol-2-one), a potent small non-peptidergic antagonist of GAL3, was reported to reduce anxiety- and depression-related behavior, ethanol consumption, and antagonizes the effect of galanin on plasma extravasation in rodent models. Accordingly, SNAP 37889 has been proposed as a potential therapeutic agent to treat anxiety and depression disorders. Therefore, we evaluated the toxicity of SNAP 37889 to different cell types. Our experiments revealed that SNAP 37889 (>/=10muM) induced apoptosis in epithelial (HMCB) and microglial (BV-2) cell lines expressing endogenous GAL3, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) expressing GAL2, and in a neuronal cell line (SH-SY5Y) lacking galanin receptor expression altogether. In conclusion, SNAP 37889 is toxic to a variety of cell types independent of GAL3 expression. We caution that the clinical use of SNAP 37889 at doses that might be used to treat anxiety- or depression- related diseases could have unexpected non-galanin receptor-mediated toxicity, especially on immune cells.",['NOTNLM'],"['Anxiety', 'Cytotoxicity', 'Depression', 'Galanin', 'Galanin receptor 3', 'SNAP 37889']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2015 Dec 22.,"The report that the cotton leaf perforator, Bucculatrix thurberiella, is one of the few insect herbivores to attack Gossypium thurberi prompted an investigation of the terpenoids present in the leaves of this wild species of cotton. Members of Gossypium produce subepidermal pigment glands in their leaves that contain the dimeric sesquiterpenoid gossypol as well as other biosynthetically related terpenoids. In addition to gossypol, a previously unknown dimeric sesquiterpenoid, gossypolhemiquinone (GHQ), was identified in trace amounts in G. thurberi, a member of the D genome. Other members of the D genome of Gossypium were subsequently found to contain this compound, but GHQ was not detected in commercial cotton cultivars. When fed to Helicoverpa zea in an artificial diet, GHQ delayed days-to-pupation, reduced pupal weights, and survival to adulthood to a lesser or equal extent than gossypol in comparison to the control diet. However, GHQ had a synergistic effect on survival and days-to-pupation when combined with gossypol at the highest dosage tested (0.18%; 15.5:84.5 GHQ:gossypol). Because gossypol exhibits anti-cancer activity, GHQ was also evaluated for its anti-cancer activity against the National Cancer Institute's 60-Human Tumor Cell Line Screen. Significant inhibitory activity against most of these cell lines was not observed, but the results may offer some promise against leukemia cancer cell lines.",['NOTNLM'],"['Di-sesquiterpenoid', 'Gossypium thurberi', 'Gossypol', 'Gossypolhemiquinone', 'Helicoverpa zea', 'Insect herbivory resistance', 'Malvaceae']",['Published by Elsevier Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical data of two patients from Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 1994 to 2014 as well as patients reported in English literature (from PubMed and Medline databases) and Chinese literature (China Hospital Knowledge Database) during the same period were retrospectively analysed. Data were extracted and analyzed using Chi-square tests. RESULTS: Totally 15 patients worldwide were available for analysis with a male-to-female ratio of 12:3 and an acute myeloid leukemia to acute lymphoblastic leukemia ratio of 10:5. The median age was 49.5 years (range:27-80 years). Most patients were neutropenic at the time of onset of fever,and the most common manifestation was lower limb infection (66.7%). Despite empirical antibiotics treatment,the mortality was still as high as 80%. Chi-square tests revealed that among the dead patients,the rates of lower limb infection (P<0.01) and septic shock (P=0.02) were significantly higher. CONCLUSION: Aeromonas sobria infection is an uncommon but highly fatal condition that requires special attention in clinical settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM) is a clonal pre-leukemic disorder that progresses to myeloid leukemia of Down syndrome (ML-DS) through the accumulation of genetic alterations. To investigate the mechanism underlying leukemogenesis, a xenograft model of TAM was established using NOG mice. Serial engraftment after cell transplantation from a TAM patient who developed ML-DS a year later showed the self-renewal capacity of these cells. We detected a GATA1 mutation but no copy number alterations (CNAs) in the primary patient sample by conventional genomic sequencing and CNA profiling. However, engrafted TAM-derived cells showed the emergence of divergent subclones with another GATA1 mutation and various CNAs, including a 16q deletion and 1q gain, both of which are clinically associated with ML-DS. Detailed genetic analysis identified minor subclones with a 16q deletion or this distinct GATA1 mutation in the primary patient sample.

However, quiescent HSCs are vulnerable to mutagenesis due to low-fidelity DNA repair. The mechanism by which HSCs avoid mutation accumulation remains to be elucidated. HSCs are normally resistant to apoptosis because of their abundant expressions of pro-survival Bcl-2 family genes. In contrast, p53 is activated in HSCs in response to DNA damage. We have recently shown that pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 signals are activated through p53 preferentially in HSCs with damaged DNA. Aspp1, an apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53, is highly expressed in HSCs and coordinates with p53 to maintain the genomic soundness of the HSC pool. In this review, we will summarize apoptosis regulation and the roles of p53 in HSCs, and introduce our findings showing coordinated regulations of HSC self-renewal, DNA damage tolerance and hematological malignancies by Aspp1 and p53.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these mutations are rare in pediatric AML cases, indicating that pathogeneses differ between adult and pediatric forms of AML. Meanwhile, the recent development of massively parallel sequencing technologies has provided a new opportunity to discover genetic changes across entire genomes or proteincoding sequences. In order to reveal a complete registry of gene mutations, we performed whole exome resequencing of paired tumor-normal specimens from 19 pediatric AML cases using Illumina HiSeq 2000. In total, 80 somatic mutations or 4.2 mutations per sample were identified. Many of the recurrent mutations identified in this study involved previously reported targets in AML, such as FLT3, CEBPA, KIT, CBL, NRAS, WT1 and EZH2. On the other hand, several genes were newly identified in the current study, including BCORL1 and major cohesin components such as SMC3 and RAD21. Whole exome resequencing revealed a complex array of gene mutations in pediatric AML genomes.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 88 untreated Iranian adult patients with CN-AML were selected as a study group. Exons 7 (including the SNP rs16754), 8, and 9 as a WT1 gene hotspot region were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing for detection of mutations. Response to treatment and clinical outcome including overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were evaluated according to WT1 gene mutational status. RESULTS: WT1 gene mutations were found in 12.5% of patients, most of which were found in exon 7. Complete remission was lower and relapse was higher in patients with WT1 gene mutation compared with WT1 gene wild type patients. OS and DFS was significantly lower in patients with WT1 gene mutation compared with patients with WT1 gene wild type (P < .001). Also, we did not find any significant effects of SNP rs16754 in exon 7 on clinical outcome and survival in patients with CN-AML. CONCLUSION: WT1 gene mutations are a predictor indicator of a poor prognosis factor in CN-AML patients. It is recommended that WT1 gene mutations be included in the molecular testing panel in order to better diagnose and confirm their prognostic significance for better management and treatment strategy.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloblastic leukemia', 'Clinical outcome', 'Prognosis', 'Survival', ""Wilms' tumor gene""]",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We report here that HoxBlinc RNA first specifies Flk1(+) mesoderm and then promotes hematopoietic differentiation through regulation of hoxb pathways. HoxBlinc binds to the hoxb genes, recruits Setd1a/MLL1 complexes, and mediates long-range chromatin interactions to activate transcription of the hoxb genes. Depletion of HoxBlinc by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genetic deletion inhibits expression of hoxb genes and other factors regulating cardiac/hematopoietic differentiation. Reduced hoxb expression is accompanied by decreased recruitment of Set1/MLL1 and H3K4me3 modification, as well as by reduced chromatin loop formation. Re-expression of hoxb2-b4 genes in HoxBlinc-depleted embryoid bodies rescues Flk1(+) precursors that undergo hematopoietic differentiation. Thus, HoxBlinc plays an important role in controlling hoxb transcription networks that mediate specification of mesoderm-derived Flk1(+) precursors and differentiation of Flk1(+) cells into hematopoietic lineages.",['NOTNLM'],"['HoxBlinc lincRNA', 'SETD1A and MLL1 HMTs', 'chromatin looping', 'hoxb gene activation', 'mesoderm specification']",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

It requires immunosuppressive treatments that broadly abrogate T cell responses including beneficial ones directed against tumor cells or infective pathogens. Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is overexpressed in many cancer types including leukemia, and clinical studies demonstrated that targeting PLK1 using selective PLK1 inhibitors resulted in inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis predominantly in tumor cells, supporting the feasibility of PLK1 as target for anticancer therapy. Here, we show that activation of alloreactive T cells (Tallo) up-regulate expression of PLK1, suggesting that PLK1 is a potential new candidate for dual therapy of aGvHD and leukemia after ASCT. Inhibition of PLK1, using PLK1-specific inhibitor GSK461364A selectively depletes Tallo by preventing activation and by inducing apoptosis in already activated Tallo, while memory T cells are preserved. Activated Tallo cells which survive exposure to PLK1 undergo inhibition of proliferation by induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest, which is accompanied by accumulation of cell cycle regulator proteins p21(WAF/CIP1), p27(Kip1), p53 and cyclin B1, whereas abundance of CDK4 decreased. We also show that suppressive effects of PLK1 inhibition on Tallo were synergistically enhanced by concomitant inhibition of molecular chaperone Hsp90. Taken together, our data suggest that PLK1 inhibition represents a reasonable dual strategy to suppress residual tumor growth and efficiently deplete Tallo, and thus provide a rationale to selectively prevent and treat aGvHD.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute graft-versus-host disease', '*Allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*Alloreactive T cell depletion', '*Transplant conditioning']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carvacrol showed a potent cytotoxic effect on both cells with dose-dependent increase in the level of free radical formation as measured by an oxidation sensitive fluorescent dye, 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) levels. The reduction in the level of antioxidants such as catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (P<0.05) was observed in carvacrol-treated cells. The major cytotoxic effect appears to be intervened by the induction of apoptotic cell death as assessed by annexin-V labeling assay using flow cytometry. Western blot analysis showed that Bax expression was increased, whereas Bcl-2 expression was significantly decreased in carvacrol exposed HL-60 cells and Jurkat cells. Further studies revealed that the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential of intact cells was accompanied by the activation of caspase-3. Our results found that the potential mechanism of cellular apoptosis induced by carvacrol is mediated by caspase-3 and is associated with the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, generation of free radicals, and depletion of the intracellular antioxidant pool.",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Cancer', 'Carvacrol', 'Caspase', 'HL-60', 'Jurkat']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) is an infrequently reported adverse effect of ATRA. METHODS: We examined the incidence, clinical course, and outcomes of patients with APL treated on Intergroup Protocol 0129 (I0129) who developed PTC. This trial evaluated the role of ATRA alone during induction and/or as maintenance therapy. RESULTS: Of the patients on trial, 240 received ATRA during induction, maintenance, or both; 8 had a clinical suspicion for PTC. Upon review of individual cases, this was felt to be ""probable"" in 4 patients, ""possible"" in 1 and ""unlikely"" in 3 due to lack of diagnostic criteria or presence of a more likely alternate diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: ""Probable"" PTC occurred in 1.7% of patients who received ATRA during induction and/or maintenance therapy. In agreement with previous reports, the incidence of PTC in APL patients receiving ATRA was higher in the pediatric population.

This retrospective study aimed to assess the role of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for diagnosing extramedullary AL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PET/CT examinations were performed in 9 patients with newly diagnosed AL, and 70 patients suspected to have recurrent AL. All the patients were diagnosed with AL by bone marrow biopsy. The diagnosis of extramedullary lesions was established according to the combination of pathology, physical examination, and imaging techniques including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET/CT, and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytologic testing, and clinical follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 79 patients, including 34 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 45 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases, 30 patients were diagnosed with extramedullary AL. (18)F-FDG PET/CT demonstrated (18)F-FDG positive lesions in the extramedullary regions in 42 patients. Among them, 28 patients were diagnosed to have extramedullary AL and the other 14 were diagnosed with non-hematological malignancies (false positive disease). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of (18)F-FDG PET/CT in diagnosing extramedullary involvement of AL were 93.3% (28/30), 71.4% (35/49), and 79.7%, respectively. The (18)F-FDG uptake of lesions was not significantly different between extramedullary AL and false positive cases (SUVmax: 6.66 +/- 2.65 vs. 5.85 +/- 1.88, t=1.275, P=0.206). The FDG uptake of extramedullary AL between ALL and AML were also not significantly different (SUVmax: 7.01 +/- 2.82 vs. 6.10 +/- 2.29, t=1.332, P=0.188). The predominant locations of extramedullary AL were the spleen, soft tissue, lymph nodes, central nerve system, liver, testis, and kidney. A total of 48.2% (27/56) of extramedullary AL lesions presented as diffuse FDG uptake compared with 6.25% (1/16) in the false positive lesions (chi(2)=9.221, P=0.002). CONCLUSION: (18)F-FDG PET/CT is a sensitive, but not specific imaging modality for diagnosing extramedullary AL. Diffuse (18)F-FDG uptake in extramedullary lesions may indicate leukemia involvement.",['NOTNLM'],"['(18)F-FDG', 'Acute leukemia', 'Diagnosis', 'Extramedullary', 'PET/CT']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Epub 2015 Dec 23.,"Hypoxic conditions are suggested to affect the differentiation status of stem cells (SC), including embryonic stem cells (ESC). Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is one of the main intracellular molecules responsible for the cellular response to hypoxia. Hypoxia stabilizes HIF by inhibiting the activity of HIF prolyl-hydroxylases (PHD), which are responsible for targeting HIF-alpha subunits for proteosomal degradation. To address the impact of HIF stabilization on the maintenance of the stemness signature of mouse ESC (mESC), we tested the influence of the inhibition of PHDs and hypoxia (1% O2 and 5% O2) on spontaneous ESC differentiation triggered by leukemia inhibitory factor withdrawal for 24 and 48 h. The widely used panhydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) and PHD inhibitor JNJ-42041935 (JNJ) with suggested higher specificity towards PHDs were employed. Both inhibitors and both levels of hypoxia significantly increased HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha protein levels and HIF transcriptional activity in spontaneously differentiating mESC. This was accompanied by significant downregulation of cell proliferation manifested by the complete inhibition of DNA synthesis and partial arrest in the S phase after 48 h. Further, HIF stabilization enhanced downregulation of the expressions of some pluripotency markers (OCT-4, NANOG, ZFP-42, TNAP) in spontaneously differentiating mESC. However, at the same time, there was also a significant decrease in the expression of some genes selected as markers of cell differentiation (e.g. SOX1, BRACH T, ELF5). In conclusion, the short term stabilization of HIF mediated by the PHD inhibitors JNJ and DMOG and hypoxia did not prevent the spontaneous loss of pluripotency markers in mESC. However, it significantly downregulated the proliferation of these cells.",['NOTNLM'],"['DMOG', 'Embryonic stem cells', 'HIF-1', 'Hypoxia', 'JNJ-42041935', 'Prolyl hydroxylase']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, the function of LIF on the regulation of adhesion molecule expression and promotion of trophoblast adhesion to endometrial cells has not been fully elucidated. Here we show that LIF significantly induced mRNA expression of ITGAV, ITGB3, and ITGB5 in endometrial cells, as evidenced by RT-PCR and qRT-PCR analysis. Based on the results from treatment of antagonist for LIF receptor (hLA), LIF positively regulates expression of integrin alphaV, beta3, and beta5, and adhesion of the human trophectoderm-derived JAr cells to endometrial Ishikawa cells. Furthermore, the adhesion between trophoblastic cells and LIF-stimulated endometrial cells was significantly reduced by neutralization of LIF-mediated integrin beta3 and beta5 expression on endometrial cell surface with integrin subunit beta3 and beta5 antibodies. Taken together, we firstly demonstrate that LIF enhances the adhesion of trophoblastic cells to endometrial cells by up-regulating expression of integrin heterodimer alphaVbeta3 and alphaVbeta5, indicating the promotion of endometrial receptivity for embryo implantation.",['NOTNLM'],"['Endometrium', 'Implantation', 'Integrin', 'Leukemia inhibitory factor', 'Trophoblast']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The Cancer and Leukemia Group B 30504 trial was a randomized phase II study of the effect of sunitinib versus placebo in ES-SCLC patients responding to platinum-based systemic therapy. The study required preenrollment brain imaging. PCI was provided at the discretion of treating physicians. We performed a secondary analysis of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B trial to determine the impact of PCI on patients with ES-SCLC. METHODS: Fisher's exact test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test were conducted to identify the differences between patients receiving PCI and patients not receiving PCI. Kaplan-Meier analyses described progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients in the PCI and non-PCI groups. RESULTS: A total of 85 patients received maintenance therapy (41 received placebo and 44 received sunitinib). Patient characteristics were balanced between the PCI and non-PCI groups. The patients receiving PCI plus sunitinib had a nonsignificant 2.7-month improvement in PFS (5.0 months versus 2.3 months, p = 0.14, hazard risk [HR] = 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.33-1.18) trending toward improved OS (8.9 months versus 5.4 months, p = 0.053, HR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.22-1.03). PCI was associated with a trend toward improved median PFS (2.9 months versus 2.2 months, p = 0.096, HR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.45-1.07) but not median OS (8.3 months in the PCI group versus 8.7 months in the non-PCI group, p = 0.76, HR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.67-1.71). The patients receiving placebo had no improvement in PFS or OS with PCI. CONCLUSIONS: Trends toward improved PFS and OS were seen in patients receiving PCI and sunitinib, thus supporting the need for further prospective research evaluating the integration of maintenance systemic therapy and PCI for patients with ES-SCLC. Improved outcomes for patients with ES-SCLC after induction chemotherapy may require PCI, thoracic radiotherapy, and maintenance systemic therapy to achieve control of both intracranial and extracranial disease.",['NOTNLM'],"['Extensive-stage small cell lung cancer', 'Maintenance chemotherapy', 'Prophylactic cranial irradiation', 'Sunitinib', 'Survival']","['Copyright (c) 2015 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Milk samples were tested for the presence of anti-BLV antibodies by ELISA. Additional data regarding the cows and the herds were collected by farm survey and Dairy Herd Improvement records. A set of mixed-effect models using all cows and only 2+ parity cows were used to investigate the association between BLV ELISA-corrected optical density and 305-d mature equivalents of individual cows. The BLV milk positivity was associated with decreased 305-d mature-equivalent yields, especially among the older cows. Additionally, increasing milk ELISA-corrected optical density was associated with increasing loss of milk production at the cow level.

Epub 2015 Dec 24.,"BACKGROUND: Pretreatment with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) decreases the occurrence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (CGVHD) after haemopoietic cell transplantation from an unrelated donor, but evidence of patient benefit is absent. We did a study to test whether ATG provides patient benefit, particularly in reducing the need for long-term immunosuppressive treatment after transplantation. METHODS: We did a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial at ten transplant centres in Canada and one in Australia. Eligible patients were aged 16 to 70 years with any haematological malignancy and a Karnofsky score of at least 60 receiving either myeloablative or non-myeloablative (or reduced intensity) conditioning preparative regimens before haemopoietic cell transplantation from an unrelated donor. We allocated patients first by simple randomisation (1:1), then by a minimisation method, to either pretransplantation rabbit ATG plus standard GVHD prophylaxis (ATG group) or standard GVHD prophylaxis alone (no ATG group). We gave a total dose of ATG of 4.5 mg/kg intravenously over 3 days (0.5 mg/kg 2 days before transplantation, 2.0 mg/kg 1 day before, and 2.0 mg/kg 1 day after). The primary endpoint was freedom from all systemic immunosuppressive drugs without resumption up to 12 months after transplantation. Analysis was based on a modified intention-to-treat method. This trial was registered at ISRCTN, number 29899028. FINDINGS: Between June 9, 2010, and July 8, 2013, we recruited and assigned 203 eligible patients to treatment (101 to ATG and 102 to no ATG). 37 (37%) of 99 patients who received ATG were free from immunosuppressive treatment at 12 months compared with 16 (16%) of 97 who received no ATG (adjusted odds ratio 4.25 [95% CI 1.87-9.67]; p=0.00060. The occurrence of serious adverse events (Common Terminology Criteria grades 4 or 5) did not differ between the treatment groups (34 [34%] of 99 patients in the ATG group vs 41 [42%] of 97 in the no ATG group). Epstein-Barr virus reactivation was substantially more common in patients who received ATG (20 [one of whom died-the only death due to an adverse event]) versus those who did not receive ATG (two [no deaths]). No deaths were attributable to ATG. INTERPRETATION: ATG should be added to myeloblative and non-myeloblative preparative regimens for haemopoietic cell transplantation when using unrelated donors. The benefits of decreases in steroid use are clinically significant. Epstein-Barr virus reactivation is increased, but is manageable by prospective monitoring and the use of rituximab. Future trials could determine whether the doses of ATG used in this trial are optimum, and could also provide additional evidence of a low relapse rate after non-myeloablative regimens.

Invasive mucormycosis of other anatomical sites is relatively infrequent and its pathogenesis has not so far been well elucidated. Here, we describe an autopsy case of pulmonary invasive mucormycosis complicated by cerebral embolism with infarct. A 77-year-old Japanese woman with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia complained of left visual disturbance and weakness of the lower limbs. The diagnosis of leukemic infiltration to the central nervous system was made. Repeated intrathecal injection of methotrexate plus cytarabine resulted in partial amelioration of the neurologic symptoms. However, the patient then developed fever, dyspnea, and subsequent right hemiparesis. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a consolidative shadow with halo sign in the left lung field, which was compatible with either invasive pulmonary aspergillosis or mucormycosis. These findings accounted for fever and dyspnea, but not hemiparesis. Despite antifungal therapy, the patient succumbed to death after two weeks. Autopsy revealed pulmonary invasive mucormycosis with a fungal ball in the lumina of the adjacent ascending aorta. Intriguingly, autopsy and postmortem CT scan identified left cerebral infarct due to mucormycosis, which accounted for the right hemiparesis.

The average age of the seven patients was 63.4 years. Moreover, bulge of the upper right abdomen and progressive athrepsia and anemia were observed in all seven patients. Computed tomography (CT) revealed the presence of multiple solid hypodense lesions. Further, CT also revealed an enhanced irregular focus. Histopathological analysis revealed the following characteristics: heavy infiltration composed mainly of medium-sized round cells with a lightly stained cytoplasm, prominent nucleoli and vesicular nuclei, nuclear fission and visible sky star phenomena. The tumor cells showed diffuse expression of CD19, CD20, and CD79a, with the percentage of Ki67-positive cells being 75%-80%. All these findings indicated that primary hepatic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is rare and generally has a poor prognosis. Biopsy and immunohistochemical staining are helpful in its diagnosis.

It has been previously shown to promote breast cancer progression by inducing the epithelial to mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cells as well as by enhancing angiogenesis. Lcn2 levels in urine and tissue samples of breast cancer patients has also been correlated with breast cancer status and poor patient prognosis. In this study, we have engineered a novel liposomal small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery system to target triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) via a recently identified molecular target, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). This ICAM-1-targeted, Lcn2 siRNA- encapsulating liposome (ICAM-Lcn2-LP) binds human TNBC MDA-MB-231cells significantly stronger than non-neoplastic MCF-10A cells. Efficient Lcn2 knockdown by ICAM-Lcn2-LPs led to a significant reduction in the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from MDA-MB-231 cells, which, in turn, led to reduced angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Angiogenesis (neovascularization) is a requirement for solid tumor growth and progression, and its inhibition is an important therapeutic strategy for human cancers. Our results indicate that a tumor-specific strategy such as the TNBC-targeted, anti-angiogenic therapeutic approach developed here, may be clinically useful in inhibiting TNBC progression.",['NOTNLM'],"['ICAM-1', 'Lipocalin-2', 'angiogenesis', 'liposomal siRNA', 'triple-negative breast cancer']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mRNA expression levels of p65 and TNF-alpha were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and Pearson's Correlation test was used to demonstrate the correlation between TNF-alpha and p65 expression levels in AML specimens. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to determine whether TNF-alpha and p65 expression levels could be used to differentiate AML samples from non-leukemia samples. MG132 and anti-TNF-alpha antibody were used to inhibit the expression of p65 and TNF-alpha in the AML cell line, HL-60. The expression of p65 and TNF-alpha were detected by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. The mRNA expression levels of p65 and TNF-alpha were significantly increased in AML patients compared with non-leukemia control bone marrow samples by RT-qPCR, and the two molecules expression pattern's exhibited sufficient predictive power to distinguish AML patients from non-leukemia control samples. Pearson's correlation analysis demonstrated that TNF-alpha expression was strongly correlated with p65 expression in AML bone marrow samples.

However, the incidence of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (t-MDS/AML) has increased. In order to further the understanding of the mechanisms of t-MDS/AML and reduce its incidence, the present study reports 4 cases of t-AML following treatment for lymphoma. The 4 patients presented aggressive forms of lymphoma in stage III/IV, and 3 were diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. All patients had previously undergone chemotherapy containing alkylating agents and/or topoisomerase II inhibitors. The latency period between the time of primary diagnosis and occurrence of t-AML ranged from 15 to 42 months. At the time of diagnosis of t-AML, 3 of the 4 patients presented pancytopenia, whilst the remaining patient exhibited leukocytosis. The majority of the patients succumbed to their disease within 1 year of t-AML diagnosis, with the exception of the patient in case 3, who survived following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The present cases indicate that an advanced stage of disease at the time of primary diagnosis, prior exposure to radiotherapy, and administration of >/=4 regimens and >/=8 cycles of chemotherapy may be risk factors for the development of t-AML. Based on the present findings and a review of the literature, we propose that allo-HSCT should be recommended for patients at high risk of developing t-AML. In addition, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy may constitute a novel type of immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer, particularly for cases of relapsed and refractory lymphoma or leukemia.",['NOTNLM'],"['chemotherapy', 'chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy', 'lymphoma', 'therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RET, a tyrosine kinase receptor; its expression levels are associated with the differentiation degree of acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) cells. The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene inhibits cell proliferation and tumor growth, participates in the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells and induces cell apoptosis. However, the association between the expression levels of HO-1, RET and PML genes and the risk stratification of AML and prognosis have not previously been reported. In the present study, HO-1 was expressed in the human AML Kasumi-1, HL-60 and THP-1 cell lines, and HO-1 expression was regulated by Hemin (20 micromol/l) and ZnPPIX (10 micromol/l). Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis demonstrated that expression of RET and PML were positively and negatively correlated with HO-1 expression, respectively. Bone marrow samples (18 favorable, 55 intermediate, 15 adverse and 2 unknown karyotype AML cases and 20 healthy donors) were collected from 90 randomly selected AML patients upon their first visit. The mRNA and protein expression of HO-1, RET and PML in samples was detected by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. At the mRNA level, the adverse group expressed significantly higher levels of HO-1 and RET compared with the levels in the favorable and normal groups. The PML mRNA expression levels in adverse patient samples was lower compared with those of the intermediate group and favorable group. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of HO-1, RET and PML proteins in all risk groups exhibited the same pattern of expression as was observed for the mRNA levels. The overall survival and relapse-free survival rates were shortest in AML patients with high HO-1 expression (Kaplan-Meier; log-rank, P<0.01). The results of the present study therefore indicate that HO-1, RET and PML may be critical in the risk-stratification and prognosis of AML. However, additional samples and clinical data should be collected and analyzed in order to provide stronger evidence for this hypothesis.",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'HO-1', 'PML', 'RET', 'prognosis', 'risk stratification']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, novel therapeutic strategies are required in order to address the emerging problem of imatinib resistance. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and proteasome inhibitors are promising alternatives, and may be amenable to integration with current therapeutic approaches. However, the mechanisms underlying the interaction between these two agents remain unclear. The present study assessed the cytotoxic effect of the HDACi, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), in combination with the proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, in imatinib-sensitive K562 and imatinib-resistant K562G cells, and investigated the mechanism underlying this effect. Cell viability was measured using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method and protein expression levels were determined by western blotting. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation levels were observed under a fluorescence microscope The results indicated that SAHA and MG-132 act in a synergistic manner to induce cell death in K562 and K562G cells. This effect was associated with Bcr-Abl downregulation and the production of ROS. Notably, the ROS scavenger, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, almost fully reversed the cell death and Bcr-Abl downregulation that was induced by the combination of SAHA and MG-132. By contrast, the pan-caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk, only partially reversed the cell death induced by these two drugs in CML cells. These results indicated that increased intracellular ROS levels are important in the induction of cell death and the downregulation of Bcr-Abl. In conclusion, the present results suggested that combined SAHA and MG-132 may be a promising treatment for CML.",['NOTNLM'],"['Bcr-Abl', 'MG-132', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'reactive oxygen species', 'suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 2.,"MicroRNA-181 (miR-181) has been recently demonstrated to participate in the differentiation and development of immune cells, including natural killer cells and B and T lymphocytes, and myeloid linages, including erythroid and megakaryocytic cells. The aberrant expression of miR-181, particularly low expression levels, has been observed in a number of leukemia types, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and cytogenetically abnormal acute myeloid leukemia. However, the expression and function of miR-181 in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) remains unknown. In the present study, the aberrant expression of miR-181a was analyzed in a patient with CML and in the CML K562 cell line. In addition, the function and potential mechanisms of miR-181a in K562 cells with regard to their chemotherapeutic sensitivity to imatinib were investigated. The expression levels of miR-181a were significantly reduced in the patient with CML and in the CML K562 cell line. Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-181a in the K562 cells enhanced the chemotherapeutic sensitivity of these cells to imatinib. The potential mechanism mediating these effects may be associated with the capacity of miR-181a to inhibit cell growth and/or to induce cells apoptosis and differentiation in K562 cells. The results of the present study suggested that miR-181a may be a target for the treatment of CML and a useful indicator of the therapeutic sensitivity of CML to imatinib.",['NOTNLM'],"['chemotherapeutic sensitivity', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'microRNA-181a']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We provide cancer statistics of 33,201 patients from all Sudan diagnosed at the Radiation and Isotope Centre in Khartoum (RICK). This hospital covers approximately 80% of patients with cancer in Sudan and is, therefore, considered representative for the situation in this country. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 2009-2013 were collected at RICK. Cancer diagnoses were made by standard pathological and radiological methods. Epidemiological data were categorized by age, gender, resident state, marital status etc. and subjected to statistical analyses by SPSS 21v. RESULTS: The cancer prevalence rate per year was 5,000-7,000 among adults and 300-400 among children, with increasing tendency for adults. Male:female ratios were 1:1.18 for adults and 1.46:1 for children. The five most frequent tumour types were breast cancer, leukaemia, prostatic carcinoma, lymphoma and colorectal carcinoma in adults and leukaemia, lymphoma, eye tumours, sarcoma and brain tumours in children. Remarkably, the median age of cancer diagnosis was 10-20 years higher in men than in women, mainly due to earlier onset of gender-related tumours in females (cancer of breast, cervix, or ovary) than in men (prostatic carcinoma). Chronic myeloid leukaemia was the most frequent haematopoietic malignancy in adults and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in children. Comparing cancer cases with population numbers of Sudanese states, Northern Sudan, River Nile and Khartoum revealed up to 8-fold higher cancer incidence rates than Al Gedarif, Southern Dafur and Blue Nile. The other states had intermediate incidence rates. Interestingly, oesophageal carcinoma occurred proportionally more frequently in Kassala (rank 3) than in the entire Sudan (rank 7) or other states. CONCLUSION: This is the largest survey on cancer burden in Sudan. It may serve as basis for governmental programmes for assessing risk factors, improving cancer prevention (e.g. by educational and vaccination programmes) and cancer therapy in the future.",['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer statistics', 'Sub-Saharan Africa', 'epidemiology', 'neoplasms', 'risk factors']","['Copyright(c) 2016 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dysregulation of mTOR signaling pathway, consisting of mTOR complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2, is a promising therapeutic target in some human malignancies. We examined antitumor effects of Torin2 in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL)-related cell lines compared to those of rapamycin, a classical mTOR inhibitor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell growth was monitored by detecting viable cells with Cell Counting Kit-8 or trypan blue. Cell cycle was studied by flow cytometric analysis. The phosphorylation status of proteins in the mTOR signaling pathway was examined by western blot analysis. RESULTS: Torin2 exhibited greater efficacy in cell growth inhibition than rapamycin, associated with a strong reduction of phosphorylated v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT) (Ser 473), that is downstream of mTORC2. CONCLUSION: Since mTORC2 activates AKT, Torin2 might inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2, resulting in stronger growth inhibition of ATL cells.",['NOTNLM'],"['AKT', 'Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', 'growth inhibition', 'mammalian target of rapamycin']","['Copyright(c) 2016 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, emerging data on epigenetic changes during tumor progression and use of epigenetic therapies have shown that epigenetic modifications leading to chemotherapy resistance have the potential to be reversible with epigenetic therapy. In fact, promising clinical data exist that treatment with epigenetic agents can diminish chemotherapy resistance in a number of tumor types including chronic myelogenous leukemia, colorectal, ovarian, lung and breast cancer.

We re-evaluated a large family with acute myeloid leukemia originally seen at NIH in 1969. We used whole exome sequencing to study this family, and conducted in silico bioinformatics analysis, protein structural modeling and laboratory experiments to assess the impact of the identified CEBPA Q311P mutation. Unlike most previously identified germline mutations in CEBPA, which were N-terminal frameshift mutations, we identified a novel Q311P variant that was located in the C-terminal bZip domain of C/EBPalpha. Protein structural modeling suggested that the Q311P mutation alters the ability of the CEBPA dimer to bind DNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the Q311P mu-tant had attenuated binding to DNA, as predicted by the protein modeling. Consistent with these findings, we found that the Q311P mutation has reduced transactivation, consistent with a loss-of-function mutation. From 45 years of follow up, we observed incomplete penetrance (46%) of CEBPA Q311P. This study of a large multi-generational pedigree reveals that a germline mutation in the C-terminal bZip domain can alter the ability of C/EBP-alpha to bind DNA and reduces transactivation, leading to acute myeloid leukemia.",,,['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,"['NCI DCEG Cancer Genomics Research Laboratory', 'NCI DCEG Cancer Sequencing Working Group']",,,,,,,,

Natural killer cell receptor repertoires are diversified by a stochastic expression of killer-cell-immunoglobulin-like receptors and lectin-like receptors such as NKG2 receptors. All individuals harbor a subset of natural killer cells expressing NKG2A, the inhibitory checkpoint receptor for HLA-E. Most neoplastic and normal hematopoietic cells express HLA-E, the inhibitory ligand of NKG2A. A novel anti-human NKG2A antibody induced tumor cell death, suggesting that the antibody could be useful in the treatment of cancers expressing HLA-E. We found that immunodeficient mice, co-infused with human primary leukemia or Epstein-Barr virus cell lines and NKG2A(+) natural killer cells, pre-treated with anti-human NKG2A, were rescued from disease progression. Human NKG2A(+) natural killer cells reconstituted in immunodeficient mice after transplantation of human CD34(+) cells. These natural killer cells are able to kill engrafted human primary leukemia or Epstein-Barr virus cell lines by lysis after intraperitoneal administration of anti-human NKG2A. Thus, this anti-NKG2A may exploit the anti-leukemic action of the wave of NKG2A(+) natural killer cells recovering after hematopoietic stem cell transplants or adoptive therapy with natural killer cell infusions from matched or mismatched family donors after chemotherapy for acute leukemia, without the need to search for a natural killer cell alloreactive donor.",,,['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The initial goal of treatment is the achievement of complete remission, defined for over 40 years by morphology. However, without additional post-remission treatment the majority of patients relapse. In many cases of acute myeloid leukemia, allogeneic stem cell transplantation offers the best prospects of cure. In 2013, 5608 stem cell transplantations in acute myeloid leukemia were performed in Europe (5228 allogeneic and 380 autologous stem cell transplantations). Most stem cell transplantations are performed in first complete remission. However, despite a considerable reduction in the chance of relapse, in most studies, overall survival benefit of allogeneic stem cell transplantation is modest due to substantial non-relapse mortality. Here we discuss the many factors related to the risk of relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.",,,['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 31.,"BACKGROUND: The evidence on the relation of family history of cancers other than breast cancer to breast cancer risk is conflicting, and most studies have not assessed specific breast cancer subtypes. METHODS: We assessed the relation of first-degree family history of breast, prostate, lung, colorectal, ovarian, and cervical cancer and lymphoma or leukemia, to the risk of estrogen receptor-positive (ER(+)), ER(-), and triple-negative breast cancer in data from the African American Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk Consortium. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: There were 3,023 ER(+) and 1,497 ER(-) breast cancer cases (including 696 triple-negative cases) and 17,420 controls. First-degree family history of breast cancer was associated with increased risk of each subtype: OR = 1.76 (95% CI, 1.57-1.97) for ER(+), 1.67 (1.42-1.95) for ER(-), and 1.72 (1.38-2.13) for triple-negative breast cancer. Family history of cervical cancer was associated with increased risk of ER(-) (OR = 2.39; 95% CI, 1.36-4.20), but not ER(+) cancer. Family history of both breast and prostate cancer was associated with increased risk of ER(+) (3.40; 2.42-4.79) and ER(-) (2.09; 1.21-3.63) cancer, but family history of both breast and lung cancer was associated only with ER(-) cancer (2.11; 1.29-3.46). CONCLUSIONS: A family history of cancers other than breast may influence the risk of breast cancer, and associations may differ by subtype. IMPACT: Greater surveillance and counseling for additional screening may be warranted for women with a family history of cancer.",,,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD25 expression and frequencies of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells with varying levels of CD25 and CD127 expression were assessed by flow cytometry in all studied individuals. RESULTS: Using univariate (unadjusted) and multivariate (adjusted) analyses we demonstrated that detection of high pretreatment CD25 expression on circulating CD4+ T cells was associated with significantly decreased survival rate of AML patients subjected to standard induction chemotherapy. These associations held true for both entire group of analyzed AML patients and different subgroups of patients identified by presence or absence of favorable and adverse molecular prognostic factors.

Epub 2015 Jun 6.,"BACKGROUND: Imatinib mesylate (Glivec(R), formerly STI-571) is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. However, there are reports suggesting that imatinib could be atheroprotective by lowering plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL). AIM: To investigate the potential inhibitory effect of imatinib on cholesterol uptake in human macrophages as well as its effect on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Uptake of fluorescence-labeled LDL was analyzed using flow cytometry. Macrophages treated with imatinib showed a 23.5%, 27%, and 15% decrease in uptake of native LDL (p<0.05), acetylated LDL (p<0.01), and copper-modified oxidized LDL (p<0.01), respectively. Gel-based zymography showed that secretion and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were inhibited by imatinib. Using GeneChip Whole Transcript Expression array analysis, no obvious gene candidates involved in the mechanisms of cholesterol metabolism or MMP regulation were found to be affected by imatinib. Instead, we found that imatinib up-regulated microRNA 155 (miR155) by 43.8% and down-regulated ADAM metallopeptidase domain 28 (ADAM28) by 41.4%. Both genes could potentially play an atheroprotective role and would be interesting targets in future studies. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that imatinib causes post-translational inhibition with respect to cholesterol uptake and regulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9. More research is needed to further evaluate the role of imatinib in the regulation of other genes and processes.",['NOTNLM'],"['Atherosclerosis', 'Cholesterol', 'Imatinib', 'Macrophages']","['Copyright (c) 2015 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.', 'Published by Elsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.

Epub 2015 Dec 22.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Plants from Kenyan flora are traditionally used against many ailments, including cancer and related diseases. Cancer is characterized as a condition with complex signs and symptoms. Recently there are recommendations that ethnopharmacological usages such as immune and skin disorders, inflammatory, infectious, parasitic and viral diseases should be taken into account when selecting plants that treat cancer. AIM: The present study was aimed at investigating the cytotoxicity of a plethora of 145 plant parts from 91 medicinal plants, most of which are used in the management of cancer and related diseases by different communities in Kenya, against CCRF-CEM leukemia cell line. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extracts from different plant parts (leaves, stems, stem bark, roots, root barks, aerial parts and whole herb) were obtained by cold percolation using different solvent systems, such as (1:1v/v) dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and n-hexane (1), methanol (MeOH) and CH2Cl2 (2); neat MeOH (3), 5% H2O in MeOH (4) and with ethanol (EtOH, 5); their cytotoxicities were determined using the resazurin reduction assay against CCRF-CEM cells. RESULTS: At a single concentration of 10mug/mL, 12 out of 145 extracts exhibited more than 50% cell inhibition. These include samples from the root bark of Erythrina sacleuxii (extracted with 50% n-hexane-CH2Cl2), the leaves of Albizia gummifera, and Strychnos usambarensis, the stem bark of Zanthoxylum gilletii, Bridelia micrantha, Croton sylvaticus, and Albizia schimperiana; the root bark of Erythrina burttii and E. sacleuxii (extracted with 50% CH2Cl2-MeOH), the stem bark of B. micrantha and Z. gilletii (extracted using 5% MeOH-H2O) and from the berries of Solanum aculeastrum (extracted with neat EtOH). The EtOH extract of the berries of S. aculeastrum and A. schimperiana stem bark extract displayed the highest cytotoxicity towards leukemia CCRF-CEM cells, with IC50 values of 1.36 and 2.97microg/mL, respectively. Other extracts having good activities included the extracts of the stem barks of Z. gilletii and B. micrantha and leaves of S. usambarensis with IC50 values of 9.04, 9.43 and 11.09microg/mL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provided information related to the possible use of some Kenyam medicinal plants, and mostly S. aculeastrum, A. schimperiana, C. sylvaticus, Z. gilletii, B. micrantha and S. usambarensis in the treatment of leukemia. The reported data helped to authenticate the claimed traditional use of these plants. However, most plants are used in combination as traditional herbal concoctions. Hence, the cytotoxicity of corresponding plant combinations should be tested in vitro to authenticate the traditional medical practitioners actual practices.",['NOTNLM'],"['Albizia schimperiana', 'Cancer', 'Kenyan flora', 'Leukemia', 'Solanum aculeastrum', 'Traditional medicine']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Epub 2015 Dec 22.,"In this study, a synthetic steroidal glycoside SBF-1 had strong and preferential antitumor effects on the human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line K562 and its imatinib-resistant form K562/G. SBF-1 induced apoptosis in both cell lines without any effect on cell cycle arrest. It also inhibited the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway members, such as PI3K and Akt, as well as downstream targets mTOR and Bcl-2. Moreover, the degradation of the Bcr-Abl protein was induced by SBF-1 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Using a pull-down assay, SBF-1 was found to bind to both Bcr-Abl and PTP1B and disrupted the interaction between them. SBF-1 triggered the degradation of Bcr-Abl through ubiquitination via the lysosome pathway. Taking together these findings, this study, for the first time, suggests that the blockade of the interaction between Bcr-Abl and PTP1B may be a feasible strategy for the treatment of CML, especially CML with resistance to Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib. Our study also indicates that SBF-1 may serve as a leading compound for novel anti-CML therapeutic agents.",['NOTNLM'],"['Bcr-Abl', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Imatinib', 'PTP1B', 'SBF-1']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Epub 2015 Dec 22.,"BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity are known risk factors for a number of cancers, with recent evidence suggesting that risk of hematologic cancer is also increased in obese individuals. We evaluated associations between body mass index (BMI) at differing time points during the life course in population-based case control studies of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplatic syndromes (MDS). METHODS: Cases were identified by the Minnesota Cancer Surveillance System. Controls were identified through the Minnesota State driver's license/identification card list. BMI was calculated using self-reported height and weight at ages 18, 35, and 50 years and two years prior to interview, and categorized as normal (18.5-25 kg/m(2)), overweight (25-29.9 kg/m(2)), obese class I (30-34.9 kg/m(2)), and obese class II/III (35+ kg/m(2)). All analyses were stratified by sex. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: We included 420 AML cases, 265 MDS cases and 1388 controls. Obesity two years prior to diagnosis was associated with AML in both males and females (OR=2.22, 95% CI 1.28, 3.85 and OR=1.85, 95% CI 1.08, 3.15 for BMI>/=35 vs. BMI 18.5-24.9, respectively). In contrast, associations between obesity and MDS were observed only in females. Weight change in adulthood was not consistently associated with either outcome. CONCLUSION: Our results extend the emerging literature suggesting that obesity is a risk factor for hematologic malignancy and provide evidence that that the association remains regardless of timing of obesity. Obesity in adulthood is a modifiable risk factor for both MDS and AML.",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Epidemiology', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes', 'Obesity']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Epigenetic regulation of transcription, particularly by CpG methylation, plays an important role in tumor progression, mainly by repressing tumor-suppressor genes. To clarify the clinical importance of aberrant DNA methylation, we studied the hypermethylation status of 16 target genes in the genomes of 92 patients with JMML by bisulfite conversion and the pryosequencing technique. Among 16 candidate genes, BMP4, CALCA, CDKN2A, and RARB exhibited significant hypermethylation in 72% (67/92) of patients. Based on the number of hypermethylated genes, patients were stratified into three cohorts based on an aberrant methylation score (AMS) of 0, 1-2, or 3-4. In the AMS 0 cohort, the 5-year overall survival (OS) and transplantation-free survival (TFS) were good (69% and 76%, respectively). In the AMS 1-2 cohort, the 5-year OS was comparable to that in the AMS 0 cohort (68%), whereas TFS was poor (6%). In the AMS 3-4 cohort, 5-year OS and TFS were markedly low (8% and 0%, respectively). Epigenetic analysis provides helpful information for clinicians to select treatment strategies for patients with JMML. For patients with AMS 3-4 in whom hematopoietic stem cell transplantation does not improve the prognosis, alternative therapies, including DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and new molecular-targeting agents, should be established as treatment options.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Targeting the Mdm2-p53 interface or MdmX ((MDM4), mouse double minute 4)-p53 interface or both has been a focus in the field. However, targeting the E3 ligase activity of Mdm2-MdmX really interesting new gene (RING)-RING interaction as a novel anticancer strategy has never been explored. In this report, we describe the identification and characterization of small molecule inhibitors targeting Mdm2-MdmX RING-RING interaction as a new class of E3 ligase inhibitors. With a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based E3 activity assay in high-throughput screening of a chemical library, we identified inhibitors (designated as MMRis (Mdm2-MdmX RING domain inhibitors)) that specifically inhibit Mdm2-MdmX E3 ligase activity toward Mdm2 and p53 substrates. MMRi6 and its analog MMRi64 are capable of disrupting Mdm2-MdmX interactions in vitro and activating p53 in cells. In leukemia cells, MMRi64 potently induces downregulation of Mdm2 and MdmX. In contrast to Nutlin3a, MMRi64 only induces the expression of pro-apoptotic gene PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis) with minimal induction of growth-arresting gene p21. Consequently, MMRi64 selectively induces the apoptotic arm of the p53 pathway in leukemia/lymphoma cells. Owing to the distinct mechanisms of action of MMRi64 and Nutlin3a, their combination synergistically induces p53 and apoptosis. Taken together, this study reveals that Mdm2-MdmX has a critical role in apoptotic response of the p53 pathway and MMRi64 may serve as a new pharmacological tool for p53 studies and a platform for cancer drug development.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our study, we have demonstrated that Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitor Bay 61-3606 was identified as a TRAIL sensitizer. Amplification of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by Bay 61-3606 was accompanied by the strong activation of Bak, caspases, and DNA fragmentation. In mechanism of action, Bay 61-3606 sensitized cells to TRAIL via two mechanisms regulating myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 (Mcl-1). First, Bay 61-3606 triggered ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Mcl-1 by regulating Mcl-1 phosphorylation. Second, Bay 61-3606 downregulates Mcl-1 expression at the transcription level. In this context, Bay 61-3606 acted as an inhibitor of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (CDK) 9 rather than Syk. In summary, Bay 61-3606 downregulates Mcl-1 expression in breast cancer cells and sensitizes cancer cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Nov 19.,"The proviral integration site for moloney murine leukemia virus (Pim) kinases, consisting of Pim-1, Pim-2 and Pim-3, belongs to a family of serine/threonine kinases that are involved in controlling cell growth and differentiation. Pim kinases are emerging as important mediators of adipocyte differentiation. SGI-1776, an inhibitor of Pim kinases, is widely used to assess the physiological roles of Pim kinases, particularly cell functions. In the present study, we examined the effects of SGI-1776 on adipogenesis. The antiadipogenic effect of SGI1776 was measured by Oil Red O staining and AdipoRed assays. The effect of SGI1776 on the growth of 3T3L1 adipocytes was determined by cell count analysis. The effects of SGI1776 on the protein and mRNA expression of adipogenesis-related proteins and adipokines in 3T3L1 adipocytes were also evaluated by western blot analysis and RTPCR, respectively. Notably, SGI-1776 markedly inhibited lipid accumulation during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes. On a mechanistic level, SGI-1776 inhibited not only the expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (C/EBP-alpha), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) and fatty acid synthase (FAS), but also the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3). Moreover, SGI-1776 decreased the expression of adipokines, including the expression of leptin and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) during adipocyte differentiation. These findings demonstrate that SGI-1776 inhibits adipogenesis by downregulating the expression and/or phosphorylation levels of C/EBP-alpha, PPAR-gamma, FAS and STAT-3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

delivery of at least one transcriptional factor or a combination of several small-molecule compounds. Delivery of transcriptional factors may affect genome stability, while small-molecule compounds may require more evaluations when applied in vivo. Thus, a defined medium with only conventional growth factors or additives for cell culture is desirable for inducing neuronal trans-differentiation. RESULTS: Here, we report that a defined medium (5C) consisting of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), N2 supplement, leukemia inhibitory factor, vitamin C (Vc), and beta-mercaptoethanol (betaMe) induces the direct conversion of somatic cells to cells with neuronal characteristics. Application of 5C medium converted mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into TuJ+ neuronal-like cells, which were capable of survival after being transplanted into the mouse brain. The same 5C medium could convert primary rat astrocytes into neuronal-like cells with mature electrophysiology characteristics in vitro and facilitated the recovery of brain injury, possibly by inducing similar conversions, when infused into the mouse brain in vivo.

Chromosomal abnormalities associated with CLL include trisomy 12 and IGH;BCL3 rearrangement [t(14;19)(q32;q13)] that juxtaposes a proto-oncogenic gene BCL3 and an immunoglobulin heavy chain, a translocation that may be associated with shorter survival. In addition to the IGH;BCL3 rearrangement, other translocations involving 14q32 locus are involved in various lymphoproliferative pathologies pointing toward the significance of IGH locus in oncogenic progression. Significantly, in the majority of B-cell neoplasms that carry an IGH;BCL3 rearrangement, it is a sole translocation involving an IGH locus. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a patient who, in addition to trisomy 12, carried a rare double-hit translocation characterized by the IGH;BCL3 translocation and an additional clonal IGH;BCL2 translocation involving IGH and another proto-oncogene BCL2, t(14;18)(q32;q21), commonly found in follicular lymphoma. Further single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array-based analysis detected a duplication of the 58.8 kb region at 19q13.32 adjacent to the BCL3 translocation junction on chromosome 19q13. Interestingly, the duplicated region contained ERCC2 gene, which encodes a DNA excision repair protein involved in the cancer-prone syndrome, xeroderma pigmentosum. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together our findings indicate the existence of double-translocation driven oncogenic events involving both IGH loci and proto-oncogenes BCL2 and BCL3. Importantly, the IGH;BCL3 translocation was characterized by the duplication of the genomic region adjacent to BCL3, containing a major DNA repair factor, ERCC2.",['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell lymphoma/leukemia', 'Double IGH;BCL2 and IGH;BCL3 translocation', 'ERCC2 duplication']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 30.,"Targeting epigenetic pathways is a promising approach for cancer therapy. Here, we report on the unexpected finding that targeting calcium signaling can reverse epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSG). In a screen for drugs that reactivate silenced gene expression in colon cancer cells, we found three classical epigenetic targeted drugs (DNA methylation and histone deacetylase inhibitors) and 11 other drugs that induced methylated and silenced CpG island promoters driving a reporter gene (GFP) as well as endogenous TSGs in multiple cancer cell lines. These newly identified drugs, most prominently cardiac glycosides, did not change DNA methylation locally or histone modifications globally. Instead, all 11 drugs altered calcium signaling and triggered calcium-calmodulin kinase (CamK) activity, leading to MeCP2 nuclear exclusion. Blocking CamK activity abolished gene reactivation and cancer cell killing by these drugs, showing that triggering calcium fluxes is an essential component of their epigenetic mechanism of action. Our data identify calcium signaling as a new pathway that can be targeted to reactivate TSGs in cancer.",,,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the optimal conditions required to obtain high-affinity retargeted envelope proteins with narrow tropism are not understood. This study highlights the advantage of constrained peptides within receptor binding domains and validates the random library screening technique of obtaining novel retargeted Env proteins. Using a modified vector backbone to screen the envelope libraries on 143B osteosarcoma cells, three novel and unique retargeted envelopes were isolated. The use of complex disulfide bonds within variable regions required for receptor binding is found within natural gammaretroviral envelope isolates. Interestingly, two of the isolates, named AII and BV2, have a pair of cysteines located within the randomized region of 11 amino acids similar to that identified within the CP Env, an isolate identified in a previous Env library screen on the human renal carcinoma Caki-1 cell line. The amino acids within the randomized region of AII and BV2 envelopes that are essential for viral infection have been identified in this study and include these cysteine residues. Through mutagenesis studies, the putative disulfide bond pairs including and beyond the randomized region were examined. In parallel, the disulfide bonds of CP Env were identified using mass spectrometry. The results indicate that this pair of cysteines creates the structural context to position key hydrophobic (F and W) and basic (K and H) residues critical for viral titer and suggest that AII, BV2, and CP internal cysteines bond together in distinct ways. IMPORTANCE: Retargeted gammaretroviral particles have broad applications for therapeutic use. Although great advances have been achieved in identifying new Env-host cell receptor pairs, the rules for designing optimal Env libraries are still unclear. We have found that isolates with an additional pair of cysteines within the randomized region have the highest transduction efficiencies. This emphasizes the importance of considering cysteine pairs in the design of new libraries. Furthermore, our data clearly indicate that these cysteines are essential for viral infectivity by presenting essential residues to the host cell receptor. These studies facilitate the screening of Env libraries for functional entry into target cells, allowing the identification of novel gammaretroviral Envs targeting alternative host cell receptors for gene and protein delivery.",,,"['Copyright (c) 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Recently, mutations in TET2 and other epigenetic modifiers as well as RHOA have been identified in these diseases, particularly in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL). CD28 is the major co-stimulatory receptor in T cells which, upon binding ligand, induces sustained T-cell proliferation and cytokine production when combined with T-cell receptor stimulation. We have identified recurrent mutations in CD28 in PTCLs. Two residues-D124 and T195-were recurrently mutated in 11.3% of cases of AITL and in one case of PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS). Surface plasmon resonance analysis of mutations at these residues with predicted differential partner interactions showed increased affinity for ligand CD86 (residue D124) and increased affinity for intracellular adaptor proteins GRB2 and GADS/GRAP2 (residue T195). Molecular modeling studies on each of these mutations suggested how these mutants result in increased affinities. We found increased transcription of the CD28-responsive genes CD226 and TNFA in cells expressing the T195P mutant in response to CD3 and CD86 co-stimulation and increased downstream activation of NF-kappaB by both D124V and T195P mutants, suggesting a potential therapeutic target in CD28-mutated PTCLs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that the two co-orthologues of PLZF found in zebrafish show distinct expression patterns, especially in larvae. Although zbtb16a/plzfa and zbtb16b/plzfb are not modulated by IFN produced during viral infection, their over-expression increases the level of the early type I IFN response, at a critical phase in the race between the virus and the host response. The effect of Plzfb on IFN induction was also detectable after cell infection by different non-enveloped RNA viruses, but not after infection by the rhabdovirus SVCV. Our findings indicate that plzf implication in the regulation of type I IFN responses is conserved across vertebrates, but at multiple levels of the pathway and through different mechanisms.",['NOTNLM'],"['Antiviral innate immunity', 'Interferon', 'PLZF', 'ZBTB', 'Zebrafish']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little information is available on the behavior of radio-resistant APL in terms of gene expression profiles and intercellular communication. In this study, cDNA microarray and RT-PCR were used to analyze the intracellular genetic network and extracellular vesicles (EVs), respectively, in the established radio-resistant HL60 (Res-HL60) cell line. Significant changes in the expression of 7,309 known mRNAs were observed in Res-HL60 relative to control. In addition, 7 mRNAs were determined as targets because significant changes in the expression were observed using Ingenuity analysis software, confirming the quantitative RT-PCR. However, EVs from Res-HL60 cells did not include these target molecules. These results suggest that radio-resistant APL is regulated by the expression and suppression of specific molecules, and these molecules are not transferred between cells by EVs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their incidence is unknown because the presence of occult tumors that contribute to relapse is not routinely sought as in other cancers. No standard approach exists for treating tumors at most sites, apparent clinical response is typically followed by further tumors, and achievement of lengthy remission is uncommon. Body scanning with (18) FDG PET/CT now provides a means to identify the extent of occult tumors that enables directed tumor eradication and a way to evaluate tumor response. To evaluate its potential benefits, analysis was undertaken of 124 published cases scanned after apparent tumors were diagnosed. Clinical and radiologic exams underestimated extent of disease in over half of 100 cases. Among 70 cases that reported scans after various treatments, 70% achieved negative scans. Half relapsed subsequently but disease-free survivals up to 6 years were documented. These reported cases add to our knowledge of extramedullary leukemia in showing that further tumors are more likely than marrow relapse, clinical and radiologic evaluation of response is inadequate, intensive chemotherapy alone generally does not prevent progression and is associated with significant mortality, and tumor-directed plus systemic therapies appears the most effective approach, particularly to AML tumors. This analysis suggests this technology could increase our ability to eradicate all foci of leukemia, and identify tumors responsible for refractory, residual, and relapsed disease.",,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated the effect of different PPAR agonists include fenofibrate, troglitazone and aleglitazar on doxorubicin-resistant human myelogenous leukemia (K562/DOX) cells. The effects of doxorubicin (DOX) following treatment with PPAR agonists on cell viability were evaluated using MTT assay and the reversal fold (RF) values. Rhodamine123 (Rh123) assays were used to determine P-gp functioning. P-gp mRNA/protein expression was measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot analysis after incubation with troglitazone and aleglitazar. Our results showed that troglitazone and aleglitazar significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of DOX and decreased the RF values in K562/DOX cells, however, no such results were found for fenofibrate. Troglitazone and aleglitazar significantly down regulated P-gp expression in K562/DOX cells; in addition, the present study revealed that aleglitazar elevated intracellular accumulation of Rh123in K562/DOX cells as short-term effects, which also contribute to the reversal of MDR. These findings show that troglitazone and especially aleglitazar exhibited potent effects in the reversal of P-gp-mediated MDR, suggesting that these compounds may be effective for combination therapy strategies and circumventing MDR in K562/DOX cells to other conventional chemotherapeutic drugs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) is considered a potential anticancer treatment, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report that Sirtinol, a known SIRT1 inhibitor, induces premature senescence and growth arrest in K562 CML cells. Chromobox homolog 8 (CBX8) suppresses the Sirtinol-induced premature senescence, which is reversed by CBX8 knockdown. Upon Sirtinol treatment, the phosphorylation of AKT1, p27KIP1 and RB is severely downregulated. However, CBX8 overexpression enhances phosphorylation and, thereby, promotes the transcriptional activity of E2F1, both of which are impaired upon CBX depletion. These data suggest that CBX8 modulates SIPS through the RB-E2F1 pathway in CML cells and provide important insight into its application in CML treatment.",['NOTNLM'],"['CBX8', 'Leukemia', 'Premature senescence', 'RB-E2F1', 'SIRT1']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Studies have shown that certain miRNAs are associated with resistance to chemotherapy or drug sensitization; however, the underlying mechanisms have largely remained elusive. Multiple drug resistance is a major barrier for the treatment of advanced HCC. In the present study, miR-101 was observed to be downregulated in a panel of HCC cell lines, suggesting that it has a tumor suppressor role. Furthermore, transfection of miR-101 significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin to HepG2 cells. While overexpression of miR-101 did not influence the accumulation of doxorubicin, it promoted the apoptosis-inducing effect of doxorubicin in HepG2 cells. A bioinformatics analysis predicted that miR-101 directly targeted the 3'-untranslated region of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), which was verified by a luciferase reporter assay. Finally, transfection of HepG2 cells with Mcl-1 expression plasmid inhibited apoptosis caused by doxorubicin plus miR-101 expression. In conclusion, the present study showed that miR-101 is a negative regulator of Mcl-1 in HCC, and the combination of miR-101 expression with doxorubicin may represent a novel approach for the treatment of HCC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported the transcript profiling of DAD induced by hyperoxia exposure in mouse lungs and showed that the gene expression of myelocytomatosis oncogene (c-Myc) was significantly upregulated whereas that of surfactant-associated protein (SP)-C was downregulated. However, the mechanism underlying hyperoxia-induced DAD is not well understood. METHODS: The hyperoxia-induced changes in SP-A/B/C/D, c-Myc, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma (Bcl)-2, and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) expression in mouse lungs were examined by cDNA microarray analysis. The expression levels of the above mentioned genes, cell viability, caspase activity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were also examined in the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and mouse fibroblast-like cell line NIH/3T3. RESULTS: Hyperoxia induced a decrease in SP-C/A expression in mouse lungs, and SP-C downregulation was also confirmed in A549 cells. In addition to enhanced c-Myc expression, Bax expression also increased following exposure of the mice to hyperoxia. In vitro analysis showed that expression of these genes is regulated in a cell-type-dependent manner, i.e., upregulation of c-Myc in NIH/3T3 cells and Bax in A549 cells occurred regardless of whether there was a similar decrease in cell viability and increase in caspase-3/7 activation in response to hyperoxia. ROS production and caspase-8 activation were also observed in both cells. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that hyperoxia induces ROS production and cell death in lung tissues through a cell-type specific mechanism involving the upregulation of c-Myc/Bax, and caspase-8 and -3/7 activation-dependent pathways, thereby leading to the development of DAD.",['NOTNLM'],"['Bax', 'Diffuse alveolar damage', 'Hyperoxia exposure', 'Reactive oxygen species', 'c-Myc']","['Copyright (c) 2015 The Japanese Respiratory Society.

Ph+ cells occur via a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22 resulting in constitutively active BCR-ABL fusion protein. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are used against the kinase activity of BCR-ABL protein for the effective treatment of CML. However, the development of drug resistance, caused by different genetic mechanisms, is the major issue in the clinical application of TKIs. These mechanisms include changes in expression levels of microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are short non-coding regulatory RNAs that control gene expression and play an important role in cancer development and progression. In the present review, we highlight the roles of miRNAs both in the progression and chemotherapy-resistance of CML. Our understanding of these mechanisms may lead to the use of this knowledge not only in the treatment of patients with CML, but also in other type of cancers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Cases were 323 MPN patients and controls were 333 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. Odds ratios (ORs) and p-values using Fischer's exact tests were calculated. The data was adjusted for confounding effects by logistic regression. RESULTS: A significantly increased risk of MPNs compared to CLL was observed in subjects with a prior history of any autoimmune disease (OR=1.86, 95%CI 1.16-2.98). A positive association between JAK2-V617F positive MPN and any autoimmune disease was observed at follow-up (OR=2.62, 95% CI 1.21-5.67). A significantly increased risk of MPN compared to CLL was also observed in subjects with prior thromboembolic events (TE-events) (OR=2.09, 95%CI 1.42-3.08). In the MPN group, an increased risk of JAK2-V617F-positive disease was observed in subjects with prior TE-events (OR=2.19, 95%CI 1.51-3.16). DISCUSSION: It is discussed if chronic inflammation in relation to autoimmunity and atherosclerosis might elicit mutations in the hematopoietic stem cell resulting in MPNs, or whether this association actually reflects a long-lasting pre-MPN-diagnosis phase, in which the MPN-disease per se contributes to a chronic inflammatory state and immune deregulation.",['NOTNLM'],"['Autoimmunity', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms', 'JAK2-V617F mutation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Thrombosis']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2015 Dec 28.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in Western countries, and mainly originates from an accumulation of abnormal B cells caused by the dysregulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. The aberration of proliferation-related gene in CLL cells induces cell arrest at G0/G1 phase, or a small section shows rapid cell growth, which further complicates the pathogenesis of CLL. The constitutively photomorphogenic 1 (COP1), as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in many biological processes in mammalian cells, but its role in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) progression remains unclear. In the present study, we analyzed the expression of COP1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 23 CLL patients and 3 healthy donors. The observed upregulated expression of COP1 in CLL patients was positively correlated with CLL clinical stage and ZAP-70 expression, but not del(13q14) and del(17q-). Overexpression of COP1 significantly promoted cell colony formation and proliferation, especially contributing to the accumulation of cells in S-phase by inhibition of FoxO1 and p21. Moreover, overexpression of COP1 accelerated tumorigenicity of HG3 cells and promoted xenograft growth. Therefore, the present study revealed that COP1 plays an important role in CLL cell proliferation and tumorigenicity, and may be a useful indicator of the chronic lymphocytic leukemia processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 31.,"BACKGROUND: When offered participation in clinical trials, families of children with cancer face a delicate balance between cure and toxicity. Since parents and children may perceive this balance differently, this paper explores whether adolescent patients have different enrollment patterns compared to younger children in trials with different toxicity profiles. PROCEDURE: Age-dependent participation rates in three consecutive, randomized childhood leukemia trials conducted by the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology were evaluated. The ALL2000 dexamethasone/vincristine (Dx/VCR) trial tested treatment intensifications to improve cure, and the back-to-back ALL2008 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and ALL2008 PEG-asparaginase (ASP) trials tested treatment intensifications (6MP) and toxicity reduction without compromising survival (ASP). Patient randomization and toxicity data were prospectively registered by the treating physicians. RESULTS: Parents of young children favored treatment intensifications (Dx/VCR: 12% refusal; 6MP: 14%; ASP: 21%), whereas parents of adolescents favored treatment reductions (Dx/VCR: 52% refusal; 6MP: 30%; ASP: 8%). Adolescents were more likely to refuse intensification trials than young children (adjusted ORs 6.3; P < 0.01 [Dx/VCR] and 2.1; P = 0.04 [6MP]). Adolescents were less likely to refuse the ASP trial, with varying effect size depending on the length of the preceding consolidation treatment (adjusted OR for median consolidation length 0.15; P = 0.01). Younger children participated more frequently in only 6MP than in only ASP (14% vs. 5%), and adolescents vice versa (2% vs. 17%; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Parents' and adolescents' divergent inclinations toward intensified or reduced therapy emphasize the necessity of actively involving adolescents in the informed consent process, which should also address motives for trial participation.",['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'adolescent', 'child', 'clinical trials as topic', 'decision making', 'research ethics']","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,"['Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology, and Oncology (NOPHO)']",,,,,,,,

She was diagnosed with B-precursor acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and was administered remission-induction chemotherapy. On day 28 of the induction therapy, she experienced seizure and prolonged unconsciousness. Blood pressure was slightly elevated. MRI revealed cortical cytotoxic edema in the right temporal and occipital lobes. In the right occipital white matter the lesion with vasogenic edema also existed. Three days later, MRI showed vasogenic edema in subcortical white matter of the right temporal right occipital and bilateral occipital lobes. The lesions had receded with time. Since the seizure occurred, the chemotherapy had been discontinued. The episodes of seizure and prolonged consciousness recurred 22 days later. MRI revealed vasogenic edema in the right occipital lobe, and MR angiography demonstrated vessel irregularity and reduced branch visualization in the middle and posterior cerebral arteries. Arterial spin-labeling (ASL) showed hypoperfusion in both occipital lobes. It suggests that vasoconstriction and hypoperfusion could lead to recurrent PRES in this case. It is possible that ASL might be more sensitive than MRI in detecting the lesions of PRES. It should be noted that PRES might recur in leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was shown that under LA action the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human T-leukemia cells had increased 5.6 times in comparison to control already at the 1st hour after the addition of studied antibiotic to the culture medium. At the 6th hour after incubation of cells with LA the nucleosomal DNA cleavage, chromatin condensation and nucleus fragmentation were observed, indicating apoptotic cell death. Catalase (scavenger of hydrogen peroxide), mannitol (scavenger of hydroxyl radicals) and superoxide dismutase (scavenger of superoxide radicals) reduced the level of ROS production under LA, suggesting the generation of H2O2, OH* and O2- radicals, respectively. It was revealed that catalase and mannitol effectively inhibited LA-mediated tumor cell death, increasing 2.5 times the percentage of alive cells in comparison to LA. However, superoxide dismutase had no significant inhibitory effect on cytotoxic activity of LA, indicating the minor role of superoxide anions in the implementation of antitumor activity of this antibiotic. Combination of catalase, mannitol and superoxide dismutase with LA increased 4-fold the percentage of alive cells in comparison to the action of LA. Dynamics of ROS formation confirms that the increase of ROS is a very rapid process, but at the same time it is not a direct consequence of apoptosis triggering, mediated by mitochondria.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 30.,"Primary myelofibrosis, the most aggressive of the classic Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), is a clonal disorder characterized by often debilitating constitutional symptoms and splenomegaly, bone marrow fibrosis and resultant cytopenias, extramedullary hematopoiesis, risk of leukemic transformation, and shortened survival. Post-polycythemia vera and post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis represent similar entities, although some differences are being recognized. Attempts to classify patients with myelofibrosis into prognostic categories have been made since the late 1980s, and these scoring systems continue to evolve as new information becomes available. Over the last decade, the molecular pathogenesis of MPNs has been elucidated considerably, and the Janus kinase (JAK) 1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib is the first drug specifically approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk myelofibrosis. This article reviews the evolution of prognostic criteria in myelofibrosis, emphasizing the major systems widely in use today, as well as recently described, novel systems that incorporate emerging data regarding somatic mutations. Risk factors for thrombosis and conversion to MPN blast phase also are discussed. Finally, the practical usefulness of the current prognostic classification systems in terms of clinical decision making is discussed, particularly within the context of some of their inherent weaknesses.

Studies exploring day 14 bone marrow false positive and negative rates yielded diverse data, and a highly specific method for early bone marrow evaluation is warranted. Given the improved induction-associated death rate, the risk of redundant reinduction administered to patients anticipating remission with one induction cycle may be outweighed by the benefit from the potential reduction in the falsely interpreted nadir bone marrow. The purpose of this review is to analyze current evidence on ways to optimize early bone marrow evaluation during induction in AML. RECENT FINDINGS: Day 14 bone marrow blast count is affected by patient's age, leukemic risk, and induction regimen, and its remission prediction power is enhanced if more stringent cutoffs are used to define significant residual blast numbers or if morphologic bone marrow evaluation is performed on day 5 of induction. SUMMARY: Early bone marrow evaluation has a potential to personalize the induction regimen, but because of limitations of day 14 bone marrow results, earlier bone marrow evaluation or the use of flow cytometry to detect minor blast populations may improve remission prediction in AML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera are among the Philadelphia chromosome negative myeloproliferative neoplasms. They are characterized by overproduction of blood cells and their complications include thrombosis, hemorrhage, and progression to myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Management of essential thrombocythemia/polycythemia vera requires recognition of the risk factors for thrombosis and hemorrhage. Risk stratification allows the clinician to make a treatment plan that may include antiplatelet therapy with aspirin alone or in combination with therapeutic phlebotomy in the case of polycythemia vera, or cytoreductive therapy for high-risk patients with either essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera. Hydroxyurea remains first-line therapy for high-risk patients with essential thrombocythemia/polycythemia vera, whereas second-line options include anagrelide, pegylated-IFNalpha-2a, and the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. The current evaluation of pegylated-IFNalpha-2a in global phase II and III studies will provide clarity to the potential long-term benefit and risks associated with this biologic in patients with essential thrombocythemia/polycythemia vera. Novel therapeutics aimed at prevention of disease progression to myelofibrosis/AML are the focus of current clinical trials. SUMMARY: Risk stratification of patients with essential thrombocythemia/polycythemia vera by age and/or history of thrombosis provides the basis of risk adapted therapeutic intervention.

We investigated the biological differences of BTK activity between these subgroups and further compared the impact of ibrutinib on molecular and cellular behaviors. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that phosphorylated active BTK is significantly higher in UM-CLL. Moreover, UM-CLL, compared to M-CLL, displayed a much higher proliferative capacity that was correlated with higher phospho-BTK and greater sensitivity to ibrutinib. In addition, BTK depletion with siRNA led to a more prominent reduction in the proliferation of UM-CLL, suggesting that elevated BTK activity is responsible for increased cell proliferation. Further, cell signaling activity by multiple measurements was consistently higher in UM-CLL accompanied by a higher sensitivity to ibrutinib. These studies link UM-CLL to elevated BCR signaling, heightened BTK-dependent cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to ibrutinib.

METHODS: Retrospective case series of patients with ATL with retinal findings. RESULTS: A total of 175 patients were diagnosed with ATL in Martinique between 1983 and 2013. Three of them showed intraocular findings related to ATL. They were bilateral deep retinal infiltrates associated with intermediate uveitis. In two cases, the ATL diagnosis was known. In the third, fluorescein angiography was remarkable for deep retinal infiltrates although fundus examination was unremarkable. The ATL cells were found in the blood of this patient. Despite chemotherapy, infiltrates progressed from the retinal periphery to the posterior pole in two patients, thus reducing visual acuity to light perception. They were associated with vasculitis. CONCLUSION: Retinal involvement in ATL is very rare. It can occur at any point during the natural course of the disease. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 carriers should benefit from a regular ophthalmic examination, and a fluorescein angiography must be performed in all patients with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 with vitreous cells. The presence of deep retinal infiltrates must raise suspicion for ATL in a patient with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its role in cancer is not well-understood. Recent studies including ours show that LIF is frequently overexpressed in many types of human tumors and promotes the progression and metastasis of tumors. However, the underlying mechanism of LIF's promoting effects on tumor progression and metastasis is poorly defined. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in tumor metastasis. This study reports that LIF promotes EMT in human tumor cells. Overexpression of LIF promotes tumor cells to acquire mesenchymal features, including morphological changes of cells from epithelial-like to mesenchymal-like, increased expression levels of mesenchymal markers and decreased expression of epithelial markers. Knockdown of endogenous LIF reverses EMT in cancer cells. We further identified that LIF induces the expression of microRNA-21 (miR-21), which in turn mediates the promoting effect of LIF on EMT. LIF induces miR-21 expression through the activation of STAT3. Importantly, blocking miR-21 function greatly abolished the promoting effect of LIF on EMT and the migration ability of cancer cells. Taken together, results from this study identified an important function and a novel underlying mechanism of LIF in EMT and tumor metastasis.",['NOTNLM'],"['LIF', 'STAT3', 'epithelial-mesenchymal transition', 'miR-21']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous work has shown that transduction of pig7 into a series of leukemia cell lines did not result in either apoptosis or differentiation of most tested cell lines. Interestingly, it did significantly sensitize these cell lines to chemotherapeutic drugs. Here, we further investigated the mechanism underlying pig7-induced improved sensitivity of acute leukemia cells to chemotherapy. Our results demonstrated that the sensitization effect driven by exogenous pig7 was more effective in drug-resistant leukemia cell lines which had lower endogenous pig7 expression. Overexpression of pig7 did not directly activate the caspase apoptotic pathway, but decreased the lysosomal stability. The expression of pig7 resulted in lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and lysosomal protease (e.g. cathepsin B, D, L) release. Moreover, we also observed increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) induced by pig7. Some autophagy markers such as LC3I/II, ATG5 and Beclin-1, and necroptosis maker MLKL were also stimulated. However, intrinsic antagonism such as serine/cysteine protease inhibitors Spi2A and Cystatin C prevented downstream effectors from triggering leukemia cells, which were only on the ""verge of apoptosis"". When combined with chemotherapy, LMP increased and more proteases were released. Once this process was beyond the limit of intrinsic antagonism, it induced programmed cell death cooperatively via caspase-independent and caspase-dependent pathways.",['NOTNLM'],"['LMP', 'PIG7', 'ROS', 'cathepsin', 'chemosensitivity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Targeted therapy focused against a specific alteration is by definition unable to attack broad pathway signaling modification. Tumor heterogeneity will render targeted therapies ineffective based on the regrowth of cancer cell sub-clones. Therefore multimodal therapy strategies, targeting signaling pathways simultaneously should improve treatment.SiRNAs against KRAS and the apoptosis associated genes BCLXL, FLIP, MCL1L, SURVIVIN and XIAP were transfected into human and murine pancreatic cancer cell lines. Induction of apoptosis was measured by Caspase 3/7 activation, subG1 FACS analysis and PARP cleavage. The therapeutic approach was tested in a subcutaneous allograft model with a murine cancer cell line.By using siRNAs as a systematic approach to remodel signal transduction in pancreatic cancer the results showed increasing inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis induction in vitro and in vivo. Thus, siRNAs are suitable to model multimodal therapy against signaling pathways in pancreatic cancer. Improvements in in vivo delivery of siRNAs against a multitude of targets might therefore be a potential therapeutic approach.",['NOTNLM'],"['KRAS', 'RNAi', 'apoptosis', 'pancreatic cancer', 'simultaneous gene silencing']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently proposed that inhibiting the antioxidant enzyme peroxiredoxin I (Prdx I) may induce leukemia-cell differentiation. However, this concept remains to be confirmed. In this work, we identified H7 as a novel Prdx I inhibitor through virtual screening, in vitro activity assay, and surface plasmon resonance assay. Cellular thermal shift assay showed that H7 directly bound to Prdx I but not to Prdxs II-V in cells. H7 treatment also increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and cell differentiation in leukemia cells, as reflected by the upregulation of the cell surface differentiation marker CD11b/CD14 and the morphological maturation of cells. The differentiation-induction effect of H7 was further observed in some non-acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and primary leukemia cells apart from APL NB4 cells. Moreover, the ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine significantly reversed the H7-induced cell differentiation. We demonstrated as well that H7-induced cell differentiation was associated with the activation of the ROS-Erk1/2-C/EBPbeta axis. Finally, we showed H7 treatment induced cell differentiation in an APL mouse model. All of these data confirmed that Prdx I was novel target for inducing leukemia-cell differentiation and that H7 was a novel lead compound for optimizing Prdx I inhibition.",['NOTNLM'],"['cell differentiation', 'leukemia', 'peroxiredoxin', 'reactive oxygen species']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BMSCs from CML patients showed increased efficiency to accelerate CML cell proliferation, enhance the drug resistance of K562 cells and up-regulate the expression of FZD7. Antagonism of FZD7 expression by shRNA significantly suppressed proliferation and increased IM sensitivity of CML cells co-cultured with BMSCs cells.

The aim of the work was to identify the main indications for BMA in Atbara city, north Sudan and to determine the common diagnoses encountered. METHODS: All reports of BMA carried out during a 6-year period from 2009 to 2014, in the Modern Specialized Laboratory (the only site where BMA is conducted in Atbara) were reviewed. The information extracted included the main indications for performing this procedure, age groups involved, and the most common diagnoses established. A specially designed form was used for this purpose and the data were analyzed using SPSS computer program. RESULTS: A total number of 112 cases were subjected to bone marrow aspiration. The most frequent indications were: pancytopenia 43(38.4%), anemia 39 (34.8%), and suspected leukemia 13 (11.6%). In 86(76.8%) cases, BMA provided either the diagnosis or diagnostic clues to the disease process, while 26 (23.2%) of the aspirates revealed a normally functioning marrow. CONCLUSION: Bone marrow aspiration is an important investigation for establishing the diagnosis in many medical conditions. The most common indication for this procedure in our study was pancytopenia and the most common finding was aplastic anemia.",['NOTNLM'],"['Atbara', 'Bone marrow aspiration', 'Sudan']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For KRAS-driven cancer, although much research has been focused on the KRAS4B splice variant, which does not undergo palmitoylation, KRAS4A has recently been shown to play an essential role in the development of carcinogen-induced lung cancer in mice and to be widely expressed in human cancers. However, the role of palmitoylation in KRAS4A tumorigenesis is not clear. METHODS: The expression of KRAS4A in KRAS-mutated leukemia cell lines and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells were checked using western blotting and reverse transcriptions-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis, respectively. The leukemogenic potentials of oncogenic KRAS4A and its palmitoylation-defective mutants were examined by a mouse bone marrow transduction and transplantation model and the in vitro transformation assays. The activation of the RAS downstream signaling pathways and the membrane localizations of the KRAS4A and its mutants were analyzed via western blot analysis and confocal microscopy, respectively. RESULTS: We show here that KRAS4A is expressed in human leukemia cell lines and in AML cells harboring KRAS mutations and that mutation at the palmitoylation site of oncogenic KRAS4A significantly abrogates its leukemogenic potential. However, unlike NRAS, palmitoylation-defective KRAS4A still induces leukemia in mice, albeit with a much longer latency. Using NRAS/KRAS4A chimeric constructs, we found that the KIKK motif of KRAS4A contributes to the transforming activity of KRAS4A. Mutations at both palmitoylation site and the KIKK motif abolish the ability of oncogenic KRAS4A to induce leukemia in mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies suggest that therapies targeting RAS palmitoylation may also be effective in treating KRAS4A associated malignancies and that interfering the KIKK membrane-targeting motif would enhance the therapeutic effectiveness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring has been demonstrated crucial for the identification of AML patients at high risk of relapse, but the best method and timing of MRD detection are still discussed. Thus, we retrospectively analyzed 104 newly diagnosed AML patients, consecutively treated and monitored by quantitative polymerase chain reactions (Q-PCR) on WT1 and by multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) on leukemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIPs) at baseline, after induction, after 1st consolidation and after 1st intensification. By multivariate analysis, the factors independently associated with adverse relapse-free survival (RFS) were: bone marrow (BM)-WT1 >/= 121/10(4) ABL copies (P = 0.02) and LAIP >/= 0.2% (P = 0.0001) (after 1st consolidation) (RFS at the median follow up of 12.5 months: 51% vs. 82% [P < 0.0001] and 57% vs. 81%, respectively [P = 0.0003]) and PB-WT1 >/= 16/10(4) ABL copies (P = 0.0001) (after 1st intensification) (RFS 43% vs. 95% [P < 0.0001]) Our data confirm the benefits of sequential MRD monitoring with both Q-PCR and MFC.

The total dose of ATG in conditioning regimens appears to be an important factor that influences the outcome in recipients of transplants. However, the optimal ATG dosage has not been established to date. It remains unclear whether, in the setting of haploidentical HSCT (haploHSCT), different doses of ATG might exert differential influences on the recovery of lymphocyte subpopulations. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed lymphocyte recovery and its correlation to viral infection in two groups of patients that received different doses of ATG before haploHSCT. We performed flowcytometry to determine immunophenotypes of CD19(+) B cells and CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), CD4(+)CD45RA(+), CD4(+)CD45RO(+), CD4(+)CD28(+), CD8(+)CD28(+), and CD4(-)CD8(-) T cells. RESULTS: We found that, compared to 6 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg ATG significantly hampered the recoveries of CD4(+), CD4(+)CD45RA(+), and CD4(+)CD45RO(+) T cells in the first 2 months following haploHSCT. Similarly, compared to 6 mg/kg, the 10 mg/kg dose of ATG negatively influenced the recoveries of CD4(-)CD8(-) and CD8(+)CD28(+) T cells; recovery was delayed for 6 and 12 months after transplantation, respectively. Moreover, we showed that an increase in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections, associated with the higher dose of ATG, was correlated with the delayed recovery of CD4(-)CD8(-) double negative T cells. CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed a differential impact of different ATG conditioning doses on the recoveries of T cell subpopulations post-haploHSCT. This study was the first to connect the recovery of CD4(-)CD8(-) T cells to the risk of EBV infection after HSCT. These findings will facilitate optimization of the ATG conditioning dosage and improve the outcome of patients with leukemia that receive haploHSCT.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 29.,"Secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2) are suggested to play an important role in inflammation and tumorigenesis. Different mechanisms of epigenetic regulation are involved in the control of group IIA, III and X sPLA2s expression in cancer cells, but group V sPLA2 (GV-PLA2) in this respect has not been studied. Here, we demonstrate the role of epigenetic mechanisms in regulation of GV-PLA2 expression in different cell lines originating from leukaemia and solid cancers. In blood leukocytes from leukaemic patients, levels of GV-PLA2 transcripts were significantly lower in comparison to those from healthy individuals. Similarly, in DU-145 and PC-3 prostate and CAL-51 and MCF-7 mammary cancer cell lines, levels of GV-PLA2 transcripts were significantly lower in relation to those found in normal epithelial cells of prostate or mammary. By sequencing and methylation-specific high-resolution melting (MS-HRM) analyses of bisulphite-modified DNA, distinct CpG sites in the GV-PLA2 promoter region were identified that were differentially methylated in cancer cells in comparison to normal epithelial and endothelial cells. Spearman rank order analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between the methylation degree and the cellular expression of GV-PLA2 (r = -0.697; p = 0.01). The effects of demethylating agent (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) and histone deacetylase inhibitor (trichostatin A) on GV-PLA2 transcription in the analysed cells confirmed the importance of DNA methylation and histone modification in the regulation of the GV-PLA2 gene expression in leukaemic, prostate and mammary cancer cell lines. The exposure of tumour cells to human recombinant GV-PLA2 resulted in a reduced colony forming activity of MCF-7, HepG2 and PC-3 cells, but not of DU-145 cells suggesting a cell-type-dependent effect of GV-PLA2 on cell growth. In conclusion, our results suggest that epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modification play an important role in downregulation of GV-PLA2 expression in cancer cells.",['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'Group V sPLA2', 'Leukaemia', 'Solid cancer cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BLV is closely related to human T cell leukemia virus. B cell epitopes are important for the use of antibodies as therapeutic agents, the epitope-driven vaccine design, and immunological assays. A common B cell epitope for BLV has not yet been found due to individual differences in disease susceptibility. RESULTS: We used a peptide microarray with 156 synthetic 15-mer peptides covering the envelope glycoprotein gp51 and the Gag proteins p15, p24, and p12 to map B cell epitope and one B cell epitope, gp51p16, was recognized by all four cattle experimentally infected with BLV. A newly developed high-throughput peptide ELISA system revealed 590 (91.2%) of 647 cattle naturally infected with BLV, carrying 25 different bovine leukocyte antigen class II DRB3 (BoLA-DRB3) alleles, responded to a 20-mer gp51p16-C peptide containing a C-terminal cysteine and gp51p16. Alanine mutation and comparison of the sequences at 17 amino acid positions within gp51p16-C revealed that R7, R9, F10, V16, and Y18 were the common binding sites to BLV antibodies, and two of these sites were found to be highly conserved. Transient expression in the cells of five infectious molecular clones of BLV with a single alanine mutation at five common antibody binding sites had no effect syncytia formation of the gp51 protein. In addition, the mutant proteins, R7A and R9A had no effect on the expression of gp51 protein; the gp51 protein expressions of F10A, V16A and Y18A were lower than that of the wild type protein. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to identify a common B cell epitope in BLV by comprehensive screening of BLV-infected cattle with varied genetic backgrounds in BoLA-DRB3. Our results have important implications for disease control and diagnosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the clinical data was performed of the cases with the diagnosis of infant acute leukemia from August 1993 to October 2014 in our hospital. RESULTS: A total of 144 cases of infant leukemia were diagnosed in the defined period, including 83 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 55 myeloid leukemia, 1 hybrid acute leukaemia and 5 with incompatible cytological and immunophenotyping findings. The patients at the age of 9 to 12 months accounted for the largest proportion (38.2%), and 87.5% of the patients had hepatosplenomegaly; Six patients below 6 months old had skin infiltration. In about 1/3 of the patients, the white blood cells count was no greater than 100 x 10(9) /L. Ninety-five patients had chromosome examinations, which identified chromosome abnormalities in 67 patients, including 18 positive for t(4;11)or t(9;11)or t(11;19), and younger patients were more likely to have chromosome abnormalities. Thirty-seven patients underwent MLL gene detection and 11 of them had positive results; the positive patients had higher rate of chromosome 11 abnormalities than the negative patients. Most of the patients gave up treatments after diagnosis and only 6 patients older than 6 months completed regular chemotherapeutic treatments and were now in complete remission. CONCLUSION: Infant leukemia is a rare type of leukemia with different clinical features from other types of leukemia.

Epub 2016 Jan 19.,"OBJECTIVE: Somatic mutations in ASXL1 seem to have a negative prognostic impact in patients with several myeloid neoplasms, including myelofibrosis (MF). The aim of this work was to determine the prevalence and profile of ASXL1 mutations in MF. METHODS: We analyzed mutations in ASXL1 in 70 consecutive MF patients from 8 Spanish hospitals by means of Sanger sequencing, as well as JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutations. RESULTS: ASXL1 mutations were found in 16/70 (23%) of cases, most commonly p.Gly646TrpfsX12 (5/16). Most mutations (13/16) were frameshift mutations. Of 54 ASXL1- wild-type patients, 32 (59%) had at least one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), 27 of them had g.78128C>T, g.79017A>C, and g.79085T>C [triple SNP (TSNP) patients]. The 5-yr overall survival probability of TSNP patients was 67% (95% CI, 43-91%) vs. 90% (95% CI, 77-100%) in ASXL1-WT patients (P = 0.152). CONCLUSION: ASXL1 mutations were found in 23% of cases, p.Gly646TrpfsX12 being the most frequent. About 85% of mutations were found only in individual cases and 46% had not previously been reported, a pattern also seen in other series. Fifty percent of ASXL1-WT patients had a combination of three specific SNPs that might have a prognostic correlation that needs to be determined in larger series.",['NOTNLM'],"['ASXL1', 'myelofibrosis', 'single nucleotide polymorphism']",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Epub 2015 Dec 29.,"This retrospective study examined the longitudinal hospital outcomes (costs adjusted for inflation, hospital days, and admissions) associated with the treatment of pediatric, adolescent, and young adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Patients between one and 26 years of age with newly diagnosed ALL, who were treated at Primary Children's Hospital (PCH) in Salt Lake City, Utah were included. Treatment and hospitalization data were retrieved from system-wide cancer registry and enterprise data warehouse. PCH is a member of the Children's Oncology Group (COG) and patients were treated on, or according to, active COG protocols. Treatment-related hospital costs of ALL were examined by computing the average annual growth rates (AAGR). Longitudinal regressions identified patient characteristics associated with costs. A total of 505 patients (46.9% female) were included. The majority of patients had B-cell lineage ALL, 6.7% had T-ALL, and the median age at diagnosis was 4 years. Per-patient, first-year ALL hospitalization costs at PCH rose from $24,197 in 1998 to $37,924 in 2012. The AAGRs were 6.1, 13.0, and 7.6% for total, pharmacy, and room and care costs, respectively. Average days (AAGR = 5.2%) and admissions (AAGR = 3.8%) also demonstrated an increasing trend. High-risk patients had 47% higher costs per 6-month period in the first 5 years from diagnosis than standard-risk patients (P < 0.001). Similarly, relapsed ALL and stem cell transplantations were associated with significantly higher costs than nonrelapsed and no transplantations, respectively (P < 0.001). Increasing treatment-related costs of ALL demonstrate an area for further investigation. Value-based interventions such as identifying low-risk fever and neutropenia patients and managing them in outpatient settings should be evaluated for reducing the hospital burden of ALL.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'hospital costs', 'pediatric/adolescent/young adult']",['(c) 2015 The Authors.

MabThera for subcutaneous injection is a novel line extension that has been approved by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of patients with follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This study aimed to evaluate in-use stability data of MabThera subcutaneous drug-product solution in single-use syringes for subcutaneous administration according to the European Medicines Agency guideline. The drug-product solution was exposed to material contact surfaces of five different administration setups commonly used in subcutaneous drug delivery. MabThera subcutaneous was transferred under aseptic conditions into polypropylene and polycarbonate syringes and stored for 1, 2, and 4 weeks at 2 degrees C to 8 degrees C followed by 24 hours at 30 degrees C. After storage, subcutaneous administration was simulated and MabThera subcutaneous drug-product solution quality attributes were evaluated by using compendial physico-chemical tests, as well as suitable and validated molecule- and formulation-specific analytical methods. MabThera subcutaneous vials were treated and analyzed in parallel. The physico-chemical results of MabThera subcutaneous in the different setups were comparable to the control for all timepoints. No change in drug-product quality after storage and simulated administration was found compared to the control. However, since single-dose products do not contain preservatives, microbial contamination and growth needs to be avoided and product sterility needs to be ensured. The results showed that MabThera subcutaneous remains compatible and stable, from a physico-chemical perspective, for up to 4 weeks at 2 degrees C to 8 degrees C followed by 24 hours at 30 degrees C with the contact materials tested in this study. In order to avoid and minimize microbial growth, MabThera subcutaneous should be used immediately after removal from the original packaging container and strict aseptic handling conditions need to be followed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these agents cause severe adverse effects. Saccharomyces cerevisiae asparaginase II, encoded by the ASP3 gene, could be a potential candidate for the formulation of new drugs. This work aimed to purify and characterize the periplasmic asparaginase produced by a recombinant Pichia pastoris strain harbouring the ASP3 gene. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity with an activity recovery of 51.3%. The estimated molecular mass of the enzyme was 136 kDa (under native conditions) and 48.6 kDa and 44.6 kDa (under reducing conditions), suggesting an oligomeric structure. The recombinant asparaginase is apparently non-phosphorylated, and the major difference between the monomers seems to be their degree of glycosylation. The enzyme showed an isoelectric point of 4.5 and maximum activity at 46 degrees C and pH 7.2, retaining 92% of the activity at 37 degrees C. Circular dichroism and fluorescence analyses showed that the enzyme structure is predominantly alpha-helical with the contribution of beta-sheet and that it remains stable up to 45 degrees C and in the pH range of 6-10. In vitro tests indicated that the recombinant asparaginase demonstrated antitumoural activity against K562 leukaemic cells.",['NOTNLM'],"['Antitumoural drug', 'Asparaginase', 'Characterization', 'Pichia pastoris', 'Purification']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2015 Dec 29.,"In our previous study, we showed that miR-125a directly targeted a WT1 oncogene, which was overexpressed in leukemia and various kinds of solid tumors including lung, breast, gastric, and colon cancers, and brain tumors and was deeply involved in leukemogenesis and tumorigenesis and that miR-125a knockout mice overexpressed WT1 and developed myeloproliferative disease. It had been also reported that miR-125a is downregulated in leukemia and various types of solid tumors such as lung cancers, suggesting its tumor suppressor function. Therefore, it is important to elucidate what is target(s) of miR-125a for understandings of such functions although few target genes for it are known. In the present study, Zbtb7a oncogene was identified as a potential target for miR-125a by gene expression profiling in miR-125a knockout mice combined with bioinformatics target prediction. EGFP-3'UTR reporter assay showed that miR-125a suppressed Zbtb7a expression through its direct binding to the Zbtb7a-3'UTR. Zbtb7a knockdown by siRNA suppressed cell proliferation and induced G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in lung cancer cells. Furthermore, miR-125a expression showed a negative correlation with Zbtb7a expression in non-small cell lung cancer tissues. The present study showed for the first time that Zbtb7a was a direct target for miR-125a and was involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis of lung cancer cells.

METHODS: APL NB4-R1 cells were treated with different concentrations of RAD001(1 nmol/L, 10 nmol/L and 100 nmol/L) with ATRA(1mumol/L) for 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. The differentiation of NB4-R1 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry with CD11b staining and nitro blue tetrozolium(NBT) reduction test. Cell cycle was detected by cell cycle staining kit and apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry with Annexin V/PI staining. Protein expressions of LC-3II, PML-RARalpha, P-P70S6K and P-4E-BP1 were determined by Western blotting. RESULTS: RAD001 combined with ATRA significantly induced NB4-R1 cells differentiation, but RAD001 or ATRA alone did not enhance NB4-R1 differentiation. The co-treatment induced accumulation of cells in G1 phase and decreased the proportion of cells in S phase. The combined treatment had no effect on cell apoptosis. The differentiation rate of NB4-R1 cells in 100 nmol/L RAD001, 1mumol/L ATRA, RAD001 combined with ATRA and control groups was(2.29+/-0.57)%,(17.06+/-2.65)%,(54.47+/-4.91)% and(2.54+/-0.53)%, respectively; the proportion of cells in G1 phase was(35.20+/-11.97)%,(33.54+/-6.25)%,(53.70+/-8.73)% and(27.40+/-6.01)%, respectively; cells apoptosis rate was(2.30+/-0.14)%,(2.25+/-0.21)%,(2.40+/-0.28)% and(1.95+/-0.07)%, respectively. The combination of RAD001 with ATRA significantly inhibited mTOR signaling downstream proteins P-P70S6K, P-4E-BP1 and enhanced autophagy-related protein LC3-II and Beclin 1. The co-treatment also induced degradation of fusion protein PML-RARalpha. CONCLUSION: RAD001 combined with ATRA can induce cell differentiation, inhibit cell cycle, resulting the reverse of drug resistance in NB4-R1 cells, which is associated with increase of autophagy level and degradation of PML-RARalpha.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLIPPERS can exhibit radiological features similar to malignant lymphoma, whose diagnosis is confounded by prior steroid administration. We report a case of CLIPPERS accompanied by abnormal elevation of beta-2 microglobulin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A 62-year-old man started to experience numbness in all fingers of his left hand one year ago, which gradually extended to his body trunk and legs on both sides. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated numerous small enhancing spots scattered in his brain and spinal cord. CSF levels of beta-2 microglobulin were elevated; although this often indicates central nervous system involvement in leukemia and lymphoma, the lesions were diagnosed as CLIPPERS based on the pathological findings from a biopsy specimen. We emphasize the importance of biopsy to differentiate between CLIPPERS and malignant lymphoma because the temporary radiological response to steroid might be the same in both diseases but the treatment strategies regarding the use of steroid are quite different.",['NOTNLM'],"['Biopsy', 'Chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive', 'to steroids', 'Diagnosis', 'malignant lymphoma', 'beta-2 microglobulin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 28.,"Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare and aggressive stem cell disease of early childhood. RAS activation constitutes the core component of oncogenic signaling. In addition, leukemic blasts in one-fourth of JMML patients present with monosomy 7, and more than half of patients show elevated age-adjusted fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the current standard of care and results in an event-free survival rate of 50% to 60%, indicating that novel molecular-driven therapeutic options are urgently needed. Using gene expression profiling in a series of 82 patient samples, we aimed at understanding the molecular biology behind JMML and identified a previously unrecognized molecular subgroup characterized by high LIN28B expression. LIN28B overexpression was significantly correlated with higher HbF levels, whereas patients with monosomy 7 seldom showed enhanced LIN28B expression. This finding gives a biological explanation of why patients with monosomy 7 are rarely diagnosed with high age-adjusted HbF levels. In addition, this new fetal-like JMML subgroup presented with reduced levels of most members of the let-7 microRNA family and showed characteristic overexpression of genes involved in fetal hematopoiesis and stem cell self-renewal. Lastly, high LIN28B expression was associated with poor clinical outcome in our JMML patient series but was not independent from other prognostic factors such as age and age-adjusted HbF levels. In conclusion, we identified elevated LIN28B expression as a hallmark of a novel fetal-like subgroup in JMML.",,,['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3412-7301', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3976-9231', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5052-9274', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7520-9111', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7760-879X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4857-5746', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6628-8559', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2634-9302', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7143-4795', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9063-7205']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 28.,"Recently our group and others have identified DDX41 mutations both as germ line and acquired somatic mutations in families with multiple cases of late onset myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and/or acute myeloid leukemia (AML), suggesting that DDX41 acts as a tumor suppressor. To determine whether novel DDX41 mutations could be identified in families with additional types of hematologic malignancies, our group screened two cohorts of families with a diverse range of hematologic malignancy subtypes. Among 289 families, we identified nine (3%) with DDX41 mutations. As previously observed, MDS and AML were the most common malignancies, often of the erythroblastic subtype, and 1 family displayed early-onset follicular lymphoma. Five novel mutations were identified, including missense mutations within important functional domains and start-loss and splicing mutations predicted to result in truncated proteins.

Epub 2015 Dec 28.,"Patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have limited therapeutic options. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-interferon beta (IFNbeta)-sodium iodide symporter (NIS) is an oncolytic VSV encoding IFNbeta and the NIS reporter. Syngeneic AML C1498 tumors responded to IV therapy with VSV-murine IFNbeta (mIFNbeta)-NIS in a dose-dependent manner. Imaging for NIS expression showed robust virus infection within the tumors. Virus infection did not increase programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor cells. Combining VSV-mIFNbeta-NIS with anti-PD-L1 antibody (Ab) therapy enhanced antitumor activity compared with treatment with virus alone or Ab alone; this enhancement was not significant at higher VSV-mIFNbeta-NIS doses. Systemic VSV therapy reduced systemic C1498-green fluorescent protein (GFP) tumor burden in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and liver of mice with AML. Combination VSV-mIFNbeta-NIS and anti-PD-L1 Ab therapy significantly enhanced the survival of these mice with no evidence of toxicity, compared with isotype control, anti-PD-L1, or virus alone. There was an increase in tumor-infiltrating CD4 and CD8 cells. Single-agent VSV-mIFNbeta-NIS virotherapy induced both VSV-specific and GFP-specific CD8 T cells as determined by IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot, pentamer, and intracellular IFN-gamma staining assays. Both of these responses were further enhanced by addition of anti-PD-L1 Ab. Depletion of CD8 or natural killer cells, but not CD4 cells, resulted in loss of antitumor activity in the VSV/anti-PD-L1 group. Clinical samples from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and acute myelomonocytic leukemia appear to be especially susceptible to VSV. Overall, our studies show that oncolytic virotherapy combined with immune checkpoint blockade is a promising approach to AML therapy.",,,['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,['Blood. 2016 Mar 17;127(11):1381-3.

The development of HTLV-1-driven autoimmunity is hypothesized to rely on molecular mimicry, because virus-like particles can trigger an inflammatory response. However, HTLV-1 modifies the behavior of CD4(+) T cells on infection and alters their cytokine production. A previous study showed that in patients infected with HTLV-1, the activity of regulatory CD4(+) T cells and their consequent expression of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines are altered.

These compartments are dynamic structures representing liquid-droplet phases which are only slightly denser than the bulk intra-nuclear fluid. They possess different functions, have diverse morphologies, and are typically composed of RNA (or, in some cases, DNA) and proteins. We analyzed 3005 mouse proteins localized in specific intra-nuclear organelles, such as nucleolus, chromatin, Cajal bodies, nuclear speckles, promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, nuclear lamina, nuclear pores, and perinuclear compartment and compared them with ~29,863 non-nuclear proteins from mouse proteome. Our analysis revealed that intrinsic disorder is enriched in the majority of intra-nuclear compartments, except for the nuclear pore and lamina. These compartments are depleted in proteins that lack disordered domains and enriched in proteins that have multiple disordered domains. Moonlighting proteins found in multiple intra-nuclear compartments are more likely to have multiple disordered domains. Protein-protein interaction networks in the intra-nuclear compartments are denser and include more hubs compared to the non-nuclear proteins. Hubs in the intra-nuclear compartments (except for the nuclear pore) are enriched in disorder compared with non-nuclear hubs and non-nuclear proteins. Therefore, our work provides support to the idea of the functional importance of intrinsic disorder in the cell nucleus and shows that many proteins associated with sub-nuclear organelles in nuclei of mouse cells are enriched in disorder. This high level of disorder in the mouse nuclear proteins defines their ability to serve as very promiscuous binders, possessing both large quantities of potential disorder-based interaction sites and the ability of a single such site to be involved in a large number of interactions.",['NOTNLM'],"['DNA-binding protein', 'RNA-binding protein', 'cell nucleus', 'intra-nuclear compartments', 'intrinsically disordered protein', 'membrane-less organelles']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 28.,"PURPOSE: IL6 promotes tumor growth and signal transduction via both its membrane-bound (CD126) and soluble receptors (sCD126). We aimed to study whether the levels of CD126 expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemic (CLL) cells can predict in vitro and in vivo treatment response. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The levels of membrane-bound CD126 expression were determined on freshly isolated CLL B cells (n = 58) using flow cytometry. These CLL cells were treated with chlorambucil or fludarabine with or without anti-CD126 antibody tocilizumab for 24 hours and IL6-mediated STAT3 transcriptional activity and cell-cycle alteration were evaluated. RESULTS: CD126 surface expression was found in all cases and positively correlated with the levels of in vivo constitutive STAT3 activity. The levels of CD126 expression were significantly and positively correlated with the resistance of CLL cells to in vitro treatment with chlorambucil or fludarabine and poor in vivo treatment response of CLL patients. Blocking IL6 signaling with the anti-CD126 antibody, tocilizumab, had profound effects on STAT3-mediated survival and growth signals: decreased Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL, favoring an apoptotic profile; and decreased p27 with increased cyclin E and CDK2 expression, leading to cell-cycle shift from G0-G1 These tocilizumab-mediated changes induced chemosensitization in resistant CLL cells, with the greatest effect seen in cells with higher CD126 expression (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CLL cells with higher CD126 expression are more resistant to treatment in vivo and in vitro via IL6-CD126-STAT3 axis. Blocking CD126 using tocilizumab sensitizes CLL cells to chemotherapy. Clin Cancer Res; 22(10); 2462-9. (c)2015 AACR.",,,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blood film showed leucocytosis with 72% blasts. Bone marrow assessment confirmed a diagnosis of B-ALL with presence of double Philadelphia (Ph) chromosomes. As she was very ill, she was initially treated with an attenuated regimen of induction chemotherapy consisting of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone (R-CVP) along with intrathecal chemotherapy comprising methotrexate, cytarabine and hydrocortisone. Bone marrow examination post-induction chemotherapy showed >5% blasts. She was subsequently re-induced with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone (R-CHOP) along with intrathecal chemotherapy, following which she went into complete remission. Consolidation chemotherapy consisting of methotrexate, methylprednisolone, cytarabine, intrathecal chemotherapy and imatinib was subsequently administered followed by maintenance chemotherapy consisting of vincristine, prednisolone and imatinib (IDEAMOP). She developed spontaneous bruises and relapsed four months into her maintenance chemotherapy with 90% blasts in the bone marrow which was treated with fludarabine, cytarabine and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (FLAG). Unfortunately she developed neutropenic sepsis which was complicated by invasive lung aspergillosis. Bone marrow examination post-FLAG showed 80% blasts.

This underlines the need to investigate this newly recognized toxicological risk and systematically screen for the epigenome modifying potential of compounds. In this study, we examined the applicability of the zebrafish embryo as a screening model for DNA methylation modifications. Embryos were exposed from 0 to 72 h post fertilization (hpf) to bisphenol-A (BPA), diethylstilbestrol, 17alpha-ethynylestradiol, nickel, cadmium, tributyltin, arsenite, perfluoroctanoic acid, valproic acid, flusilazole, 5-azacytidine (5AC) in subtoxic concentrations. Both global and site-specific methylation was examined. Global methylation was only affected by 5AC. Genome wide locus-specific analysis was performed for BPA exposed embryos using Digital Restriction Enzyme Analysis of Methylation (DREAM), which showed minimal wide scale effects on the genome, whereas potential informative markers were not confirmed by pyrosequencing. Site-specific methylation was examined in the promoter regions of three selected genes vasa, vtg1 and cyp19a2, of which vasa (ddx4) was the most responsive. This analysis distinguished estrogenic compounds from metals by direction and sensitivity of the effect compared to embryotoxicity. In conclusion, the zebrafish embryo is a potential screening tool to examine DNA methylation modifications after xenobiotic exposure. The next step is to examine the adult phenotype of exposed embryos and to analyze molecular mechanisms that potentially link epigenetic effects and altered phenotypes, to support the DOHaD hypothesis.",['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'Environmental contaminant exposure', 'Epigenetics', 'Screening', 'Zebrafish embryo']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

It may develop in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic syndrome, sometimes preceding onset of the systemic disease. Frequent sites of myeloid sarcoma are bones or various soft tissues. Gastrointestinal involvement is very rare. We report a unique case of myeloid sarcoma presenting as a painful anal fissure, in a patient with a history of acute myeloid leukemia.

METHODS: The clinical data of SAA patients treated with IST who had monosomy 7 malignant clonal evolution from October 2004 to January 2012 were analyzed respectively. RESULTS: Six patients (4.2%) had monosomy 7 clonal evolutions. The median time to monosomy 7 was 36 (12-75) months after IST. All 6 patients were diagnosed myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Among them, 3 patients transformed to acute myeloid leukemia following MDS. The time was 24, 45 and 51 months after IST. The median following time was 42 (17-84) months. Four patients died during the following time. The median time from MDS to death was 9 (5-17) months. Among them, three patients died with infection, one died with cerebral hemorrhage. Six patients had the clinical characteristics that they had no response to IST after 6 months, high monocyte percentage in one month after IST combined with recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rHu-GCSF) and agranulocytosis in 3 months after IST. CONCLUSION: Poor myeloid response to IST suggests malignant clonal hematopoiesis and poor prognosis in SAA patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Nov 14.,"Chronic myeloid leukemia is rare in pregnancy with an estimated incidence of 1:75000. It is a genetic myeloproliferative disorder marked by increased and unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow. The terminal phase of chronic myeloid leukemia may develop into a blast crisis, defined as >30% myeloblasts in the circulation. A blast crisis resembles an acute leukemia and is associated with rapid clinical deterioration and short survival. Targeted gene therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors is effective in treatment but when these agents are discontinued, as in pregnancy, the patient may relapse and blast cells may enter the circulation. Theoretically, a central nervous system blast crisis may be induced by inadvertent intrathecal seeding of circulating blast cells, and is associated with a high mortality rate and a median life expectancy of three months. We describe the anesthetic management of a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia and blast cells in the circulation who required cesarean delivery. After considering the potential anesthetic risks and benefits, general anesthesia was chosen. Although an iatrogenic central nervous system blast crisis is extremely rare, the high morbidity and mortality associated with such an event should be considered when formulating an anesthetic plan.",['NOTNLM'],"['Cesarean delivery', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'General anesthesia']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We identify functional genomic targets of two H3K4 methyltransferases, Set1 and MLL1/2, in both the stem cells and differentiated tissue of the planarian flatworm Schmidtea mediterranea. We show that, despite their common substrate, these enzymes target distinct genomic loci in vivo, which are distinguishable by the pattern each enzyme leaves on the chromatin template, i.e., the breadth of the H3K4me3 peak. Whereas Set1 targets are largely associated with the maintenance of the stem cell population, MLL1/2 targets are specifically enriched for genes involved in ciliogenesis. These data not only confirm that chromatin regulation is fundamental to planarian stem cell function but also provide evidence for post-embryonic functional specificity of H3K4me3 methyltransferases in vivo.",,,['Copyright (c) 2015 The Authors.

Epub 2015 Dec 17.,"Targeted therapies designed to exploit specific molecular pathways in aggressive cancers are an exciting area of current research. Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) mutations such as the t(4;11) translocation cause aggressive leukemias that are refractory to conventional treatment. The t(4;11) translocation produces an MLL/AF4 fusion protein that activates key target genes through both epigenetic and transcriptional elongation mechanisms. In this study, we show that t(4;11) patient cells express high levels of BCL-2 and are highly sensitive to treatment with the BCL-2-specific BH3 mimetic ABT-199. We demonstrate that MLL/AF4 specifically upregulates the BCL-2 gene but not other BCL-2 family members via DOT1L-mediated H3K79me2/3. We use this information to show that a t(4;11) cell line is sensitive to a combination of ABT-199 and DOT1L inhibitors. In addition, ABT-199 synergizes with standard induction-type therapy in a xenotransplant model, advocating for the introduction of ABT-199 into therapeutic regimens for MLL-rearranged leukemias.",['NOTNLM'],"['DOT1L', 'H3K79 methylation', 'MLL/AF4', 'apoptosis pathways', 'bcl-2 family members', 'leukemias']",['Copyright (c) 2015 The Authors.

Immunosuppressed patients, however, are at high risk of developing inflammation.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 64 patients with T-ALL who had been admitted to Mansoura University Oncology Center were included in the present study. For all patients, DNA extraction and amplification with sequencing analysis using the 310 ABI genetic analyzer for detection of a mutation (R882H). RESULTS: The DNMT3A mutation (R882H) was found in 12 of the 64 patients (18.8%). The DNMT3A mutation was frequently detected in the older age group and was associated with high leukocytic counts, a high bone marrow blast cell percentage, and the frequent presence of extramedullary disease. However, it was not associated with the hemoglobin level, red blood cell count, or platelet count. The patients with mutant T-ALL had a low tendency to achieve remission after induction. These patients had significantly shorter overall survival and shorter disease-free survival compared with those with wild-type T-ALL (P = .037 and P = .006, respectively). CONCLUSION: DNMT3A is frequently mutated in T-ALL and is associated with distinct clinicopathologic entities and a poor prognosis. These findings could help in risk stratification and treatment decisions for patients with T-ALL.",['NOTNLM'],"['DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA methyl transferase mutation', 'Epigenetic regulation', 'Prognosis', 'T-ALL']",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2015 Nov 24.,"Feline calicivirus (FCV) infections are associated with oral ulceration, chronic stomatitis and a limping syndrome. Epizootic outbreaks of virulent systemic disease (VSD) have been reported in the USA and Europe. Here, the molecular characterization and neutralization patterns of FCV isolates from cases of severe, non-epizootic infection associated with skin ulceration and edema are presented. Samples from eleven symptomatic cats, four in-contact cats and 27 cats with no contact with symptomatic cats were collected and tested for FCV, feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1), feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Phylogenetic analyses based on the capsid (VP1) gene of FCV and virus neutralization with antisera raised against four FCV vaccine strains were performed. Nine kittens and two adult cats in two shelters and two veterinary clinics in four geographically distinct locations in Switzerland and Liechtenstein were affected. The cats showed fever, tongue and skin ulceration, head and paw edema, and occasionally jaundice, generalized edema and dyspnea. All symptomatic cats tested FCV-positive but were negative for FHV-1, FeLV and FIV, with the exception of one FIV-positive kitten. All kittens of one litter and both adult cats died. The disease did not spread to cats in the environment. Cats in the environment displayed phylogenetically distinct, but related, FCV strains. Virus neutralization patterns suggested that some cases might have been potentially prevented by vaccination with the optimal vaccine strain. In conclusion, clinicians should be aware of severe, non-epizootic forms of FCV infections with initial clinical presentations similar to VSD.",['NOTNLM'],"['Feline calicivirus', 'PCR', 'Paw and mouth disease', 'Phylogenetic analysis', 'Virulent systemic disease', 'Virus neutralization']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It is associated with favorable prognosis. The identification of the genomic sequence of the breakpoint flanking regions of the ETV6-RUNX1 translocation should be the best strategy to monitor minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients with ETV6-RUNX1-positive ALL. In this study, the ETV6-RUNX1 translocation was sequenced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) in 26 patients with ETV6-RUNX1-positive ALL and re-sequenced by using the Sanger method. Interestingly, the three-way translocation, including ETV6-RUNX1, was detected in five patients. Four of them relapsed during or after therapy, while 21 patients without the three-way translocation were still in remission (P < 0.0001). The three-way translocation pattern was identical between the diagnosis and relapse samples in three patients, excluding one patient (SCMC-001245). The relapse samples retained the translocation of ETV6-RUNX1 relative to the three-way translocation t(8;12;21) at diagnosis, suggesting that the three-way translocation might be an important risk factor for relapse in patients with ETV6-RUNX1-positive ALL and should be further studied.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'ETV6-RUNX1', 'breakpoint', 'childhood', 'next-generation sequencing']",['(c) 2015 The Authors.

Transplantation studies have elucidated an important role for Dnmt3a in stem cell self-renewal and in myeloid differentiation. Here, we investigated the impact of conditional hematopoietic Dnmt3a loss on disease phenotype in primary mice. Mx1-Cre-mediated Dnmt3a ablation led to the development of a lethal, fully penetrant MPN with myelodysplasia (MDS/MPN) characterized by peripheral cytopenias and by marked, progressive hepatomegaly. We detected expanded stem/progenitor populations in the liver of Dnmt3a-ablated mice. The MDS/MPN induced by Dnmt3a ablation was transplantable, including the marked hepatomegaly. Homing studies showed that Dnmt3a-deleted bone marrow cells preferentially migrated to the liver. Gene expression and DNA methylation analyses of progenitor cell populations identified differential regulation of hematopoietic regulatory pathways, including fetal liver hematopoiesis transcriptional programs. These data demonstrate that Dnmt3a ablation in the hematopoietic system leads to myeloid transformation in vivo, with cell-autonomous aberrant tissue tropism and marked extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) with liver involvement. Hence, in addition to the established role of Dnmt3a in regulating self-renewal, Dnmt3a regulates tissue tropism and limits myeloid progenitor expansion in vivo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In spite of this important progress, however, nearly all MM patients ultimately relapse, even those who experience a complete response to initial therapy. Management of relapsed MM thus represents a vital aspect of the overall care for patients with MM and a critical area of ongoing scientific and clinical research. This comprehensive manuscript from the International Myeloma Working Group provides detailed recommendations on management of relapsed disease, with sections dedicated to diagnostic evaluation, determinants of therapy, and general approach to patients with specific disease characteristics. In addition, the manuscript provides a summary of evidence from clinical trials that have significantly impacted the field, including those evaluating conventional dose therapies, as well as both autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Specific recommendations are offered for management of first and second relapse, relapsed and refractory disease, and both autologous and allogeneic transplant. Finally, perspective is provided regarding new agents and promising directions in management of relapsed MM.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although genome profiling studies have demonstrated heterogeneity in subclonal architecture that may ultimately lead to relapse, a gene expression-based prediction program that can identify, distinguish and quantify drug response in sub-populations within a bulk population of myeloma cells is lacking. In this study, we performed targeted transcriptome analysis on 528 pre-treatment single cells from 11 myeloma cell lines and 418 single cells from 8 drug-naive MM patients, followed by intensive bioinformatics and statistical analysis for prediction of proteasome inhibitor sensitivity in individual cells. Using our previously reported drug response gene expression profile signature at the single-cell level, we developed an R Statistical analysis package available at https://github.com/bvnlabSCATTome, SCATTome (single-cell analysis of targeted transcriptome), that restructures the data obtained from Fluidigm single-cell quantitative real-time-PCR analysis run, filters missing data, performs scaling of filtered data, builds classification models and predicts drug response of individual cells based on targeted transcriptome using an assortment of machine learning methods. Application of SCATT should contribute to clinically relevant analysis of intratumor heterogeneity, and better inform drug choices based on subclonal cellular responses.",,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-5392-9284'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the morphological and clinical features in patients diagnosed according either to the BCSH (n=238) or the WHO guidelines (n=232). The BCSH-defined ET cohort was re-evaluated by applying the WHO classification. At presentation, patients of the BCSH group showed significantly higher values of serum lactate dehydrogenase and had palpable splenomegaly more frequently. Following the WHO criteria, the re-evaluation of the BCSH-diagnosed ET cohort displayed a heterogeneous population with 141 (59.2%) ET, 77 (32.4%) prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis (prePMF), 16 (6.7%) polycythemia vera and 4 (1.7%) primary myelofibrosis. Contrasting WHO-confirmed ET, the BCSH cohort revealed a significant worsening of fibrosis-free survival and prognosis. As demonstrated by the clinical data and different outcomes between WHO-diagnosed ET and prePMF, these adverse features were generated by the inadvertent inclusion of prePMF to the BCSH group. Taken together, the diagnosis of ET without a scrutinized examination of BM biopsy specimens will generate a heterogeneous cohort of patients impairing an appropriate clinical management.",,,,,,['Leukemia. 2017 Feb;31(2):527-528.

METHODS: Leukocyte differentiation count was analyzed by using hematology analyzer, CytoDiff flow cytometry and morphology differential count in 278 healthy controls, 550 flagged and 102 unflagged samples. The reference intervals of leukocyte parameters were established and verified according to the healthy controls. Then the correlations of five leukocytes were analyzed among hematology analyzer, CytoDiff flow cytometry and morphology differential count. Lymphocyte subsets were analyzed and compared between healthy controls and patients with different diseases. The CytoDiff flow cytometric blast counts were explored to analyze the clinical diagnostic efficiency compared to morphology differential count as a reference method. RESULTS: CytoDiff flow cytometry can differentiate the leukocyte into 16 parameters, including percentage and absolute count, therefore 32 parameters in total. Among these parameters, 18 parameters had significant difference between male and female (P < 0. 05), and the others had no difference (P >0. 05). Except the CD16pos monocyte, there were no difference among ages in other parameters. The correlation between hematology analyzer, CytoDiff flow cytometry and morphology differential count were good for neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils and eosinophils in healthy controls and clinical samples. When the cutoff value of the ratio of T + NK and B lymphocyte was set at 1. 0 by ROC, the sensitivity was 90. 9% and specificity was 99. 8% for diagnosing the chronic lymphocyte leukemia (CLL). When the cutoff value of blast count by CytoDiff flow cytometry was set at 1%, the sensitivity was 100%, specificity was 96. 1% and accuracy was 96. 2% by morphology differential blast count for the reference method. CONCLUSIONS: Establish and verify the reference interval of leukocyte differential count in peripheral blood by CytoDiff flow cytometry in the adults of Beijing region. CytoDiff flow cytometry provide more parameters than hematology analyzer and morphology differential count, and therefore have excellent clinical diagnostic efficiency, especially for CLL and blasts from acute leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The expression of CD22, SYK and their phosphorylation, along with the expression of IgG and IgM, which obtained from B lymphocytes in peripheral blood of 46 patients with IRP(22 new diagnosed and 24 remitted patients returned to normal after treatment), 22 healthy controls and 12 chronic lymphocytic leukemia(CLL) patients from February to December 2014 were analyzed by flow cytometry. And the mRNA expression of CD22 in peripheral blood mononuclear cell was determined by real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: The ratios of CD22+ cells and phosphorylated CD22(pCD22)+ cells of B lymphocytes in new diagnosed group (60. 03% +/- 20. 94% 71. 32% +/- 11. 16%) were significantly higher than those in remission group (46. 92% +/- 20. 04%, 55. 82% +/- 14. 42%), normal control group (46. 86% +/- 17. 78%, 53. 28% +/- 14. 76%) and CLL group (39. 74% +/- 18. 96%, 59. 07% +/- 17.09%) (all P <0.05). The ratios of phosphorylated SYK( pSYK) + cells in the four groups had the same trend (all P <0. 05).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Green tea extract (GTE) was prepared from green tea infusion. GTE-based composites of red wine (GTRW), lemon peel (GTRWL) and/or NanoGTE as well as corresponding nanocomposites were prepared. The total polyphenolics of the different GTE-based extracts ranged from 18.0% to 21.3%. The effects of GTE-based extracts were studied in sarcoma 180, Ehrlich carcinoma, B16 melanoma, Ca755 mammary carcinoma, P388 leukemia, L1210 leukemia, and Guerin carcinoma (original, cisplatin-resistant and doxorubicin-resistant variants). The extracts were administered as 0.1% solution in drinking water (0.6-1.0 mg by total polyphenolics per mouse per day and 4.0-6.3 mg per rat per day). RESULTS: Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) in mice treated with NanoGTE, cisplatin or cisplatin + NanoGTE was 27%, 55% and 78%, respectively, in Sarcoma 180%, 21%, 45% and 59%, respectively, in Ehrlich carcinoma; and 8%, 13% and 38%, respectively in B16 melanoma. Composites of NanoGTE, red wine, and lemon peel (NanoGTRWL) enhanced the antitumor effects of cyclophosphamide in mice with Ca755 mammary carcinoma. The treatment with combination of NanoGTE and inhibitors of polyamines (PA) synthesis (DFMO + MGBG) resulted in significant TGI of P388 leukemia (up to 71%) and L1210 leukemia. In rats transplanted with Guerin carcinoma (parental strain), treatment with GTRW or GTE alone resulted in 25-28% TGI vs. 55-68% TGI in cisplatin-treated animals. The inhibition observed in the case of combination of GTE or GTRW with cisplatin was additive giving 81-88% TGI. Similar effects were observed when combinations of the cytostatics with GTE (or NanoGTE) were tested against cisplatin- or doxorubicin-resistant Guerin carcinoma. Moreover, the plant extracts lowered side toxicity of the drugs. Treatment with GTE, NanoGTE, and NanoGTRW decreased the levels of malondialdehyde in heart, kidney and liver tissue of experimental animals, as well as the levels of urea and creatinine in blood serum, increased erythrocyte and platelet counts, hemoglobin content, and decreased leucocyte counts.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Starting from sorption-purified HSA, the albumin nanoparticles with a different degree of lysine residues cross-linking (10; 20; 40, and 100%) were obtained by the coacervation method. The HSA NPs were used for synthesis of nanocomposites with chlorin e6 and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled preparations. Malignant lymphocytes of the MT-4 (human T-cell leukemia) line and normal lymphocytes of healthy donors served as cell targets. For photodynamic treatment, a semiconductor laser was exploited as a light source, and cell viability was assessed by MTT or trypan blue dye exclusion tests. For cell imaging and HSA NPs visualization, the fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were applied, respectively. C57Bl/6 mice were used in animal experiments. RESULTS: The absorption and fluorescence spectra of chlorin e6-HSA NPs composites were characterized, and by the electron microscopy investigation the size of NPs (nanospheres) was estimated: 100-120 nm. FITC-labeled albumin preparations allowed to establish that HSA NPs have much higher exposition and concentration dependent affinity to malignant cell surface than initial HSA. In experiments with MT-4 cells on PDT activity of chlorin e6-HSA NPs, the nanocomposite effectiveness elevated along with increasing percentage of cross-linked amino acid residues, and for the nanocomposite with 100% of albumin cross-linking it exceeded the activity of free chlorin e6. In contrast to malignant cells, the complexation of chlorin e6 with HSA NPs decreased its photodynamic effect on normal human lymphocytes.

Herein, we present 7 patients with GATA2 deficiency recruited into the French Severe Chronic Neutropenia Registry, which enrolls patients with all kinds of congenital neutropenia. We performed extended immunophenotyping of their whole blood lymphocyte populations, together with the analysis of their chemotactic responses. Lymphopenia was recorded for B and CD4(+) T cells in 6 patients. Although only 3 patients displayed natural killer cell cytopenia, the CD56(bright) natural killer subpopulation was nearly absent in all 7 patients. Natural killer cells from 6 patients showed decreased CXCL12/CXCR4-dependent chemotaxis, whereas other lymphocytes, and most significantly B lymphocytes, displayed enhanced CXCL12-induced chemotaxis compared with healthy volunteers. Surface expression of CXCR4 was significantly diminished in the patients' natural killer cells, although the total expression of the receptor was found to be equivalent to that of natural killer cells from healthy individual controls. Together, these data reveal that GATA2 deficiency is associated with impaired membrane expression and chemotactic dysfunctions of CXCR4. These dysfunctions may contribute to the physiopathology of this deficiency by affecting the normal distribution of lymphocytes and thus potentially affecting the susceptibility of patients to associated infections.",['NOTNLM'],"['*HPV', '*NK cells cytopenia', '*human papillomavirus infection', '*myelodysplastic syndrome', '*primary immunodeficiency']",['(c) Society for Leukocyte Biology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detection of a specific gene rearrangement allows the identification of prognostically relevant subgroups in childhood B-ALL. There are four common gene rearrangements which are widely studied to see prognostical values (TEL-AML1, BCR-ABL, E2A-PBX1, MLL-AF4) in childhood B-ALL. In this study we show the prevalence of these common gene rearrangements and also explain the way to identify some rare breakpoints which also occur in these gene rearrangements. 97 samples received for diagnosis from paediatric B-ALL patients were included in this study. Qualitative reverse transcriptase PCR was used for detection of the TEL-AML1-t(12;21), E2A-PBX1-t(1;19), BCR-ABL1-t(9;22) and MLL-AF4 t(4;11) fusion transcripts. Unusually sized amplicons were confirmed by FISH and DNA sequencing to confirm atypical breakpoints. Amongst the paediatric B-ALL samples t(12;21), was detected in ( approximately 20%), t(9;22), was detected in ( approximately 8%), t(1;19) was detected in ( approximately 9%) and t(4;11) was detected in 2 cases. t(12;21) with intron 1of the AML1 gene was detected as the most common gene rearrangement in paediatric ALL, whereas one rare form of the TEL-AML1 breakpoint in which TEL is fused with intron 2 of AML1 was also observed. In the t(9;22) breakpoints e13a2, e14a2 and e1a2 were detected as the common breakpoints. Two atypical and rare breakpoint of t(9;22) were detected namely e6a2 and e13a3 in paediatric ALL. TEL-AML1 was found to be the most common translocation in Paediatric B-ALL.

METHODS: A total of 72 patients with refractory AML undergoing allo-HSCT from May 2001 to June 2013 were enrolled in this prospective study. Intensified conditioning included fludarabine + cytarabine plus total body irradiation + cyclophosphamide + etoposide. Cyclosporine A was withdrawn rapidly in a stepwise fashion if patients who did not experience acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) at Day + 30 post-transplantation. Donor lymphocytes were infused in patients without grade II or more than grade II aGVHD at Day + 60 post-transplantation. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 655 (1-4 200) d post-transplantation. Except for one died of infection and one died of regimen-related toxicity (RRT), the other 70 patients achieved complete remission at the time of neutrophil reconstitution. The mortality of RRT was 1.4% (1/72). The 1-year cumulative incidence of aGVHD and 2-year incidence of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) post-transplantation were 60.7% +/- 5.0% and 58.5% +/- 4.7%. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse post-transplantation was 29.6% +/- 6.6%. The 5-year non-relapse mortality was 28.8% +/- 6.0%. The 5-year overall and disease-free survival were 51.0% +/- 6.5% and 49.9% +/- 6.4%. Multivariate analysis revealed that donor lymphocyte infusion, cGVHD and bone marrow blasts at Day 0 were independent prognostic factors for relapse (HR (95% CI): 0.042 (0.007-0.688), 0.009 (0.003-0.345), 3.385 (1.451-7.899)) and survival (HR (95% CI): 0.315 (0.146-0.621), 0.416 (0.200-0.866), 1.332 (1.158-1.533)). CONCLUSION: The strategy of sequential intensified conditioning followed by GVL induction has an acceptable toxicity profile, and could decrease the relapse rate and improve the survival for refractory AML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Laboratory check-up showed thrombocytopenia with thrombocytopathy and hypofibrinogenaemia. THERAPY AND CLINICAL COURSE: Despite appropriate intraoperative hemostasis, sustained post-treatment bleeding occurred, necessitating the application of several erythrocyte concentrates as well as substitution of prothrombin, fibrinogen, and factor XIII. After stationary dismissal, the patient experienced a transition into acute myelomonocytic leukemia and died a short time thereafter.

This study aimed to assess changes in REE of acute leukemia adult patients before and after the first remission induction. Evaluation of REE was performed by indirect calorimetry and predicted REE was calculated by Harris-Benedict equation. Weight and height were measured and compared to a control group of healthy individuals. FFM was assessed by bioelectrical impedance for adjusting REE values. We evaluated 18 patients and 26 healthy individuals. At diagnosis, patients presented REE, REE/weight, and REE/FFM higher than the controls. Reductions of REE, REE/weight, and REE/FFM were also observed in patients after the first cycle of chemotherapy. The predicted REE for the patients group showed significant lower value compared with measured REE.

Oxidized zirconium (Oxinium; Smith & Nephew, Memphis, Tennessee) femoral heads were introduced in the past decade for use in total hip arthroplasty. The advantages of oxidized zirconium include less risk of fracture compared with traditional ceramic heads. This case report describes a patient with a history of bilateral avascular necrosis of the femoral head after chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Nonoperative management of avascular necrosis failed, and the patient was treated with bilateral total hip arthroplasty. The patient was followed at regular intervals and had slow eccentric polyethylene wear during a 10-year period. After 10 years, the patient had accelerated wear, with femoral and acetabular bone changes as a result of Oxinium and ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene wear during a 6-month period. This article highlights the unusual accelerated bone changes that occurred as a result of Oxinium wear particles.",,,"['Copyright 2016, SLACK Incorporated.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated various mitochondrial aberrations in pediatric AML and evaluated their impact on clinical outcomes. METHODS: Sequencing, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number determination, mtDNA 4,977-bp large deletion assessments, and gene scan analyses were performed on the bone marrow mononuclear cells of 55 pediatric AML patients and on the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 55 normal controls. Changes in the mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial membrane potential, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were also examined. RESULTS: mtDNA copy numbers were about two-fold higher in pediatric AML cells than in controls (P<0.0001). Furthermore, a close relationship was found between mtDNA copy number tertiles and the risk of pediatric AML. Intracellular ROS levels, mitochondrial mass, and mitochondrial membrane potentials were all elevated in pediatric AML. The frequency of the mtDNA 4,977-bp large deletion was significantly higher (P<0.01) in pediatric AML cells, and pediatric AML patients harboring high amount of mtDNA 4,977-bp deletions showed shorter overall survival and event-free survival rates, albeit without statistical significance.

So far, we have collected about 80 direct MLL fusions (MLL-X alleles) and about 120 reciprocal MLL fusions (X-MLL alleles). The reason for the higher amount of reciprocal MLL fusions is that the excess is caused by 3-way translocations with known direct fusion partners. This review is aiming to propose a solution for an obvious problem, namely why so many and completely different MLL fusion alleles are always leading to the same leukemia phenotypes (ALL, AML, or MLL). This review is aiming to explain the molecular consequences of MLL translocations, and secondly, the contribution of the different fusion partners.

Over the last 20 years, this research field has been rewarding and many novel prognostic factors have been identified, especially at the molecular genetic level. Whilst detection of recurrent cytogenetic aberrations and determination of the immunoglobulin heavy variable gene somatic hypermutation status have an established role in outcome prediction, next-generation sequencing has recently revealed novel mutated genes with clinical relevance (e.g. NOTCH1, SF3B1 and BIRC3). Efforts have been made to combine variables into prognostic indices; however, none has been universally adopted. Although a unifying model for all groups of patients and in all situations is appealing, this may prove difficult to attain. Alternatively, focused efforts on patient subgroups in the same clinical context and at certain clinically relevant 'decision points', that is at diagnosis and at initiation of first-line or subsequent treatments, may provide a more accurate approach. In this review, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages as well as the clinical applicability of three recently proposed prognostic models, the MD Anderson nomogram, the integrated cytogenetic and mutational model and the CLL-international prognostic index. We also consider future directions taking into account novel aspects of the disease, such as the tumour microenvironment and the dynamics of (sub)clonal evolution. These aspects are particularly relevant in view of the increasing number of new targeted therapies that have recently emerged.",['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'decision points', 'patient management', 'predictive markers', 'prognostic index']",['(c) 2015 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically we studied the effects of these extracts on intracellular signal nodes and apoptotic pathways. We characterized the composition of essential oils of these fifteen different algae extracts using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Finally, to identify potential molecular targets causing the phenotypic changes in leukemic cell lines, we docked a selected group of these essential oils to several key intracellular proteins.

Despite widespread use of oral arsenicals in medicine historically, they had disappeared from modern pharmacopeia until oral ATO was redeveloped in Hong Kong in 2000. Since then, over 200 patients with leukemia (predominantly APL) have been treated with oral ATO in Hong Kong and China. Oral arsenic trioxide and other formulations of arsenic appear to have a clinical efficacy comparable to that of IV formulations. These drugs given orally also appear to have a slightly better safety profile, lower operational costs and improved convenience for patients. The clinical experience with oral ATO has previously been reported piecemeal as case series, pilot studies or subgroup analyses rather than in a comprehensive cohort. In this report we attempt to synthesize the published English language literature on oral arsenicals and present the argument for further development of these compounds.

METHODS: Tet-Off inducible system was used to construct the conditional expression vector of TBLR1-RARalpha fusion gene by cloning the TBLR1-RARalpha fragment into lentivirus vector pLVX-Tight-Puro, the expression of TBLR1-RARalpha fusion gene was induced by doxycycline (Dox). Then, K562 cells were transfected with lentivirus pLVX-Tight-Puro-TBLR1-RARalpha-flag, and the expression of fusion proteins was verified by Western blot. After treatment of K562 with all-trans retinoid acid (ATRA), real time RT-PCR was performed to test the expression of erythroid differentiation-related CD71 and alpha, epsilon, gamma-globins gene. Flow cytometry was used also to analyze the expression of erythroid differentiation markers CD71 and CD235a. Benzidine staining was used to detect the production of hemoglobin in K562 cells. RESULTS: qRT-RCR showed that ATRA could increase the expression level of CD71 and alpha, epsilon, gamma-globin genes when TBLR1-RARalpha was expressed. After treatment of ATRA, the proportion of CD71(+) cells detected by the flow cytometry also increased. Benzidine staining showed that ATRA could induce hemoglobin production in K562 cells with TBLR1-RARalpha fusion gene expression. CONCLUSION: The expression of TBLR1-RARalpha fusion gene contribute to ATRA-inducing differentiation of K562 cells into erythroid lineage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: All patients, >/=18 years of age, provided by 24 Shanghai hospitals with initial clinical findings consistent with a hematopoietic abnormality between June 2003 and April 2007, were the candidates for inclusion in this study. The blood and bone marrow samples of every patient should be provided at baseline. Diagnosis was made by incorporating morphologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic and molecular features according to WHO classification criteria. Cytogenetic analysis was performed using conventional G-banding karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques. Cumulative risk of evolution was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic factors were evaluated by univariate Log-rank method and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: A total of 435 patients were diagnosed as MDS. The median age of MDS onset was 58(18-90) years, with 248 male patients and 187 female patients (male: female 1.33: 1). The percentage of cases with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) was the highest (65.5%), while that of refraetory anemia (RA) (2.3%), refractory anenia with ring sideroblast (RARS) (1.1%) and 5q-syndrome (0.5%) was lower. Trisomy 8 (+8) was the most common chromosome abnormalities (71 cases, 12.7%). The mean follow-up time was 20.3 (4.2-57.1) months. Cases were patients with evolution by the end of follow-up, while controls were patients without evolution by that time. Case group included 41 patients and control group included 342 patients. Univariate analysis showed that the age, sex, WHO subtype, WBC count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), IPSS cytogenetic subgroup, IPSS group and bone marrow blast percentage were significant risk factors for leukemia-free survival (LFS). Multivariate analysis of COX model showed that the age, sex, WHO subtype, IPSS cytogenetic subgroup and bone marrow blast were independent risk factors for LFS. CONCLUSION: A nested case-control study cohort of MDS patients is established. The clinical characteristics and WHO subtype of MDS patients in Chinese Shanghai are different from that in Western countries. The independent risk factors for MDS evolution are age, sex, WHO subtype, IPSS cytogenetic subgroup and bone marrow blast percentage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Three kinds of leukemia cell lines (U266, K562 and U937) were treated with either indomethacin (final concentration 30 micromol/L) or solvent DMSO (control) for 7 days. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue, cell apoptosis and cell cycle were determined by flow cytometry, mRNA expression of hyperplastic suppression gene P21 and P27 was determined by RT-PCR, and cell senescence rate was assayed at day 0, 4, 7 after treatment. RESULTS: After treatment with indomethacin, the cell viability in U266 and U937 groups decreased significantly, while it was not changed in K562 group. Cell cycle in U266 and U937 groups was blocked at G(2)/M phase, but the blooking effect was not found in K562 cells. The cell apoptotic rate was enhanced in 3 treated groups (P < 0.01). The mRNA expression of P21 and P27 was significantly increased after indomethacin treatment in U266 and K562 cell lines except for the P27 mRNA expression of U937. The expression levels of P21 and P27 mRNA in U266 and K562 increased obviously. The cell senescence rate in K562 and U937 group also increased. CONCLUSION: The indomethacin possesses inhibitory effects on leukemia cells. However, its mechanisms are varied from different types of leukemia cells. It suggests that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can play a role in adjuvant therapy for leukemia, while its application would be adjusted according to different types of leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: sixty cases of newly diagnosed APL were enrolled in this study. They received standard remission induction, consolidation and maintenance treatments according to the clinical pathway for APL, and were followed up. During the same time the PML/RARalpha fusion gene mRNA expression of all cases was detected by multi-nested PCR. RESULTS: except for 3 death cases and 1 case failed to follow-up, the PML/RARalpha fusion genes in the remaining 56 cases were firstly found to be negative from 24 to 381 days respectively, the mean value of the first switched time was 131 +/- 90 days. There was no statistically significant difference in age, sex and risk stratification between different groups. However, the cases with L-type PML/RARalpha gene had shorter time compared with the patients with S-type PML/RARalpha gene (P = 0.032); then, for the above-mentimed 56 cases, the follow-up duration ranged from 25-1979 days (median 946 days), long-term molecular remissions had been observed in most cases, but 1 case with the first switched time of 133 days unfortunately recurred to be positive and followed by clinical relapse. CONCLUSION: The PML/RARalpha fusion gene in newly diagnosed APL patients was first switched to be negative in about 4 months after treatment. The first switched time of PML/RARalpha fusion gene can objectively reflect the reduction of leukemia cells, and the differences among different subtypes of PML/RARalpha fusion gene may have some suggestions for the treatment, but without important significance for the evaluation of prognosis and recurrence for APL patients. In addition, minimal residual disease (MRD) can be dynamically monitored by detecting PML/RARalpha fusion gene, thus having an important clinical significance for analysis of APL recurrence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) from 44 AML patients and 25 healthy donors were collected, and the expression level of CD131 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. The full length coding sequence of CD131 from 15 patients and 5 healthy donors was amplified by RT-PCR, and linked to pGEM-T vector to clone TA, 10 positive recombinant clones of each sample were analyzed by DNA sequencing. The AML patients were divided into CD131 negative and CD131 positive groups according the expression level of CD131, and white blood cell counts, CD34(+) cells percentage, complete remission rate of patients were compared. RESULTS: CD131 was expressed at a lower level in AML than that in healthy donor. Five kinds of CD131 mutantions could be detected in both AML and healthy donor groups, but the mutation rate in AML (75.33%) was higher than that in healthy donors (18.0%). CD131 negative group showed a higher CD34(+) cells percentage (69.1% +/- 20.8%), and lower complete remission rate (33.3%) than that in CD131 positive group (69.1% +/- 20.8%, 33.3%). No statistically significant difference of WBC counts was found between 2 groups. CONCLUSION: CD131 is expressed at a low level and shows high frequency of mutation in acute myeloid leukemic cells.

METHODS: Firstly, methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) was used to analyze the methylation status of CpG islands in microRNA let-7b promoter of bone marrow mononuclear cells in the patients with ALL and patients with non-hematologic malignancies as control, the real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to detect the expression levels of microRNA let-7b in this 2 groups; and then 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC, DAC) was used to treat ALL cell line MOLT-4; after drug treatment, MSP was used to analyze the methylation status of the CpG islands in microRNA let-7b promoter; the qPCR was used to detect the expression levels of microRNA let-7b, and further explore the regulatory mechanism of microRNA let-7b expression. RESULTS: Hypermethylation of CpG islands in microRNA let-7b promoter in ALL patients was significantly higher than that in patients with non-hematologic malignancies, and the relative expression level of microRNA let-7b was significantly reduced in ALL patients; 5-aza-dC could significantly inhibit the growth of MOLT-4 cells and arrest the cells in G1 phase, thus biosynthesis of RNA and protein was suppressed, and the apoptosis was promoted, meanwhile, 5-Aza-dC could increase the expression of microRNA let-7b. CONCLUSION: In the patients with ALL, the expression of microRNA let-7b is regulated by methylation of CpG islands in the region of genomic promoter. The microRNA let-7b may act as a tumor suppressor, whose low expression is involved in ALL development, indicating the microRNA let-7b may become a new therapeutic target for ALL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 18.,"T-Cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is considered a largely curable disease in children; however, adult patients and children with refractory or relapsed disease have consistently poor outcomes. On the basis of our prior work highlighting CD44 as a marker of leukemia-initiating cells in animal models and because cancer stem cells are postulated to possess intrinsic resistance to conventional chemotherapy, we examined whether CD44 itself might play a role in mediating chemoresistance. We report here that in both genetically defined mouse models and human cell lines, CD44 expression is associated with chemoresistance, and that this effect is mediated in part through enhanced drug efflux. Interestingly, we also observed increased CD44 expression in residual blasts following standard induction chemotherapy, as compared with blasts from matched, pretherapy samples in a subset of pediatric patients undergoing minimal residual disease monitoring as part of a clinical trial. These findings support a functional role for CD44 in promoting chemotherapy resistance and suggest that targeting it directly or its relevant effector pathways may improve clinical responses in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",,,"['Copyright (c) 2016 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

In recent years, the contribution of two variants of FEN1, rs174538 and rs4246215, regarding cancer risk have been investigated in lung, breast, liver, esophageal, gastric, colorectal cancer and glioma. However, it has not been revealed whether rs174538 and rs4246215 are associated with leukemia. Therefore, in the present study we aimed to evaluate the contribution of these genotypic polymorphisms in FEN1 to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) risk in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 266 patients with childhood ALL and an equal number of recruited non-cancer controls were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: The FEN1 rs174538 genotype, but not rs4246215, was differently distributed between childhood ALL and control groups. The AG and AA of FEN1 rs174538 genotypes were significantly less frequently found in childhood ALL patients than in controls (odds ratio [OR]=0.68 and 0.48, 95%confidence intervals [CI]=0.47-0.98 and 0.24-0.82, respectively). As for gender, boys carrying the FEN1 rs174538 AG or AA genotype conferred lower ORs of 0.55 and 0.36 (95%CI=0.33-0.91 and 0.18-0.73, p=0.0053) for childhood ALL. Regarding age, those equal to or greater than 3.5 years of age at onset carrying the FEN1 rs174538 AG or AA genotype were of lower risk (ORs=0.53 and 0.32, 95%CI=0.31-0.90 and 0.15-0.70, p=0.0042). CONCLUSION: The FEN1 rs174538 A allele is a protective biomarker for childhood ALL and this association is more significant in males and in patients at onset age of 3.5 years or older.",['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood leukemia', 'FEN1', 'Taiwan', 'genotype', 'polymorphism']","['Copyright(c) 2016, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 18.,"Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), a master regulator of the antioxidant response element (ARE)-dependent transcription, plays a pivotal role in chemical detoxification in normal and tumor cells. Consistent with previous findings that NRF2-ARE contributes to chemotherapeutic resistance of cancer cells, we found that stable knockdown of NRF2 by lentiviral shRNA in human acute monocytic leukemia (AML) THP-1 cells enhanced the cytotoxicity of several chemotherapeutic agents, including arsenic trioxide (As2O3), etoposide and doxorubicin. Using an ARE-luciferase reporter expressed in several human and mouse cells, we identified a set of compounds, including isonicotinic acid amides, isoniazid and ethionamide, that inhibited NRF2-ARE activity. Treatment of THP-1 cells with ethionamide, for instance, significantly reduced mRNA expression of multiple ARE-driven genes under either basal or As2O3-challenged conditions. As determined by cell viability and cell cycle, suppression of NRF2-ARE by ethionamide also significantly enhanced susceptibility of THP-1 and U937 cells to As2O3-induced cytotoxicity. In THP-1 cells, the sensitizing effect of ethionamide on As2O3-induced cytotoxicity was highly dependent on NRF2. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate that ethionamide suppresses NRF2-ARE signaling and disrupts the transcriptional network of the antioxidant response in AML cells, leading to sensitization to chemotherapeutic agents.",['NOTNLM'],"['Arsenic trioxide', 'Chemotherapeutic resistance', 'Cytotoxicity', 'Ethionamide', 'Isoniazid', 'Leukemia', 'NRF2']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2015 Dec 18.,"Polymer drug carriers that are based on N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymers have been widely used in the development and synthesis of high-molecular-weight (HMW) drug delivery systems for cancer therapy. In this study, we compared linear (Mw ~27kDa, Rh ~4nm) and non-degradable star (Mw ~250kDa, Rh ~13nm) HPMA copolymer conjugates bearing anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin (DOX) bound via pH-sensitive hydrazone bond. We determined the in vitro and in vivo toxicity of both conjugates and their maximum tolerated dose (MTD). We also compared their anti-tumour activity in mouse B-cell leukaemia (BCL1) and a mouse T-cell lymphoma (EL4) model. We found that MTD was higher for the linear conjugate (85mgDOX/kg) and lower for the star conjugate (22.5mgDOX/kg). An evaluation of the intestinal barrier integrity using FITC-dextran as a gut permeability tracer proved that no pathology was caused by the MTD of either conjugate. However, free DOX showed some damage to the gut barrier. The therapy of BCL1 leukaemia by both of the polymeric conjugates using the MTD or its fraction (i.e., equitoxic dosage) showed better results in the case of the star conjugate. On the other hand, treatment of EL4 lymphoma seemed to be more efficient when the linear conjugate was used. We suppose that the anti-cancer treatment of solid tumours and leukaemias requires different types of drug conjugates. We hypothesise that the most suitable HPMA copolymer-DOX conjugate for the treatment of solid tumours should have an HMW structure with increased Rh that would be stable for three to four days after the conjugate administration and then rapidly disintegrate in the short polymer chains, which are excretable from the body by glomerular filtration. On the other hand, the treatment of leukaemia requires a drug conjugate with a long circulation half-life. This would provide an active drug, whilst slowly degrading to excretable fragments.",['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-tumour activity', 'Doxorubicin', 'HPMA', 'Structure', 'Toxicity']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2015 Dec 28.,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a high-risk subset of acute leukemia, characterized by frequent activation of Notch1 or AKT signaling, where new therapeutic approaches are needed. We showed previously that cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) is required for thymic lymphoblastic lymphoma induced by activated AKT. Here, we show CDK6 is required for initiation and maintenance of Notch-induced T-ALL. In a mouse retroviral model, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells lacking CDK6 protein or expressing kinase-inactive (K43M) CDK6 are resistant to induction of T-ALL by activated Notch, whereas those expressing INK4-insensitive (R31C) CDK6 are permissive. Pharmacologic inhibition of CDK6 kinase induces CD25 and RUNX1 expression, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in mouse and human T-ALL. Ablation of Cd25 in a K43M background restores Notch-induced T leukemogenesis, with disease that is resistant to CDK6 inhibitors in vivo. These data support a model whereby CDK6-mediated suppression of CD25 is required for initiation of T-ALL by activated Notch1, and CD25 induction mediates the therapeutic response to CDK6 inhibition in established T-ALL. These results both validate CDK6 as a molecular target for therapy of this subset of T-ALL and suggest that CD25 expression could serve as a biomarker for responsiveness of T-ALL to CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy.",,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-7669-9506'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results suggest that venetoclax is only active in a small cohort of patients therefore we wanted to determine its efficacy when used in combination. Combining venetoclax with melphalan or carfilzomib produced additive or better cell death in four of the five cell lines tested. The most striking results were seen with dexamethasone (Dex). Co-treatment of human myeloma cell lines and primary patient samples, with Dex and venetoclax, significantly increased cell death over venetoclax alone in four of the five cell lines, and in all patient samples tested. The mechanism by which this occurs is an increase in the expression of both Bcl-2 and Bim upon addition of Dex. This results in alterations in Bim binding to anti-apoptotic proteins. Dex shifts Bim binding towards Bcl-2 resulting in increased sensitivity to venetoclax. These data suggest that knowledge of drug-induced alterations of Bim-binding patterns may help inform better combination drug regimens. Furthermore, the data indicate combining this novel therapeutic with Dex could be an effective therapy for a broader range of patients than would be predicted by single-agent activity.",,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01794507'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 7.,"BACKGROUND: BCL11A encodes a C2H2 type zinc-finger protein. During normal haematopoietic cell differentiation BCL11A expression is down-regulated. Data in mice suggest up-regulation of BCL11A is involved in the pathogenesis of myeloid leukaemias. BCL11A expression in persons with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is not systematically studied. OBJECTIVE: Interrogate associations between BCL11A expression at diagnosis and clinical and laboratory valuables and outcomes in newly-diagnosed persons with AML. METHODS: We determined BCL11A mRNA levels in bone marrow and blood mononuclear cells in 292 consecutive newly-diagnosed subjects with AML by reverse transcript and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Data were compared to mRNA levels in bone marrow cells of normals. RESULTS: Subjects with BCL11A transcript levels at diagnosis exceeding the median value of 2.434 (+/-3.423 SD; 25th-75th inter-quartile range, 1.33-4.29) had higher WBC levels, a greater proportion of bone marrow myeloblasts, were more likely to be FAB M0 subtype, less likely to be FAB M3 subtype, more likely to be in the intermediate cytogenetic risk cohort, less likely to have a complex karyotype and more likely to have DNMT3A(R882) and FLT3-ITD mutations than subjects with transcript levels below the median value. In 89 subjects receiving conventional induction chemotherapy the complete remission rate was 54% (95% confidence interval [CI]; 33, 75%) in the lower BCL11A cohort and 65% (45, 85%; P=0.26) in the higher BCL11A cohort. 3 year survival was 33% (2, 65%) in the lower BCL11A cohort and 15% (0, 39%; P=0.35) in the high BCL11A cohort. CONCLUSION: BCL11A transcript levels at diagnosis was significantly associated with several clinical and laboratory variables. There were also non-significant associations with complete remission rate and survival.

This is a prospective evaluation of the incidence, risk factors and outcomes of TE in 1038 children with ALL. TE occurred in 6.1% of children, with the highest incidence (20.5%) among those aged 15-17 years. A TE-associated case fatality of 6.4% indicates that TE is a severe complication of ALL treatment. SUMMARY: BACKGROUND: Thromboembolism (TE) is a major toxicity in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and may have a negative impact on ALL treatment. OBJECTIVES: To examine the cumulative incidence, outcomes and risk factors associated with TE in children with leukemia. PATIENTS/METHODS: We prospectively evaluated TE in 1038 Nordic children and adolescents (>/= 1 and < 18 years) diagnosed with ALL during 2008-2013 and treated according to the NOPHO (Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology)-ALL 2008 protocol. The cohort was followed until December 2014. Cox proportional regression was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: TE events (n = 63) occurred most frequently in conjunction with asparaginase (ASP) administration (52/63). The cumulative incidence of TE was 6.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.8-7.7). Being aged 15-17 years was associated with an increased risk of TE (adjusted HR of 4.0; 95% CI, 2.1-7.7). We found a TE-associated 30-day case fatality of 6.4% (95% CI, 1.8-15.5) and TE-related truncation of ASP therapy in 36.2% (21/58). Major hemorrhage occurred in 3.5% (2/58) of anticoagulated patients. Minor hemorrhage was reported in two out of 58 patients. No major bleeds occurred in children who received low-molecular-weight heparin. CONCLUSIONS: Methods to identify children and adolescents who will benefit from thromboprophylaxis during ALL treatment are called for. The truncation of ASP should be avoided. The long-term survival outcomes for ALL patients with TE require close monitoring in the future.",['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'asparaginase', 'children', 'thromboembolism']",['(c) 2015 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing were performed in DNA of whole blood obtained a year prior to the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and at the time of diagnosis of AML, respectively. We analyzed rare mutations in cancer susceptibility genes using a candidate strategy and estimated cancer risk using the Risk-O-Gram algorithm. We found rare mutations in cancer susceptibility genes associated with an increased hereditary cancer risk in the patient. Notably, the number of mutated genes in p53 signaling pathway was significantly higher than expected (p=0.02). However, the phenotype of multiple malignant neoplasms of the studied patient was unlikely to be caused by accumulation of common cancer risk alleles. In conclusion, we established the mutation profile in a rare case of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, illustrating that the rare mutations rather than the cumulative of common risk alleles leading to an increased cancer risk in the patient.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biocompatibility assays were performed in murine fibroblast (L929) cells and human peripheral blood lymphocytes (HPBL). Finally, photobiological assays were performed in two leukemic cells: chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis (K562) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Jurkat). ZnPc loaded PMMA NPs presented an average diameter of 97+/-2.5 nm with a low polydispersity index and negative surface charge. The encapsulation efficiency (EE %) of ZnPc PMMA NPs was 87%+/-2.12. The release of ZnPc from PMMA NPs was slow and sustained without the presence of burst effect, indicating homogeneous drug distribution in the polymeric matrix. NP biocompatibility was observed on the treatment of peripheral blood lymphocytes and L929 fibroblast cells. Phototoxicity assays showed that the ZnPc loaded in PMMA NPs was more phototoxic than ZnPc after activation with visible light at 675 nm, using a low light dose of 2J/cm(2) in both leukemic cells (Jurkat and K562). The results from fluorescence microscopy (EB/OA) and DNA fragmentation suggest that the ZnPc loaded PMMA NPs induced cell death by apoptosis. Based on presented results, our study suggests that PDT combined with the use of polymeric NPs, may be an excellent alternative for leukemia treatment.",['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia', 'Miniemulsion', 'Photodynamic therapy', 'Polymeric nanoparticles']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

One strategy used to overcome resistance is combination of existing BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors with agents that target alternative pathways. We report that inhibition of isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (Icmt), a key enzyme in the protein prenylation pathway, with the selective inhibitor cysmethynil enhances the effect of BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors in killing CML cells. Cysmethynil augments tyrosine kinase inhibitor-induced apoptosis in both BCR-ABL1 wild type and BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutant-expressing cell lines. Importantly, the enhanced apoptosis observed with the combination of cysmethynil and imatinib is significant only in primary CML CD34+ progenitor cells, not normal cord blood progenitor cells. The combination was also selective in inhibiting colony formation in CML CD34+ cells. The enhanced apoptosis appears to be due to combination of immediate and persistent inhibition of MAPK signaling. Consistent with in vitro studies, cysmethynil and imatinib, in combination, enhance the in vivo effects of either drug used alone. We found that simultaneous inhibition of BCR-ABL1 and Icmt may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for CML.",,,"['Copyright (c) 2016 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

AML1-ETO functions as a rogue transcription factor, altering the expression of genes critical for myeloid cell development and differentiation. Currently, there are no specific therapies for AML1-ETO-positive AML. While known for decades to be the translational product of a chimeric gene created by the stable chromosome translocation t(8;21)(q22;q22), it is not known how AML1-ETO achieves its native and functional conformation or whether this process can be targeted for therapeutic benefit. Here, we show that the biosynthesis and folding of the AML1-ETO protein is facilitated by interaction with the essential eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC (or CCT). We demonstrate that a folding intermediate of AML1-ETO binds to TRiC directly, mainly through its beta-strand rich, DNA-binding domain (AML-(1-175)), with the assistance of HSP70. Our results suggest that TRiC contributes to AML1-ETO proteostasis through specific interactions between the oncoprotein's DNA-binding domain, which may be targeted for therapeutic benefit.",['NOTNLM'],"['AML1-ETO', 'TRiC/CCT', 'chaperone', 'chaperonin', 'fusion protein', 'leukemia', 'protein folding']","['(c) 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']",,,,,,,['2017/02/26 00:00'],,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Data obtained from death registration system of the healthcare center were used to calculate the age-specific standardized mortality for 5-year age groups. To calculate the YLL, the standardized expected YLL method was used with a discount rate of 0.03 for health gain in the future, the age weight of 0.04 for different years of age, and a constant age weight correction factor of 0.165. The collected data were analyzed using the Epi 6 and Excel 2007. RESULTS: 28 patients in Yazd aged 0-19 die annually due Leukemia and CNS tumors were the most common causes of death. The crude cancer death rate is 8.48 in boys and 6.72 in girls per 100000. Premature cancer deaths have caused 3,436 YLL in boys and 2,561 YLL in girls (4.92% of total YLL in both sex) .The average death age did not have a significant relationship with sex or location of residence.

Epub 2015 Jul 20.,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is a medical problem in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Obesity is associated with many complications, so it is important to investigate the respective etiology. Leptin is a protein synthesized in the fatty tissue and is effective in the control of obesity. Survey of leptin in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors could be helpful in controlling obesity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, 53 pediatric patients diagnosed with ALL between 2006 and 2012 from Southern Iran, were enrolled. We examined body mass index (BMI) status and performed laboratory measuring tests including triglyceride, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, leptin at diagnosis time and then every 6 months and in the last visit. RESULTS: Participants consisted of 35 male and 18 female patients. At the time of diagnosis, 5.66% were overweight or obese, whereas at the end of treatment, approximately 13 patients (24.53%) were overweight or obese. The median and interquartile range (IQR) for blood leptin level were significantly higher for obese patients than other patients (885, 1120 vs. 246, 494 pg/ml), (P=0.030). The median and IQR were also significantly higher in females than in males (861, 969 vs. 204, 267 pg/ml), (P=0.006). CONCLUSION: Obesity is a complication of ALL treatment. It is associated with elevated blood leptin level. Hypothalamus leptin resistance in obese patients should be considered. In each visit, clinicians should weight and their patient's BMI take into account.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'BMI', 'Leptin', 'Obesity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is the hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). It results in juxtaposition of the 5' part of the BCR gene on chromosome 22 to the 3' part of the ABL1 gene on chromosome 9. During CML progression 60-80 % of the cases acquire additional genetic changes. Blast crisis (BC) is characterized by the rapid expansion of a population of differentiation arrested blast cells (myeloid or lymphoid cells population), often presenting with secondary chromosomal abnormalities. Here we report an unusual CML-BC case with acquired secondary chromosomal aberrations observed after the patient had to interrupt a successful Imatinib treatment for overall 16 months. CASE PRESENTATION: A complete cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic analysis were performed and application of molecular genetic methods such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) finally characterized a complex karyotype including an inv dup(22)(q11.23), tetrasomy 8 and trisomy 19. CONCLUSIONS: Here we report the first case of a BC after successfully initiated and suddenly interrupted Imatinib treatment.

PTBP2 was found to maintain embryonic splicing patterns of many synaptic and cytoskeletal proteins during differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) into early neurons. However, the role of the earlier PTBP1 program in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and NPCs was not clear. We show that PTBP1 controls a program of neuronal gene expression that includes the transcription factor Pbx1. We identify exons specifically regulated by PTBP1 and not PTBP2 as mouse ESCs differentiate into NPCs. We find that PTBP1 represses Pbx1 exon 7 and the expression of the neuronal Pbx1a isoform in ESCs. Using CRISPR-Cas9 to delete regulatory elements for exon 7, we induce Pbx1a expression in ESCs, finding that this activates transcription of neuronal genes.

Epub 2015 Dec 23.,"Chromatin immunoprecipitation with massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) has greatly improved the reliability with which transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) can be identified from genome-wide profiling studies. Many computational tools are developed to detect binding events or peaks, however the robust detection of weak binding events remains a challenge for current peak calling tools. We have developed a novel Bayesian approach (ChIP-BIT) to reliably detect TFBSs and their target genes by jointly modeling binding signal intensities and binding locations of TFBSs. Specifically, a Gaussian mixture model is used to capture both binding and background signals in sample data. As a unique feature of ChIP-BIT, background signals are modeled by a local Gaussian distribution that is accurately estimated from the input data. Extensive simulation studies showed a significantly improved performance of ChIP-BIT in target gene prediction, particularly for detecting weak binding signals at gene promoter regions. We applied ChIP-BIT to find target genes from NOTCH3 and PBX1 ChIP-seq data acquired from MCF-7 breast cancer cells. TF knockdown experiments have initially validated about 30% of co-regulated target genes identified by ChIP-BIT as being differentially expressed in MCF-7 cells. Functional analysis on these genes further revealed the existence of crosstalk between Notch and Wnt signaling pathways.",,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2015.

In this study, we investigated the effects of an ethanol KP extract and two of its components [5,7-dimethoxyflavone (DMF) and 5-hydroxy-3,7,3',4'-tetramethoxyflavone (TMF)] on monocyte adhesion and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), which provide an in vitro model of events relevant to the development and progression of atherosclerosis. METHODS: RAW264.7 mouse macrophage-like cells were incubated with various concentrations of KP extract or polymethoxyflavonoids and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide prior to measuring nitrite levels in the culture media. Monocyte adhesion was evaluated by measuring the fluorescently labeled human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells that is attached to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-stimulated HUVECs. Cellular ROS production was assessed by measuring cellular antioxidant activity using pyocyanin-stimulated HUVECs. RESULTS: KP extract and DMF reduced nitrite levels (as indicator of nitric oxide production) in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells and also inhibited THP-1 cell adhesion to HUVECs. These treatments induced mRNA expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase in TNF-alpha-stimulated HUVECs and downregulated that of various cell adhesion molecules, inflammatory mediators, and endothelial function-related genes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was inhibited by KP extract in vitro. Furthermore, KP extract, DMF, and TMF inhibited the production of cellular ROS in pyocyanin-stimulated HUVECs. CONCLUSION: KP extract, DMF, and TMF showed potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in these in vitro models, properties that would inhibit the development and progression of atherosclerosis.",['NOTNLM'],"['Atherosclerosis', 'Cell adhesion', 'HUVECs', 'Inflammatory mediator', 'Kaempferia parviflora', 'Polymethoxyflavonoid']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 17.,"Galectin 3 (LGALS3) expression is prognostic for poor survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. GCS-100 is a novel galectin inhibitor that may prove useful for AML therapy. In this study, we found that GCS-100 induced apoptosis in AML cells. The agent reduced MCL-1 expression suggesting that GCS-100 could be more effective when combined with a BH3 mimetic. Indeed, potent synergistic cytotoxicity was achieved when GCS-100 was combined with ABT-737 or ABT-199. Furthermore, the GCS-100/ABT-199 combination was effective against primary AML blast cells from patients with FLT3 ITD mutations, which is another prognostic factor for poor outcome in AML. This activity may involve wild-type p53 as shRNA knockdown of LGALS3 or galectin 1 (LGALS1) sensitized wild-type p53 OCI-AML3 cells to GCS-100/ABT-737-induced apoptosis to a much greater extent than p53 null THP-1 cells. Suppression of LGALS3 by shRNA inhibited MCL-1 expression in OCI-AML3 cells, but not THP-1 cells, suggesting the induced sensitivity to ABT-737 may involve a MCL-1 mediated mechanism. OCI-AML3 cells with LGALS1 shRNA were also sensitized to ABT-737. However, these cells exhibited increased MCL-1 expression, so MCL-1 reduction is apparently not required in this process. A role for p53 appears important as GCS-100 induces p53 expression and shRNA knockdown of p53 protected OCI-AML3 cells from the cytotoxic effects of the GCS-100/ABT-737 treatment combination. Our results suggest that galectins regulate a survival axis in AML cells, which may be targeted via combined inhibition with drugs such as GCS-100 and ABT-199.",['NOTNLM'],"['GCS-100', 'Galectin', 'Leukemia', 'MCL-1', 'Signal transduction', 'p53']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study was carried out to find the prevalence and profile of IKZF1 deletions and their correlation in B-ALL. METHODS: The untreated B-ALL cases were prospectively analyzed for IKZF1 deletions over a period of eleven months using multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA). The IKZF1 deletions were classified into three functional groups-dominant negative, haploinsufficiency and others. The response to induction chemotherapy was correlated with the IKZF1 deletion status. RESULTS: The median age of 101 cases was 7 years (1-67) with 82 pediatric (<18 years) cases. Fifteen cases were positive for BCR-ABL. The IKZF1 deletions were detected in 29 (28.7%) cases; 53% BCR-ABL positive, 24% BCR-ABL negative, 47% adult and 24% pediatric cases. Out of the 29 deletions, 19 (66%) were haploinsufficiency, 8 (28%) were dominant negative and 2 others. The IKZF1 deleted cases had higher induction failure rates compared to the cases without IKZF1 deletions. CONCLUSIONS: The IKZF1 deletions were detected in 28.7% B-ALL patients. These were more common in BCR-ABL positive and adult B-ALL compared to the BCR-ABL negative and pediatric cases, respectively. The haploinsufficiency was commoner than dominant negative IKZF1 deletions.

Epub 2015 Dec 15.,"ATF7IP-PDGFRB is a novel PDGFRB-related fusion gene identified in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) with a signature similar to that of Ph1 ALL, so-called Ph-like ALL. When we introduced ATF7IP-PDGFRB, murine Ba/F3 cells acquired the ability to proliferate in an interleukin (IL)-3-independent manner. On the contrary, the expression of wild-type PDGFRB is not sufficient to acquire the ability for IL-3-independent proliferation in Ba/F3 cells. The introduction of ATF7IP-PDGFRB also induces a typical gene expression profile for Ph1-ALL in Ba/F3 cells. A series of biochemical and cell biological experiments revealed the constitutive activation of ATF7IP-PDGFRB as well as downstream signaling molecules, including AKT and MAPK. Although the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor led to cell death in both cells into which ATF7IP-PDGFRB had been introduced and IL-3-maintained Mock cells, MEK inhibitor selectively led to cell death into which ATF7IP-PDGFRB had been introduced. The introduction of tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations at binding sites of adaptor molecules important in the MAPK pathway located in the PDGFRB portion abolished ATF7IP-PDGFRB-mediated cell transformation, suggesting that MAPK-mediated signals are critical in ATF7IP-PDGFRB-mediated cell transformation. On treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, ATF7IP-PDGFRB-expressing, but not Mock, Ba/F3 cells underwent rapid apoptosis accompanied by reduced phosphorylation of MAPK. Importantly, the sensitivity of ATF7IP-PDGFRB-expressing Ba/F3 cells to imatinib is significantly higher than that of BCR-ABL1-transformed Ba/F3 cells, as assessed by the IC50. Taken together, ATF7IP-PDGFRB has transforming potential via the constitutive activation of MAPK and participates in the pathogenesis of Ph-like ALL. Our observations suggest the therapeutic importance of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and possibly MEK inhibitor for a subset of BCP-ALL harboring PDGFRB-related fusion kinases.",,,"['Copyright (c) 2016 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

We sought to examine outcomes following E. coli l-asparaginase discontinuation due to severe allergic reactions. PROCEDURE: We evaluated the outcome of children enrolled in Taiwan Pediatric Oncology Group-2002-ALL protocol between 2002 and 2012, who had E. coli l-asparaginase discontinued due to severe allergic reactions, and compared the outcomes of those who continued with Erwinia l-asparaginase (Erwinase) with those who did not. RESULTS: Among 700 patients enrolled in this study, 33 patients had E. coli l-asparaginase treatment discontinued due to severe allergic reactions. Five-year overall survival did not differ significantly among the 648 patients without discontinuation (81 +/- 1.6%, mean +/- SE), compared to 17 patients with allergic reactions and treated with Erwinase (88 +/- 7.8%) and 16 patients with allergic reactions but not treated with Erwinase (87 +/- 8.6%). Among 16 patients who did not receive Erwinase, all 10 who received >/=50% of the scheduled doses of E. coli l-asparaginase before discontinuation survived without events.

PML and ND10 structures have been shown to mediate an intrinsic immune response against a variety of different viruses. Their role during retroviral replication, however, is still controversially discussed. In this study, we analyzed the role of PML and the ND10 components Daxx and Sp100 during retroviral replication in different cell types. Using cell lines exhibiting a shRNA-mediated knockdown, we found that PML, but not Daxx or Sp100, inhibits HIV and other retroviruses in a cell type-dependent manner. The PML-mediated block to retroviral infection was active in primary human fibroblasts and murine embryonic fibroblasts but absent from T cells and myeloid cell lines. Quantitative PCR analysis of HIV cDNA in infected cells revealed that PML restricts infection at the level of reverse transcription. Our findings shed light on the controversial role of PML during retroviral infection and show that PML contributes to the intrinsic restriction of retroviral infections in a cell type-dependent manner.",['NOTNLM'],"['HIV-1', 'ND10', 'PML', 'TRIM19', 'intrinsic immunity', 'retrovirus']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this progress, lead exposure continues to be a significant public health concern. The main goal of this research was to determine the in vitro mechanisms of lead nitrate [Pb(NO(3))(2)] to induce DNA damage, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest in human leukemia (HL-60) cells. To reach our goal, HL-60 cells were treated with different concentrations of Pb(NO(3))(2) for 24 h. Live cells and necrotic death cells were measured by the propidium idiode (PI) assay using the cellometer vision. Cell apoptosis was measured by the flow cytometry and DNA laddering. Cell cycle analysis was evaluated by the flow cytometry. The result of the PI demonstrated a significant (p < 0.05) increase of necrotic cell death in Pb(NO(3))(2)-treated cells, indicative of membrane rupture by Pb(NO(3))(2) compared to the control. Data generated from the comet assay indicated a concentration-dependent increase in DNA damage, showing a significant increase (p < 0.05) in comet tail-length and percentages of DNA cleavage. Data generated from the flow cytometry assessment indicated that Pb(NO(3))(2) exposure significantly (p < 0.05) increased the proportion of caspase-3 positive cells (apoptotic cells) compared to the control. The flow cytometry assessment also indicated Pb(NO(3))(2) exposure caused cell cycle arrest at the G(0)/G(1) checkpoint. The result of DNA laddering assay showed presence of DNA smear in the agarose gel with little presence of DNA fragments in the treated cells compared to the control.

Similarly, sex variability was observed in CI, boys (237 per 100,000) and girls (230 per 100,000). The most commonly diagnosed malignancies were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Central Nervous System (CNS)/brain and renal cancer. The geographic locales with relatively higher cancer CI in the state of DE were zip codes 19804 and 19960, but this does not imply cancer clustering.

Linalool is one of the biologically active compounds that can be isolated from Plantaginaceae. Most of the commonly used cytotoxic anticancer drugs have been shown to induce apoptosis in susceptible tumor cells. However, the signaling pathway for apoptosis remains undefined. In this study, the cytotoxic effect of linalool on human cancer cell lines was investigated. Water-soluble tetrazolium salts (WST-1) based colorimetric cellular cytotoxicity assay, was used to test the cytotoxic ability of linalool against U937 and HeLa cells, and flow cytometry (FCM) and genechip analysis were used to investigate the possible mechanism of apoptosis. These results demonstrated that linalool exhibited a good cytotoxic effect on U937 and HeLa cells, with the IC50 value of 2.59 and 11.02 muM, respectively, compared with 5-FU with values of 4.86 and 12.31 muM, respectively. After treating U937 cells with linalool for 6 h, we found an increased sub-G1 peak and a dose-dependent phenomenon, whereby these cells were arrested at the G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, by using genechip analysis, we observed that linalool can promote p53, p21, p27, p16, and p18 gene expression. Therefore, this study verified that linalool can arrest the cell cycle of U937 cells at the G0/G1 phase and can arrest the cell cycle of HeLa cells at the G2/M phase. Its mechanism facilitates the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinases inhibitors (CDKIs) p53, p21, p27, p16, and p18, as well as the non-expression of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) activity.",['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)', 'cyclin-dependent kinases inhibitors (CDKIs)', 'flow cytometry (FCM)', 'genechip', 'linalool']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The regulatory function and potential role of miRNAs targeting the mRNA of the 5'-aminolevulinate synthase 2 (ALAS2) in erythropoiesis were investigated in order to identify miRNAs which play a role in erythroid iron metabolism and differentiation. Firstly, the role of ALAS2 in erythroid differentiation and iron metabolism in human erythroid leukemia cells (K562) was confirmed by ALAS2 knockdown. Through a series of screening strategies and experimental validations, it was identified that hsa-miR-218 (miR-218) targets and represses the expression of ALAS2 by binding to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR). Overexpression of miR-218 repressed erythroid differentiation and altered iron metabolism in K562 cells similar to that seen in the ALAS2 knockdown in K562 cells. In addition to iron metabolism and erythroid differentiation, miR-218 was found to be responsible for a reduction in K562 cell growth.

Epub 2015 Dec 23.,"The TET enzymes are members of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family and comprise three isoenzymes in humans: TETs 1-3. These TETs convert 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) in DNA, and high 5-hmC levels are associated with active transcription. The importance of the balance in these modified cytosines is emphasized by the fact that TET2 is mutated in several human cancers, including myeloid malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We characterize here the kinetic and inhibitory properties of Tets and show that the Km value of Tets 1 and 2 for O2 is 30 mum, indicating that they retain high activity even under hypoxic conditions. The AML-associated mutations in the Fe(2+) and 2-oxoglutarate-binding residues increased the Km values for these factors 30-80-fold and reduced the Vmax values. Fumarate and succinate, which can accumulate to millimolar levels in succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate hydratase-mutant tumors, were identified as potent Tet inhibitors in vitro, with IC50 values approximately 400-500 mum. Fumarate and succinate also down-regulated global 5-hmC levels in neuroblastoma cells and the expression levels of some hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) target genes via TET inhibition, despite simultaneous HIFalpha stabilization. The combination of fumarate or succinate treatment with TET1 or TET3 silencing caused differential effects on the expression of specific HIF target genes. Altogether these data show that hypoxia-inducible genes are regulated in a multilayered manner that includes epigenetic regulation via TETs and 5-hmC levels in addition to HIF stabilization.",['NOTNLM'],"['5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC)', 'AML', 'TET', 'epigenetics', 'fumarate', 'hypoxia', 'hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)', 'leukemia', 'succinate']","['(c) 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fusion gene PAX5-PML has been identified in acute lymphoblastic leukemia with chromosomal translocation t(9;15)(p13;q24). We have reported previously that PAX5-PML dominant-negatively inhibited PAX5 transcriptional activity and impaired PML function by disrupting PML nuclear bodies (NBs). Here we demonstrated the leukemogenicity of PAX5-PML by introducing it into normal mouse pro-B cells. Arrest of differentiation was observed in PAX5-PML-introduced pro-B cells, resulting in the development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia after a long latency in mice. Among the transactivation targets of PAX5, B cell linker protein (BLNK) was repressed selectively in leukemia cells, and enforced BLNK expression abrogated the differentiation block and survival induced by PAX5-PML, indicating the importance of BLNK repression for the formation of preleukemic state.

Epub 2015 Dec 24.,"BACKGROUND: Fanconi anemia (FA) is a heterogeneous autosomal recessive (and rarely X linked) disorder, which is characterized by congenital malformations, progressive bone marrow failure, and predisposition to malignancies. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only definitive treatment for the hematological manifestations in FA. PROCEDURE: Twenty-seven patients with FA underwent HSCT using fludarabine (Flu) based regimen at our center between April 2004 and May 2014. One patient who developed acute leukemia before HSCT was excluded from the study. The remaining 26 patients were included. The median age of the patients at the time of transplantation was 9.6 years (range 5.6-17.0 years) and male/female ratio was 19/7. Donors were Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling in 18 patients, HLA-identical other relatives in six patients, and HLA 1-antigen mismatched sibling in two patients. Conditioning regimen consisted of Flu, cyclophosphamide, and antithymocyte globulin. RESULTS: All patients engrafted but one developed poor graft function and underwent second HSCT. Acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) (>/=grade 2) occurred in two patients (7.6%) and chronic GVHD in one patient (3.9%). Three patients developed venoocclusive disease (11.5%). Survival rate was 96.2% (25/26) at a median follow-up of 54 months (10-131 months) and all patients who survived were in good clinical condition. None of the patients developed secondary malignancy during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: The present study from Turkey, a middle-income country, shows successful transplant outcome with low toxicity using Flu-based conditioning in patients with FA who underwent HSCT from HLA-related donors.",['NOTNLM'],"['Fanconi anemia', 'fludarabine', 'transplantation']","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular three molecules (14d, 14e, and 14g) showing selectivity versus MAO A and remarkably inhibiting colony formation in THP-1 human leukemia cells, were assessed in mouse for their preliminary pharmacokinetic. 14d and 14e were further tested in vivo in a murine acute promyelocytic leukemia model, resulting 14d the most effective. Its two enantiomers were synthesized: the (1S,2R) enantiomer 15 showed higher activity than its (1R,2S) analogue 16, in both biochemical and cellular assays. Compound 15 exhibited in vivo efficacy after oral administration, determining a 62% increased survival in mouse leukemia model with evidence of KDM1A inhibition.

To optimize immunotherapy in the clinic, we aimed to create an in vivo model enabling us to analyze human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses against human malignancies. To this end, we developed NOD/SCID/IL2rgKO (NSG) mice expressing the HLA class I molecules HLA-A*0201 and A*2402. In the bone marrow (BM) and spleen of HLA class I transgenic (Tg) NSG mice transplanted with cord blood hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), we found human memory CD8(+) T cells and antigen-presenting cells. To evaluate antigen-specific human CTL responses, we immunized HLA class I Tg NSG mice using polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid mixed Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) peptides, with or without WT1 peptide-loaded autologous dendritic cells. After immunization, the frequencies of HLA-restricted WT1-specific CTLs increased significantly in the spleen. Next, we transplanted the WT1-specific T-cell receptor (WT1-TCR) gene-transduced human HSCs into HLA class I Tg NSG newborn mice. WT1 tetramer-positive CD8(+) T cells differentiated from WT1-TCR-transduced HSCs in the recipients' BM, spleen, and thymus. Upon stimulation with WT1 peptide in vitro, these CTLs produced interferon-gamma and showed lytic activity against leukemia cells in an antigen-specific, HLA-restricted manner. HLA class I Tg NSG xenografts may serve as a preclinical model to develop effective immunotherapy against human malignancies.",,,['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4868-1031'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

heterogeneous and no specific markers to predict sensitivity to this drug have been reported. In order to identify biomarkers of response, we analyzed the in vitro activity of bendamustine and the gene expression profile in primary CLL cells. We observed that mRNA expression of CD69 (CD69) and ITGAM (CD11b) constitute the most powerful predictor of response to bendamustine. When we interrogated the predictive value of the corresponding cell surface proteins, the expression of the activation marker CD69 was the most reliable predictor of sensitivity to bendamustine. Importantly, a multivariate analysis revealed that the predictive value of CD69 expression was independent from other clinico-biological CLL features. We also showed that when CLL cells were co-cultured with distinct subtypes of stromal cells, an upregulation of CD69 was accompanied by a reduced sensitivity to bendamustine. In agreement with this, tumor cells derived from lymphoid tumor niches harbored higher CD69 expression and were less sensitive to bendamustine than their peripheral blood counterparts. Furthermore, pretreatment of CD69 high CLL cases with the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway inhibitors ibrutinib and idelalisib decreased CD69 levels and enhanced bendamustine cytotoxic effect. Collectively, our findings indicate that CD69 could be a predictor of bendamustine response in CLL patients and the combination of clinically-tested BCR signaling inhibitors with bendamustine may represent a promising strategy for bendamustine low responsive CLL cases.",['NOTNLM'],"['CD69', 'bendamustine', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'ibrutinib', 'idelalisib']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about its role in development and progression of solid tumor. In this study, we found that the expression of TLE4 in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues was significantly higher than that in their matched adjacent intestine epithelial tissues. In addition, high expression of TLE4 was significantly correlated with advanced Dukes stage, lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis of CRC. Moreover, enforced expression of TLE4 in CRC cell lines significantly enhanced proliferation, invasion and tumor growth. On the contrary, knock down of TLE4 repressed cell proliferation, invasion and tumor growth. Furthermore, our study exhibited that the TLE4 promoted cell proliferation and invasion partially via activation of JNK-c-Jun pathway and subsequently increased cyclinD1 and decreased P27Kip1 expression. In conclusion, these results suggested that TLE4, a potential prognostic biomarker for CRC, plays an important role in the development and progression of human CRC.",['NOTNLM'],"['JNK', 'TLE4', 'c-Jun', 'colorectal cancer', 'proliferation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, pediatric-inspired chemotherapy may also offer durable leukemia-free survival in the absence of HCT. We compared 422 HCT recipients aged 18-50 years with Ph-ALL in CR1 reported to the CIBMTR with an age-matched concurrent cohort of 108 Ph- ALL CR1 patients who received a Dana-Farber Consortium pediatric-inspired non-HCT regimen. At 4 years of follow-up, incidence of relapse after HCT was 24% (95% CI 19-28) versus 23% (95% CI 15-32) for the non-HCT (chemo) cohort (P=0.97). Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was higher in the HCT cohort [HCT 37% (95% CI 31-42) versus chemo 6% (95% CI 3-12), P<0.0001]. DFS in the HCT cohort was 40% (95% CI 35-45) versus 71% (95% CI 60-79) for chemo, P<0.0001. Similarly, OS favored chemo [HCT 45% (95% CI 40-50)] versus chemo 73% [(95% CI 63-81), P<0.0001]. In multivariable analysis, the sole factor predictive of shorter OS was the administration of HCT [hazard ratio 3.12 (1.99-4.90), P<0.0001].

Epub 2016 Feb 3.,"OBJECTIVES: Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-1 causes T-cell leukaemia and myelopathy. Together with HTLV-2, it is endemic in some African nations. Seroprevalence data from Malawi are scarce, with no reports on associated disease incidence. HTLV seroprevalence and type were tested in 418 healthy mothers from Malawi. In addition, we tested the sera of 534 children to investigate mother-to-child transmission. To provide context, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of HTLV seroprevalence in African women and children. METHODS: Stored samples from a previous childhood cancer and BBV study were analysed. ELISA was used for HTLV screening followed by immunoblot for confirmation and typing. Standard methods were used for the systematic review. RESULTS: HTLV seroprevalence was 2.6% (11/418) in mothers and 2.2% (12/534) in children. Three mothers carried HTLV-1 alone, seven had HTLV-2 and one was dually infected. Three children carried HTLV-1 alone, seven had HTLV-2 and two were dually infected. Only two corresponding mothers of the 12 HTLV-positive children were HTLV positive. The systematic review included 66 studies of women and 13 of children conducted in 25 African countries. Seroprevalence of HTLV-1 varied from 0 to 17% and of HTLV-2 from 0 to 4%. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to findings from other studies in Africa, the seroprevalence of HTLV-2 was higher than that of HTLV-1 in Malawi and one of the highest for the African region. The lack of mother-child concordance suggests alternative sources of infection among children.

Epub 2016 Feb 9.,"Chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) is a potentially aggressive myeloproliferative neoplasm, for which current WHO diagnostic criteria include leukocytosis of >/=25 x 10(9) /L (of which >80% are neutrophils) and with <10 and <1% circulating immature granulocytes and blasts, respectively without dysplasia, clinical, or molecular criteria for other myeloproliferative disorders, nor an identifiable cause for physiologic neutrophilia in the absence of markers of myeloid clonality. Such a pathogenic clonal marker has now been identified as a somatic activating mutation of CSF3R, most commonly CSF3R T618I, thus demanding revision of the current WHO diagnostic classification to include the molecular criterion of mutated CSF3R. The clinical presentation, disease course and prognosis of CSF-R mutated CNL have been recently outlined. Co-operative mutations in SETBP1 and ASXL1 appear to be of prognostic significance and correlate with disease progression. Advances in the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of CNL, have not yet fully translated into satisfactory therapeutic strategies, but the foundations for these are strengthening. Am. J.

Despite the tremendous success of current treatment strategies, drug resistance still remains a major cause of chemotherapy failure and relapse in pediatric patients. Overwhelming evidence illustrates that microRNAs (miRNAs) act as post-transcriptional regulators of drug-resistance-related genes. The current study was aimed at how dysregulated miRNA-mRNA-signaling pathway interaction networks mediate resistance to four commonly used chemotherapy agents in pediatric ALL, including asparaginase, daunorubicin, prednisolone, and vincristine. Using public expression microarray datasets, a holistic in silico approach was utilized to investigate candidate drug resistance miRNA-mRNA-signaling pathway interaction networks in pediatric ALL. Our systems biology approach nominated significant drug resistance and cross-resistance miRNAs, mRNAs, and cell signaling pathways based on anti-correlative relationship between miRNA and mRNA expression pattern. To sum up, our systemic analysis disclosed either a new potential role of miRNAs, or a possible mechanism of cellular drug resistance, in chemotherapy resistance of pediatric ALL. The current study may shed light on predicting drug response and overcoming drug resistance in childhood ALL for subsequent generations of chemotherapies.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Drug resistance', 'Signaling pathway', 'Therapeutic targets', 'miRNA']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective cohort of patients with newly diagnosed ALL who were treated on the Total Therapy XVI protocol at St Jude Children's Research Hospital between 2007 and 2011 was evaluated. RESULTS: Of 223 children, 95 (43%) developed 133 episodes of viral acute respiratory illness (ARI) (incidence, 1.1 per 1000 patient-days). ARI without viral etiology was identified in 65 patients (29%) and no ARI was detected in 63 patients (28%). There were no significant associations noted between race, sex, age, or ALL risk group and the development of ARI. Children receiving induction chemotherapy were found to be at the highest risk of viral ARI (incidence, 2.3 per 1000 patient-days). Influenza virus was the most common virus (38%) followed by respiratory syncytial virus (33%). Of 133 episodes of viral ARI, 61% of patients were hospitalized, 26% experienced a complicated course, 80% had their chemotherapy delayed, and 0.7% of patients died. Twenty-four patients (18%) developed viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), 5 of whom (21%) had complications. Patients with viral LRTI had a significantly lower nadir absolute lymphocyte count; were sicker at the time of presentation; and were more likely to have respiratory syncytial virus, to be hospitalized, and to have their chemotherapy delayed for longer compared with those with viral upper respiratory tract infections. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the low incidence of viral ARI in children with ALL, the associated morbidity, mortality, and delay in chemotherapy remain clinically significant. Viral LRTI was especially associated with high morbidity requiring intensive care-level support. Cancer 2016;122:798-805.

The formation of radical intermediates, especially reactive oxygen species, upon UVA photoexcitation of the studied derivatives was monitored by indirect techniques of EPR spectroscopy. For all 4-anilinoquinazolines the photoinduced generation of superoxide radical anion was evidenced using spin trapping agent 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide, and the presence of (1)O2 was detected by the oxidation of 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine to the paramagnetic species 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine N-oxyl. The confirmed photoinduced activation of molecular oxygen via both Type I and Type II photooxidation mechanisms indicates potential phototoxic responses in cells. Biological results showed that derivatives I-V initiated different cytotoxic/phototoxic effects dependent on their concentration, time of treatment and the character of the cell line. UVA irradiation increased the cytotoxic activity of all tested 4-anilinoquinazoline derivatives. The highest cytotoxicity/phototoxicity on all tested cancer cells was induced by N,2-diphenyl-quinazolin-4-amine (derivative III). This most effective derivative emerged as the potent photosensitizer, which possesses a significant antiproliferative activity and DNA damage in L1210 cells increased by UVA irradiation.

Identifying areas to improve registry procedures might help to maximise completeness. We examined characteristics of childhood cancer cases that were registered via death certificate notification (DCN) rather than during life, and estimated completeness of the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry (SCCR). METHODS: We analysed data from all children who died from cancer in Switzerland between 1985-2009 at age <16 years (n = 978), and checked whether they had been registered in the SCCR. We used multivariable logistic regression to compare characteristics of DCN cases with deceased SCCR cases, and the DCN-to-incidence and mortality-to-incidence ratio method to estimate completeness for different diagnostic periods. RESULTS: Among 978 deceased children with cancer, 126 (12.9%) were registered via DCN. Those with tumours of digestive organs (odds ratio [OR] 5.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9-13.7), tumours of endocrine glands (OR 4.5; 95% CI 1.6-12.3), and brain tumours (OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.7-5.5) were more likely to be DCN cases than those with leukaemia. Neonates (OR 14.1, 95% CI 5.3-37.3), infants (OR 7.5; 95% CI 3.1-18.0) and 14-15 year olds (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.2-4.9) were more likely to be DCN cases than 1-4 year olds. The DCN proportion was particularly high in infants who lived in rural regions. Estimated completeness of the SCCR increased from 85% for 1985-89 to >/= 95% for 1995-2009. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood cancer registration in Switzerland was quite complete, but registration must improve for infants, particularly neonates, and children diagnosed with hepatic, endocrine and brain tumours.",,,,,,,,,['Swiss Paediatric Oncology Group (SPOG)'],,,,"['Ammann R', 'Angst R', 'Ansari M', 'Beck Popovic M', 'Bergstraesser E', 'Brazzola P', 'Greiner J', 'Grotzer M', 'Hengartner H', 'Kuehne T', 'Leibundgut K', 'Niggli F', 'Rischewski J', 'von der Weid N']","['Ammann, R A', 'Angst, R', 'Ansari, M', 'Beck Popovic, M', 'Bergstraesser, E', 'Brazzola, P', 'Greiner, J', 'Grotzer, M', 'Hengartner, H', 'Kuehne, T', 'Leibundgut, K', 'Niggli, F', 'Rischewski, J', 'von der Weid, N']",,,

Although mainly second generation (2G) CARs carrying CD28 or 4-1BB have been investigated in patients, preclinical studies suggest that third generation (3G) CARs with both CD28 and 4-1BB have enhanced capacity. However, little is known about the intracellular signaling pathways downstream of CARs. In the present work, we have analyzed the signaling capacity post antigen stimulation in both 2G and 3G CARs. 3G CAR T cells expanded better than 2G CAR T cells upon repeated stimulation with IL-2 and autologous B cells. An antigen-driven accumulation of CAR+ cells was evident post antigen stimulation. The cytotoxicity of both 2G and 3G CAR T cells was maintained by repeated stimulation. The phosphorylation status of intracellular signaling proteins post antigen stimulation showed that 3G CAR T cells had a higher activation status than 2G. Several proteins involved in signaling downstream the TCR were activated, as were proteins involved in the cell cycle, cell adhesion and exocytosis. In conclusion, 3G CAR T cells had a higher degree of intracellular signaling activity than 2G CARs which may explain the increased proliferative capacity seen in 3G CAR T cells. The study also indicates that there may be other signaling pathways to consider when designing or evaluating new generations of CARs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 23.,"PURPOSE: Azacitidine is the mainstay of high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) therapy, but molecular predictors of response and the mechanisms of resistance to azacitidine remain largely unidentified. Deregulation of signaling via Stat3 and Stat5 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with aggressive disease. Numerous genes involved in cell signaling are aberrantly methylated in MDS, yet the alterations and the effect of azacitidine treatment on Stat3/5 signaling in high-risk MDS have not been explored. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We assessed longitudinally constitutive and ligand-induced phospho-Stat3/5 signaling responses by multiparametric flow cytometry in 74 patients with MDS and low blast count AML undergoing azacitidine therapy. Pretreatment Stat3/5 signaling profiles in CD34(+)cells were grouped by unsupervised clustering. The differentiation stage and the molecular properties of the CD34(+)G-CSF-inducible Stat3/5 double-positive subpopulation were performed by flow cytometry and quantitative real-time PCR in isolated MDS progenitors. RESULTS: The pretreatment Stat3/5 signaling profiles in CD34(+)cells correlated strongly with response and cytogenetics and independently predicted event-free survival. We further identified a CD34(+)G-CSF-inducible Stat3/5 double-positive subpopulation (DP subset) whose pretreatment levels were inversely associated with treatment response and cytogenetics. The kinetics of the DP subset followed the response to azacitidine and the disease course, whereas its molecular characteristics and cellular hierarchy were consistent with a leukemia propagating cell phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a novel link among Stat3/5 signaling and MDS pathobiology and suggest that the Stat3/5 signaling biosignature may serve as both a response biomarker and treatment target.",,,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,['Hellenic MDS Study Group'],,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 23.,"PURPOSE: Little is known about the breast cancer risk among childhood cancer survivors who did not receive chest radiotherapy. We sought to determine the magnitude of risk and associated risk factors for breast cancer among these women. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated cumulative breast cancer risk in 3,768 female childhood cancer survivors without a history of chest radiotherapy who were participants in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. RESULTS: With median follow up of 25.5 years (range, 8 to 39 years), 47 women developed breast cancer at a median age of 38.0 years (range, 22 to 47 years) and median of 24.0 years (range, 10 to 34 years) from primary cancer to breast cancer. A four-fold increased breast cancer risk (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] = 4.0; 95% CI, 3.0 to 5.3) was observed when compared with the general population. Risk was highest among sarcoma and leukemia survivors (SIR = 5.3; 95% CI, 3.6 to 7.8 and SIR = 4.1; 95% CI, 2.4 to 6.9, respectively). By the age of 45 years, the cumulative incidence of breast cancer in sarcoma and leukemia survivors was 5.8% (95% CI, 3.7 to 8.4) and 6.3% (95% CI, 3.0 to 11.3), respectively. No other primary cancer diagnosis was associated with an elevated risk. Alkylators and anthracyclines were associated with an increased breast cancer risk in a dose-dependent manner (P values from test for trend were both < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Women not exposed to chest radiotherapy who survive childhood sarcoma or leukemia have an increased risk of breast cancer at a young age. The data suggest high-dose alkylator and anthracycline chemotherapy increase the risk of breast cancer. This may suggest a possible underlying gene-environment interaction that warrants further study.",,,['(c) 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],,,['J Clin Oncol. 2016 Mar 20;34(9):891-4.

Epub 2015 Dec 23.,"PURPOSE: To determine the oncologic efficacy, cardioprotective effectiveness, and safety of dexrazoxane added to chemotherapy that included a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 360 mg/m(2) to treat children and adolescents with newly diagnosed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) or lymphoblastic non-Hodgkin lymphoma (L-NHL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were treated on Pediatric Oncology Group Protocol POG 9404, which included random assignment to treatment with or without dexrazoxane given as a bolus infusion immediately before every dose of doxorubicin. Cardiac effects were assessed by echocardiographic measurements of left ventricular function and structure. RESULTS: Of 573 enrolled patients, 537 were eligible, evaluable, and randomly assigned to an arm with or without dexrazoxane. The 5-year event-free survival (with standard error) did not differ between groups: 77.2% (2.7%) for the dexrazoxane group versus 76.0% (2.7%) for the doxorubicin-only group (P = .9). The frequencies of severe grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity, infection, CNS events, and toxic deaths were similar in both groups (P ranged from .26 to .64). Of 11 second malignancies, eight occurred in patients who received dexrazoxane (P = .17). The mean left ventricular fractional shortening, wall thickness, and thickness-to-dimension ratio z scores measured 3 years after diagnosis were worse in the doxorubicin-alone group (n = 55 per group; P </= .01 for all comparisons). Mean fractional shortening z scores measured 3.5 to 6.4 years after diagnosis remained diminished and were lower in the 21 patients who received doxorubicin alone than in the 31 patients who received dexrazoxane (-2.03 v -0.24; P </= .001). CONCLUSION: Dexrazoxane was cardioprotective and did not compromise antitumor efficacy, did not increase the frequencies of toxicities, and was not associated with a significant increase in second malignancies with this doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy regimen. We recommend dexrazoxane as a cardioprotectant for children and adolescents who have malignancies treated with anthracyclines.",,,['(c) 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],,,,"[""Authors' disclosures of potential conflicts of interest are found in the article"", 'online at www.jco.org.

A computed tomography scan of the neck performed 30 days before referral revealed bilateral cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy (6 x 5 cm). A fine-needle aspirate of nasopharyngeal tissue demonstrated fibroadipose tissue. Tissue collected by core needle biopsy of a left internal jugular lymph node demonstrated a reactive lymph node but no malignancy. The patient was admitted to an academic medical center hospital. His physical examination was remarkable for bulky cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. A testicular examination was normal. The patient's lactate dehydrogenase concentration was 327 U/L (normal range, 118-225 U/L). A positron emission tomography scan revealed bilateral cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy (6 x 5 cm with a standardized uptake value [SUV] of 14), a 1.3-cm subcutaneous nodule in the left thigh (SUV 16), and two 2.7-cm liver lesions (SUV 14). He underwent an excisional lymph node biopsy. The lymph node revealed effacement of the architecture by an interfollicular infiltrate of lymphoid cells (Fig 1). Mitotic figures were abundant (Ki-67 stain 80% to 90% positive) and there were multiple foci of tissue necrosis. The lymphoblasts were examined by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry and expressed the T-cell markers CD2, CD3, CD4, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. A subpopulation of T cells was positive for both CD4 and CD8. Polymerase chain reaction studies revealed a clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gamma gene. A marrow aspirate and biopsy revealed normal trilineage hematopoiesis with no evidence of lymphoma and a normal male karyotype (46, XY). A lumbar puncture sample did not contain lymphoma cells. The patient's diagnosis was T-lymphoblastic lymphoma.",,,['(c) 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Nov 6.,"BACKGROUND: With the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the prognosis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has undergone significant changes in all age groups and at different clinical stages over the past 15 years. Consequently, although disease incidence has remained stable, cumulative prevalence is increasing. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed our experience with imatinib mesylate (IM) as a first- and second-line treatment for different CML stages to examine demographic and clinical characteristics of patients, cytogenetic and molecular response rates, as well as overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and event-free survival of patients at the Specialties Hospital of the National Medical Center ""La Raza,"" which belongs to the Mexican Social Security Institute and serves a population with medium to low socioeconomic status. RESULTS: We analyzed data of 302 CML patients who received IM as a first- (n = 234) or second-line treatment (n = 68). Overall, 198 of 302 patients (66%) reached a complete cytogenetic response and at least 115 of 302 (38%) achieved a major molecular response. Among 302 IM-treated patients, 55 (18%) achieved a molecular response 4.5 (MR4.5) or major; at the time of writing this report, 283 (93.7%) were alive and 19 (6.29%) had died. At 60 months, OS was 94%. CONCLUSION: IM offers long-term OS expectations not previously observed with any other therapy, in addition to a good quality of life. However, more than a third of the patients require further treatment with a second-generation TKI; consequently, expectations for treatment-free remission and long-term OS are reduced. Timely change to second-generation TKIs could improve such expectations.",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'First line', 'Polymerase chain reaction', 'Treatment', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Exposure of J/Neo cells to kaempeferol caused cytotoxicity and activation of the ATM/ATR-Chk1/Chk2 pathway, activating the phosphorylation of p53 (Ser-15), inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc25C (Ser-216), and inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1), with resultant G2- arrest of the cell cycle. Under these conditions, apoptotic events, including upregulation of Bak and PUMA levels, Bak activation, mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) loss, activation of caspase-9, -8, and -3, anti-poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and accumulation of apoptotic sub-G1 cells, were induced without accompanying necrosis. However, these apoptotic events, except for upregulation of Bak and PUMA levels, were completely abrogated in J/Bcl-xL cells overexpressing Bcl-xL, suggesting that the G2-arrest and the Bcl-xL-sensitive mitochondrial apoptotic events were induced, in parallel, as downstream events of the DNA-damage-mediated G2-checkpoint activation. Together these results demonstrate that kaempferol-mediated antitumor activity toward Jurkat T cells was attributable to G2-checkpoint activation, which caused not only G2-arrest of the cell cycle but also activating phosphorylation of p53 (Ser-15) and subsequent induction of mitochondriadependent apoptotic events, including Bak and PUMA upregulation, Bak activation, Deltapsim loss, and caspase cascade activation.",['NOTNLM'],"['Antitumor activity', 'Bak activation', 'G2-checkpoint activation', 'caspase cascade', 'kaempferol', 'mitochondrial apoptosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 23.,"BACKGROUND: The powerful cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects of corticosteroids are an important element of the success that has been achieved in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). In addition to physical side effects, corticosteroids can adversely influence behaviour, cognitive function and mood leading to significantly impaired quality of life (QoL). A number of tools exist for assessing QoL, but none of these specifically examines changes attributable to steroids. METHODS: Children and young adults aged 8-24 years and parents of children receiving maintenance therapy for ALL from four UK centres were invited to participate. The study comprised three stages carried out over 2 years: (1) focus groups and interviews where participants were asked to describe their experiences of dexamethasone; (2) analysis of questionnaires sent to healthcare professionals and patients to evaluate the importance and relevance of the questions; and (3) cognitive interviewing. RESULTS: Interpretative phenomenological analysis of focus group and interview transcripts identified that dexamethasone adversely influenced behaviour, appetite, body image, mood and family relationships. 157 electronic survey responses were analysed leading to further item development. Cognitive interviewing confirmed face validity and internal consistency. QuESt comprises 28 questions within four domains and has three age-specific versions. CONCLUSIONS: QuESt is the first treatment-specific QoL measure for children and young adults receiving corticosteroids. It can be completed in 10-15 min by children aged >/=8 years. Further validity and reliability testing will be undertaken. Although the initial application is for ALL, QuESt may also be a valuable tool for understanding the impact of corticosteroids in other paediatric conditions.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'Corticosteroids', 'Quality of life']","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the expression of the miR-146b-5p, miR-181b-5p, miR-424, miR-532, miR-199a-3p, miR-423, miR-22-3p, let-7i-5p, and miR-1 and the predicted target genes IGF2R, LEPR, SGK1, MMP2, MMP10, LIF, IL6, and STAT3 in menstrual endometria and early pregnancy decidua. RESULTS: miR-146b-5p, miR-181b-5p, miR-424, miR-532, and miR-199a-3p were significantly downregulated in early pregnancy decidua, while miR-423, miR-22-3p, let-7i-5p, and miR-1 were significantly upregulated. In addition, the decidua had significantly lower levels of expression of LIF, IL6, MMP2, MMP10, and IGF2R and higher levels of expression of SGK1, LEPR, PROK1, and STAT3 than the menstrual endometria group. CONCLUSION: Our results provide new insights into the expression of miRNAs that regulate genes involved in decidualization and the maintenance of early pregnancy.",['NOTNLM'],"['Decidua', 'Menstrual endometrium', 'MicroRNA', 'Target gene']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Epub 2015 Dec 14.,"In the nervous system, BCL11B is crucial for the development of deep layer corticospinal projection neurons and striatal medium spiny neurons and is often used as a marker for the aforementioned cell types. However, the expression of BCL11B in subtypes of non-excitatory neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) has not been reported in the mouse. In this study we show that BCL11B is extensively expressed in S1 GABAergic interneurons, throughout the three main subgroups (somatostatin-, parvalbumin- and 5HT3a-expresssing). Almost all BCL11B positive cells in the upper S1 layers were GABAergic interneurons and surprisingly, almost 40% of the BCL11B positive neurons in layer V were GABAergic interneurons. Single cell mRNA sequencing data revealed higher Bcl11b expression in S1 interneurons compared to deep layer pyramidal neurons. The highest levels of Bcl11b expression were found within the 5HT3a population, specifically in putative neurogliaform interneuron subclasses (5HT3a-positive but not expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide). In the light of our findings we suggest caution using BCL11B as a single marker to identify neurons.",['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11B', 'CTIP2', 'GABAergic interneurons', 'Mouse', 'Somatosensory cortex']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The efficacy of L-asparaginase has been discussed for the past 40 years, and an ideal substitute for the enzyme has not yet been developed. The early clearance from plasma (short half-life) and requirement for multiple administrations and hence frequent physician visits make the overall treatment cost quite high. In addition, a high rate of allergic reactions in patients receiving treatment with the enzyme isolated from bacterial sources make its clinical application challenging. For these reasons, various attempts are being made to overcome these barriers. Therefore, the present article reviews studies focused on seeking substitutes for L-asparaginase through alternative sources including bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, algae and plants to overcome these limitations. In addition, the role of chemical modifications and protein engineering approaches to enhance the drug's efficacy are also discussed. Moreover, an overview has also been provided in the current review regarding the contradiction among various researchers regarding the significance of the enzyme's glutaminase activity.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia', 'Algae and plants', 'Anti-leukaemic drug', 'Blood plasma', 'E. coli', 'L-asparaginase']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-two persons (16 of AML and 16 of healthy control) were included to the study. PON1 and ARE activities were measured as spectrophotometrically in serum samples. High density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) were analyzed in autoanalyzer. RESULTS: PON1 activities were respectively 16.04 U/L and 18.6 U/L in AML and healthy controls. There was no statistical significance between groups (p > 0.05). The mean ARE activities were respectively 0.21 U/L and 0.36 U/L in AML and healthy controls. Serum ARE activity significantly decreased in AML group (p < 0.001). Serum HDL values were significantly decreased (181.8 +/- 76.2 mg/dl; p = 0.002) in AML. There was no difference in total cholesterol, LDL and triglyceride values (respectively; 181.8 +/- 76.2 mg/dl, 120.6 +/- 64.6 mg/dl, 157.3 +/- 87.2 mg/dl; p > 0.05) between AML and controls.

Cellular (2)H2O labelling, mass spectrometry, and isotopomer analysis revealed an increase in lanosterol synthesis which was not accompanied by an increase in cholesterol flux or pool size in CEM/R2 cells. Exogenous addition of lanosterol had a negative effect on CEM/R2 and a positive effect on sensitive CEM cell viability. Treatment of CEM and CEM/R2 cells with cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors acting on the enzymes squalene epoxidase and lanosterol synthase, both also involved in the 24,25-epoxycholesterol shunt pathway, revealed a connection of this pathway to lanosterol turnover.

It is an important source of bioactive natural products like, for instance soulatrolide, and mammea type coumarins. Soulatrolide is a tetracyclic dipyranocoumarins and a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mammea A/BA and A/BB coumarins, pure or as a mixture, are highly active against several leukemia cell lines, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania amazonensis. In the present work, a toxicogenomic analysis of Soulatrolide and Mammea A/BA + A/BB (3:1) mixture was performed in order to validate the toxicological potential of this type of compounds. Soulatrolide or mixture of mammea A/BA + A/BB (3:1) was administered orally to male mice (CD-1) at dose of 100 mg/kg/daily, for 1 week. After this time, mice were sacrificed, and RNA extracted from the liver of treated animals. Transcriptomic analysis was performed using Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array. Robust microarray analysis (RMA) and two way ANOVA test revealed for mammea mixture treatment 46 genes upregulated and 72 downregulated genes; meanwhile, for soulatrolide 665 were upregulated and 1077 downregulated genes.

Yet, many lack such knowledge. This study investigated to what extent: (1) potential late effects were discussed with adolescent and young adult (AYA)-aged survivors (of pediatric cancer), and (2) information about late effects was provided by the pediatric oncologists (POs) during routine follow-up consultations. METHODS: Consultations were recorded with 10 POs and 66 adolescents, aged 12-20 years, treated for leukemia (72.7%) or lymphoma (21.2%), or who had received hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation for a benign disease (7.6%). Discussions of potential late effects were identified and coded, and then the amount of information about late effects provided was categorized into three levels: none, basic, and extended information. RESULTS: Potential late effects were discussed in 85% of the consultations. Of these, 71% were PO initiated, and 60% concerned existing health problems. The POs provided none, basic, and extended information about late effects in 41%, 30%, and 29% of these discussions. Patients' age, time since treatment, and risk of late effects were not associated with amount of potential late effects discussed, but the type of potential late effect (physical vs. psychosocial and current vs. future risk) and PO were. CONCLUSION: Potential late effects were frequently discussed, thus providing ample opportunity to provide information about late effects to adolescent cancer survivors. The observed PO variability in providing such information indicates a need for standardization of information practices.",['NOTNLM'],"['clinical communication', 'follow-up care', 'information provisioning', 'late effects', 'survivorship']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, deletion of TP53 gene, which is associated with an aggressive course of the disease and poor prognosis along with a lack of response to treatment, is one of the alterations which may escape cytogenetic diagnoses in CLL. Thus, other techniques have emerged such as interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH). Deletion of TP53 may but must not go together with the formation of an isochromosome i(17q); surprisingly this subgroup of patients was not in the focus of CLL studies yet. This study was about if presence of i(17q) could be indicative for a new subgroup in CLL with more adverse prognosis. As a result, TP53 deletion was detected in 18 out of 150 (12%) here studied CLL cases. Six of those cases (~33%) had the TP53 deletion accompanied by an i(17q). Interestingly, the cases with i(17q) showed a tendency towards more associated chromosomal aberrations. These findings may be the bases for follow-up studies in CLL patients with TP53 deletion with and without i(17q); it may be suggested that the i(17q) presents an even more adverse prognostic marker than TP53 deletion alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it remains unclear whether transfected miRNAs behave similarly to endogenous miRNAs. Here we show that transient transfection of miRNA mimics into HeLa cells by a commonly used method led to the accumulation of high molecular weight RNA species and a few hundred fold increase in mature miRNA levels. In contrast, expression of the same miRNAs through lentiviral infection or plasmid transfection of HeLa cells, transgenic expression in primary lymphocytes, and endogenous overexpression in lymphoma and leukemia cell lines did not lead to the appearance of high molecular weight RNA species. The increase of mature miRNA levels in these cells was below 10-fold, which was sufficient to suppress target gene expression and to drive lymphoma development in mice. Moreover, transient transfection of miRNA mimics at high concentrations caused non-specific alterations in gene expression, while at low concentrations achieved expression levels comparable to other methods but failed to efficiently suppress target gene expression. Small RNA deep sequencing analysis revealed that the guide strands of miRNA mimics were frequently mutated, while unnatural passenger strands of some miRNA mimics accumulated to high levels. The high molecular weight RNA species were a heterogeneous mixture of several classes of RNA species generated by concatemerization, 5'- and 3'-end tailing of miRNA mimics. We speculate that the supraphysiological levels of mature miRNAs and these artifactual RNA species led to non-specific changes in gene expression. Our results have important implications for the design and interpretation of experiments primarily employing transient transfection of miRNA mimics.",['NOTNLM'],"['guide strand mutation', 'high molecular weight RNA species', 'miR-155', 'miR-17~92', 'microRNA mimics', 'transient transfection', 'unnatural passenger strand']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the effect of ex vivo treatment with G-CSF on AML primary blasts was studied. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from AML patients were treated with G-CSF at increasing doses, alone or in co-culture with HS-5 stromal cells. Cell viability and surface phenotype was determined by flow cytometry 72 h after treatment. For clonogenicity assays, AML primary samples were treated for 18 h with G-CSF at increasing concentrations and cultured in methyl-cellulose for 14 days. Colonies were counted based on cellularity and morphology criteria. RESULTS: The presence of G-CSF reduced the overall viability of AML cells co-cultured with bone marrow stroma; whereas, in absence of stroma, a negligible effect was observed. Moreover, clonogenic capacity of AML cells was significantly reduced upon treatment with G-CSF. Interestingly, reduction in the AML clonogenic capacity correlated with the sensitivity to chemotherapy observed in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These ex vivo results would provide a biological basis to data available from studies showing a clinical benefit with the use of G-CSF as a priming agent in patients with a chemosensitive AML and would support implementation of further studies exploring new strategies of chemotherapy priming in AML.",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Chemotherapy priming', 'G-CSF']",,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4048-9536'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

After many false claims resulting from various artifacts, most scientists abandoned the search, but the Gallo laboratory carried on, developing both specific assays and new cell culture methods that enabled them to report, in the accompanying 1980 PNAS paper, identification and partial characterization of human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV; now known as HTLV-1) produced by a T-cell line from a lymphoma patient. Follow-up studies, including collaboration with the group that first identified a cluster of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cases in Japan, provided conclusive evidence that HTLV was the cause of this disease. HTLV-1 is now known to infect at least 4-10 million people worldwide, about 5% of whom will develop ATL. Despite intensive research, knowledge of the viral etiology has not led to improvement in treatment or outcome of ATL.

The Bcl-2 family of proteins undergo a series of protein-protein interactions which regulate the intrinsic cell-death pathway. The pro-survival members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL , and Mcl-1, are commonly overexpressed in a number of human cancers. Effective modulators of members of the Bcl-2 family have been developed and are undergoing clinical trials, but the efficient modulation of Mcl-1 is still not represented in the clinic. In addition, Mcl-1 is a major cause of resistance to radio- and chemotherapies, including inhibitors that target other Bcl-2 family members. Subsequently, the inhibition of Mcl-1 has become of significant interest to the scientific community. This review covers the progress made to date in modulating the activity of Mcl-1, by both stapled peptides and small molecules. The development of peptides as drug candidates, and the advancement of experimental and computational techniques used to discover small molecules are also highlighted.",['NOTNLM'],"['Bcl-2', 'Mcl-1', 'protein-protein interactions', 'small-molecule inhibitors', 'stapled peptides']",['(c) 2015 The Authors.

Intravenous fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim is an effective regimen in this setting. In view of the lack of availability of intravenous fludarabine in Mexico from 2009-2013, we substituted an equivalent oral fludarabine dose (40 mg) for the intravenous formulation. OBJECTIVE: This is a retrospective comparison of the toxicity and effectiveness of oral fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim versus intravenous fludarabine, cytarabine and filgrastim. RESULTS: A total of 44 patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoid leukemia treated in an academic medical center from 2005-2013 with oral fludarabine, cytarabine and filgrastim (21 patients) or intravenous fludarabine, cytarabine and filgrastim (23 patients) were included in the analysis. There was a trend towards a higher complete remission rate and a longer overall survival following intravenous fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim as compared with oral fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim: complete remission rates 39.1 vs. 23.8% (p = 0.342) and overall survival 6.14 vs. 10.78 months (p = 0.363), respectively. A higher incidence of neutropenic fever (100 vs. 76.2%; p = 0.019) and septic shock (34.8 vs. 0%; p = 0.003) and a longer hospitalization (26.8 vs. 19.4 days; p = 0.046) were observed with intravenous fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with a shorter survival were septic shock (HR: 3.93; 95% CI: 1.67-9.25; p = 0.002) and a higher number of previous treatments (HR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.26-4.99; p = 0.009). Complete remission was associated with better survival (HR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.08-0.44; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are needed to determine the optimal dose and timing of oral fludarabine when given as part of the fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim regimen for relapsed/refractory acute leukemia. Our data suggest that the dose of oral fludarabine used, 40 mg/m(2) per day for five days, may be a lower bioequivalent dose to the intravenous dose in fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 508 patients with the chronic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia without radi ation in anamnesis as well as 13 patients with the similar diagnosis and with confirmed presence of radiation expo sure due to the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident. RESULTS: No significant differences in hematologic parameters, rate of additional chromosomal aberrations and f vari ant translocations were observed between patients with small ie, Cyrillic13small a, Cyrillic2 and small ie, Cyrillic14small a, Cyrillic2 transcript. Cumulative probability of com plete cytogenetic response did not differ in patients with small ie, Cyrillic13small a, Cyrillic2 and small ie, Cyrillic14small a, Cyrillic2 transcript and was 76 and 80 % respec tively (small er, Cyrillic = 0,981). Median of achieving a complete cytogenetic response was 20 months in both patient groups. Significantly more patients with e14a2 transcript compared to patients with e13a2 achieved major molecular response by 12 month of therapy (61.5 % versus 23.0 %, p = 0.016). The higher incidence of deep molecular response by 24 month of therapy was revealed in this group (38.7 % versus 6.25 %, p = 0.018). The overall survival and pro gression free survival rates were not statistically different between two groups with different transcripts. However, the rate of event free survival was statistically lower for the patients with e13a2 transcript compared to the ones with e14a2 transcript (51 % versus 62.0 %, p = 0.039). The number of primary resistant patients was 40 % regardless of the transcript expressed. A significant prevalence in incidence either of lost complete cytogenetic response or fail ure of the major molecular response was shown in patients with e13a2 transcript compared to patients with e14a2 transcripts (43.5 % versus 24.8 %, p = 0.015). CONCLUSION: Imatinib therapy is more effective for CML patients with e14a2 transcript compared to patients with e13a2 transcript expression.

METHODS: NOTCH1 mutations were determined by polymerase chain reaction followed by direct sequencing in 201 previously untreated patients with CLL of B cell origin: 88 CLL patients, sufferers of the Chornobyl NPP accident, and 113 CLL patients of the control group. RESULTS: Mutations of NOTCH1 were found in 13.4 % of observed patients, mostly in cases with unmutated heavy chain variable region (IGHV) genes (p = 0.001). Patients of the two groups were comparable by gender, age, stage at diagnosis, and mutational status of IGHV genes. But, the frequency of NOTCH1 mutations in the main group appeared to be lower in comparison with the control group (6.8 % vs 18.6 %; p = 0.015). Furthermore, if in the con trol group the number of NOTCH1 mutations increased in patients requiring first treatment compared with patients at diagnosis (p = 0.012), in the main group such differencies were non significant (p = 0.317). When clinical data of all observed groups of patients were analyzed, the presence of NOTCH1 mutations was associated with more advanced stage of disease, higher initial WBC count, bulky disease, short time to treatment period and progression free survival.

Epub 2015 Dec 22.,"Cell migration is controlled by PI3Ks, which generate lipid messengers phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate [PI(3,4)P2] and consequently recruit pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing signaling proteins. PI3K inhibition impairs migration of normal and transformed B cells, an effect thought to partly underlie the therapeutic efficacy of PI3K inhibitors in treatment of B cell malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Although a number of studies have implicated phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate in cell migration, it remains unknown whether PI(3,4)P2 plays a distinct role. Using the PI(3,4)P2-specific phosphatase inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase, we investigate the impact of depleting PI(3,4)P2 on migration behavior of malignant B cells. We find that cells expressing wild-type, but not phosphatase dead, inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase show impaired SDF-induced PI(3,4)P2 responses and reduced migration in Transwell chamber assays. Moreover, PI(3,4)P2 depletion in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells significantly impaired their migration capacity. PI(3,4)P2 depletion reduced both overall motility and migration directionality in the presence of a stable chemokine gradient. Within chemotaxing B cells, the PI(3,4)P2-binding cytoskeletal regulator lamellipodin (Lpd) was found to colocalize with PI(3,4)P2 on the plasma membrane via its PH domain. Overexpression and knockdown studies indicated that Lpd levels significantly impact migration capacity. Moreover, the ability of Lpd to promote directional migration of B cells in an SDF-1 gradient was dependent on its PI(3,4)P2-binding PH domain. These results demonstrate that PI(3,4)P2 plays a significant role in cell migration via binding to specific cytoskeletal regulators such as Lpd, and they suggest that impairment of PI(3,4)P2-dependent processes may contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of PI3K inhibitors in B cell malignancies.",,,"['Copyright (c) 2016 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1587-8866', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8287-8981', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7523-7593', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3832-8795', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9950-7941', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6509-8817', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5465-446X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0119-732X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1175-5498']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 29.,"Monomethoxypolyethylene glycol L-asparaginase (PEG-ASNASE) is the PEGylated version of the enzyme L-asparaginase (ASNASE). Both are used for remission induction in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The treatment control is generally carried out by performing activity assays, though methods to determine the actual enzyme rather than its activity are rare. Using asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) offered the chance to develop a method capable of simultaneously measuring PEG-ASNASE and PEG. A method validation was performed in accordance with FDA guidelines for PEG-ASNASE from non-biological solutions. The method unfolded a linearity of 15-750 U/mL with coefficients of correlation of r(2)>0.99. The coefficients of variation (CV) for within-run and between-run variability were 1.18-10.15% and 2.43-8.73%, respectively. Furthermore, the method was used to perform stability tests of the product Oncaspar(R) (PEG-ASNASE) and estimation of the molecular weight by multi-angle light scattering (MALS) of stressed samples to correlate them with the corresponding activity. The findings indicate that Oncaspar(R) stock solution should not be stored any longer than 24 h at room temperature and cannot be frozen in pure aqueous media.

Epub 2016 Feb 8.,"Sweet syndrome (SS) was described over 50 years ago as a distinctive form of neutrophilic dermatosis. It may be idiopathic, drug-induced or paraneoplastic, and in the last of those subtypes, myeloproliferative diseases are prominently represented. A peculiar variant of SS is termed 'histiocytoid' SS (HSS), and early accounts of that condition asserted that it showed no linkage to hematological disorders. We herein report two additional cases of HSS--both of which were associated with myeloid dyscrasias--together with a review of the pertinent literature. Along with our observations, the latter process appears to contradict the contention that HSS has no relationship to hematopoietic diseases; between 35 and 55% of reported cases have indeed shown such an association, usually with myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.",['NOTNLM'],"['Sweet syndrome', 'aseptic neutrophilic dermatosis', 'hematological dyscrasias paraneoplastic cutaneous diseases']",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

These lncRNAs are implicated to play pivotal roles in various molecular processes, including development and oncogenesis. Gene expression profiling of human B-ALL samples showed differential lncRNA expression in samples with particular cytogenetic abnormalities. One of the most promising lncRNAs identified, designated B-ALL associated long RNA-6 (BALR-6), had the highest expression in patient samples carrying the MLL rearrangement, and is the focus of this study. RESULTS: Here, we performed a series of experiments to define the function of BALR-6, including several novel splice forms that we identified. Functionally, siRNA-mediated knockdown of BALR-6 in human B-ALL cell lines caused reduced cell proliferation and increased cell death. Conversely, overexpression of BALR-6 isoforms in both human and mouse cell lines caused increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Overexpression of BALR-6 in murine bone marrow transplantation experiments caused a significant increase in early hematopoietic progenitor populations, suggesting that its dysregulation may cause developmental changes. Notably, the knockdown of BALR-6 resulted in global dysregulation of gene expression. The gene set was enriched for leukemia-associated genes, as well as for the transcriptome regulated by Specificity Protein 1 (SP1). We confirmed changes in the expression of SP1, as well as its known interactor and downstream target CREB1. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated an enhancement of SP1-mediated transcription in the presence of BALR-6. These data provide a putative mechanism for regulation by BALR-6 in B-ALL. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a role for the novel lncRNA BALR-6 in promoting cell survival in B-ALL. Furthermore, this lncRNA influences gene expression in B-ALL in a manner consistent with a function in transcriptional regulation. Specifically, our findings suggest that BALR-6 expression regulates the transcriptome downstream of SP1, and that this may underlie the function of BALR-6 in B-ALL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bone marrow histologic findings of this disorder are typically characterized by the presence of myeloid metaplasia with an associated reactive fibrosis, angiogenesis, and osteosclerosis. However, marked myelofibrosis is not solely confined to PMF and may also be associated with other conditions including but not limited to acute megakaryoblastic leukemias (FAB AML-M7). Here, we describe a rare case of a non-megakaryoblastic acute myeloid leukemia with marked myelofibrosis with osteosclerosis and an isolated trisomy 19. A 19-year-old male presented with severe bone pain of one week duration with a complete blood cell count and peripheral smear showing a mild anemia and occasional circulating blasts. A follow up computed tomography (CT) scan showed diffuse osteosclerosis with no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy. Subsequently, the bone marrow biopsy showed markedly sclerotic bony trabeculae and a hypercellular marrow with marked fibrosis and intervening sheets of immature myeloid cells consistent with myeloblasts with monocytic differentiation. Importantly, these myeloblasts were negative for megakaryocytic markers (CD61 and vWF), erythroid markers (hemoglobin and E-cadherin), and lymphoid markers (CD3, CD19, and TdT). Metaphase cytogenetics showed an isolated triosomy 19 with no JAK2 V617F mutation. The patient was treated with induction chemotherapy followed by allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation which subsequently resulted in a rapid resolution of bone marrow fibrosis, suggesting graft-anti-fibrosis effect.

The current study examined whether kaempferol inhibited mast cell degranulation and prostaglandin (PG) release leading to the development of aberrant airways, using an in vitro model of dinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA)-sensitized rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) mast cells and an in vivo model of BSA-challenged asthmatic mice. Nontoxic kaempferol at 10-20 muM suppressed beta-hexosaminidase release and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2)-mediated production of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha) in sensitized mast cells. Oral administration of </=20 mg/kg kaempferol blocked bovine serum albumin (BSA) inhalation-induced epithelial cell excrescence and smooth muscle hypertrophy by attenuating the induction of COX2 and the formation of PGD2 and PGF2alpha, together with reducing the anti-alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression in mouse airways. Kaempferol deterred the antigen-induced mast cell activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) responsive to protein kinase Cmu (PKCmu) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Furthermore, the antigen-challenged activation of Syk-phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma) pathway was dampened in kaempferol-supplemented mast cells. These results demonstrated that kaempferol inhibited airway wall thickening through disturbing Syk-PLCgamma signaling and PKCmu-ERK-cPLA2-COX2 signaling in antigen-exposed mast cells. Thus, kaempferol may be a potent anti-allergic compound targeting allergic asthma typical of airway hyperplasia and hypertrophy.",['NOTNLM'],"['airway thickening', 'asthma', 'bronchoconstriction', 'cyclooxygenase 2', 'kaempferol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mammalian genomes contain multiple members of the PRAME family whereas in other vertebrate genomes only one PRAME-like LRR protein was identified. PRAME is a cancer/testis antigen that is expressed at very low levels in normal adult tissues except testis but at high levels in a variety of cancer cells. In contrast to most other cancer/testis antigens, PRAME is expressed not only in solid tumors but also in leukemia cells. Expression of PRAME and other members of the PRAME family is regulated epigenetically. PRAME interacts with varying pathways that might be directly involved in the malignant phenotype of cancer cells. For instance, PRAME is able to dominantly repress retinoic acid signaling in these cells. On the other hand, PRAME-derived peptides can be recognized as epitopes by cytotoxic T cells and PRAME represents an attractive target for immunological treatment strategies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of CYP3A metabolic activity on the plasma concentration and outcome of imatinib in patients with CML. METHODS: Forty-three patients with CML were phenotyped for CYP3A activity using quinine as a probe drug and evaluated for clinical response parameters. Plasma concentrations of imatinib and its main metabolite, CGP74588, were determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Patients with optimal response to imatinib after 12 months of therapy did not differ in CYP3A activity compared to nonoptimal responders (quinine metabolic ratio of 14.69 and 14.70, respectively; P = 0.966). Neither the imatinib plasma concentration nor the CGP74588/imatinib ratio was significantly associated with CYP3A activity. CONCLUSIONS: The CYP3A activity does not influence imatinib plasma concentrations or the therapeutic outcome. These results indicate that although imatinib is metabolized by CYP3A enzymes, this activity is not the rate-limiting step in imatinib metabolism and excretion. Future studies should focus on other pharmacokinetic processes so as to identify the major contributor to patient variability in imatinib plasma concentrations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the growing availability of clinical genetic testing, there is an increasing appreciation that a number of genetic predisposition syndromes may underlie apparent de novo presentations of MDS/AML, particularly in children and young adults. Recent findings of clonal hematopoiesis in acquired aplastic anemia add another facet to our understanding of the mechanisms of MDS/AML predisposition. As more predisposition syndromes are recognized, it is becoming increasingly important for hematologists and oncologists to have familiarity with the common as well as emerging syndromes, and to have a systematic approach to diagnosis and screening of at risk patient populations.

High levels of serum soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R; 4,304 U/mL) and an increased percentage of CD4+CD25+ T cells (75.5%) in peripheral blood were also detected. The second patient was a 78-year-old female, a known asymptomatic HTLV-1 carrier, who presented with persistent herpes zoster, followed by Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Disease progression of smoldering ATL along opportunistic infections was observed with very high levels of serum sIL-2R (14,058 U/mL) and an increased percentage of CD4+CD25+ T cells (87.2%) in peripheral blood.

Nevertheless, its function in salivary gland Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), a relatively rare malignance with poor long-term survival rate arisen in head and neck region, remain unknown. In this study, down-regulated miR-101-3p expression was detected in ACC tissues and ACC cell lines with high potential for metastasis. Ectopic expression of miR-101-3p significantly repressed the invasion, proliferation, colony formation, and formation of nude mice xenografts and induced potent apoptosis in ACC cell lines. The provirus integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 1 (Pim-1) oncogene was subsequently confirmed as a direct target gene of miR-101-3p in ACC. Functional restoration assays revealed that miR-101-3p inhibits cell growth and invasion by directly decreasing Pim-1 expression. Protein levels of Survivin, Cyclin D1 and beta-catenin were also down-regulated by miR-101-3p. miR-101-3p enhanced the sensitivity of cisplatin in ACC cell lines.

Hyper-activated MAPK and STAT5 pathways by oncogenic Nras contribute to the leukemogenesis in vivo. However, it is unclear whether these conclusions remain true in a more human relevant model. Here, we evaluated the effects of NRASG12D on human hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis in vitro and in vivo by ectopically expressing NRASG12D in human cord blood stem/progenitor cells (hSPCs). NRASG12D expressing hSPCs preferentially differentiated into myelomonocytic lineage cells, demonstrated by forming more colony forming unit-macrophages than control hSPCs in cultures. Transplantation of NRASG12D expressing hSPCs initiated myeloproliferative neoplasm in immune deficiency mice. All the recipient mice died of myeloid tumor burdens in spleens and bone marrows and none developed lymphoid leukemia. Phospho-flow analysis of CD34(+) CD38(-) hSPCs confirmed that NRASG12D hyper-activated MAPK, AKT and STAT5 pathways.

METHODS: K562 cells were cultured, and the relevant mRNA expressions were detected. RESULTS: Matrine induced the expression of four NKG2D ligands on K562 cells, of which ULBP2 had the highest increase. After treatment with 0.8 mg/mL matrine for 24 h, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of ULBP2 increased. After matrine treatment, the sensitivity of K562 cells to NK cell-mediated killing increased significantly. After treatment with 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 mg/ mL matrine, the percentage of K562 cells killed by NK cells was significantly higher than that of untreated cells (29.2%) (P<0.05). Matrine significantly inhibit the protein expression of phosphorylated STAT 3 and JAK2. Matrine markedly inhibited the IL-6 expression of K562 cells, and antagonized the IL-6 mediated STAT3 and JAK2 phosphorylation. In addition, matrine enhanced the inhibitory effect of STAT 3 inhibitor on STAT 3 activity. The silencing of STAT expression and inhibition of STAT3 activity significantly up-regulated the ULPB2 expression. Matrine had no effect on the expression of IL-6R and gp130 on K562 cells, the mRNA expression of IL-6R and gp130 increased slightly and the sgp 130 in cell supernatant significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal IL-6 and IL-6 receptor-mediated JAK/STAT3 pathway is involved in the matrine induced up-regulation of NKG2D ligands ULBP2 on K562 cells.

Epub 2015 Dec 12.,"Members of the kruppel-associated box-containing zinc finger protein (KRAB-ZFP) family mediate a number of cellular processes through binding to target DNA sequences via zinc fingers. Generally, zinc fingers recognize three-nucleotide sequences; however, this rule is not universally applicable. Zinc finger protein 809 (ZFP809) belongs to the KRAB-ZFP family and functions in repressing the expression of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) via sequence-specific binding to the primer-binding site (PBS) located downstream of the MoMLV-long terminal repeat (LTR) and the induction of epigenetic modifications at LTR, such as repressive histone modifications and de novo DNA methylation. Previously, we demonstrated the role of the first to fifth zinc fingers of ZFP809 in binding to MLV PBS, indicating these zinc fingers do not recognize MLV PBS as a three-nucleotide sequence. Therefore, in the present study, we constructed truncated and mutated zinc fingers and examined their ability to bind to MLV PBS. The third to fifth zinc fingers of ZFP809 were found to be essential for binding to MLV PBS. Furthermore, the results of the present study indicate that other zinc fingers, which were not directly involved in binding to MLV PBS, may function in potentiating binding and stable protein expression. Further characterization of the amino acid sequences of zinc fingers will help further elucidate the functions and features of KRAB-ZFP and other zinc finger proteins.",['NOTNLM'],"['Kruppel-associated box-containing zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFPs)', 'Retroviral vector', 'Zinc finger protein 809 (ZFP809)']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

European mistletoe (Viscum album) has long been used as a complementary and alternative medicine supporting cancer therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate synergistic antitumor action of V. album extract and doxorubicin during co-treatment of chemoresistant chronic myelogenic leukemia K562 cells. Combined treatment of leukemia cells led to inhibitory synergism at sub-apoptotic doxorubicin concentrations and multifold reduction of cytotoxic effects in healthy control cells. Prolonged co-treatment was associated with reduced G2/M accumulation and increased expression of early and late apoptotic markers. Our data indicate that V. album extract increases antileukemic effectiveness of doxorubicin against resistant K562 cells by preventing G2/M arrest and inducing apoptosis.,['NOTNLM'],"['K562 leukemia cells', 'Viscum album', 'apoptosis', 'complementary medicines', 'doxorubicin', 'therapy']","['Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the role of stem cell transplantation (SCT), we performed a retrospective review of adult patients with AML who underwent SCT at our center between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2011. Of the 200 patients transplanted, 79 patients (40%) had normal cytogenetics; of these, 17 (22%) had the FLT3-ITD mutation, 35 were WT (44%), and 27 (34%) did not have FLT3 testing performed. Clinical characteristics were similar in each group. At four years, overall survival (OS) between FLT3 positive and WT groups was similar: 0.54 (95% CI 0.29-0.75) versus 0.73 (95% CI 0.53-0.99), p=0.18. Relapse rates were also similar, 0.09 (95% CI 0.02-0.21) versus 0.12 (95% CI: 0.02-0.32); p=0.67.

Epub 2015 Dec 22.,"Recently, great progress has been achieved in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, some patients, particularly older patients with comorbidities or with relapsed/refractory leukemia, still have limited therapeutic options. There is an urgent need to discover less toxic and more effective drugs for CLL patients. Applying new modalities or substances that are widely used for the treatment of other diseases has been reported to improve results in CLL treatment. This study aimed to assess the non-chemotherapeutic drug danazol for its potential to destroy leukemic cells. Leukemic cells, obtained from the peripheral blood and bone marrow of 23 CLL patients, were cultured in the presence of danazol and its combination with the purine nucleoside analogs fludarabine and cladribine and bendamustine. After 24 h of incubation, the rate of apoptosis indicated by active caspase-3 expression, and cytotoxicity indicated by forward light scatter and light scatter analysis, was assessed by flow cytometry. We also measured expression of apoptosis-regulating proteins of BCL family and active caspase 9 and active caspase 8 expressions in leukemic cells. Danazol had a caspase-dependent pro-apoptotic and cytotoxic effect on leukemic cells in a tumor-specific manner. The mechanisms of its action appear to be complex and should be precisely established; however, induction of apoptosis involving both mitochondrial and receptor cascades appears to be most probable. Danazol showed a synergic effect with cladribine, an additive effect with fludarabine, and an infra-additive effect with bendamustine.

Of these patients, 571 received HLA-identical sibling HSCT and 840 received haploidentical HSCT. The cumulative incidence of overall mortality and transplant-related mortality (TRM) after haploidentical HSCT was higher than those after HLA-identical sibling HSCT (38.7% vs. 33.3%, P=0.012 and 27.5% vs. 19.9%, P=0.002), but the incidence of relapse-related mortality (RRM) did not differ between the two groups (15.6% vs. 16.7%, P=0.943). A multivariate analysis suggested that high-risk disease status and haploidentical HSCT correlated with a higher incidence of overall mortality (P<0.0001, hazard ratio=1.911 and P=0.019, hazard ratio=1.249); in addition, in haploidentical HSCT, only high-risk disease status correlated with a higher incidence of overall mortality (P<0.0001, hazard ratio=1.845). Our study suggested that haploidentical HSCT provided a higher incidence of overall mortality and TRM but the same incidence of RRM compared with HLA-identical sibling HSCT.

Treatment with nebivolol, carvedilol, metoprolol and atenolol suppressed Cell Index (CI) of serum-starved HL-1 cells (</=17%, </=8%, </=15% and </=15% respectively) as measured by the Xcelligence Real-Time Cell Analyzer (RTCA). Conversely, CI was increased by Ang II (>/=9.6%), CGP42112A (>/=14%), and NP-6A4 (>/=25%) respectively and this effect was blocked by AT2R antagonist PD123319, but not by AT1R antagonist losartan. Thus, the CI signature for each drug could be unique. MTS cell proliferation assay showed that NP-6A4, but not other drugs, increased viability (>/=20%) of HL-1 and hCAVSMCs. Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) staining showed that nebivolol was most effective in reducing cell sizes of HL-1 and hCAVSMCs. Myeloid Cell Leukemia 1 (MCL-1) is a protein critical for cardiovascular cell survival and implicated in cell adhesion. beta-blockers significantly suppressed and NP-6A4 increased MCL-1 expression in HL-1 and hCAVSMCs as determined by immunofluorescence. Thus, reduction in cell size and/or MCL-1 expression might underlie beta-blocker-induced reduction in CI of HL-1. Conversely, increase in cell viability and MCL-1 expression by NP-6A4 through AT2R could have resulted in NP-6A4 mediated increase in CI of HL-1. These data show for the first time that activation of the AT2R-MCL-1 axis by NP-6A4 in nutrient-stressed mouse and human cardiovascular cells (mouse HL-1 cells and primary cultures of hCAVSMCs) might underlie improved survival of cells treated by NP-6A4 compared to other drugs tested in this study.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the exception of t(3q), translocations are not explicitly considered in the cytogenetic classification of the IPSS-R and their impact on disease progression and patient survival is unknown. The present study was aimed at determining the prognostic impact of translocations in the context of the cytogenetic classification of the IPSS-R. We evaluated 1,653 patients from the Spanish Registry of MDS diagnosed with MDS or CMML and an abnormal karyotype by conventional cytogenetic analysis. Translocations were identified in 168 patients (T group). Compared with the 1,485 patients with abnormal karyotype without translocations (non-T group), the T group had a larger proportion of patients with refractory anemia with excess of blasts and higher scores in both the cytogenetic and global IPSS-R. Translocations were associated with a significantly shorter survival and higher incidence of transformation into AML at univariate analysis but both features disappeared after multivariate adjustment for the IPSS-R cytogenetic category. Patients with single or double translocations other than t(3q) had an outcome similar to those in the non-T group in the intermediate cytogenetic risk category of the IPSS-R. In conclusion, the presence of translocations identifies a subgroup of MDS/CMML patients with a more aggressive clinical presentation that can be explained by a higher incidence of complex karyotypes. Single or double translocations other than t(3q) should be explicitly considered into the intermediate risk category of cytogenetic IPSS-R classification.",,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,['Spanish Group of Myelodysplastic Syndromes'],,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Mortality from all causes of death combined for white male officers was significantly higher than expected (SMR=1.20; 95% confidence interval (CI) =1.14-1.26). Increased mortality was also seen for all malignant neoplasms combined (SMR=1.32; 1.19-1.46), all benign neoplasms combined (SMR=2.50; 1.08-4.93), and all diseases of the circulatory system combined (SMR=1.11; 1.02-1.19). The elevated mortality for all malignant neoplasms was primarily due to statistically significant excesses in cancers of the esophagus, colon, respiratory system, Hodgkin's disease and leukemia. Black officers had lower than expected mortality from all causes (SMR=0.45; 0.18-0.92) while female officers had elevated all-cause mortality (SMR=2.17; 1.12-3.79).

However, the detailed sequence of cellular changes that occur in nucleated cells attacked by mAb and complement has not been delineated. Recently developed CD20 mAbs, engineered to form hexamers on binding to cells, react with B-cells in serum, chelate C1q, and then activate complement and promote cell killing considerably more effectively than their wild-type precursors. We used these engineered mAbs as a model to investigate the sequence of events that occur when mAbs bind to B-cell lines and to primary cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and then activate complement. Based on four-color confocal microscopy real-time movies and high resolution digital imaging, we find that after CD20 mAb binding and C1q uptake, C3b deposits on cells, followed by Ca(2+) influx, revealed by bright green signals generated on cells labeled with FLUO-4, a Ca(2+) indicator. The bright FLUO-4/Ca(2+) signal fades, replaced by punctate green signals in mitochondria, indicating Ca(2+) localization. This step leads to mitochondrial poisoning followed by cell death. The entire sequence is completed in <2 min for hexamerization-enhanced CD20 mAb-mediated killing. To our knowledge this is the first time the entire process has been characterized in detail in real time. By identifying multiple discrete steps in the cytotoxic pathway for nucleated cells our findings may inform future development and more effective application of complement-fixing mAbs to cancer treatment.",['NOTNLM'],"['Complement-dependent cytotoxicity', 'Immunotherapy', 'Real-time movies']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We found that Wnt5a enhanced proliferation and migration of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and that these effects were blocked by the humanized anti-ROR1 mAb cirmtuzumab (UC-961). Treatment of CLL cells with Wnt5a induced ROR1 to oligomerize with ROR2 and recruit guanine exchange factors (GEFs), which activated Rac1 and RhoA; siRNA-mediated silencing of either ROR1 or ROR2 or treatment with UC-961 inhibited these effects. Using the ROR1-deficient CLL cell line MEC1, we demonstrated that ectopic ROR1 expression induced ROR1/ROR2 heterooligomers, which recruited GEFs, and enhanced proliferation, cytokine-directed migration, and engraftment potential of MEC1 cells in immune-deficient mice. Notably, treatment with UC-961 inhibited engraftment of ROR1+ leukemia cells in immune-competent ROR1-transgenic mice. Molecular analysis revealed that the extracellular Kringle domain is required for ROR1/ROR2 heterooligomerization and the cysteine-rich domain or intracellular proline-rich domain is required for Wnt5a-induced recruitment of GEFs to ROR1/ROR2. This study identifies an interaction between ROR1 and ROR2 that is required for Wnt5a signaling that promotes leukemia chemotaxis and proliferation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the years, the prognostication in CLL has expanded with the addition in late 90s of mutational status of variable region of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGHV), and chromosomal analyses using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). More recently, stereotypy of BCR (B cell receptor) and whole exome sequencing (WES) based discovery of specific mutations such as NOTCH1, TP53, SF3B1, XPO-1, BIRC3, ATM, and RPS15 further refined the current prognostication system in CLL. In therapy, the field of CLL has seen major changes from oral chlorambucil and steroids prior to 1980s, to chemo-immunotherapy (CIT) with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab (FCR) to the orally administered targeted therapeutic agents inhibiting kinases in the B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway such as Ibrutinib (BTK inhibitor) and Idelalisib (p110 PI3Kdelta inhibitor) and novel anti-CD20 mAb's (monoclonal antibodies) such as obinutuzumab. This progress is continuing and other targeted therapeutics such as Bcl2 antagonists (Venetoclax or ABT-199) and finally chimeric antigen receptor against T cells (CART) are in the process of being developed. This review is an attempt to summarize the major benchmarks in the prognostication and in the therapy of CLL. The topic allocated to us by Dr Ayalew Tefferi and Dr Carlo Brugnara is very appropriate to reminisce what our understanding of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was in 1976 and how rapidly have the advances occurring in this field affected the patients with CLL.",,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Founding mutations and chimeric oncogenes characterize various AMKL subtypes. However, for around one third of all cases the underlying mechanisms of AMKL leukemogenesis are still largely unknown. Recently, an in-frame fusion of meningeoma 1-friend leukemia virus integration 1 (MN1-Fli1) gene was detected in a child with AMKL. We intended to investigate the potential role of this oncofusion in leukemogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia. Strikingly, expression of MN1-Fli1 in murine hematopoietic progenitor cells was sufficient to induce leukemic transformation generating immature myeloid cells with cytomorphology and expression of surface markers typical for AMKL. Systematic structure function analyses revealed FLS and 3'ETS domains of Fli1 as decisive domains for the AMKL phenotype. Our data highlight an important role of MN1-Fli1 in AMKL leukemogenesis and provide a basis for research assessing the value of this oncofusion as a future diagnostic marker and/or therapeutic target in AMKL patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventy-two AML patients were assessed for MRD before CBT, and the majority (84.7%) of these patients received single-unit CBT. All patients received intensified myeloablative conditioning with BUCY2 or TBICY plus high-dose cytarabine, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil. The cumulative incidences of neutrophil and platelet engraftment, acute or chronic GVHD were comparable between MRD-negative and MRD-positive groups. The cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality (TRM) and relapse did not differ signi fi cantly between the two cohorts (25.6% vs. 32.5%, 16.1% vs. 19.2%; p = 0.52, 0.61). There were no apparent differences in 3-year overall survival (OS) (68.9% in MRD-negative group and 57.9% in MRD-positive group, p = 0.31) and 3-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) (62.5% in MRD-negative group and 52.7% in MRD-positive group, p = 0.42) between both groups.

Differential expression patterns of microRNAs (miRNAs) are closely related to the formation and growth of tumors. (1) BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to understand how miRNAs might be related to tumor growth during ALV-J infection. We chose to characterize the effects of miR-221 and miR-222 on cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis based on previous microarray data. (2) METHODS: In vivo, the expression levels of miR-221 and miR-222 were significantly increased in the liver of ALV-J infected chickens (p < 0.01). Over-expression of gga-miR-221 and gga-miR-222 promoted the proliferation, migration, and growth of DF-1 cells, and decreased the expression of BCL-2 modifying factor (BMF) making cells more resistant to apoptosis. (3) RESULTS: Our results suggest that gga-miR-221 and gga-miR-222 may be tumour formation relevant gene in chicken that promote proliferation, migration, and growth of cancer cells, and inhibit apoptosis. BMF expression was significantly reduced in vivo 70 days after ALV-J infection.

For more than two decades, the transforming ability of HTLV-1 has been exclusively associated to the viral transactivator Tax. Thirteen year ago, we first reported that the minus strand of HTLV-1 encoded for a basic Zip factor factor (HBZ), and since then several teams have underscored the importance of this antisense viral protein for the maintenance of a chronic infection and the proliferation of infected cells. More recently, we as well as others have demonstrated that HBZ has the potential to transform cells both in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we focus on the latest progress in our understanding of HBZ functions in chronicity and cellular transformation.

Here we systematically analyse 4,034 cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas cancer cases representing 12 cancer types. We find that the frequency of rare germline truncations in 114 cancer-susceptibility-associated genes varies widely, from 4% (acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)) to 19% (ovarian cancer), with a notably high frequency of 11% in stomach cancer. Burden testing identifies 13 cancer genes with significant enrichment of rare truncations, some associated with specific cancers (for example, RAD51C, PALB2 and MSH6 in AML, stomach and endometrial cancers, respectively). Significant, tumour-specific loss of heterozygosity occurs in nine genes (ATM, BAP1, BRCA1/2, BRIP1, FANCM, PALB2 and RAD51C/D). Moreover, our homology-directed repair assay of 68 BRCA1 rare missense variants supports the utility of allelic enrichment analysis for characterizing variants of unknown significance. The scale of this analysis and the somatic-germline integration enable the detection of rare variants that may affect individual susceptibility to tumour development, a critical step toward precision medicine.",,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2368-4890', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2851-6741', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3482-0923', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4266-6700', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7934-5906', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2276-7013']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall survival (OS) at 6 years was 92% (95%CI, 87 to 98) in the eculizumab cohort versus 80% (95%CI 70 to 91) in historical controls diagnosed after 1985 (HR 0.38 [0.15 to 0.94], P = 0.037). There were significantly fewer thrombotic events (TEs) in the group of patients treated with eculizumab (4% [1-10]) as compared to the historical cohort (27% [20-34]). However, we found that TEs may still occur after the initiation of eculizumab treatment and that previous TEs still have a negative impact on survival. Evolutions to myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukemia were similar in both cohorts. There was less evolution to aplastic anemia in the treatment group.

Epub 2015 Dec 22.,"Cancer, the unregulated proliferation of cells, can occur at any age and may arise from almost all cell types. However, the incidence and types of cancer differ with age. Some cancers are predominantly observed in children, others are mostly restricted to older ages. Treatment strategies of some cancers are very successful and cure is common in childhood, while treatment of the same cancer type is much more challenging in adults. Here, we develop a stochastic model of stem cell proliferation that considers both tissue development and homeostasis and discuss the disturbance of such a system by mutations. Due to changes in population size, mutant fitness becomes context dependent and consequently the effects of mutations on the stem cell population can vary with age. We discuss different mutant phenotypes and show the age dependency of their expected abundances. Most importantly, fitness of particular mutations can change with age and advantageous mutations can become deleterious or vice versa. This perspective can explain unique properties of childhood disorders, for example, the frequently observed phenomenon of a self-limiting leukemia in newborns with trisomy 21, but also explains other puzzling observations such as the increased risk of leukemia in patients with bone marrow failure or chemotherapy induced myelodysplasia.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphocytic leukemia', 'Acute myelogenous leukemia', 'Adult haematopoietic stem cells', 'Cancer stem cells', 'Hemopoietic stem cells', 'Self-renewal']",['(c) AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Today, a considerable number of patients reach a sustained DMR, especially when they are treated with the latest drugs. Although new-generation treatments may provide significant improvement in terms of patient health and health-related quality of life, many patients are uncertain about discontinuation and may refuse a treatment switch. METHODS: This study is an observational research project aimed at investigating, from a psychological point of view, possible cognitive and emotional components that can influence treatment discontinuation and treatment decisions in a cohort sample of 120 CML patients. RESULTS: The expected results indicate that cognitive and emotional factors may influence decision-making in this setting and may prevent appropriate risk-and-benefit evaluation of new treatment approaches. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that will analyze in depth all possible psychological variables that can interfere with the medical decision process of treatment discontinuation in CML, providing new insights for clinical practice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it remains unclear whether K(+) channels are involved in the lipid uptake of macrophages. The expression and function of the inward rectifier potassium channel (Kir2.1, KCNJ2) in Human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) cells and human monocytes derived macrophages (HMDMs) were investigated using RT-PCR and western blotting, and patch clamp technique. The expression of scavenger receptors in THP-1-derived macrophages was detected using western blotting. Expressions of Kir2.1 mRNA and protein in HMDMs were significantly decreased by 60% (P < 0.05) and 90% (P < 0.001) on macrophage maturation, but overexpressed by approximately 1.3 (P > 0.05) and 3.8 times (P = 0.001) after foam cell formation respectively. Concurrently, the Kir2.1 peak current density in HMDMs, mature macrophages and foam cells, measured at -150 mV, were -22.61 +/- 2.1 pA/pF, -7.88 +/- 0.60 pA/pF and -13.39 +/- 0.80 pA/pF respectively (P < 0.05). In association with an up-regulation of Kir2.1 in foam cells, the SR-A protein level was significantly increased by over 1.5 times compared with macrophages (P < 0.05). THP-1 cells contained much less lipids upon Kir2.1 knockdown and cholesterol ester/total cholesterol ratio was 29.46 +/- 2.01% (P < 0.05), and the SR-BI protein level was increased by over 6.2 times, compared to that of macrophages (P < 0.001).

Cats that are infected with FeLV may develop a progressive infection resulting in persistent viremia, immunodeficiency, tumors, anemia and death. A significant number of cats mount a protective immune response that suppresses viremia; these cats develop a regressive infection characterized by the absence of viral replication and the presence of low levels of proviral DNA. The biological importance of these latter provirus carriers is largely unknown. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that ten cats that received a transfusion of blood from aviremic provirus carriers developed active FeLV infections, some with a progressive outcome and the development of fatal FeLV-associated disease. The infection outcome, disease spectrum and evolution into FeLV-C in one cat mirrored those of natural infection. Two cats developed persistent antigenemia; six cats were transiently antigenemic. Reactivation of infection occurred in some cats. One recipient developed non-regenerative anemia associated with FeLV-C, and four others developed a T-cell lymphoma, one with secondary lymphoblastic leukemia. Five of the ten recipient cats received provirus-positive aviremic blood, whereas the other five received provirus- and viral RNA-positive but aviremic blood. Notably, the cats that received blood containing only proviral DNA exhibited a later onset but graver outcome of FeLV infection than the cats that were transfused with blood containing proviral DNA and viral RNA. Leukocyte counts and cytokine analyses indicated that the immune system of the latter cats reacted quicker and more efficiently. CONCLUSIONS: Our results underline the biological and epidemiological relevance of FeLV provirus carriers and the risk of inadvertent FeLV transmission via blood transfusion and demonstrate the replication capacity of proviral DNA if uncontrolled by the immune system. Our results have implications not only for veterinary medicine, such as the requirement for testing blood donors and blood products for FeLV provirus by sensitive polymerase chain reaction, but are also of general interest by revealing the importance of latent retroviral DNA in infected hosts. When aiming to eliminate a retroviral infection from a population, provirus carriers must be considered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Uncovering the potential associations between diseases and miRNA-EF interactions could benefit the understanding of the underlying disease mechanism at miRNA and EF levels, miRNA signatures identification, and drug repurposing. In this study, based on the assumption that similar miRNAs (EFs) tend to interact with similar EFs (miRNAs) in the context of a given disease and under the framework of random walk with restart (RWR), a novel method of miREFRWR was developed to uncover the hidden disease-related miRNA-EF interactions by implementing random walks on an miRNA similarity network and EF similarity network, respectively. miREFRWR was evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation, which achieved an AUC of 0.9500. It has been demonstrated that miREFRWR can effectively identify potential interactions in all the test classes, even if these test samples only share either EFs or miRNAs with the training samples. Furthermore, many predictive results for acute promyelocytic leukemia and breast cancer (67 and 10 interactions out of the top 1% predictions, respectively) have been verified by independent experimental studies. It is anticipated that miREFRWR could be a useful and important biological resource for biomedical research.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four analogs, 1,7-bis-(3,4-dimethoxy-phenyl)-hepta-1,6-diene-3,5-dione (1J), 2,6-bis-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-benzylidene)-cyclohexanone (2A), 2,6-bis-(3,4-dihydroxy-benzylidene)-cyclohexanone (2F) and 2,6-bis-(3,4-dimethoxy-benzylidene)-cyclohexanone (2J) markedly increased the sensitivity of K562/Adr cells to paclitaxel (PTX) for 8-, 2-, 8- and 16- folds, respectively and vinblastine (Vin) for 5-, 3-, 12- and 30- folds, respectively. The accumulation of P-gp substrates, Calcein-AM, Rhodamine 123 and Doxorubicin, was significantly increased by 1J (up to 6-, 11- and 22- folds, respectively) and 2J (up to 7-, 12- and 17- folds, respectively). Besides 2A, 2F and 2J dramatically decreased P-gp expression in K562/Adr cells. These results could be summarized in the following way. Analog 1J inhibited only P-gp function, while 2A and 2F inhibited only P-gp expression. Interestingly, 2J exerts inhibition of both P-gp function and expression. The combination index (CI) of combination between 2J and PTX (0.09) or Vin (0.06) in K562/Adr cells indicated strong synergistic effects, which likely due to its MDR reversing activity. Moreover, these analogs showed less cytotoxicity to peripheral mononuclear cells (human) and red blood cells (human and rat) suggesting the safety of analogs for further animal and clinical studies.",['NOTNLM'],"['Curcumin analogs', 'Leukemia', 'Multi-drug resistance', 'P-gp inhibitor']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Epub 2015 Nov 25.,"Recent epidemiological studies indicate that the antidiabetic drug metformin has chemosensitizing and chemopreventive effects against carcinogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that metformin exerts varying degrees of antitumor activity against human leukemia cells, as reflected by differences in growth inhibition, apoptosis, and alterations to metabolic enzymes. In metformin-sensitive cells, autophagy was not induced but rather it blocked proliferation by means of arresting cells in the S and G2/M phases which was associated with the downregulation of cyclin A, cyclin B1, and cdc2, but not that of cyclin E. In 10E1-CEM cells that overexpress Bcl-2 and are drug-resistant, the effect of metformin on proliferation was more pronounced, also inducing the activation of the caspases 3/7 and hence apoptosis. In all sensitive cells, metformin decreased the Deltapsi m and it modified the expression of enzymes involved in energy metabolism: PKCepsilon (PKCepsilon) and PKCdelta (PKCdelta). In sensitive cells, metformin altered PKCepsilon and PKCdelta expression leading to a predominance of PKCepsilon over PKCdelta which implies a more glycolytic state. The opposite occurs in the nonresponsive cells. In conclusion, we provide new insights into the activity of metformin as an antitumoral agent in leukemia cells that could be related to its capability to modulate energy metabolism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although there is overlap of imaging features with other more common malignancies, such as transitional and renal cell cancers, the combination of imaging findings and the appropriate clinical picture should allow the radiologist to raise a provisional diagnosis of a haematological neoplasm.

Epub 2015 Jul 26.,"BACKGROUND: Activation of the Hedgehog signalling pathway contributes to cancer progression and the development of myeloid leukaemia stem cell therapeutic resistance. We aimed to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose of the selective Hedgehog antagonist PF-04449913 in myeloid malignancies. METHODS: We undertook an open-label, dose-finding, standard 3+3 design phase 1 study of PF-04449913 in adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or myelofibrosis who were refractory, resistant, or intolerant to previous treatments, at three centres in the USA and one in Italy. Patients who had newly diagnosed, untreated disease were included if they were not eligible for standard treatment options or if standard treatments were not deemed appropriate. Patients received PF-04449913 once daily continuously until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or patient withdrawal for up to 12 28-day cycles. Additional cycles were given if patients showed evidence of clinical benefit. The starting dose was 5 mg and was increased by 100% until the first dose-limiting toxic effect (DLT) and by 50% thereafter, in keeping with a 3+3 clinical trial statistical design. The primary endpoint was first-cycle DLTs. Secondary endpoints were safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical activity. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00953758. FINDINGS: Between March 24, 2010, and Sept 7, 2012, 47 patients were enrolled and included in the study: 28 with acute myeloid leukaemia, six with myelodysplastic syndrome, five with chronic myeloid leukaemia (two with chronic-phase and three with blast-phase disease), one with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, and seven with myelofibrosis. Patients received PF-04449913 once daily at 5 mg (n=3), 10 mg (n=3), 20 mg (n=4), 40 mg (n=4), 80 mg (n=8), 120 mg (n=3), 180 mg (n=3), 270 mg (n=5), 400 mg (n=9), and 600 mg (n=5). Two patients experienced DLTs (one each in the 80 mg and 600 mg dose groups). The MTD for PF-04449913 was established to be 400 mg once daily. Of the 47 patients enrolled, 28 (60%) experienced treatment-related adverse events, three of which were grade 4 in severity. The most common treatment-related adverse events included dysgeusia (13 [28%] patients), decreased appetite (nine [19%]), and alopecia (seven [15%]). None of the 15 deaths reported were treatment related. Pharmacokinetics seemed to be dose proportional. The mean half-life was 23.9 h (SD 14.0) in the MTD group. Some suggestion of clinical activity was noted in 23 (49%) of 47 patients with haematological malignancies. Based on these results, the recommended phase 2 dose was 200 mg or lower once daily. INTERPRETATION: Based on these findings, PF-04449913 is being tested in phase 2 studies in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukaemia, and myelofibrosis.

Epub 2015 Jun 11.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms are at increased risk of new solid or haematological cancers, but how prognosis is affected in patients with preceding myeloproliferative neoplasms is unclear. METHODS: We used data from population-based medical databases in Denmark from 1980 to 2011 to compare survival between cancer patients with and without a preceding diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasm, matched for age, sex, year of diagnosis, and type of cancer. We assessed outcomes by cancer stage and comorbidities. FINDINGS: Data were available for 1246 patients with a history of myeloproliferative neoplasms and we matched 5155 patients without a history of myeloproliferative neoplasm for comparison. Among patients with new localised solid cancers, 5-year survival was 49.8% (95% CI 39.1-59.6) for patients with preceding essential thrombocythaemia, 47.9% (42.1-53.4) for those with preceding polycythaemia vera, and 48.0% (34.1-60.7) for those with preceding chronic myeloid leukaemia. The values were 72.4% (68.4-76.0), 63.9% (61.5-66.2), and 74.3% (68.2-79.4), respectively, in matched patients without preceding myeloproliferative neoplasms. The risk of death among patients with a solid tumour and preceding myeloproliferative neoplasm was 1.21-2.28 times higher than in patients without myeloproliferative neoplasms. Excess mortality risk was observed irrespective of whether new cancers were diagnosed within 5 years or 5 years or more after myeloproliferative neoplasm. INTERPRETATION: Preceding myeloproliferative neoplasm is a predictor for poor outlook in patients who develop new primary cancers.

Epub 2015 May 20.,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to compare the ability of recently developed prognostic indices for myelodysplastic syndromes to identify patients with poor prognoses within the lower-risk (low and intermediate-1) categories defined by the International Prognosis Scoring System (IPSS). METHODS: We included patients with de-novo myelodysplastic syndromes diagnosed between Nov 29, 1972, and Dec 15, 2011, who had low or intermediate-1 IPSS scores and were in the Spanish Registry of Myelodysplastic Syndromes. We reclassified these patients with the new prognostic indices (revised IPSS [IPSS-R], revised WHO-based Prognostic Scoring System [WPSS-R], Lower Risk Scoring System [LRSS], and the Grupo Espanol de Sindromes Mielodisplasicos [Spanish Group of Myelodysplastic Syndromes; GESMD]) and calculated the overall survival of the different risk groups within each prognostic index to identify the groups of patients with overall poor prognoses (defined as an expected overall survival <30 months). We calculated overall survival with the Kaplan-Meier method. FINDINGS: We identified 2373 patients. None of the prognostic indices could be used to identify a population with poor prognoses (median overall survival <30 months) for the patients with low IPSS scores (1290 individuals). In the group with intermediate-1 scores (1083 individuals), between 17% and 47% of patients were identified as having poor prognoses with the new prognostic indices. The LRSS had the best model fit with the lowest value in the Akaike information criteria test, whereas the IPSS-R identified the largest proportion of patients with poor prognoses (47%). Patients with intermediate-1 scores who were classified as having poor prognoses by one or more prognostic index (646 [60%] individuals) had worse median overall survival (33.1 months, 95% CI 28.4-37.9) than did patients who were classified as having low risk by all prognostic indices (63.7 months, 49.5-78.0], HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.6-2.3, p<0.0001) INTERPRETATION: Recently proposed prognostic indices for myelodysplastic syndromes can be used to improve identification of patients with poor prognoses in the group of patients with intermediate-1 IPSS scores, who could potentially benefit from a high-risk treatment approach.

Epub 2015 Dec 11.,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an infectious disease responsible for several deaths in malnourished children due to impaired cell-mediated immunity, which is accompanied by low circulating leptin levels. The cytokine function of leptin is implicated for several immune regulation activities such as hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, innate and adaptive immunity. Its deficiency associated with polarization of Th2 response, which coincides with VL pathogenesis. To determine the cytokine role of leptin in case of experimental VL, we tested the leptin associated Th1/Th2 type cytokine profile at mRNA level from Leishmania donovani infected human monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We also tested the effect of leptin on macrophages activation (viz. studying the phosphorylation of signaling moieties), phagocytic activity and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during infection. We observed that leptin induced Th1 specific response by upregulation of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-8 and TNF-alpha in THP-1 and IFN-gamma, IL-12 and IL-2 in PBMCs. We also observed the downregulation of Th2 type cytokine i.e. IL-10 in THP-1 and unaltered expression of cytokines i.e. TGF-beta, IL-10 and IL-4 in PBMCs. In addition, leptin stimulates the macrophages by inducing phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and Akt which are usually dephosphorylated in L. donovani infection. In concordance, leptin also induces the macrophage phagocytic activity by enhancing the intracellular ROS generation which helps in phagolysosome formation and oxidative killing of the parasite. In compilation, leptin is able to maintain the defensive environment against L. donovani infection through the classical macrophage activity.",['NOTNLM'],"['Leptin', 'Phagocytosis', 'Proinflammatory response', 'Reactive oxygen species', 'Visceral leishmaniasis']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2015 May 6.,"BACKGROUND: A mechanism for clonal growth advantage in isolated del(5q) disease remains elusive. CSNK1A1 resides on the critically deleted region, and deletion of this gene has been shown in mouse knockout and transplantation studies to produce some characteristics of bone marrow failure, including a proliferative advantage. We aimed to establish the frequency, nature, and clinical association of CSNK1A1 mutations in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and associated myeloid neoplasms. METHODS: Between June 1, 2004, and May 31, 2014, in King's College (London, UK), we did whole-exome sequencing of five patients with isolated del(5q) followed by targeted screening for CSNK1A1 mutations and 20 myelodysplastic syndrome-associated mutations in 245 additional patients with myeloid neoplasms. All patients met present WHO diagnostic criteria for myelodysplastic syndrome and other related myeloid neoplasms. FINDINGS: 39 (16%) of 250 patients with myeloid neoplasms had isolated del(5q), of whom seven (18%) had CSNK1A1 mutations. All these mutations were missense and presented in a highly conserved region that is implicated in ATP catalysis. Serial sampling and response to lenalidomide treatment showed that CSNK1A1 mutations were highly associated with the del(5q) clone. Only one patient with a CSNK1A1 mutation showed complete cytogenetic response to lenalidomide. Four (57%) of the seven patients carrying a CSNK1A1 mutation showed disease progression coupled with an increase in mutant allele burden (all four were on lenalidomide). We detected coexisting myelodysplastic syndrome-related gene mutations in patients with CSNK1A1 mutations, including TP53. INTERPRETATION: Similar to the effect of TP53 mutations on progression of del(5q) abnormality, mutant CSNK1A1 also gives rise to a poor prognosis in del(5q) abnormality, for which a coupled increase in P53 activation is suggested. CSNK1A1 mutations in del(5q) disease are important in the context of therapeutic manipulation and need incorporation into future prospective studies.

Epub 2015 Apr 14.,"BACKGROUND: Roughly 80% of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia have high activity of Bruton's tyrosine-kinase (BTK) in their blast cells compared with normal haemopoietic cells, rendering the cells sensitive to the oral BTK inhibitor ibrutinib in vitro. We aimed to develop the biological understanding of the BTK pathway in acute myeloid leukaemia to identify clinically relevant diagnostic information that might define a subset of patients that should respond to ibrutinib treatment. METHODS: We obtained acute myeloid leukaemia blast cells from unselected patients attending our UK hospital between Feb 19, 2010, and Jan 20, 2014. We isolated primary acute myeloid leukaemia blast cells from heparinised blood and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells to establish the activity of BTK in response to CD117 activation. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of ibrutinib on CD117-induced BTK activation, downstream signalling, adhesion to primary bone-marrow mesenchymal stromal cells, and proliferation of primary acute myeloid leukaemia blast cells. We used the Mann-Whitney U test to compare results between groups. FINDINGS: We obtained acute myeloid leukaemia blast cells from 29 patients. Ibrutinib significantly inhibited CD117-mediated proliferation of primary acute myeloid leukaemia blast cells (p=0.028). CD117 activation increased BTK activity by inducing phosphorylated BTK in patients with CD117-positive acute myeloid leukaemia. Furthermore, ibrutinib inhibited CD117-induced activity of BTK and downstream kinases at a concentration of 100 nM or more. CD117-mediated adhesion of CD117-expressing blast cells to bone-marrow stromal cells was significantly inhibited by Ibrutinib at 500 nM (p=0.028) INTERPRETATION: As first-in-man clinical trials of ibrutinib in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia commence, the data suggest not all patients will respond. Our findings show that BTK has specific pro-tumoural biological actions downstream of surface CD117 activation, which are inhibited by ibrutinib. Accordingly, we propose that patients with acute myeloid leukaemia whose blast cells express CD117 should be considered for forthcoming clinical trials of ibrutinib.

Epub 2015 Apr 21.,"BACKGROUND: Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) was introduced into the conditioning regimen in haemopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to prevent graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD) and graft failure. However, ATG can also cause delayed immune reconstitution of donor T cells. We studied the relation between exposure to active ATG and clinical outcomes in children. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, all patients (age 0.2-23 years) receiving their first HCT between April 1, 2004, and April 1, 2012, who received ATG (thymoglobulin) in two Dutch paediatric HCT programmes were included. The cumulative dose of ATG was chosen according to local protocols and was given intravenously over 4 days consecutively. ATG exposure measures (maximum concentration, concentration at time of HCT, clearance, days to reach a concentration below the lympholytic concentration of one arbitrary unit [AU] per mL, total area under the curve [AUC], AUC before HCT, and AUC after HCT) were calculated using a validated population pharmacokinetic model. The main outcome of interest was immune reconstitution (defined as CD4+ T cells >0.05 x 10(9) cells per L in two consecutive measurements within 100 days). Other outcomes of interest were survival, acute and chronic GvHD, and graft failure. We used Cox proportional hazard models, logistic regression models, and Fine-Gray competing risk regressions for analyses. FINDINGS: 251 patients were included. The chance of successful immune reconstitution decreased as the ATG AUC after HCT increased (odds ratio 0.991, 95% CI 0.987-0.996; p<0.0001). Within the cord blood group, we noted decreased immune reconstitution above the lowest AUC quartile (>/= 20 AU x day/mL; p=0.0024), whereas in the bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell group, decreased immune reconstitution was noted only in the highest quartile (>/= 100 AU x day/mL; p=0.0024). Successful immune reconstitution by day 100 was associated with increased overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.49, 95% CI 0.29-0.81; p=0.0047) caused by reduced non-relapse mortality (0.40, 0.21-0.77; p=0.0062), and relapse-related mortality in myeloid leukaemia (0.25, 0.08-0.76; p=0.015). An AUC before transplantation of at least 40 AU x day/mL resulted in a lower incidence of acute GvHD (grade 2-4 HR 0.979, 95% CI 0.963-0.994; p=0.0081; and grade 3-4 0.975, 0.952-0.998; p=0.033), chronic GvHD (0.983, 0.968-0.998; p=0.029), and graft failure (0.981, 0.965-0.997; p=0.020) compared with an AUC of less than 40 AU x day/mL. INTERPRETATION: These results stress the importance of improving the efficacy and safety of ATG in HCT by amending dosage and timing. Individualised dosing and timing of ATG to aim for optimum exposure before and after HCT could result in improved outcomes after paediatric HCT.

Epub 2015 Apr 20.,"BACKGROUND: Tyrosine-kinase inhibitors improve overall survival in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase (CML-CP). Survival compared with the general population by age, response, and type of tyrosine-kinase inhibitor is not known. With use of data from trials of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, we compared overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP to that of general population. METHODS: In this cohort analysis, we included data from patients with CML-CP enrolled in six consecutive or parallel prospective clinical trials of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors at a single institution from July 30, 2000, to Sept 17, 2012. We analysed data for response and survival with the Kaplan-Meier method. For estimated overall survival in the general population, we obtained data from national vital statistics reports and matched to patients with CML-CP by age, sex, ethnicity, and year at diagnosis. We assessed numbers and causes of death within 1 year of beginning treatment by age group and by response to therapy. We then did univariate analysis and multivariate analysis to investigate factors associated with survival probability. FINDINGS: Our analysis included 483 patients, 271 received imatinib, 105 received nilotinib, and 107 received dasatinib. Most patients were younger than 65 years, and no patients were older than 85 years. Median follow-up was 99.4 months (IQR 44.9-121.6), by which time 53 (11%) patients had died. The most common causes of death were progression to advanced disease stage, including complications of stem-cell transplantation (17 [4%] patients), secondary malignancies (nine [2%] patients), and cardiovascular causes (nine [2%] patients). 5-year overall survival in patients with CML-CP decreased in older age categories. For the whole population of patients with CML-CP, 5-year survival was only slightly lower than that of the matched general population (relative survival 94.7% [95% 92.1-97.4]). Individuals of all ages with a report of complete cytogenetic response to treatment or deeper within 1 year had a 5-year survival similar to that of the general population. INTERPRETATION: In the era of treatment with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, patients diagnosed with CML-CP can expect a 5-year survival that is only slightly lower than that of the general population. With access to tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, most patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia could enjoy a near normal life expectancy.

Epub 2015 Mar 20.,"BACKGROUND: Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are available for treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase (CML-CP). We analysed long-term molecular and cytogenetic response and survival outcomes for four TKI modalities used as frontline therapy for CML-CP. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort analysis, we included data from patients with CML-CP treated in prospective clinical trials with frontline TKI modalities at a single institution between July 31, 2000, and Sept 10, 2013. The main aim of the study was to determine whether achievement of complete cytogenetic response or major molecular response had similar prognostic implications irrespective of the frontline TKI modality used. We analysed each TKI modality for response assessment and analysed survival endpoints (event-free, failure-free, transformation-free, and overall survival) with the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done with Cox proportional hazard regression. FINDINGS: Our analysis included 482 patients who were treated with imatinib 400 mg daily (n=68), imatinib 800 mg daily (n=200), dasatinib 50 mg twice daily or 100 mg daily (n=106), or nilotinib 400 mg twice daily (n=108). More patients receiving imatinib 800 mg or second-generation TKIs (ie, dasatinib or nilotinib) achieved complete cytogenetic response (58 [87%] of 67 for imatinib 400 mg vs 180 [90%] of 199 for imatinib 800 mg, vs 100 [96%] of 104 for dasatinib vs 99 [93%] of 107 for nilotinib), major molecular response (51 [76%] vs 171 [86%] vs 93 [90%] vs 97 [91%]), and 4.5 log or higher reduction in BCR-ABL transcripts (MR(4.5) response 38 [57%] vs 148 [74%] vs 76 [71%] vs 76 [71%]). This finding was consistent over time (3-60 months). 5-year event free survival significantly differed between the imatinib 400 mg group and the other TKI groups (imatinib 800 mg p=0.029, dasatinib p=0.003, nilotinib p=0.031). There was no significant difference in 5-year failure-free survival (p=0.32, p=0.075, p=0.332), transformation-free survival (p=0.053, p=0.038, p=0.493), or overall survival (p=0.563, p=0.162, p=0.981). Multivariate analysis showed that therapy with imatinib 800 mg (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29-0.88, p=0.016), dasatinib (0.28, 0.12-0.66, p=0.004), or nilotinib (0.42, 0.20-0.89, p=0.024) predicted for better event-free survival compared with imatinib 400 mg, but that failure-free, transformation-free, and overall survival were similar irrespective of the TKI used. 28 (41%) patients receiving imatinib 400 mg, 85 (43%) receiving imatinib 800 mg, 23 (21%) receiving dasatinib, and 27 (25%) receiving nilotinib discontinued treatment for any reason. INTERPRETATION: Treatment with imatinib 800 mg or the second-generation TKIs dasatinib or nilotinib resulted in superior and deeper responses than did standard-dose imatinib, which were maintained after 5 years of follow-up. Results with imatinib 800 mg were similar to those with second-generation TKIs, although more patients discontinued therapy.

Epub 2015 Feb 25.,"BACKGROUND: Prognosis of patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is poor and new treatments are needed. We aimed to assess the feasibility, tolerability, dosimetry, and efficacy of yttrium-90-labelled anti-CD22 epratuzumab tetraxetan ((90)Y-DOTA-epratuzumab) radioimmunotherapy in refractory or relapsed CD22-positive B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in a standard 3 + 3 phase 1 study. METHODS: Adults (>/=18 years) with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (with CD22 expression on at least 70% of blast cells) were enrolled at six centres in France. Patients received one cycle of (90)Y-DOTA-epratuzumab on days 1 and 8 (give or take 2 days) successively at one of four dose levels: 2.5 mCi/m(2) (92.5 MBq/m(2); level 1), 5.0 mCi/m(2) (185 MBq/m(2); level 2), 7.5 mCi/m(2) (277.5 MBq/m(2); level 3), and 10.0 mCi/m(2) (370 MBq/m(2); level 4). The primary objective was to identify the maximum tolerated dose of (90)Y-DOTA-epratuzumab. We assessed safety during infusions and regularly after radioimmunotherapy over a 6-month period. Analyses included only patients who received radioimmunotherapy. The trial is closed to inclusion and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01354457. FINDINGS: Between Aug 25, 2011, and June 11, 2014, 17 patients (median age 62 years; range 27-77) were treated (five at level 1, three at level 2, three at level 3, and six at level 4). Radioimmunotherapy infusion was overall well tolerated. One dose-limiting toxic effect (aplasia lasting 8 weeks) occurred at level 4, but the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were pancytopenia (one patient at level 2, one at level 3, and six at level 4) and infections (three at level 1, one at level 2, and five at level 4). INTERPRETATION: (90)Y-DOTA-epratuzumab radioimmunotherapy is well tolerated. We recommend the dose of 2 x 10.0 mCi/m(2) 1 week apart per cycle for phase 2 studies.

Epub 2015 Dec 10.,"Genome-wide profiling of histone modifications can provide systematic insight into the regulatory elements and programs engaged in a given cell type. However, conventional chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) does not capture quantitative information on histone modification levels, requires large amounts of starting material, and involves tedious processing of each individual sample. Here, we address these limitations with a technology that leverages DNA barcoding to profile chromatin quantitatively and in multiplexed format. We concurrently map relative levels of multiple histone modifications across multiple samples, each comprising as few as a thousand cells. We demonstrate the technology by monitoring dynamic changes following inhibition of p300, EZH2, or KDM5, by linking altered epigenetic landscapes to chromatin regulator mutations, and by mapping active and repressive marks in purified human hematopoietic stem cells. Hence, this technology enables quantitative studies of chromatin state dynamics across rare cell types, genotypes, environmental conditions, and drug treatments.",,,['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2015 Jan 7.,"BACKGROUND: Nilotinib is now recommended for patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase and leads to important rates of molecular response 4.5 log (MR(4.5)), allowing the prospect of therapy cessation. However, most patients do not reach this criterion and nilotinib is taken for lengthy periods, resulting in chronic or late-onset adverse events. Nilotinib combined with interferon might further increase rates of MR(4.5), avoid late side-effects, and allow therapy cessation. In a phase 2 trial we aimed to assess the feasibility, safety, and deep molecular response of the combination of nilotinib (600 mg daily) and peginterferon alfa-2a in newly diagnosed patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). METHODS: In a non-randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial, we enrolled adult patients (age >/=18 years) without any organ failure who had BCR-ABL-positive, chronic-phase CML, at diagnosis. After a priming procedure with 90 mug per week of peginterferon alfa-2a alone for a month, we gave patients peginterferon alfa-2a 45 mug per week combined with nilotinib 600 mg daily until 24 months after interferon initiation. The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of MR(4.5) at 12 months after initiation of peginterferon alfa-2a. Data were analysed by a modified intention-to-treat principle. This trial is registered at the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT), number 2010-019786-28. FINDINGS: Between March 24, 2011, and Sept 27, 2011, we enrolled 42 patients. One patient withdrew consent before receiving any study treatment so was excluded from analysis; 41 patients received treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a and nilotinib. At 12 months, seven (17%) patients had achieved MR(4.5). Haematological and hepatic adverse events were frequent-with grade 3-4 neutropenias occurring in ten (24%) patients, grade 3-4 thrombocytopenias occurring in ten (24%) patients, grade 3-4 cholestatic events occurring in seven (17%) patients, and grade 3-4 elevations in aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase occurring in three (7% patients-particularly during the first 3 months. However, 30 (73%) patients remained on interferon therapy at 1 year. Three grade 3-4 cardiac events (7% of patients, all coronary stenoses) occurred at later timepoints. INTERPRETATION: The combination of peginterferon alfa-2a resulted in good molecular responses in patients. Despite substantial toxic effects, most patients remained on the study drugs for more than a year. This combination should now be tested in a randomised controlled trial.

Epub 2014 Dec 22.,"BACKGROUND: The standard of care for myelodysplastic syndromes is hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine. However, responses to azacitidine are generally temporary, and outcomes after hypomethylating agent failure are dismal. Therefore, the development of more effective treatments is crucial to improve outcomes in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. We aimed to assess azacitidine and lenalidomide in patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukaemia. METHODS: We did this single-arm phase 1/2 study at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, TX, USA. Patients of any age were eligible for phase 1 and 2a if they had relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome with bone marrow blasts more than 10%. For phase 2b, eligible participants were previously untreated with myelodysplastic syndrome with an International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score of intermediate-1 or higher with up to 30% blasts. All participants received 75 mg/m(2) azacitidine once a day for days 1-5 for each 28 day cycle. We gave patients oral lenalidomide for 5 or 10 days starting on day 6. We assessed seven lenalidomide doses in a 3 + 3 phase 1 design (n=28). The primary endpoint in phase 1 was the maximum tolerated dose, and the primary endpoint in phase 2 was overall survival. Outcome analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01038635. FINDINGS: Between Dec 30, 2009, and June, 17, 2013, we enrolled 88 patients (28 in phase 1 and 60 in phase 2). One patient unexpectedly died in the phase 1 study at the highest dose level, six more patients were recruited with no further serious adverse events. We recorded no dose-limiting toxic effects, and the maximum tolerated dose of lenalidomide in combination with azacitidine in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome was initially established at 50 mg per day for 10 days. In the first 20 patients in phase 2, we noted a high rate of myelosuppression and myelosuppression-related toxic effects; therefore, we amended the lenalidomide dose to 25 mg per day for 5 days. We also adjusted the inclusion criteria to include patients with less than 30% blasts to focus mainly on patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. Median overall survival was 75 weeks (IQR 25-not reached) for the 40 patients in phase 2b. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events overall were neutropenic fever (n=27) and pneumonia (n=18). INTERPRETATION: We have identified a safe and active sequential treatment combination of azacitidine and lenalidomide for patient with myelodysplastic syndrome and have preliminary evidence that this dose is also safe for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia.

Epub 2015 Dec 21.,"The outcome of patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) has dramatically improved over the last two decades, due to the introduction of combined all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy regimens and, more recently, to the advent of arsenic trioxide (ATO). ATRA and anthracycline-based chemotherapy remains a widely used strategy, providing cure rates above 80%, but it is associated with risk of severe infections and occurrence of secondary leukaemias. ATO is the most effective single agent in APL and, used alone or in combination with ATRA or ATRA and reduced-intensity chemotherapy, results in greater efficacy with considerably less haematological toxicity. The toxic profile of ATO includes frequent, but manageable, QTc prolongation and increase of liver enzymes. Two large randomized studies have shown that ATRA + ATO is superior to ATRA + chemotherapy for newly diagnosed low-risk APL resulting in 2-4 year event-free survival rates above 90% and very few relapses. According to real world data, the spectacular progress in APL outcomes reported in clinical trials has not been paralleled by a significant improvement in early death rates, this remains the most challenging issue for the final cure of the disease.",['NOTNLM'],"['PML/RARA', 'acute promyelocytic leukaemia', 'all-trans retinoic acid', 'arsenic trioxide']",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cell killing ability of EGCG was synergistically enhanced by menadione. In addition, the cytotoxic effect of EGCG applied alone or in combination with menadione was accompanied by apoptosis induction. We also observed that in acute treatments EGCG displays strong antioxidant properties in the intracellular milieu, but concurrently triggers some oxidative stress generating mechanisms that can fully develop on a longer timescale. In parallel, EGCG dose-dependently induced mitochondrial depolarization during exposure, but this condition was subsequently reversed to a persistent hyperpolarized mitochondrial state that was dependent on the activity of respiratory Complex I. Fluorimetric measurements suggest that EGCG is a mitochondrial Complex III inhibitor and indicate that EGCG evokes a specific cellular fluorescence with emission at 400nm and two main excitation bands (at 330nm and 350nm) that may originate from a mitochondrial supercomplex containing dimeric Complex III and dimeric ATP-synthase, and therefore could provide a valuable means to characterize the functional properties of the respiratory chain.",['NOTNLM'],"['Antimycin A (PubChem CID: 14957)', 'Apoptosis', 'Cyclosporin A (PubChem CID: 5284373)', 'Epigallocatechin-3-gallate', 'Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (PubChem CID: 65064)', 'Leukemia', 'Menadione', 'Menadione sodium bisulfite (PubChem CID: 23665888)', 'Mitochondrial dysfunction', 'Oxidative stress', 'Rotenone (PubChem CID: 6758)']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2015 Dec 19.,"The forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors are considered as tumor suppressors that limit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. FOXO gene alterations have been described in a limited number of human cancers, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, leukemia and lymphoma. In addition, FOXO proteins are inactivated by major oncogenic signals such as the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase pathway and MAP kinases. Their expression is also repressed by micro-RNAs in multiple cancer types. FOXOs are mediators of the tumor response to various therapies. However, paradoxical roles of FOXOs in cancer progression were recently described. FOXOs contribute to the maintenance of leukemia-initiating cells in acute and chronic myeloid leukemia. These factors may also promote invasion and metastasis of subsets of colon and breast cancers. Resistance to treatment was also ascribed to FOXO activation in multiple cases, including targeted therapies. In this review, we discuss the complex role of FOXOs in cancer development and response to therapy.",['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer stem cells', 'Cell cycle', 'Cell invasion', 'FOXO1', 'FOXO3', 'FOXO4', 'Metastasis', 'Tumor-initiating cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 2.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The prognosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is poor in older adults and elderly patients, and subtype-oriented prospective trials are scarce in these patients. We present the results of three prospective parallel subtype-oriented protocols in fit patients older than 55 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 2008, three prospective phase II trials in patients older than 55 years were activated: ALLOLD07 for Philadephia (Ph) chromosome-negative ALL, ALLOPH07 for Ph-positive ALL, and BURKIMAB08 for mature B-ALL. Early death (ED), complete remission (CR), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS) and toxicity were analyzed. RESULTS: 56, 53 and 21 patients from the ALLOLD07, ALLOPH07 and BURKIMAB08 trials, respectively, were evaluable. CR was 74%, 87% and 70%, with an ED rate of 13%, 11% and 15%, respectively. The medians of DFS were 8 and 38 months for ALLOLD07 and ALLOPH07 protocols, not being achieved in the BURKIMAB08 trial (p=0.001), and the median OS was 12, 37 and 25 months, respectively (p=0.030). Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and infections were less frequent in the ALLOPH07 trial vs. ALLOLD07 and BURKIMAB trials, and renal toxicity and mucositis were more frequent in the BURKIMAB08 trial vs. the ALLOLD07 and ALLOPH07 trials. ECOG score and WBC count had prognostic significance for OS in ALLOPH07 and BURKIMAB08 trials, whereas no prognostic factors were identified in ALLOLD07 protocol. CONCLUSION: Subtype-oriented treatment had an impact in the outcome of older adults with ALL. The poorest outcome was observed in Ph-negative non-Mature B-cell ALL patients, for whom improvements in therapy are clearly needed.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Elderly', 'Risk-adapted therapy']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

By using the transformant, we showed that expression of RIG-G in NB4 cells not only arrested the cells at G1/G0 transition phase and inhibited their proliferation, but also markedly drive the maturation of NB4 cells in the presence of very low concentration of ATRA (10(-9)mol/L). What's more, by detecting the expression of RIG-G in fresh primary bone marrow mononuclear cells of APL patients in different morbid states, we found high RIG-G expression level in complete remission patients, while low level in untreated or relapsed patients.

We investigated the safety and efficacy of discontinuing second-line or subsequent dasatinib after at least 1 year of deep molecular response. METHODS: The Dasatinib Discontinuation trial was a prospective multicentre trial done in Japan. Eligible patients taking dasatinib and with confirmed stable deep molecular response were enrolled between April 1, 2011, and March 31, 2012. All patients received dasatinib consolidation therapy for at least 1 year. In those with sustained deep molecular response, dasatinib was discontinued. Patients were followed up every month in year 1 (clinical cutoff), every 3 months in year 2, and every 6 months in year 3 for deep molecular response and immunological profiles. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with treatment-free remission at 6 months after discontinuation. Molecular relapse was defined as loss of deep molecular response at any assessment. This study is registered, number UMIN000005130. FINDINGS: 88 patients were enrolled in the consolidation phase, 24 were excluded from the discontinuation phase due to fluctuations in BCR-ABL1 transcript levels. One patient was excluded because of positive expression of major and minor BCR-ABL1 transcripts in chronic myeloid leukaemia cells and the detection of minor BCR-ABL1 transcripts during consolidation. Thus, 63 patients discontinued dasatinib treatment. The 25 patients who were excluded from discontinuation continued to receive dasatinib and none showed disease progression. Median follow-up was 20.0 months (IQR 16.5-24.0). Of the 63 patients who discontinued and were not excluded, 30 patients maintained deep molecular response while 33 patients had molecular relapses, all within the first 7 months after discontinuation. The estimated overall treatment-free remission was 49% (95% CI 36-61) at 6 months. No severe treatment-related toxic effects were seen. Treatment was restarted in the 33 patients with relapse; rapid molecular responses were seen in all 33 patients, of whom 29 (88%) regained deep molecular response within 3 months, as did the remaining four by 6 months. INTERPRETATION: Dasatinib discontinuation after sustained deep molecular response for more than 1 year is feasible.

We have previously identified the leukemia stem cell (LSC) in a CALM/AF10-driven murine bone marrow transplant AML model as B220+ lymphoid cells with B-cell characteristics. To identify the target cell for leukemic transformation or 'cell of origin of leukemia' (COL) in non-disturbed steady-state hematopoiesis, we inserted the CALM/AF10 fusion gene preceded by a loxP-flanked transcriptional stop cassette into the Rosa26 locus. Vav-Cre-induced panhematopoietic expression of the CALM/AF10 fusion gene led to acute leukemia with a median latency of 12 months. Mice expressing CALM/AF10 in the B-lymphoid compartment using Mb1-Cre or CD19-Cre inducer lines did not develop leukemia. Leukemias had a predominantly myeloid phenotype but showed coexpression of the B-cell marker B220, and had clonal B-cell receptor rearrangements. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified an average of two to three additional mutations per leukemia, including activating mutations in known oncogenes such as FLT3 and PTPN11. Our results show that the COL for CALM/AF10 leukemia is a stem or early progenitor cell and not a cell of B-cell lineage with a phenotype similar to that of the LSC in CALM/AF10+ leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although antigen selection plays a key role during CLL development, it is not known whether this occurs in early MBL or only during progression to CLL. Recent studies suggested that MBL sometimes displays oligoclonality, but these used techniques with limited sensitivity and specificity and were not conclusive. In this study, we combine cell sorting and next-generation sequencing of rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IgVH) genes to thoroughly assess the VH repertoire and oligoclonality of purified MBL cells. Clonal functional rearrangements or clonotypes were identified in 29 of 30 sequenced cases, with 7 or 24% having two clonotypes with unrelated CDR3 sequences. In four of the seven cases with unrelated clonotypes, VH segments from the same family were used. In addition, 6 of 29 cases showed clear evidence of ongoing VH gene hypermutation with three of these being among the seven with unrelated clonotypes. This study conclusively shows that MBL cases often contain multiple B-cell clones, the first to report ongoing VH gene mutation in MBL, and that antigen selection appears to occur in early MBL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 21.,"Effective treatment regimens for elderly acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients harboring internal tandem duplication mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) gene (FLT3/ITD) are lacking and represent a significant unmet need. Recent data on the effects of FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors on FLT3/ITD(+) AML showed promising clinical activity, including in elderly patients. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors such as decitabine (5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, DEC) and 5-azacitidine (AZA) demonstrated clinical benefit in AML, are well tolerated and are associated with minimal increases in FLT3 ligand, which can represent a potential resistance mechanism to FLT3 inhibitors. In addition, both FLT3 and DNMT inhibition are associated with the induction of terminal differentiation of myeloid blasts. Consequently, there is a strong theoretical rationale for combining FLT3 and DNMT inhibition for FLT3/ITD(+) AML. We therefore sought to study the anti-leukemic effects of DEC, AZA and FLT3 inhibitors, either as single agents or in combination, on AML cell lines and primary cells derived from newly diagnosed and relapsed AML patients. Our studies indicate that combined treatment using FLT3 inhibition and hypomethylation confers synergistic anti-leukemic effects, including apoptosis, growth inhibition and differentiation. The simultaneous administration of AZA and FLT3 inhibition appears to be the most efficacious combination in this regard. These drugs may provide a novel therapeutic approach for FLT3/ITD(+) AML, in particular for older patients.",,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2662-8897'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only in rare cases, blockage may be caused by malignant tumors and even more exceptionally by lymphatic neoplasms so that biopsies are not routinely taken for diagnostic purposes. METHODS: A computerized retrieval system was used for this retrospective study to identify all patients with histologically documented lymphoproliferative infiltration in the lacrimal drainage system from 2001 to 2009. RESULTS: In four of 191 patients (2.1%), infiltration of the nasolacrimal sac mucosa with a small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)/chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) was found. Patients who develop symptoms like epiphora within the course of known CLL are highly suspicious for lymphoproliferative infiltration of the lacrimal drainage associated lymphoid tissue. CONCLUSION: A proactive approach with ophthalmologic consultation and DCR should be followed in these patients to avoid dacryocystitis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 21.,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) frequently involves aberrant expression of TAL1 (T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 1) and LMO2, oncogenic members of the TAL1 transcriptional complex. Transcriptional activity of the TAL1-complex is thought to have a pivotal role in the transformation of thymocytes and is associated with a differentiation block and self-renewal. The transcription factor Forkhead Box P3 (FOXP3) was recently described to be expressed in a variety of malignancies including T-ALL. Here we show that increased FOXP3 levels negatively correlate with expression of genes regulated by the oncogenic TAL1-complex in human T-ALL patient samples as well as a T-ALL cell line ectopically expressing FOXP3. In these cells, FOXP3 expression results in altered regulation of cell cycle progression and reduced cell viability. Finally, we demonstrate that FOXP3 binds LMO2 in vitro, resulting in decreased interaction between LMO2 and TAL1, providing a molecular mechanism for FOXP3-mediated transcriptional modulation in T-ALL. Collectively, our findings provide initial evidence for a novel role of FOXP3 as a tumor suppressor in T-ALL through modulation of TAL1 transcriptional activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Oct 1.,"BACKGROUND: Risk-stratification of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) requires identification of patients with disease that is not cured, despite initial treatment with R-CHOP. The prognostic importance of the revised International Prognostic Index (R-IPI) and cell of origin of the malignant B cell are established in DLBCL. We aimed to develop a novel, easily applicable, tissue-based prognostic biomarker based on quantification of the tumour microenvironment that is independent of and additive to the R-IPI and cell of origin. METHODS: We performed digital hybridisation on the NanoString platform to assess the relation between immune effector and inhibitory (checkpoint) genes in 252 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded DLBCL tissue specimens obtained from patients treated with R-CHOP. We used a tree-based survival model to quantify net antitumoral immunity (using ratios of immune effector to checkpoint genes) and to generate a cutoff as an outcome predictor in 158 of the 252 patients. We validated this model in tissue (n=233) and blood (n=140) samples from two independent cohorts treated with R-CHOP. FINDINGS: T-cell and NK-cell immune effector molecule expression correlated with tumour-associated macrophage and PD-1/PD-L1 axis markers, consistent with malignant B cells triggering a dynamic checkpoint response to adapt to and evade immune surveillance. The ratio of CD4*CD8 to (CD163:CD68[M2])*PD-L1 was better able to stratify overall survival than was any one immune marker or combination, distinguishing groups with disparate 4-year overall survival. 94 (59%) of 158 patients had a score above the cutoff and 4-year overall survival of 92.1% (95% CI 82.9-96.7), and the remaining 64 (41%) patients had a score below the cutoff and 4-year overall survival of 47.0% (32.8-60.5; hazard ratio [HR] 8.3, 95% CI 4.3-17.3; p<0.0001). The CD4*CD8:M2*PD-L1 immune ratio was independent of and added to the R-IPI and cell of origin. Tissue findings in the independent tissue cohort accorded with those in our initial tissue cohort. 139 (60%) of 233 patients had a score above the cutoff and 4-year overall survival of 75.6% (95% CI 64.6-83.6), with the remaining 94 (40%) patients having a score below the cutoff (63.5% [52.5-72.7]; HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.3; p=0.0067). INTERPRETATION: Ratios of immune effectors to checkpoints augment the cell of origin and R-IPI in DLBCL and are applicable to paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens. These findings might have potential implications for selection of patients for checkpoint blockade within clinical trials.

Epub 2015 Sep 18.,"BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukaemia mainly affects elderly people, with a median age at diagnosis of around 70 years. Although about 50-60% of patients enter first complete remission upon intensive induction chemotherapy, relapse remains high and overall outcomes are disappointing. Therefore, effective post-remission therapy is urgently needed. Although often no post-remission therapy is given to elderly patients, it might include chemotherapy or allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following reduced-intensity conditioning. We aimed to assess the comparative value of allogeneic HSCT with other approaches, including no post-remission therapy, in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia aged 60 years and older. METHODS: For this time-dependent analysis, we used the results from four successive prospective HOVON-SAKK acute myeloid leukaemia trials. Between May 3, 2001, and Feb 5, 2010, a total of 1155 patients aged 60 years and older were entered into these trials, of whom 640 obtained a first complete remission after induction chemotherapy and were included in the analysis. Post-remission therapy consisted of allogeneic HSCT following reduced-intensity conditioning (n=97), gemtuzumab ozogamicin (n=110), chemotherapy (n=44), autologous HSCT (n=23), or no further treatment (n=366). Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens consisted of fludarabine combined with 2 Gy of total body irradiation (n=71), fludarabine with busulfan (n=10), or other regimens (n=16). A time-dependent analysis was done, in which allogeneic HSCT was compared with other types of post-remission therapy. The primary endpoint of the study was 5-year overall survival for all treatment groups, analysed by a time-dependent analysis. FINDINGS: 5-year overall survival was 35% (95% CI 25-44) for patients who received an allogeneic HSCT, 21% (17-26) for those who received no additional post-remission therapy, and 26% (19-33) for patients who received either additional chemotherapy or autologous HSCT. Overall survival at 5 years was strongly affected by the European LeukemiaNET acute myeloid leukaemia risk score, with patients in the favourable risk group (n=65) having better 5-year overall survival (56% [95% CI 43-67]) than those with intermediate-risk (n=131; 23% [19-27]) or adverse-risk (n=444; 13% [8-20]) acute myeloid leukaemia. Multivariable analysis with allogeneic HSCT as a time-dependent variable showed that allogeneic HSCT was associated with better 5-year overall survival (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.53-0.95], p=0.017) compared with non-allogeneic HSCT post-remission therapies or no post-remission therapy, especially in patients with intermediate-risk (0.82 [0.58-1.15]) or adverse-risk (0.39 [0.21-0.73]) acute myeloid leukaemia. INTERPRETATION: Collectively, the results from these four trials suggest that allogeneic HSCT might be the preferred treatment approach in patients 60 years of age and older with intermediate-risk and adverse-risk acute myeloid leukaemia in first complete remission, but the comparative value should ideally be shown in a prospective randomised study.

Epub 2015 Oct 1.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia who are thrombocytopenic and unable to receive disease-modifying therapy have few treatment options. Platelet transfusions provide transient benefit and are limited by alloimmunisation. Eltrombopag, an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist, increases platelet counts and has preclinical antileukaemic activity. We aimed to assess the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome, secondary acute myeloid leukaemia after myelodysplastic syndrome, or de-novo acute myeloid leukaemia. METHODS: We did this multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 1/2 trial at 37 centres in ten countries in Europe, east Asia, and the Americas. Patients aged 18 years or older who had relapsed or refractory disease or were ineligible for standard treatments; had platelet counts of less than 30 x 10(9) platelets per L; had 10-50% bone-marrow blasts; or were platelet transfusion dependent were randomly assigned (2:1), via a telephone-based interactive voice-response system (GlaxoSmithKline Registration and Medication Ordering System) with a permuted-block randomisation schedule (block size of three), to receive once-daily eltrombopag or matching placebo dose adjusted from 50 mg to a maximum dose of 300 mg. Randomisation was stratified by presence of poor-prognosis (complex) karyotype (presence of at least three abnormalities, or chromosome 7 abnormalities, vs absence) and bone-marrow blast count (<20% vs >/=20%). Patients and study personnel were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability, including adverse events, non-haematological laboratory grade 3-4 toxic effects, and changes in bone-marrow blast counts from baseline. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00903422. FINDINGS: Between May 14, 2009, and May 9, 2013, we randomly assigned 98 patients to receive either eltrombopag (n=64) or placebo (n=34). 63 (98%) patients in the eltrombopag group and 32 (94%) patients in the placebo group had adverse events. The most common adverse events were pyrexia (27 [42%] vs 11 [32%]), nausea (20 [31%] vs 7 [21%]), diarrhoea (19 [30%] vs 6 [18%]), fatigue (16 [25%] vs 6 [18%]), decreased appetite (15 [23%] vs 5 [15%]), and pneumonia (14 [22%] vs 8 [24%]). Drug-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were reported in six (9%) patients in the eltrombopag group and four (12%) patients in the placebo group. Increases in the proportion of peripheral blasts did not differ significantly between groups. Haemorrhage of grade 3 or higher was reported in ten (16%) patients given eltrombopag and nine (26%) patients given placebo. 21 (33%) patients receiving eltrombopag and 16 (47%) patients receiving placebo died while on treatment. No deaths in patients receiving eltrombopag and two deaths in patients receiving placebo were regarded as treatment related. Post-baseline bone-marrow examinations were done in 40 (63%) patients in the eltrombopag group and 17 (50%) patients in the placebo group. The most common reason for no examination was death before the scheduled 3 month assessment. There were no differences between median bone-marrow blast counts or proportions of peripheral blasts between groups. INTERPRETATION: Eltrombopag doses up to 300 mg daily had an acceptable safety profile in patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia. The role of eltrombopag in these patients warrants further investigation. FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline.",,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2015 Dec 21.,"Nup98 is an important component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and also a rare but recurrent target for chromosomal translocation in leukaemogenesis. Nup98 contains multiple cohesive Gly-Leu-Phe-Gly (GLFG) repeats that are critical notably for the formation of intranuclear GLFG bodies. Previous studies have reported the existence of GLFG bodies in cells overexpressing exogenous Nup98 or in a HeLa subline (HeLa-C) expressing an unusual elevated amount of endogenous Nup98. Here, we have analysed the presence of Nup98-containing bodies in several human cell lines. We found that HEp-2, another HeLa subline, contains GLFG bodies that are distinct from those identified in HeLa-C. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) revealed that HEp-2 cells express additional truncated forms of Nup98 fused to a non-coding region of chromosome 11q22.1. Cytogenetic analyses using FISH and array-CGH further revealed chromosomal rearrangements that were distinct from those observed in leukaemic cells. Indeed, HEp-2 cells feature a massive amplification of juxtaposed NUP98 and 11q22.1 loci on a chromosome marker derived from chromosome 3. Unexpectedly, minor co-amplifications of NUP98 and 11q22.1 loci were also observed in other HeLa sublines, but on rearranged chromosomes 11. Altogether, this study reveals that distinct genomic rearrangements affecting NUP98 are associated with the formation of GLFG bodies in specific HeLa sublines.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Homogeneously staining region', '*Leukaemia', '*Nucleoporin', '*Nup98']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 19.,"Targeting Proviral integration-site of murine Moloney leukemia virus 1 kinase, hereafter called Pim-1 kinase, is a promising strategy for treating different kinds of human cancer. Headed for this a total list of 328 formerly reported Pim-1 kinase inhibitors has been explored and divided based on the pharmacophoric features of the most active molecules into 10 subsets projected to represent potential active binding manners accessible to ligands within the binding pocket of Pim-1 kinase. Discovery Studio 4.1 (DS 4.1) was employed to detect potential pharmacophoric active binding manners anticipated by Pim-1 Kinase inhibitors. The pharmacophoric models were then allowed to compete within Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) framework with other 2D descriptors. Accordingly Genetic algorithm and multiple linear regression investigation were engaged to find the finest QSAR equation that has the best predictive power r262(2) = 0.70, F = 119.14, rLOO(2) = 0.693, rPRESS(2) against 66 external test inhibitors = 0.71 q(2) = 0.55. Three different pharmacophores appeared in the successful QSAR equation this represents three different binding modes for inhibitors within the Pim-1 kinase binding pocket.

Epub 2015 Aug 24.,"BACKGROUND: Cyclophosphamide plus intravenous busulfan has not been compared with cyclophosphamide plus total body irradiation (TBI) in adults with advanced refractory acute myeloid leukaemia before allogeneic haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HCT). We aimed to assess whether survival of patients receiving ablative intravenous busulfan-based conditioning regimens before a related or volunteer-unrelated donor HCT for refractory acute myeloid leukaemia is not inferior to that of patients receiving an ablative TBI-based regimen. METHODS: In this retrospective, multicentre, registry-based study, we obtained data for patients (aged >18 years) with refractory acute myeloid leukaemia in active phase of disease, who had received HCT from an HLA-identical sibling or an unrelated donor after intravenous busulfan plus cyclophosphamide or cyclophosphamide plus TBI conditioning between 2000 and 2012. Data was obtained from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry. The primary endpoints of the study were overall survival and leukaemia-free survival. FINDINGS: We obtained data for 514 patients who had received intravenous busulfan plus cyclophosphamide and 338 patients who had received cyclophosphamide plus TBI. The median percentage of blasts before HCT did not differ significantly between groups (20% [range 5-100; IQR 10-32] in the intravenous busulfan plus cyclophosphamide group vs 16% [5-95; 9-33] in the cyclophosphamide plus TBI group; p=0.16). Overall survival at 2 years did not differ between the groups in the univariate analysis (31.2% [95% CI 26.8-35.5] with intravenous busulfan plus cyclophosphamide vs 33.4% [28.1-38.7] wth cyclophosphamide plus TBI; p=0.65). Leukaemia-free survival at 2 years also did not differ between groups (25.0% [95% CI 21.0-29.0] vs 28.4% [23.4-33.5]; p=0.47). In multivariable analysis adjusting for differences between both groups, no difference was noted between the two groups in terms of overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.99 [95% CI 0.83-1.20]; p=0.95) or leukaemia-free survival (HR 0.97 [0.81-1.16]; p=0.71). Main causes of non-relapse mortality were graft-versus-host disease (49 [10%] in the intravenous busulfan plus cyclophosphamide group vs 25 [7%] in the cyclophosphamide plus TBI group) and infection (36 [7%] vs 18 [5%]). INTERPRETATION: From a practical standpoint, the use of intravenous busulfan plus cyclophosphamide is likely to be a valid and efficient alternative to cyclophosphamide plus TBI conditioning regimen for patients with refractory acute myeloid leukaemia, especially for those transplant centres without access to radiation facilities.

Epub 2015 Aug 20.,"BACKGROUND: Initial treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia traditionally involves tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid) combined with anthracycline-based risk-adapted chemotherapy, with arsenic trioxide being the treatment of choice at relapse. To try to reduce the relapse rate, we combined arsenic trioxide with tretinoin and idarubicin in induction therapy, and used arsenic trioxide with tretinoin as consolidation therapy. METHODS: Patients with previously untreated genetically confirmed acute promyelocytic leukaemia were eligible for this study. Eligibilty also required Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-3, age older than 1 year, normal left ventricular ejection fraction, Q-Tc interval less than 500 ms, absence of serious comorbidity, and written informed consent. Patients with genetic variants of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (fusion of genes other than PML with RARA) were ineligible. Induction comprised 45 mg/m(2) oral tretinoin in four divided doses daily on days 1-36, 6-12 mg/m(2) intravenous idarubicin on days 2, 4, 6, and 8, adjusted for age, and 0.15 mg/kg intravenous arsenic trioxide once daily on days 9-36. Supportive therapy included blood products for protocol-specified haemostatic targets, and 1 mg/kg prednisone daily as prophylaxis against differentiation syndrome. Two consolidation cycles with tretinoin and arsenic trioxide were followed by maintenance therapy with oral tretinoin, 6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate for 2 years. The primary endpoints of the study were freedom from relapse and early death (within 36 days of treatment start) and we assessed improvement compared with the 2 year interim results. To assess durability of remission we compared the primary endpoints and disease-free and overall survival at 5 years in APML4 with the 2 year interim APML4 data and the APML3 treatment protocol that excluded arsenic trioxide. This study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12605000070639. FINDINGS: 124 patients were enrolled between Nov 10, 2004, and Sept 23, 2009, with data cutoff of March 15, 2012. Four (3%) patients died early. After a median follow-up of 4.2 years (IQR, 3.2-5.2), the 5 year freedom from relapse was 95% (95% CI 89-98), disease-free survival was 95% (89-98), event-free survival was 90% (83-94), and overall survival was 94% (89-97). The comparison with APML3 data showed that hazard ratios were 0.23 (95% CI 0.08-0.64, p=0.002) for freedom from relapse, 0.21 (0.07-0.59, p=0.001) for disease-free survival, 0.34 (0.16-0.69, p=0.002) for event-free survival, and 0.35 (0.14-0.91, p=0.02) for overall survival. INTERPRETATION: Incorporation of arsenic trioxide in initial therapy induction and consolidation for acute promyelocytic leukaemia reduced the risk of relapse when compared with historical controls. This improvement, together with a non-significant reduction in early deaths and absence of deaths in remission, translated into better event-free and overall survival.

Epub 2015 Nov 27.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is a potential curative treatment option for various malignant and nonmalignant hematologic disorders. Patients undergoing an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant are prescribed immune-suppressant therapies to facilitate hematopoietic donor-cell engraftment and prevent graft-versus-host disease. Drug-drug interactions may occur, owing to exposure to complex multidrug regimens with narrow therapeutic windows and high toxicity profiles. Here, we describe a unique case of a 65-year-old man with poor-risk acute myeloid leukemia who underwent a matched-sibling hematopoietic cell allograft. Sirolimus and tacrolimus were used for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. He developed oral thrush requiring treatment with clotrimazole troches, which subsequently resulted in serious renal toxicity attributed to supratherapeutic levels of sirolimus and tacrolimus. Patient renal function improved after temporarily holding both immune suppressants, and administering phenytoin to help induce sirolimus and tacrolimus metabolism.

Although the RGC-5 cell line was initially thought to be of retinal ganglion cell origin, recent evidence suggests that the RGC-5 line could have been the result of contamination with 661W mouse cone photoreceptor cells. This raised the possibility that a cone photoreceptor cell line could be multipotent and could be differentiated to a neuronal phenotype. METHODS: 661W and RGC-5 cells, non-neuronal retinal astrocytes, retinal endothelial cells, retinal pericytes, M21 melanoma cells, K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, and Daudi Burkitt lymphoma cells, were differentiated with staurosporine. The resulting morphology was quantitated using NeuronJ with respect to neurite counts and topology. RESULTS: Treatment with staurosporine induced similar-appearing morphological differentiation in both 661W and RGC-5 cells. The following measures were not significantly different between 661W and RGC-5 cells: number of neurites per cell, total neurite field length, number of neurite branch points, and cell viability. Neuronal-like differentiation was not observed in the other cell lines tested. CONCLUSIONS: 661W and RGC-5 cells have virtually identical and distinctive morphology when differentiated with low concentrations of staurosporine. This result demonstrates that a retinal neuronal precursor cell with cone photoreceptor lineage can be differentiated to express a neuronal morphology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differential evolution (DE) is a powerful optimization algorithm, which has been widely used in many areas. However, the standard DE and most of its variants search in the continuous space, which cannot solve the binary optimizations directly. In this paper, the hybrid framework based on the binary DE algorithm and silhouette filter, is proposed to improve searching ability to classify breast and leukemia cancers in microarray for biomarker discovery. The study is focused to use hybrid DE algorithm for gene selection and silhouette statistics as a discriminant function to classify multiple tumor types in microarray data. Distance metrics on silhouette statistics have also been discussed for high classification accuracy. Experimental results show that the hybrid method is effective to discriminate breast and leukemia cancer subtypes and find potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis.",['NOTNLM'],"['Gene selection', 'cancer classification', 'hybrid differential evolution', 'silhouette statistics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 19.,"Our aim was to identify miRNAs that can predict risk of relapse in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Following high-throughput miRNA expression analysis (48 samples), five miRs were selected for further confirmation performed by real time quantitative PCR on a cohort of precursor B-cell ALL patients (n = 138). The results were correlated with clinical parameters and outcome. Low expression of miR-151-5p, and miR-451, and high expression of miR-1290 or a combination of all three predicted inferior relapse free survival (P = 0.007, 0.042, 0.025, and <0.0001, respectively). Cox regression analysis identified aberrant expression of the three miRs as an independent prognostic marker with a 10.5-fold increased risk of relapse (P = 0.041) in PCR-MRD non-high risk patients. Furthermore, following exclusion of patients harboring IKZF1 deletion, the aberrant expression of all three miRs could identify patients with a 24.5-fold increased risk to relapse (P < 0.0001). The prognostic relevance of the three miRNAs was evaluated in a non-BFM treated precursor B-cell ALL cohort (n = 33). A significant correlation between an aberrant expression of at least one of the three miRs and poor outcome was maintained (P < 0.0001). Our results identify an expression profile of miR-151-5p, miR-451, and miR-1290 as a novel biomarker for outcome in pediatric precursor B-cell ALL patients, regardless of treatment protocol. The use of these markers may lead to improved risk stratification at diagnosis and allow early therapeutic interventions in an attempt to improve survival of high risk patients.",,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At face value, this would appear to indicate that this multiprotein complex is a potent tumour suppressor. However, it has recently emerged that some mutations in the SWI/SNF complex can have a gain-of-function effect and that in other tumours, such as pancreatic cancer, leukaemia, and breast cancer, the wild-type complex is used to drive cancer. Thus, paradoxically, this ""tumour suppressor"" has become an attractive target for developing anticancer agents.

Epub 2016 Jan 8.,"Prediagnostic serum/plasma concentrations of B-cell activation markers have been associated with future risk of B-cell lymphomas (BCL) in HIV-infected patients and in the general population. Current evidence for the general population is however limited and relies on relatively small numbers of observations, especially for specific histologies. We carried out a nested case-control study, including 218 BCL and 218 matched controls, within two prospective cohorts, to investigate the association between plasma levels of soluble (s)CD27 and sCD30 and future risk of BCL, and main histologic subtypes separately. To expand the evidence further, we performed meta-analyses of the published data on these associations from prospective studies among the general population. Our study revealed a significant relationship between sCD30 concentration and BCL risk (OR = 0.86, 1.53, 1.76, for the 2nd-4th quartiles respectively, p trend = 0.01). Similar increased risks were observed for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Analyses of sCD27 blood concentrations did not show significant associations with BCL, (OR = 0.90, 1.26, 1.65 for the 2nd-4th quartiles, respectively, p trend = 0.17), but significant associations were observed for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and for the group of ""other BCL"" subtypes. Our findings involving sCD30 were confirmed within our meta-analyses of five prospective cohorts, while results were more heterogeneous for sCD27 with the exception of CLL which was found consistently in all studies. Data to date suggest that chronic B-cell stimulation might be an important mechanism involved in B-cell lymphomagenesis both in HIV-infected and in the general population.",['NOTNLM'],"['lymphoma', 'meta-analyses', 'prospective study', 'sCD27', 'sCD30']",['(c) 2015 UICC.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, more than one tenth of myeloma patients still die shortly after diagnosis. We therefore aim to investigate the risk factors of early mortality (death within 60 days after diagnosis) in patients with MM. We included in this study 451 consecutive patients with MM, newly diagnosed at an Asian tertiary medical center between January 1, 2002 and April 30, 2015. A total of 57 subjects who experienced early mortality were identified. Risk factors for early mortality in myeloma patients were collected and analyzed. Early mortality occurred in 57 (12.6%) of the myeloma patients. In the multivariate analysis, being male (adjusted OR 2.93, 95% CI 1.17-7.31), serum albumin < 3.5 g/dL (adjusted OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.09-6.74), primary plasma cell leukemia (adjusted OR 17.61, 95% CI 1.01-306.05), serum albumin (adjusted OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.15-6.38), corrected serum calcium >/= 12 mg/dL (adjusted OR 2.94, 95% CI 1.21-7.14), and LDH >/= 250 U/L (adjusted OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.50-6.27) were identified as independent risk factors of early mortality. Pneumonia with other infections contributed most to early mortality (n = 36, 65%), followed by renal failure and cardiac failure. The early mortality rate is high (12.6%) in patients with MM. Patients who are male and those with primary plasma cell leukemia, low serum albumin, high-corrected serum calcium, or LDH are at risk of early mortality. Nearly two thirds of the myeloma patients who experienced early mortality in our study (37 of 57, 65%) died of infection. Once a high-risk group is identified, much effort is required to target new approaches for prevention, early detection, and treatment of infections.",,,,,,,['The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.'],"['Medicine (Baltimore). 2016 Feb;95(6):e762a', 'Medicine (Baltimore). 2016 Feb 12;95(6):e762a.

Impaired T lymphocyte function occurs early in HIV-1 infection but opportunistic infections (OIs) rarely occur in the absence of CD4 lymphopenia. In the unusual case where a HIV-1 infected individual with a high CD4 count presents with recurrent OIs, a clinician is faced with the possibility of a second underlying comorbidity. We present a case of pseudo-adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) in HIV-1/HTLV-1 coinfection where the individual fulfilled Shimoyama criteria for chronic ATLL and had pulmonary Mycobacterium kansasii, despite a high CD4 lymphocyte count. However, there was no evidence of clonal T-cell proliferation by T-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies nor of monoclonal HTLV-1 integration by high-throughput sequencing. Mutually beneficial interplay between HIV-1 and HTLV-1, maintaining high level HIV-1 and HTLV-1 viremia and proliferation of poorly functional CD4 cells despite chronicity of infection is a postulated mechanism. Despite good microbiological response to antimycobacterial therapy, the patient remained systemically unwell with refractory anemia. Subsequent initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy led to paradoxical resolution of CD4 T lymphocytosis as well as HIV-1 viral suppression and decreased HTLV-1 proviral load. This is proposed to be the result of attenuation of immune activation post-HIV virological control. This case illustrates the importance of screening for HTLV-1 in HIV-1 patients with appropriate clinical presentation and epidemiological risk factors and explores mechanisms for the complex interactions on HIV-1/HTLV-1 adaptive immunity.",,,,,,,['The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.'],,,,,,,,,,

SUMMARY: Blinatumomab is a novel, bispecific, T-cell engaging antibody that targets tumor-associated antigens CD19 and CD3. Blinatumomab was approved through an accelerated pathway for the treatment of Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). One Phase II trial found 16 of 21 patients to be negative for minimal residual disease (MRD) after one cycle of treatment, resulting in a response rate of 80%. Another Phase II trial showed an 82% MRD response, even in heavily pretreated patients. The most common adverse events of any grade noted were pyrexia, febrile neutropenia, hypokalemia, and anemia. The most frequently occurring grade 3 or 4 adverse events were febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, and anemia. Cycle 1 is dosed as a 9- mug/ day continuous i.v. infusion on days 1-7 and a 28-mug/day continuous i.v. infusion on days 8-28 administered as a four-week continuous i.v. infusion, followed by at least two weeks of no treatment. Subsequent cycles are dosed as a 28-mug/day continuous i.v. infusion on days 1-28, followed by at least two weeks of no treatment, for up to five treatment cycles. CONCLUSION: Blinatumomab is approved as an option for Ph chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL and is a needed addition to the limited treatment options for this difficult-to-treat patient population. Two Phase II clinical trials resulted in impressive results when using blinatumomab as a single agent, resulting in the drug's approval.",,,"['Copyright (c) 2016 by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Inc.

Nonetheless, 5-year event-free survival for the TYA cohort (aged 16-24 years) was 72.3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 66.2-78.4] overall and 92.6% (95% CI: 85.5-99.7) for MRD low risk patients. The risk of serious adverse events was higher in patients aged >/=10 years compared to those aged 9 or younger (P < 0.0001) and novel age-specific patterns of treatment-related toxicity were observed. TYA patients obtain excellent outcomes with a risk- and response-adapted paediatric chemotherapy protocol. Whilst those aged 10 years and older have excess toxicity compared with younger patients, the age association is specific to individual toxicities.",['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'chemotherapy', 'efficacy', 'teenage and young adult', 'toxicity']",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 18.,"Emergency granulopoiesis occurs in response to infectious or inflammatory challenge and is a component of the innate immune response. Some molecular events involved in initiating emergency granulopoiesis are known, but termination of this process is less well defined. In this study, we found that the interferon consensus sequence binding protein (Icsbp/Irf8) was required to terminate emergency granulopoiesis. Icsbp is an interferon regulatory transcription factor with leukemia suppressor activity. Expression of Icsbp is decreased in chronic myeloid leukemia, and Icsbp(-/-) mice exhibit progressive granulocytosis with evolution to blast crisis, similar to the course of human chronic myeloid leukemia. In this study, we found aberrantly sustained granulocyte production in Icsbp(-/-) mice after stimulation of an emergency granulopoiesis response. Icsbp represses transcription of the genes encoding Fas-associated phosphatase 1 (Fap1) and growth arrest-specific 2 (Gas2) and activates genes encoding Fanconi C and F. After stimulation of emergency granulopoiesis, we found increased and sustained expression of Fap1 and Gas2 in bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells from Icsbp(-/-) mice in comparison with the wild type. This was associated with resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis and increased beta-catenin activity in these cells. We also found that repeated episodes of emergency granulopoiesis accelerated progression to acute myeloid leukemia in Icsbp(-/-) mice. This was associated with impaired Fanconi C and F expression and increased sensitivity to DNA damage in bone marrow myeloid progenitors. Our results suggest that impaired Icsbp expression enhances leukemogenesis by deregulating processes that normally limit granulocyte expansion during the innate immune response.",['NOTNLM'],"['CD95 (APO-1/Fas)', 'calpain', 'gene expression', 'hematopoiesis', 'innate immunity']","['(c) 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), oral nutrition is often hampered and hence total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is necessary. We therefore investigated the course of weight during stem cell transplantation and the clinical consequences of weight change. METHODS: 180 consecutive patients who received allogeneic SCT between January 2010 and December 2011 at our center were analyzed for weight loss, laboratory and clinical parameters. RESULTS: During SCT, a median decrease of 6.6% of body mass index (BMI) was observed for the whole population (from 25.3 at admission to 23.6 at discharge), and a 1.6fold increase of malnutrition despite use of TPN (28.3% to 45.0%). 55.6% of patients experienced a significant weight loss of >/=5% with a median decrease of 9.2% in BMI. Serum levels of albumin, total protein and cholesterol rapidly decreased during conditioning therapy. After a median of 2.4 years, the median BMI was still only 23.4 (not different from discharge). However, we did not observe a meaningful difference in side effects and survival between patients that did or did not lose weight. CONCLUSION: Weight loss is commonly observed during allogeneic SCT despite TPN, but the clinical consequences thereof seem limited: we observed no significant impact on patients with a decrease >/= 5% in BMI on transplant outcome, side effects or survival.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore BCR/ABL fusion proteins (BCR/ABL-OOF) are characterized by an in-frame BCR portion followed by an amino acids sequence arising from the out of frame (OOF) reading of the ABL gene. The product of this new transcript contains the characteristic BCR domains while lacking the COOH-terminal Rho GTPase GAP domain. The present work aims to characterize the protein functionality in terms of cytoskeleton (re-)modelling, adhesion and activation of canonical oncogenic signalling pathways. Here, we show that BCR/ABL-OOF has a peculiar endosomal localization which affects EGF receptor activation and turnover. Moreover, we demonstrate that BCR/ABL-OOF expression leads to aberrant cellular adhesion due to the activation of Rac GTPase, increase in cellular proliferation, migration and survival. When overexpressed in a BCR/ABL positive cell line, BCR/ABL-OOF induces hyperactivation of Rac signaling axis offering a therapeutic window for Rac-targeted therapy. Our data support a critical role of BCR/ABL-OOF in leukemogenesis and identify a subset of patients that may benefit from Rac-targeted therapies.",['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Rac GTPase', 'alternative splicing']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 17.,"Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is an aggressive T-cell malignancy caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1. Because of its immunosuppressive property and resistance to treatment, patients with ATL have poor prognoses. ATL cells possess the regulatory T cell (Treg) phenotype, such as CD4 and CD25, and usually express forkhead box P3 (FOXP3). However, the mechanisms of FOXP3 expression and its association with Treg-like characteristics in ATL remain unclear. Selective demethylation of the Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR) in the FOXP3 gene leads to stable FOXP3 expression and defines natural Tregs. Here, we focus on the functional and clinical relationship between the epigenetic pattern of the TSDR and ATL. Analysis of DNA methylation in specimens from 26 patients with ATL showed that 15 patients (58%) hypomethylated the TSDR. The FOXP3(+) cells were mainly observed in the TSDR-hypomethylated cases. The TSDR-hypomethylated ATL cells exerted more suppressive function than the TSDR-methylated ATL cells. Thus, the epigenetic analysis of the FOXP3 gene identified a distinct subtype with Treg properties in heterogeneous ATL. Furthermore, we observed that the hypomethylation of TSDR was associated with poor outcomes in ATL. These results suggest that the DNA methylation status of the TSDR is an important hallmark to define this heterogeneous disease and to predict ATL patient prognosis.",,,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aggressive cytotoxic therapies are often poorly tolerated in this patient population. Obinutuzumab is a glycoengineered type II anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody indicated in combination with chlorambucil for previously untreated CLL. The approval of this drug was based on the pivotal CLL11 trial, which demonstrated longer progression-free survival vs. rituximab/chlorambucil and chlorambucil alone in patients with significant co-existing medical conditions and/or poor renal function. However, a higher risk of infusion-related reactions (IRRs) was demonstrated with obinutuzumab-based therapy. We highlight important nursing care considerations to help prevent and successfully manage IRRs and other important adverse events, to improve the treatment experience of patients receiving obinutuzumab infusions and to enable them to complete their treatment and receive optimal benefit.

Epub 2015 Dec 8.,"Osteoblasts are emerging regulators of myeloid malignancies since genetic alterations in them, such as constitutive activation of beta-catenin, instigate their appearance. The LDL receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5), initially proposed to be a co-receptor for Wnt proteins, in fact favors bone formation by suppressing gut-serotonin synthesis. This function of Lrp5 occurring in the gut is independent of beta-catenin activation in osteoblasts. However, it is unknown whether Lrp5 can act directly in osteoblast to influence other functions that require beta-catenin signaling, particularly, the deregulation of hematopoiesis and leukemogenic properties of beta-catenin activation in osteoblasts, that lead to development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using mice with gain-of-function (GOF) Lrp5 alleles (Lrp5(A214V)) that recapitulate the human high bone mass (HBM) phenotype, as well as patients with the T253I HBM Lrp5 mutation, we show here that Lrp5 GOF mutations in both humans and mice do not activate beta-catenin signaling in osteoblasts. Consistent with a lack of beta-catenin activation in their osteoblasts, Lrp5(A214V) mice have normal trilinear hematopoiesis. In contrast to leukemic mice with constitutive activation of beta-catenin in osteoblasts (Ctnnb1(CAosb)), accumulation of early myeloid progenitors, a characteristic of AML, myeloid-blasts in blood, and segmented neutrophils or dysplastic megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, are not observed in Lrp5(A214V) mice. Likewise, peripheral blood count analysis in HBM patients showed normal hematopoiesis, normal percentage of myeloid cells, and lack of anemia. We conclude that Lrp5 GOF mutations do not activate beta-catenin signaling in osteoblasts. As a result, myeloid lineage differentiation is normal in HBM patients and mice.

Epub 2015 Nov 24.,"Naphtho[1',2':4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-5,6-diones (NPDOs), a new type of N-heterocycle-fused o-quinones, have been synthesized. They have been found to be efficient electron-accepting substrates of NADPH-dependent single-electron-transferring P-450R and two-electron transferring NQO1, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a concomitant decrease in NADPH, which is consistent with redox-cycling. The reactivity of NPDOs toward P-450R (in terms of kcat/Km) varied in the range of 10(6)-10(7)M(-1)s(-1), while their reduction by NQO1 proceeded much faster, approaching the diffusion control limit (kcat/Km approximately 10(8)-10(9)M(-1)s(-1)). NPDOs exhibited relatively high cytotoxic activity against human lung carcinoma (A-549) and breast tumor (MCF-7) cell lines (LC50=0.1-8.3muM), while promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) were less sensitive to NPDOs (LC5010muM). 3-Nitro-substituted NPDO (11) revealed the highest potency against both A-549 and MCF-7 cell lines, with LC50 of 0.12+/-0.03muM and 0.28+/-0.08muM, respectively. Dicoumarol partly suppressed the activity of the compounds against A-594 and MCF-7 cell lines, suggesting that their cytotoxic action might be partially influenced by NQO1-mediated bioreductive activation.",['NOTNLM'],"['Antibacterial activity', 'Antitumor activity', 'Bioreductive activation', 'Cytochrome P-450 reductase (P-450R)', 'DFT calculation', 'Enzymatic reactivity', 'Quinone reductase (NQO1)', 'Quinones']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, their clinical use is limited by the inability to expand these cells ex vivo. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify specific targets and effective probes that can expand HSCs. Here we report a novel class of INK4C (p18(INK4C) or p18) small molecule inhibitors (p18SMIs), which were initially found by in silico 3D screening. We identified a lead p18 inhibitor, XIE18-6, confirmed its p18-targeting specificity and bioactivity of promoting HSCs expansion, and then performed structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies by synthesizing a series of analogs of XIE18-6. Among these, compound 40 showed the most potent bioactivity in HSCs expansion (ED50 = 5.21 nM). We confirmed that compound 40 promoted expansion of both murine and human HSCs, and also confirmed its p18-targeting specificity. Notably, compound 40 did not show significant cytotoxicity toward 32D cells or HSCs, nor did it augment leukemia cell proliferation. Taken together, our newly discovered p18SMIs represent novel chemical agents for murine and human HSCs ex vivo expansion and also can be used as valuable chemical probes for further HSC biology research towards promising utility for therapeutic purposes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: HL-60 cells were treated with As2O3 to investigate apoptosis through signaling of caspase cascades and mitochondrial dysfunction. RESULTS: As2O3 (>0.5 uM) decreased the viability of HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner, which was revealed as apoptosis shown chromatin condensation and ladder pattern DNA fragmentation. As2O3 increased the catalytic activity of caspase family cysteine proteases including caspase-3 and -9 proteases. Consistently, PARP, an intracellular biosubstrate of caspase-3 protease, was cleaved from 116 kDa to 85 kDa fragments. It also induced the change of mitochondrial membrane potential.

In this study we attempted to establish the overall survival rate of major childhood cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The primary source of data of childhood cancer under 15 years of age were the registry files of the Central Cancer Registry Report (Ministry of Health & Welfare) from 1993 to 1997. The above data was compared to death case data files of the same period obtained from the Korea National Statistical Office using the personal identification code. We calculated the 1, 3, and 5 year survival rates using the life table of SPSS and Kaplan-Meier method and compared the survival rate of disease according to prognostic factors. RESULTS: A total of 6,720 cases of pediatric cancer from the Central Cancer Registry files were computerized and sorted by personal identification (ID) code to extract duplicated cases as well as cases with incomplete data. The final number of cases entered in this study was 4,983. 1) The number of confirmed death cases was 1,448 (29.1%). 2) The disease distribution showed that the most common pediatric cancer was leukemia (1,468/4,983, 29%), followed by brain tumors (503/4,983, 10%), lymphoma (315/4,983, 6%), Wilms tumor (165/4,983, 3%), etc. in order by number of patients. 3) The 5 year survival rate of disease was as follows: overall 62%, acute lymphocytic leukemia 61%, acute non-lymphocytic leukemia 32%, malignant lymphoma 72%, neuroblastoma 47%, medulloblastoma 51%, Astrocytoma 66%, Wilms tumor 83%, etc. CONCLUSION: We analyzed and report the 5 year survival rate of overall childhood cancer and of each of the twelve major childhood cancers from in Korea 1993 to 1997 to provide basic data on childhood cancer statistics.",['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood neoplasm', 'Survival rate']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Jan 5.,"Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection is an important health issue that affects a variety of endemic areas. The Khorasan province, mainly its capital Mashhad in northeastern Iran, was reported to be as one of these endemic regions. Torbat-e Heydarieh, a large city Southwest border to Mashhad with a segregated population was investigated for the prevalence and associated risk factors of HTLV-1 infection in 400 randomly selected individuals. Blood samples were tested for the presence of HTLV-1 antibodies via the ELISA method and then were confirmed by an Immunoblot test. For the presence of HTLV-1 in lymphocytes of infected subjects, PCR was performed on LTR and TAX regions. DNA sequencing of LTR fragment was also carried out to determine the phylogenetic of HTLV-1, using the Maximum likelihood method. HTLV-1 sero-reactivity (sero-prevalence) among the study population was 2% (8/400), of which 1.25% had HTLV-1 provirus in lymphocytes (actual prevalence). HTLV-1 infection was significantly associated with the age, marital status, and history of blood transfusion (P < 0.05). However, there were no statistical differences between HTLV-1 infection, and gender, surgery, and hospitalization. In regression analysis, age showed the most significant correlation with the infection (P = 0.006, OR = 4.33). Based on our phylogenetic study, the HTLV-1 prevalent sequence type of Torbat-e Heydarieh belongs to the cosmopolitan subtype A. HTLV-1 prevalence in Torbat-e Heydarieh (1.25%) is low comparing to those of both Mashhad (2-3%) and Neishabour (3.5-5%) in the province of Khorasan. Thus, traveling mobility and population mixing such as marriage, bureaucratic affairs, occupation, and economic activities could be the usual routs of HTLV-1 new wave of spreading in this segregated city.",['NOTNLM'],"['Iran', 'epidemiology', 'human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)', 'human T-cell leukemia virus type 2 (HTLV-2)']","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Jan 14.,"Malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) is a rare aggressive pediatric cancer characterized by inactivation of SNF5, a core subunit of SWI/SNF complexes. Previously, we showed that SNF5 contributes to transcriptional activation of NOXA, a pro-apoptotic protein that binds and inhibits the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1. In this study, we found that NOXA expression was downregulated in MRT cell lines as well as in clinical MRT samples and that ectopically expressed NOXA bound MCL-1 and increased the sensitivity of MRT cell lines to doxorubicin (DOX) by promoting apoptosis. Consistent with this finding, knockdown of MCL-1 in MRT cell lines induced apoptosis and increased DOX sensitivity in MRT cells, and the MCL-1 inhibitor TW-37 synergized with DOX to induce MRT cell death. Our results suggest that modulation of the NOXA/MCL-1 pathway may be a potential strategy for the treatment of patients with MRT. J. Cell. Physiol. 231: 1932-1940, 2016.

METHODS: We conducted a decision analysis to address which transplantation procedure should be prioritized for younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) harboring high- or intermediate-risk cytogenetics in first complete remission (CR1), when they lack a matched related donor but have immediate access to a suitable umbilical cord blood unit. Main sources for our analysis comprised the data from three phase III trials for a chemotherapy cohort (n = 907) and the registry data for a transplantation cohort (n = 752). RESULTS: The baseline analysis showed that when the 8/8 match was considered for UBMT, the expected 5-year survival rate was higher for UBMT than for UCBT (58.1% vs. 51.8%). This ranking did not change even when the 7/8 match was considered for UBMT. Sensitivity analysis showed consistent superiority of UBMT over UCBT when the time elapsed between CR1 and UBMT was varied within a plausible range of 3-9 months. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that 8/8 or 7/8 UBMT is a better transplantation option than UCBT even after allowing time required for donor coordination.",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'decision analysis', 'first complete remission', 'umbilical cord blood transplantation', 'unrelated bone marrow transplantation']",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

CLL is a B cell clonal disorder characterized by the accumulation of mature monoclonal CD5(+) B cells. Although CLL could be considered to be a proliferative disease, most circulating CLL B cells are arrested in the G0 phase of the cell cycle and present both defects in calcium (Ca(2+)) homeostasis and signaling. The Ca(2+) response to antigen ligation is heterogeneous and related, in part, to defects arising from the incapacity to respond to B cell receptor (BCR) engagement (anergy), to the expression of T cell kinases (e.g. Zap70), and to the presence of negative feedback regulation by phosphatases (e.g. SHP-1). Anergic CD5(+) CLL B cells are characterized by an elevated basal Ca(2+) level, IgM/CD79 downregulation, a constitutive activation of BCR pathway kinases, and an activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT). Based on the Ca(2+) response, patients are classified into three groups: unresponders, responders with apoptosis, and responders with entry in the cell cycle. Moreover, internal and direct interaction between leukemic BCR-HCDR3 epitopes at the plasma membrane and interaction between Bcl-2 and the IP3-receptor at the endoplasmic reticulum are also suspected to interfere with the intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis in CLL-B cells. As a whole, the Ca(2+) pathway is emerging to play a key role in malignant CLL-B survival, disease progression, and last but not least, in the therapeutic response.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 8.,"CIAPIN1 (cytokine-induced apoptosis inhibitor 1) was recently identified as an essential downstream effector of the Ras signaling pathway. However, its potential role in regulating myeloid leukemia cells sensitivity to Imatinib remains unclear. In this study, we found depletion of CIAPIN1 inhibited proliferation and triggered more apoptosis of K562CML (chronic myeloid leukemia) cells with or without Imatinib treatment. Meanwhile, CIAPIN1 depletion decreased ERK5 phosphorylation and NF-kappaB activity. Importantly, treating CIAPIN1-depleted K562 cells with ERK5 signaling pathway specific inhibitor, XMD8-92, further inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis with or without Imatinib treatment. Treatment with the NF-kappaB specific inhibitor, Bay 11-7082, induced nearly the same inhibition of proliferation and promotion of apoptosis conferred by CIAPIN1 depletion as was observed with XMD8-92 treatment. Further, XMD8-92 and Bay 11-7082 synergistically inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of CIAPIN1-depleted K562 cells with or without Imatinib treatment. The nude mice transplantation model was also performed to confirm the enhanced sensitivity of CIAPIN1-depleted K562 cells to Imatinib. Thus, our results provided a potential management by which CIAPIN1 knock-down might have a crucial impact on enhancing sensitivity of K562 cells to Imatinib in the therapeutic approaches, indicating that CIAPIN1 knock-down might serve as a combination with chemotherapeutical agents in leukemia diseases therapy.",['NOTNLM'],"['CIAPIN1', 'ERK5', 'Imatinib', 'K562 cells', 'NF-kappaB']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The adoption of pediatric-derived, intensive lymphoblastic leukemia-like protocols led to significantly improved results, with survival rates of about 70% and 90% in adults and children, respectively. Adequate central nervous system prophylaxis and mediastinal irradiation contributed to the therapeutic success; however, the role of radiation therapy is debated due to toxicity concerns and the excellent results obtained with radiation-free programs especially in pediatric patients. With these modern schedules, localized radiotherapy and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplants could be generally omitted, and considered only for high-risk patients identified through postinduction computed tomography/positron-emission tomography scans, minimal residual disease analysis, and new genetics and genomics. New clinical studies will have to confirm the value of these assays for risk-oriented therapy, while further therapeutic progress is expected from the introduction of new drugs and targeting agents.",['NOTNLM'],"['biology', 'diagnosis', 'lymphoblastic lymphoma', 'risk factors', 'treatment']",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Recent evidence indicates that HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha could have overlapping, unique and even sometimes opposing activities in both normal physiology and disease. Despite an increase in our understanding of the different pathways regulated by HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha, the role played by each factor in HSC maintenance and leukemogenesis is still controversial. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes our current understanding of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha activities and discusses the implications and challenges of using HIF inhibitors therapeutically in blood malignancies. EXPERT OPINION: As HIF inhibitors are currently under clinical evaluation in different cancers, including hematological malignancies, a more thorough understanding of the unique roles performed by HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha in human neoplasia is warranted.",['NOTNLM'],"['HIFs', 'Hypoxia', 'Leukemia', 'Stem cell']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FINDINGS: Parents' and siblings' PTG levels were similar to survivors' PTG levels; however, parents reported higher PTG than siblings. Parents who used less avoidant coping, were younger, and had higher life satisfaction experienced less psychological distress. Parents whose survivor children used more active coping reported less psychological distress. Siblings who were older used more active coping, and the longer it had been since their brother or sister was diagnosed, the less avoidant coping they used. .

Epub 2015 Dec 17.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a group of heterogeneous hematopoietic malignancies sustained by leukemic stem cells (LSCs) that can resist treatment. Previously, we found that low expression of Hes1 was a poor prognostic factor for AML. However, the activation status of Hes1 and its regulation in LSCs and leukemic progenitors (LPs) as well as normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in Hes1-low AML patients have not been elucidated. In this study, the expression of Hes1 in LSCs and LPs was analyzed in adult CD34(+) Hes1-low AML with normal karyotype and the upstream microRNA (miRNA) regulators were screened. Our results showed that the level of either Hes1 or p21 was lower in LSCs or LPs than in HSCs whereas the level of miR-9 was highest in LPs and lowest in HSCs. An inverse correlation was observed in the expression of Hes1 and miR-9. Furthermore, we validated miR-9 as one of the regulators of Hes1 by reporter gene analysis. Knockdown of miR-9 by lentivirus infection suppressed the proliferation of AML cells by the induction of G0 arrest and apoptosis in vitro. Moreover, knockdown of miR-9 resulted in decreased circulating leukemic cell counts in peripheral blood and bone marrow, attenuated splenomegaly, and prolonged survival in a xenotransplant mouse model. Our results indicate that the miR-9 plays an important role in supporting AML cell growth and survival by downregulation of Hes1 and that miR-9 has potential as a therapeutic target for treating AML.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hes1', 'Leukemic progenitors', 'Leukemic stem cells', 'MicroRNA-9']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many studies suggest that SATB1 overexpression is an indicator of poor prognosis in various cancers, such as breast cancer, malignant cutaneous melanoma, and liver cancer. However, their expression patterns and function values for adult T cell leukemia (ATL) are still largely unknown. The aim of this study is to examine the levels of SATB1 in ATL and to explore its function and mechanisms in Jurkat cell line. Here, we reported that SATB1 expressions were decreased in ATL cells (p < 0.001) compared with normal controls. Knockdown of SATB1 expression significantly enhanced invasion of Jurkat cell in vitro. Furthermore, knockdown of SATB1 gene enhances beta-catenin nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity and thus may increase the invasiveness of Jurkat cell through the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in vitro.",['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'Invasion', 'SATB1', 'beta-Catenin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms by which MLL5 protein stability is regulated have remained unclear to date. Here, we showed that MLL5 protein stability is cooperatively regulated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7). Depletion of OGT in cells led to a decrease in the MLL5 protein level through ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent proteolytic degradation, whereas ectopic expression of OGT protein suppressed MLL5 ubiquitylation. We further identified deubiquitinase USP7 as a novel MLL5-associated protein using mass spectrometry. USP7 stabilized the MLL5 protein through direct binding and deubiquitylation. Loss of USP7 induced degradation of MLL5 protein. Conversely, overexpression of USP7, but not a catalytically inactive USP7 mutant, led to decreased ubiquitylation and increased MLL5 stability. Co-immunoprecipitation and co-immunostaining assays revealed that MLL5, OGT and USP7 interact with each other to form a stable ternary complex that is predominantly located in the nucleus. In addition, upregulation of MLL5 expression was correlated with increased expression of OGT and USP7 in human primary cervical adenocarcinomas. Our results collectively reveal a novel molecular mechanism underlying regulation of MLL5 protein stability and provide new insights into the functional interplay among O-GlcNAc transferase, deubiquitinase and histone methyltransferase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied 58 SM patients to define CD123 expression patterns by immunohistochemistry and its clinical significance. Two hematopathologists independently scored bone marrow slides using predefined histologic parameters. In all, 23 patients had indolent SM (ISM), 10 aggressive SM (ASM), 23 SM with associated hematological neoplasm (SM-AHN) and 2 had mast cell leukemia (MCL). MC_CD123 expression was demonstrable in 37 (64%) cases; expression rates were 100%, 61%, 57% and 0% in ASM, ISM, SM-AHN and MCL, respectively (P=0.02). Focal proliferation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) around MC aggregates, suggesting a tumor-promoting role for PDCs, was noted in 44 (76%) cases, and was significantly higher in CD123-positive versus -negative cases (87% versus 50%, P=0.005). CD123 expression and its staining intensity had prognostic value in SM-chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and nonindolent SM patients, respectively. These observations suggest that targeting CD123 in SM may have direct (via MCs) and indirect (via PDCs) antitumor effects and clinical trials to that effect require laboratory correlative studies to address the observed target expression heterogeneity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 17.,"The amount of genomic information about leukemia cells currently far exceeds our overall understanding of the precise genetic events that ultimately drive disease development and progression. Effective implementation of personalized medicine will require tools to distinguish actionable genetic alterations within the complex genetic landscape of leukemia. In this study, we performed kinase inhibitor screens to predict functional gene targets in primary specimens from patients with acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Deep sequencing of the same patient specimens identified genetic alterations that were then integrated with the functionally important targets using the HitWalker algorithm to prioritize the mutant genes that most likely explain the observed drug sensitivity patterns. Through this process, we identified tyrosine kinase nonreceptor 2 (TNK2) point mutations that exhibited oncogenic capacity. Importantly, the integration of functional and genomic data using HitWalker allowed for prioritization of rare oncogenic mutations that may have been missed through genomic analysis alone. These mutations were sensitive to the multikinase inhibitor dasatinib, which antagonizes TNK2 kinase activity, as well as novel TNK2 inhibitors, XMD8-87 and XMD16-5, with greater target specificity. We also identified activating truncation mutations in other tumor types that were sensitive to XMD8-87 and XMD16-5, exemplifying the potential utility of these compounds across tumor types dependent on TNK2. Collectively, our findings highlight a more sensitive approach for identifying actionable genomic lesions that may be infrequently mutated or overlooked and provide a new method for the prioritization of candidate genetic mutations.",,,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apart from integrin cytoplasmic tails, kindlins are known to interact with other cytoplasmic proteins. Here we demonstrate that kindlin-3 can associate with ribosome via the receptor for activated-C kinase 1 (RACK1) scaffold protein based on immunoprecipitation, ribosome binding, and proximity ligation assays. We show that kindlin-3 regulates c-Myc protein expression in the human chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562. Cell proliferation was reduced following siRNA reduction of kindlin-3 expression and a significant reduction in tumor mass was observed in xenograft experiments. Mechanistically, kindlin-3 is involved in integrin alpha5ss1-Akt-mTOR-p70S6K signaling; however, its regulation of c-Myc protein expression could be independent of this signaling axis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer is a known risk factor for thrombosis outside of pregnancy. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of cancer on the risk of VTE, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in pregnancy. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective population-based cohort study using the Health Care Cost and Utilization Project database from 2003 to 2011. Risk of developing DVT, PE and VTE among pregnant patients with the 10 most prevalent malignancies was measured using unconditional logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 2826 women were identified with underlying malignancies, among our study cohort of 7 917 453 women. Risk of VTE was increased among pregnant patients with cervical cancer (OR 8.64, 95% CI (2.15-34.79)), ovarian cancer (OR 10.35, 95% CI (1.44-74.19)), Hodgkin's disease (OR 7.87, 95% CI (2.94-21.05)) and myeloid leukemia (OR 20.75, 95% CI (6.61-65.12)). There was no increased risk of VTE among women with brain cancer, thyroid cancer, melanoma and lymphoid leukemia. CONCLUSION: Many cancers may increase risk of VTE in pregnancy. Appropriate thromboprophylaxis should be considered in some of these women, particularly those with hematological malignancies and gynecologic cancers.",['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'deep vein thrombosis', 'pregnancy', 'pulmonary embolism', 'venous thromboembolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It can also precede the onset of leukemia which is called non-leukemic MS. Non-leukemic MS is a kind of rare disease and easy to be misdiagnosed as other common malignancies due to the rarity and nonspecific manifestation. We herein report an unusual case of non-leukemic MS involving the vulva, vagina, and cervix in a female patient. The bone marrow aspiration and biopsy of the patient revealed no hematological abnormality. Immunohistochemical staining of the biopsies was strongly positive for myeloperoxidase, CD68, leukocyte common antigen (LCA), CD117, CD34, CD38, CD79a, and negative for cytokeratin (CK), epithelial memberane antigen (EMA), CD2, CD3, CD20, CD5, CD138. Then a diagnosis of non-leukemic MS was made. Unfortunately, our patient received only one cycle of chemotherapy consisting of cytosine arabinoside and daunorubicin, then refused any further treatment and died 4 months after diagnosis. Although systemic chemotherapy is widely accepted to be a promising strategy, its benefit still needs to be further assessed. Certain questions still need to be answered for this disease: 1) Why can approximately 20% of the patients with non-leukemic MS remain disease-free after local therapy alone? 2) How many cycles of chemotherapy are needed for these patients after achievement of complete remission? 3) What are the prognostic or risk factors in these patients who have no abnormality of karyotype, fusion genes, or gene mutation to predict responsiveness to chemotherapy and outcome? 4) What is the risk factor for relapse? The rarity of non-leukemic MS makes it almost impossible to conduct large-scale randomized trials, but judicious study for each patient with MS is helpful for a further understanding of the nature of the disease.",['NOTNLM'],"['chemotherapy', 'genital tract', 'leukemia', 'myeloid sarcoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-six adult, chronic-phase CML patients who had been on TKI treatment (79% on imatinib, 10.5% dasatinib, and 10.5% nilotinib) for at least 6 months participated in the study (mean age: 57.8 years, 52% males). The mean time from diagnosis was 5.1 years. All patients were interviewed, and patient-reported ADRs were obtained using a structured list. Adherence was assessed using Morisky's 8-item Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS). The symptoms' interference with patient's daily QoL was measured by asking patients about the influence of symptom(s) on their mood, general condition, enjoyment of life, walking, relationships, and work. RESULTS: Ninety-seven percent of the patients were suffering from at least one ADR. The mean number of different symptoms was seven (range: 0-15, median 6). The most commonly perceived ADRs were muscle soreness or cramp (69/86, 80%); swelling of hands, legs, feet, or around the eyes (59/86, 69%); and fatigue (43/86, 50%). No correlation was found between adherence and ADRs, because symptoms were equally common in each MMAS adherence class. Half of the patients felt that the ADRs had a negative influence on their daily QoL. A quarter of the patients reported that ADRs affected either their mood, general condition, or enjoyment of life. The incidence of almost all ADRs was much higher among patients reporting negative influence of ADRs on their daily life compared to total study population (P=0.016). CONCLUSION: TKI-related ADRs were common among CML patients irrespective of patient's adherence level.

Epub 2015 Dec 15.,"Oridonin, obtained from the traditional Chinese herbal medicine rabdosia rubescens, exerts potent antitumor activities in cancer cells. Valproic acid (VPA), as a potent histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI), also plays an important role in inhibition of proliferation of tumor cells. However, there are no reports so far on the cooperation between oridonin and VPA for anti-leukemic effect. Therefore, in the present study, we undertook experiments to determine whether lower concentration of oridonin in conjunction with lower concentration of VPA would produce even more encouraging synergistic effect than each of them alone, and to clarify its molecular mechanism. The results demonstrated that the lower concentration of oridonin in combination with lower concentration of VPA synergistically inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells, and induced obvious caspase-dependent apoptosis through activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, which is involved in the downregulation of Bcl-2/Bax ratio, release of cytochrome c to cytosol and caspase-9 activation, as well as through the extrinsic apoptosis pathway mediated by Fas/FasL and caspase-8 activation. In addition, MAPK signaling pathway was also involved in apoptosis induced by oridonin plus VPA. Furthermore, the combination treatment in vivo remarkably reduced the xenograft tumor size and triggered tumor cell apoptosis. Taken together, the novel combination of oridonin plus VPA exerted synergistic anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing effects on human myeloid leukemia cells, and may serve as a potential promising anti-leukemia strategy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To better understand how these pathways become pathologically activated and to potentially identify new drivers of hematopoietic cancers, we developed a high-throughput functional screening approach using ex vivo mutagenesis with the Sleeping Beauty transposon. We analyzed over 1,100 transposon-mutagenized pools of Ba/F3 cells, an IL3-dependent pro-B-cell line, which acquired cytokine independence and tumor-forming ability. Recurrent transposon insertions could be mapped to genes in the JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways, confirming the ability of this strategy to identify known oncogenic components of cytokine signaling pathways. In addition, recurrent insertions were identified in a large set of genes that have been found to be mutated in leukemia or associated with survival, but were not previously linked to the JAK/STAT or MAPK pathways nor shown to functionally contribute to leukemogenesis. Forced expression of these novel genes resulted in IL3-independent growth in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo, validating this mutagenesis-based approach for identifying new genes that promote cytokine signaling and leukemogenesis. Therefore, our findings provide a broadly applicable approach for classifying functionally relevant genes in diverse malignancies and offer new insights into the impact of cytokine signaling on leukemia development.",,,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved, depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus providing mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins-may influence disease onset and progression. In this study, we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability, binding, and activity. We found that recurrent, homozygous, and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than random noncancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models, assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and, to a lesser extent, with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding, whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity, and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.",,,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a transcription factor, PLZF shows tight regulation in its cell-type-specific and stage-specific expression patterns. Emerging evidence shows that PLZF regulates the balance of self-renewal and differentiation in stem cells. However, the gene regulatory network of PLZF is only beginning to be understood. In this review, we discuss the diverse functions of PLZF, in particular its role in self-renewal versus differentiation of stem cells. We also discuss the current state of knowledge on the gene regulatory network of PLZF, in conjunction with its upstream factors, post-translational modifications and binding cofactors for multiprotein complexes.

Additionally, in southwest China, only insufficient data exist regarding FLT3-ITD, FLT3-TKD, NPM1, C-KIT, DNMT3A, and CEBPA mutations have been widely used in clinical settings. Therefore, a comprehensive study about these mutations of clinical importance in the prognosis of AML in western China is necessary. In a cohort of 255 patients with de novo AML, we retrospectively analyzed the prevalence of the six gene mutations, and then we assessed the results in conjunction with clinical characteristics and treatment responses. As for the frequencies of these mutations, the NPM1 mutation occurred most frequently (17.7 %; 42/237), followed by the CEBPA mutation (15.0 %; 19/127) and the FLT3-ITD mutation (10.2 %; 25/244). The frequencies of the FLT3-TKD, DNMT3A, and C-KIT mutations were 3.7 % (9/234), 4.0 % (9/225) and 4.2 % (10/238), respectively. These mutations were closely related to clinical characteristics including FAB classification, gender and age, hemogram, blasts (%), fusion genes, and immunophenotypes. Additionally, a higher complete remission (CR) rate was found in NPM1-mutated patients.

Epub 2015 Dec 10.,"Progression of chronic myeloid leukemia, marked by the oncogenic BcrAbl mutation, is tightly associated with an alteration of the p53 pathway. It is known that butein extracted from various plants represses cancer growth. Although the anticancer effects of butein are widely accepted, the mechanisms by which butein induces apoptosis of chronic myeloid leukemia cells remains to be elucidated. The present study demonstrated that butein-induced apoptosis was mediated by p53. KBM5 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells expressing wild-type p53 were more sensitive to butein compared with p53-null K562 CML cells in terms of apoptotic cell death. In addition, butein arrested KBM5 cells at S-phase and altered the expression levels of certain cyclins and the p53-downstream targets, MDM2 and p21. In addition, while butein reduced the protein expression of MDM2 in the KBM5 and K562 cells, it resulted in proteasome-independent MDM2 degradation in p53-expressing KBM5 cells, however, not in p53-null K562 cells. Therefore, the present study suggested that p53 causes the butein-mediated apoptosis of leukemic cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To compare the overall risk of cancer, and specific cancers of interest, in patients with psoriasis compared with patients without psoriasis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based cohort study of patients ages 18 to 89 years with no medical history of human immunodeficiency virus, cancer, organ transplants, or hereditary disease (albinism and xeroderma pigmentosum), prior to the start date, conducted using The Health Improvement Network, a primary care medical records database in the United Kingdom. The data analyzed had been collected prospectively from 2002 through January 2014. The analysis was completed in August 2015. EXPOSURES OF INTEREST: Patients with at least 1 diagnostic code for psoriasis were classified as having moderate-to-severe disease if they had been prescribed psoralen, methotrexate, cyclosporine, acitretin, adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, or ustekinumab or phototherapy for psoriasis. Patients were classified as having mild disease if they never received treatment with any of these agents. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 937,716 control group patients without psoriasis, matched on date and practice visit, and 198,366 patients with psoriasis (186,076 with mild psoriasis and 12,290 with moderate-to-severe disease) were included in the analysis. The adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) with 95% CIs for any incident cancer excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) were 1.06 (95% CI, 1.02-1.09), 1.06 (95% CI, 1.02-1.09), and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.96-1.22) in the overall, mild, and severe psoriasis group. The aHRs for incident lymphoma were 1.34 (95% CI, 1.18-1.51), 1.31 (95% CI, 1.15-1.49), and 1.89 (95% CI, 1.25-2.86); for NMSC, 1.12 (95% CI, 1.07-1.16), 1.09 (95% CI, 1.05-1.13), and 1.61 (95% CI, 1.42-1.84); and for lung cancer, 1.15 (95% CI, 1.03-1.27), 1.12 (95% CI, 1.01-1.25), and 1.62 (95% CI, 1.16-2.28) in the overall, mild, and severe psoriasis groups, respectively. No significant association was seen with cancer of the breast, colon, prostate, or leukemia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The association between psoriasis and cancer, albeit small, was present in our cohort of patients with psoriasis. This association was primarily driven by NMSC, lymphoma, and lung cancer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, DC vaccines are designed primarily to induce effective T-cell responses, ignoring the antitumor activity potential of natural killer (NK) cells. Aiming to further improve current DC vaccination outcome, we engineered monocyte-derived DC to produce interleukin (IL)-15 and/or IL-15 receptor alpha (IL-15Ralpha) using mRNA electroporation. The addition of IL-15Ralpha to the protocol, enabling IL-15 transpresentation to neighboring NK cells, resulted in significantly better NK-cell activation compared to IL-15 alone. Next to upregulation of NK-cell membrane activation markers, IL-15 transpresentation resulted in increased NK-cell secretion of IFN-gamma, granzyme B and perforin. Moreover, IL-15-transpresenting DC/NK cell cocultures from both healthy donors and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients in remission showed markedly enhanced cytotoxic activity against NK cell sensitive and resistant tumor cells. Blocking IL-15 transpresentation abrogated NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against tumor cells, pointing to a pivotal role of IL-15 transpresentation by IL-15Ralpha to exert its NK cell-activating effects. In conclusion, we report an attractive approach to improve antitumoral NK-cell activity in DC-based vaccine strategies through the use of IL-15/IL-15Ralpha mRNA-engineered designer DC.",['NOTNLM'],"['IL-15 receptor alpha', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunology and Microbiology Section', 'dendritic cells', 'interleukin-15 transpresentation', 'mRNA elektroporation', 'natural killer cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is associated with both liquid malignancies, commonly multiple myeloma, leukemia, and non-Hodgkins lymphoma and solid cancers, particularly breast and renal carcinomas as well as squamous cell carcinomas of any organ. The clinical manifestations of hypercalcemia are generally constitutional in nature and not specific to the inciting malignancy. Such physical manifestations can range from malaise to lethargy and confusion. Constipation and anorexia are common. Acute kidney injury is likely the most frequently encountered manifestation of end organ damage. Symptomatology is closely linked to both the absolute elevation of serum calcium levels and the rapidity of calcium rise. The majority of cases are humoral in etiology and related to parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP). Approximately 20% of cases are the result of direct bone metastasis with extra-renal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) and ectopic parathyroid hormone production likely accounting for less than 1% of cases. The diagnosis of hypercalcemia of malignancy is confirmed either by an elevated PTHrP or by an evidence of bone metastasis in the appropriate clinical setting. Treatment is predicated on the patient's symptoms and absolute serum calcium level. Interventions are aimed at lowering the serum calcium concentration by inhibiting bone resorption and increasing urinary calcium excretion, the former accomplished via bisphosphonate therapy and the latter with aggressive hydration. Novel therapies for refractory disease include denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand, and the calcimimetic cinacalcet. Finally, anti-PTHrP antibodies have been successfully deployed in animal models of disease. Despite the efficacy of the above therapies, hypercalcemia of malignancy portends an ominous prognosis, indicating advanced and often refractory cancer with survival on the order of months.",['NOTNLM'],"['bisphosphonates', 'calcitonin', 'cinacalcet', 'denosumab', 'hypercalcemia of malignancy parathyroid hormone', 'parathyroid hormone-related protein']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 16.,"Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) is first-line treatment of medically fit chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients; however, despite good response rates, many patients eventually relapse. Although recent high-throughput studies have identified novel recurrent genetic lesions in adverse prognostic CLL, the mechanisms leading to relapse after FCR therapy are not completely understood. To gain insight into this issue, we performed whole-exome sequencing of sequential samples from 41 CLL patients who were uniformly treated with FCR but relapsed after a median of 2 years. In addition to mutations with known adverse-prognostic impact (TP53, NOTCH1, ATM, SF3B1, NFKBIE, and BIRC3), a large proportion of cases (19.5%) harbored mutations in RPS15, a gene encoding a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit. Extended screening, totaling 1119 patients, supported a role for RPS15 mutations in aggressive CLL, with one-third of RPS15-mutant cases also carrying TP53 aberrations. In most cases, selection of dominant, relapse-specific subclones was observed over time. However, RPS15 mutations were clonal before treatment and remained stable at relapse. Notably, all RPS15 mutations represented somatic missense variants and resided within a 7 amino-acid, evolutionarily conserved region. We confirmed the recently postulated direct interaction between RPS15 and MDM2/MDMX and transient expression of mutant RPS15 revealed defective regulation of endogenous p53 compared with wild-type RPS15.

SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review provides a detailed overview of recent advances in the application of target-specific therapies for childhood cancers, either as single agents or in combination with other therapies. The review summarizes preclinical evidence on which clinical trials are based, early phase clinical trial results, and the incorporation of predictive biomarkers into clinical practice, according to cancer type. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: There is growing evidence that molecularly targeted therapies can valuably add to the arsenal available for treating childhood cancers, particularly when used in combination with other therapies. Nonetheless the introduction of molecularly targeted agents into practice remains challenging, due to the use of unselected populations in some clinical trials, inadequate methods to evaluate efficacy, and the need for improved preclinical models to both evaluate dosing and safety of combination therapies. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The increasing recognition of the heterogeneity of molecular causes of cancer favors the continued development of molecularly targeted agents, and their transfer to pediatric and adolescent populations.",['NOTNLM'],"['ALK, anaplastic lymphoma kinase', 'ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'AML, acute myeloid leukemia', 'ARMS, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma', 'AT/RT, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor', 'AURKA, aurora kinase A', 'AURKB, aurora kinase B', 'BET, bromodomain and extra terminal', 'Biomarkers', 'CAR, chimeric antigen receptor', 'CML, chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Childhood cancer', 'DFMO, difluoromethylornithine', 'DIPG, diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma', 'EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor', 'ERMS, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma', 'HDAC, histone deacetylases', 'Hsp90, heat shock protein 90', 'IGF-1R, insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor', 'IGF/IGFR, insulin-like growth factor/receptor', 'Molecular diagnostics', 'NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer', 'ODC1, ornithine decarboxylase 1', 'PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase', 'PDGFRA/B, platelet derived growth factor alpha/beta', ""PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase"", 'PLK1, polo-like kinase 1', 'Ph +, Philadelphia chromosome-positive', 'RMS, rhabdomyosarcoma', 'SHH, sonic hedgehog', 'SMO, smoothened', 'SYK, spleen tyrosine kinase', 'TOP1/TOP2, DNA topoisomerase 1/2', 'TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand', 'Targeted therapy', 'VEGF/VEGFR, vascular endothelial growth factor/receptor', 'mAb, monoclonal antibody', 'mAbs, monoclonal antibodies', 'mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have screened an shRNA library targeting ubiquitin pathway proteins for effects on PML NBs, and identified RNF8 and RNF168 DNA-damage response proteins as negative regulators of PML NBs. Additional studies confirmed that depletion of either RNF8 or RNF168 increased the levels of PML NBs and proteins, whereas overexpression induced loss of PML NBs. RNF168 partially localized to PML NBs through its UMI/MIU1 ubiquitin-interacting region and associated with NBs formed by any PML isoform. The association of RNF168 with PML NBs resulted in increased ubiquitylation and SUMO2 modification of PML. In addition, RNF168 was found to associate with proteins modified by SUMO2 and/or SUMO3 in a manner dependent on its ubiquitin-binding sequences, suggesting that hybrid SUMO-ubiquitin chains can be bound. In vitro assays confirmed that RNF168, preferentially, binds hybrid SUMO2-K63 ubiquitin chains compared with K63-ubiquitin chains or individual SUMO2. Our study identified previously unrecognized roles for RNF8 and RNF168 in the regulation of PML, and a so far unknown preference of RNF168 for hybrid SUMO-ubiquitin chains.",['NOTNLM'],"['PML nuclear bodies', 'RNF168', 'RNF8', 'SUMO']",['(c) 2016.

Here, we examined APRE cytotoxicity seen on target neuroblastoma cells (NB) using cell viability assays, DAPI visualization of fragmented DNA, and Western blotting analysis of candidate signaling pathways involved in proliferation and apoptosis. We demonstrated that APRE reduced cell viability in NB to a greater extent than in fibroblast cells. In addition, we found that APRE could inhibit the three classes of MAPK proteins and could also down-regulate the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3beta activity all being relevant for proliferation and survival. APRE could also up-regulate Bax expression and down-regulate Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. With APRE treatment, depolarization of mitochondria membrane potential and activation of caspase-3 was demonstrated in the SH-SY5Y cells. We could not found increased activity of death receptor and caspase-8 as markers of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway for the APRE treated cells. In presence of a caspase-3 siRNA and a pan-caspase inhibitor, APRE could not reduce the viability of NB cells to a significant degree. So we predicted that with APRE, the intrinsic pathway was solely responsible for inducing apoptosis as we also showed that the non-caspase autophagy pathway or ER stress-ROS mediated pathways were not involved. These findings demonstrate that an intrinsic mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway mediates the apoptotic effects of APRE on SH-SY5Y cells, and that APRE shows promise as a novel agent for neuroblastoma therapy.",['NOTNLM'],"['Angelica polymorpha', 'Bax/Bcl-2 ratio', 'apoptosis', 'caspase', 'neuroblastoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This in vivo study aimed to establish a stable line of zebrafish expressing the human RUNX1-Evi-1 fusion gene under the control of a heat stress-inducible bidirectional promoter, and investigate its roles in hematopoiesis and hematologic malignancies. METHODS: We introduced human RUNX1-Evi-1 fusion gene into embryonic zebrafish through a heat-shock promoter to establish Tg(RE:HSE:EGFP) zebrafish. Two males and one female mosaic F0 zebrafish embryos (2.1%) were identified as stable positive germline transgenic zebrafish. RESULTS: The population of immature myeloid cells and hematopoietic blast cells were accumulated in peripheral blood and single cell suspension from kidney of adult Tg(RE:HSE:EGFP) zebrafish. RUNX1-Evi-1 presented an intensive influence on hematopoietic regulatory factors. Consequently, primitive hematopoiesis was enhanced by upregulation of gata2 and scl, while erythropoiesis was downregulated due to the suppression of gata1. Early stage of myelopoiesis was flourishing with the high expression of pu.1, but it was inhibited along with the low expression of mpo. Microarray analysis demonstrated that RUNX1-Evi-1 not only upregulated proteasome, cell cycle, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, tyrosine metabolism, drug metabolism, and PPAR pathway, but also suppressed transforming growth factor beta, Jak-STAT, DNA replication, mismatch repair, p53 pathway, JNK signaling pathway, and nucleotide excision repair. Interestingly, histone deacetylase 4 was significantly up-regulated. Factors in cell proliferation were obviously suppressed after 3-day treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitor, valproic acid. Accordingly, higher proportion of G1 arrest and apoptosis were manifested by the propidium iodide staining. CONCLUSION: RUNX1-Evi-1 may promote proliferation and apoptosis resistance of primitive hematopoietic cell, and inhibit the differentiation of myeloid cells with the synergy of different pathways and factors. VPA may be a promising choice in the molecular targeting therapy of RUNX1-Evi-1-related leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Nov 14.,"OBJECTIVE: Feature selection is a technique widely used in data mining. The aim is to select the best subset of features relevant to the problem being considered. In this paper, we consider feature selection for the classification of gene datasets. Gene data is usually composed of just a few dozen objects described by thousands of features. For this kind of data, it is easy to find a model that fits the learning data. However, it is not easy to find one that will simultaneously evaluate new data equally well as learning data. This overfitting issue is well known as regards classification and regression, but it also applies to feature selection. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We address this problem and investigate its importance in an empirical study of four feature selection methods applied to seven high-dimensional gene datasets. We chose datasets that are well studied in the literature-colon cancer, leukemia and breast cancer. All the datasets are characterized by a significant number of features and the presence of exactly two decision classes. The feature selection methods used are ReliefF, minimum redundancy maximum relevance, support vector machine-recursive feature elimination and relaxed linear separability. RESULTS: Our main result reveals the existence of positive feature selection bias in all 28 experiments (7 datasets and 4 feature selection methods). Bias was calculated as the difference between validation and test accuracies and ranges from 2.6% to as much as 41.67%. The validation accuracy (biased accuracy) was calculated on the same dataset on which the feature selection was performed. The test accuracy was calculated for data that was not used for feature selection (by so called external cross-validation). CONCLUSIONS: This work provides evidence that using the same dataset for feature selection and learning is not appropriate. We recommend using cross-validation for feature selection in order to reduce selection bias.",['NOTNLM'],"['Convex and piecewise linear classifier', 'Feature selection bias', 'Gene selection', 'Microarray data', 'Support vector machine']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2015 Dec 7.,"Differentiation during hematopoiesis leads to the generation of many cell types with specific functions. At various stages of maturation, the cells may change pathologically, leading to diseases including acute leukemias (ALs). Expression levels of regulatory molecules (such as the IKZF, GATA, HOX, FOX, NOTCH and CEBP families, as well as SPI-1/PU1 and PAX5) and lineage-specific molecules (including CD2, CD14, CD79A, and BLNK) may be compared between pathological and physiological cells. Although the key steps of differentiation are known, the available databases focus mainly on fully differentiated cells as a reference. Precursor cells may be a more appropriate reference point for diseases that evolve at immature stages. Therefore, we developed a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) array to investigate 90 genes that are characteristic of the lymphoid or myeloid lineages and/or are thought to be involved in their regulation. Using this array, sorted cells of granulocytic, monocytic, T and B lineages were analyzed. For each of these lineages, 3-5 differentiation stages were selected (17 stages total), and cells were sorted from 3 different donors per stage. The qPCR results were compared to similarly processed AL cells of lymphoblastic (n=18) or myeloid (n=6) origins and biphenotypic AL cells of B cell origin with myeloid involvement (n=5). Molecules characteristic of each lineage were found. In addition, cells of a newly discovered switching lymphoblastic AL (swALL) were sorted at various phases during the supposed transdifferentiation from an immature B cell to a monocytic phenotype. As demonstrated previously, gene expression changed along with the immunophenotype. The qPCR data are publicly available in the LeukoStage Database in which gene expression in malignant and non-malignant cells of different lineages can be explored graphically and differentially expressed genes can be identified. In addition, the LeukoStage Database can aid the functional analyses of next-generation sequencing data.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'B and T lymphocytes', 'Differentiation plasticity', 'Gene expression', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Lineage promiscuity']","['Copyright (c) 2015 International Society of Differentiation.

Therefore, inhibition of this pathway may represent a potential therapeutic approach in AML. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pre-clinical activity of NVP-BKM120 (BKM120), a selective pan-class I PI3K inhibitor, on AML cell lines and primary samples. Our results demonstrate that BKM120 abrogates the activity of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, promoting cell growth arrest and significant apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner in AML cells but not in the normal counterpart. BKM120-induced cytotoxicity is associated with a profound modulation of metabolic behaviour in both cell lines and primary samples. In addition, BKM120 synergizes with the glycolitic inhibitor dichloroacetate enhancing apoptosis induction at lower doses. Finally, in vivo administration of BKM120 to a xenotransplant mouse model of AML significantly inhibited leukemia progression and improved the overall survival of treated mice. Taken together, our findings indicate that BKM120, alone or in combination with other drugs, has a significant anti-leukemic activity supporting its clinical development as a novel therapeutic agent in AML.",,,,,,,,['Sci Rep. 2016;6:20743.

Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis are tightly regulated by AKT via phosphorylation of GSK3alpha and beta isoforms which inactivates these kinases. In the current study we examine the prognostic role of AKT mediated GSK3 phosphorylation in AML. METHODS: We analyzed GSK3alpha/beta phosphorylation by reverse phase protein analysis (RPPA) in a cohort of 511 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Levels of phosphorylated GSK3 were correlated with patient characteristics including survival and with expression of other proteins important in AML cell survival. RESULTS: High levels of p-GSK3alpha/beta correlated with adverse overall survival and a lower incidence of complete remission duration in patients with intermediate cytogenetics, but not in those with unfavorable cytogenetics. Intermediate cytogenetic patients with FLT3 mutation also fared better respectively when p-GSK3alpha/beta levels were lower. Phosphorylated GSK3alpha/beta expression was compared and contrasted with that of 229 related cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis proteins. Consistent with p-GSK3alpha/beta as an indicator of AKT activation, RPPA revealed that p-GSK3alpha/beta positively correlated with phosphorylation of AKT, BAD, and P70S6K, and negatively correlated with beta-catenin and FOXO3A. PKCdelta also positively correlated with p-GSK3alpha/beta expression, suggesting crosstalk between the AKT and PKC signaling pathways in AML cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that AKT-mediated phosphorylation of GSK3alpha/beta may be beneficial to AML cell survival, and hence detrimental to the overall survival of AML patients. Intrinsically, p-GSK3alpha/beta may serve as an important adverse prognostic factor for a subset of AML patients.",['NOTNLM'],"['AKT', 'GSK3', 'Leukemia', 'PKC delta', 'RPPA', 'Signal transduction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) blasts misuse these bone marrow niches for protection by the local microenvironment, but also might create their own microenvironment. Here we identify IL-8 as a hypoxia-regulated cytokine in both AML cell lines and primary AML samples that is induced within 48 hours of severe hypoxia (1% O2). IL-8 lacked effects on AML cells but induced migration in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), an integral part of the bone marrow. Accordingly, MSC were significantly increased in AML bone marrow as compared to healthy bone marrow. Interestingly, mononuclear cells obtained from healthy bone marrow displayed both significantly lower endogenous and hypoxia-induced production of IL-8. IL-8 mRNA expression in AML blasts from 533 patients differed between genetic subgroups with significantly lower expression of IL-8 in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), while in non APL-AML patients with FLT ITD had the highest IL-8 expression. In this subgroup, high IL-8 expression was also prognostically unfavourable.

However, recent evidence indicates that ATRA can also promote differentiation of leukemia cells that are PML-RARalpha negative, such as HL-60 cells. Here, gene expression profiling of HL-60 cells was used to investigate the alternative mechanism of impaired differentiation in APL. The expression of peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PADI4), encoding PAD4, a protein that post-translationally converts arginine into citrulline, was restored during ATRA-induced differentiation. We further identified that hypermethylation in the PADI4 promoter was associated with its transcriptional repression in HL-60 and NB4 (PML-RARalpha positive) cells. Functionally, PAD4 translocated into the nucleus upon ATRA exposure and promoted ATRA-mediated differentiation. Mechanistic studies using RNAi knockdown or electroporation-mediated delivery of PADI4, along with chromatin immunoprecipitation, helped identify PU.1 as an indirect target and SOX4 as a direct target of PAD4 regulation. Indeed, PAD4 regulates SOX4-mediated PU.1 expression, and thereby the differentiation process, in a SOX4-dependent manner. Taken together, our results highlight an association between PAD4 and DNA hypermethylation in APL and demonstrate that targeting PAD4 or regulating its downstream effectors may be a promising strategy to control differentiation in the clinic.",['NOTNLM'],"['PADI4', 'differentiation', 'leukemia', 'methylation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the high efficacy of imatinib, not all patients benefit from this treatment. Resistance to imatinib can develop from a number of mechanisms. One of the main reasons for treatment failure is a mutation in the BCR-ABL gene, which leads to therapy resistance and clonal evolution. Clearly, new treatment approaches are required for patients who are resistant to imatinib. However, mutated clones are usually susceptible to second-generation TKIs, such as nilotinib and dasatinib. The choice of the therapy depends on the type of mutation. A large trial program showed that dasatinib is effective in patients previously exposed to imatinib. However, for a minority of patients who experience treatment failure with TKI or progress to advanced-phase disease, allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) remains the therapeutic option. In spite of the high curative potential of allo-SCT, its high relapse rate still requires a feasible strategy of posttransplant treatment and prophylaxis. We report a case of a CML patient with primary resistance to first-line TKI therapy. The patient developed an undifferentiated blast crisis. Before dasatinib therapy, the patient was found to have an F317L mutation. He was successfully treated with dasatinib followed by allo-SCT. In the posttransplant period, preemptive dasatinib treatment was used to prevent disease relapse.",['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL mutations', 'CML', 'F317L mutation', 'TKI', 'allo-SCT', 'dasatinib']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many reports suggest that ATO can also be applied as an anticancer agent for solid tumors in the future. The influence of arsenic trioxide on the expression of different cell cycle regulators is poorly recognized. The purpose of the current study is to investigate how arsenic trioxide affects cyclin A expression and localization in the A549 cell line. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Morphological and ultrastructural changes in A549 cells were observed using light and transmission electron microscopes. Cyclin A localization was determined by immunofluorescence. Image-based cytometry was applied to evaluate the effect of arsenic trioxide on apoptosis and the cell cycle. Expression of cyclin A mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR. RESULTS: After treatment with arsenic trioxide, increased numbers of cells with cytoplasmic localization of cyclin A were observed. The doses of 10 and 15 muM ATO slightly reduced expression of cyclin A mRNA. The apoptotic phenotype of cells was poorly represented, and the Tali imagebased cytometry analysis showed low percentages of apoptotic cells. The A549 population displayed an enriched fraction of cells in G0/G1 phase in the presence of 5muM ATO, whereas starting from the higher concentrations of the drug, i.e. 10 and 15 muM ATO, the G2/M fraction was on the increase. DISCUSSION: Low expression of cyclin A in the A549 cell line may constitute a potential factor determining arsenic trioxide resistance. It could be hypothesized that the observed alterations in cyclin A expression/distribution may correlate well with changes in cell cycle regulation in our model, which in turn determines the outcome of the treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 16.,"Evodiamine, a quinolone alkaloid, is one of the major bioactive compounds of Evodia rutaecarpa Bentham (Rutaceae). It exhibits excellent biological activities, especially the anticancer activity. This study aims to investigate the effect of evodiamine on the proliferation of leukemia cell line K562 and to explore the underlying mechanism. The effect of evodiamine on K562 cells proliferation was analyzed by trypan blue dye exclusion assay and MTT assay. The expression levels of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), cyclin D1, and p21 were detected by western blot assay. The results demonstrated that evodiamine inhibited the proliferation and decreased the viability of K562 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. 2-Chloro-5-nitro-N-phenylbenzamide (GW9662) and/or PPARgamma-siRNA pretreatment alleviated the cell growth suppression triggered by evodiamine. Meanwhile, evodiamine intervention elevated the expression of PPARgamma in K562 cells, while pretreatment with GW9662 attenuated the enhanced upregulation of PPARgamma expression induced by evodiamine. In addition, GW9662 and PPARgamma-siRNA pretreatment also significantly attenuated the downregulation of the cell cycle control protein cyclin D1 and the upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 induced by evodiamine. In conclusion, PPARgamma signaling pathway may involve in the proliferation inhibition of evodiamine on K562 cells via inhibiting cylcin D1 and stimulating of p21.",['NOTNLM'],"['Cyclin D1', 'K562 cells', 'PPARgamma', 'evodiamine', 'p21']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is metabolized and excreted via urine as monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and As(V), along with excess As(III). In our study eight APL patients were treated (intravenously) with 0.15 mg As2O3/kg/day. During the therapy As(III) and its metabolites were followed in pre- and post-infusion urine using HPLC for separation followed by on-line detection using hydride generation-atomic fluorescence spectrometry. Five patients had a normal excretion pattern of residual arsenic compounds in morning pre-infusion urine, with 15-25% of As(III), 35-55% of DMA, 25-30% of MMA and 1-5% of As(V), while three patients showed unexpected exceptions from typical excretion patterns of arsenic compounds (i) a high DMA/MMA ratio (factor 5.3), (ii) severe As(III) oxidation (10.2% As(III) converted to As(V)) or (iii) the presence of an excessive amount of As(III) (average 30.4% of total arsenic). Intriguing was the occurrence of post-infusion oxidation of As(III) to As(V) observed in almost all patients and being especially high (>40%) in patient with increased residual As(V). Results indicate that arsenic metabolites patterns can be unpredictable. Observed high levels of un-metabolised As(III) are a warning signal for side effects and for routine determination of arsenic metabolites during first days of treatment. High or low percentages of MMA or DMA did not show any observable effect on treatment results, while clear presence of post-infusion As(V) supports theoretical claims of in vivo oxidation (detoxification) of As(III) to As(V) associated with various metabolic processes.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'Arsenic trioxide', 'Biotransformation', 'Metabolites', 'Speciation', 'Urine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current methods of flow-cytometric (FC) DNA-ploidy evaluation are either technically difficult or limited to three- to four-color immunophenotyping and hence, challenging to evaluate DNA-ploidy in minute tumor population with background rich of its normal counterpart cells and other hematopoietic cells. We standardized a novel sensitive and easy method of simultaneous evaluation of six- to seven-color immunophenotyping and DNA-ploidy using a dye-FxCycle Violet (FCV). Linearity, resolution, and coefficient of variation (CV) for FCV were studied using chicken erythrocyte nuclei. Ploidy results of FCV were compared with Propidium iodide (PI) in 20 samples and intra-assay variation for FCV was studied. Using this six-color immunophenotyping & FCV-protocol DNA-ploidy was determined in bone-marrow samples from 124 B-ALL & 50 MM patients. Dilution experiment was also conducted to determine the sensitivity in detection of aneuploidy in minute tumor population. FCV revealed high linearity and resolution in 450/50 channel. On comparison with PI, CV of Go/G1-peak with FCV (mean-CV 4.1%) was slightly higher than PI (mean-CV 2.9%) but had complete agreement in ploidy results. Dilution experiment showed that aneuploidy could be accurately detected up to the limit of 0.01% tumor cells. Intra-assay variation was very low with CV of 0.005%. In B-ALL, hypodiploidy was noted in 4%, hyperdiploidy in 24%, near-hyperdiploidy in 13% and remaining 59% were diploid. In MM, hypodiploidy was in 2%, hyperdiploidy in 58%, near-hyperdiploidy in 8% and remaining 30% were diploid. FCV-based DNA-ploidy method is a sensitive and easy method for simultaneous evaluation of six-color immunophenotyping and DNA analysis.

Besides, it was one of core components of MLL1 (mixed lineage leukemia 1), which were required for H3K4 methyltransferase activity. MLL1 dysfunction was found to be associated with the progression of some cancers such as acute leukemias. However, the precise role of RBQ3 in tumor progression remains obscure. In this study, we explored the expression and clinical role of RBQ3 in gliomas. Our results showed that RBQ3 was significantly upregulated in clinical glioma specimens by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Moreover, its level was significantly associated with the pathology grades. High RBQ3 expression was suggested to be an independent prognostic factor for glioma patients' survival by univariate and multivariate analyses. Serum starvation and refeeding assay indicated that the expression of RBQ3 increased 8h after serum-stimulation, together with percentage of cells at S phase. In addition, knockdown of RBQ inhibited U87-MG cell proliferation with CCK8 kit, flow cytometry assays and colony formation analyses; while the depletion of RBQ3 induced the apoptosis of U87-MG cells.

Second HSCT is a curative option; however, few reports have been published about a second HSCT in children for AML with posttransplantation relapse. PROCEDURE: Using the database provided by the Japanese Society of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, we analyzed 46 children with AML who underwent a second allogeneic HSCT after achieving a second remission. RESULTS: The median duration from the first to second HSCT was 20 months, and the source of the second HSCT was related bone marrow (BM) in 22, related peripheral blood in 6, unrelated BM in 14, and unrelated cord blood in 4 patients. Twenty-five children eventually died of the following causes: progressive disease in 14 and transplant-related toxicities in 9. The 5-year overall survival rate was 41.7 +/- 7.7%. An interval of less than 24 months between the first and second HSCT was a significant poor prognostic factor.

However, potential protection of malignant cells remains a legitimate concern for clinicians. We tested LLLT-induced protection from ionizing radiation killing in both malignant and normal cells. METHODS: We treated six groups each of normal human lymphoblasts (TK6) and human leukemia cells (HL60) with He-Ne LLLT (632.8 nm, 35 mW, CW, 1 cm(2), 35 mW/cm(2) for 3-343 s, 0.1-12 J/cm(2)) prior to exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). Cells were then incubated and counted daily to determine their survival. Optimization of IR dose and incubation time was established prior to testing the effect of LLLT. RESULTS: Growth curves for both cell lines showed significant declines after exposure to 50-200 cGy IR when compared to controls. Pre-radiation exposure to LLLT (4.0 J/cm(2)) followed by 1-h incubation blocked this decline in TK6 but not in HL60 cells. The latter cells were sensitized to the killing effects of IR in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: This study shows that pre-IR LLLT treatment results in a differential response of normal vs. malignant cells, suggesting that LLLT does not confer protection and may even sensitize cancer cells to IR killing.",['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Cytoprotection', 'LLLT', 'Mucositis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within the pediatric AML-BFM (Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster) 98/04 studies, emergency strategies for these children included exchange transfusion (ET) or leukapheresis (LPh). Risk factors for ED and interventions performed were analyzed. PATIENTS: Two hundred thirty-eight of 1,251 (19%) patients with AML presented with hyperleukocytosis; 23 of 1,251 (1.8%) patients died of bleeding/leukostasis. RESULTS: ED due to bleeding/leukostasis was highest at white blood cell (WBC) count >200,000/mul (14.3%). ED rates were even higher (20%) in patients with FAB (French-American-British) M4/M5 and hyperleukocytosis >200,000/mul. Patients with WBC >200,000/mul did slightly better with ET/LPh compared to those without ET/LPh (ED rate 7.5% vs. 21.2%, P = 0.055). Multivariate WBC >200,000/mul was of strongest prognostic significance for ED (P(chi(2) ) <0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our data confirm the high risk of bleeding/leukostasis in patients with hyperleukocytosis.

Epub 2015 Dec 15.,"Apoptosis is one of the mechanisms used by host cells to remove unwanted intracellular organisms, and often found to be subverted by pathogens through use of host anti-apoptotic proteins. In the present study, with the help of in vitro and in vivo approaches, we documented that the macrophage anti-apoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1) is exploited by the intra-macrophage parasite Leishmania donovani to protect their ""home"" from actinomycin D-induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Among all the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members, infection preferentially up-regulated expression of MCL-1 at both the mRNA and protein levels and compared with infected control, MCL-1-silenced infected macrophages documented enhanced caspase activity and increased apoptosis when subjected to actinomycin D treatment. Phosphorylation kinetics and ChIP assay demonstrated that infection-induced MCL-1 expression was regulated by transcription factor CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein) and silencing of CREB resulted in reduced expression of MCL-1 and increased apoptosis. During infection, MCL-1 was found to be localized in mitochondria and this was significantly reduced in Tom70-silenced macrophages, suggesting the active role of TOM70 in MCL-1 transport. In the mitochondria, MCL-1 interacts with the major pro-apoptotic protein BAK and prevents BAK-BAK homo-oligomer formation thereby preventing cytochrome c release-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. Silencing of MCL-1 in the spleen of infected mice showed decreased parasite burden and increased induction of splenocyte apoptosis. Collectively our results showed that L. donovani exploited the macrophage anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1 to prevent BAK-mediated mitochondria-dependent apoptosis thereby protecting its niche, which is essential for disease progression.",['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family', 'Leishmania', 'apoptosis', 'cytochrome c', 'macrophage']","['(c) 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 28.,"Minimal residual disease is the most powerful predictor of outcome in acute leukemia and is useful in therapeutic stratification for acute lymphoblastic leukemia protocols. Nowadays, the most reliable methods for studying minimal residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia are multiparametric flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction. Both provide similar results at a minimal residual disease level of 0.01% of normal cells, that is, detection of one leukemic cell in up to 10,000 normal nucleated cells. Currently, therapeutic protocols establish the minimal residual disease threshold value at the most informative time points according to the appropriate methodology employed. The expertise of the laboratory in a cancer center or a cooperative group could be the most important factor in determining which method should be used. In Brazil, multiparametric flow cytometry laboratories are available in most leukemia treatment centers, but multiparametric flow cytometry processes must be standardized for minimal residual disease investigations in order to offer reliable and reproducible results that ensure quality in the clinical application of the method. The Minimal Residual Disease Working Group of the Brazilian Society of Bone Marrow Transplantation (SBTMO) was created with that aim. This paper presents recommendations for the detection of minimal residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia based on the literature and expertise of the laboratories who participated in this consensus, including pre-analytical and analytical methods. This paper also recommends that both multiparametric flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction are complementary methods, and so more laboratories with expertise in immunoglobulin/T cell receptor (Ig/TCR) gene assays are necessary in Brazil.",['NOTNLM'],"['Flow cytometry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'MRD acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Minimal residual disease']","['Copyright (c) 2015 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

Published reports have indicated an incidence from 9% to 30% of transplant patients however to date there is no information about infection in these patients in Chile. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of patients who developed C. difficile infection after hematopoietic stem cell transplantations from 2000 to 2013. Statistical analysis used the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty patients were studied (mean age: 39 years; range: 17-69), with 147 (59%) receiving allogeneic transplants and 103 (41%) receiving autologous transplants. One hundred and ninety-two (77%) patients had diarrhea, with 25 (10%) cases of C. difficile infection being confirmed. Twenty infected patients had undergone allogeneic transplants, of which ten had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, three had acute myeloid leukemia and seven had other diseases (myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myeloid leukemia, severe aplastic anemia). In the autologous transplant group, five patients had C. difficile infection; two had multiple myeloma, one had amyloidosis, one had acute myeloid leukemia and one had germinal carcinoma. The overall incidence of C. difficile infection was 4% within the first week, 6.4% in the first month and 10% in one year, with no difference in overall survival between infected and non-infected groups (72.0% vs. 67.6%, respectively; p-value=0.56). Patients infected after allogeneic transplants had a slower time to neutrophil engraftment compared to non-infected patients (17.5 vs. 14.9 days, respectively; p-value=0.008). In the autologous transplant group there was no significant difference in the neutrophil engraftment time between infected and non-infected patients (12.5 days vs. 11.8 days, respectively; p-value=0.71). In the allogeneic transplant group, the median time to acute graft-versus-host disease was similar between the two groups (p-value=0.08), as was the incidence of grades 1-4 acute graft-versus-host disease (40% vs. 48%; p-value >0.05). CONCLUSION: The incidence of C. difficile infection after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was low, with a significant number of cases occurring shortly after transplantation.

Epub 2015 Sep 14.,"INTRODUCTION: Minimal residual disease is an important independent prognostic factor that can identify poor responders among patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze minimal residual disease using immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements by conventional polymerase chain reaction followed by homo-heteroduplex analysis and to compare this with real-time polymerase chain reaction at the end of the induction period in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: Seventy-four patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were enrolled. Minimal residual disease was evaluated by qualitative polymerase chain reaction in 57 and by both tests in 44. The Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox methods and the log-rank test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Nine patients (15.8%) were positive for minimal residual disease by qualitative polymerase chain reaction and 11 (25%) by real-time polymerase chain reaction considering a cut-off point of 1x10(-3) for precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 1x10(-2) for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Using the qualitative method, the 3.5-year leukemia-free survival was significantly higher in children negative for minimal residual disease compared to those with positive results (84.1%+/-5.6% versus 41.7%+/-17.3%, respectively; p-value=0.004). There was no significant association between leukemia-free survival and minimal residual disease by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Minimal residual disease by qualitative polymerase chain reaction was the only variable significantly correlated to leukemia-free survival. CONCLUSION: Given the difficulties in the implementation of minimal residual disease monitoring by real-time polymerase chain reaction in most treatment centers in Brazil, the qualitative polymerase chain reaction strategy may be a cost-effective alternative.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Leukemia free survival', 'Minimal residual disease', 'Polymerase chain reaction']","['Copyright (c) 2015 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

Epub 2015 Dec 16.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell neoplasm with significant molecular heterogeneity. Gene expression profiling (GEP) has contributed significantly to our understanding of the underlying biology and has led to several prognostic gene signatures. However, the best way to apply these GEP signatures in clinical practice is unclear. In this study, we investigated the integration of proven prognostic signatures for improved patient risk stratification. Three publicly available MM GEP data sets that encompass newly diagnosed as well as relapsed patients were analyzed using standardized estimation of nine prognostic MM signature indices and simulations of signature index combinations. Cox regression analysis was used to assess the performance of simulated combination indices. Taking the average of multiple GEP signature indices was a simple but highly effective way of integrating multiple GEP signatures. Furthermore, although adding more signatures in general improved performance substantially, we identified a core signature combination, EMC92+HZDCD, as the top-performing prognostic signature combination across all data sets. In this study, we provided a rationale for gene signature integration and a practical strategy to choose an optimal risk score estimation in the presence of multiple prognostic signatures.",,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-5392-9284'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively identified 262 patients with POEMS syndrome treated at the Mayo Clinic from 1974 to 2014 and who had follow-up information. The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was 58% and 78%, respectively. Median time to R/P was 42 months. Seventy-nine patients (30%) had an R/P, with 52 (19%) experiencing a symptomatic R/P. Eighteen patients relapsed with symptoms or signs that were not documented at diagnosis. Median times to vascular endothelial growth factor, hematologic, radiographic and clinical R/P were 35 months (range, 4-327 months), 72 months (range, 4-327 months), 51 months (range, 4-327 months) and 48 months (range, 6-311 months), respectively. On multivariate analyses, low albumin at diagnosis and failure to achieve a complete hematologic response to first-line therapy were independent risk factors for PFS. Thirty patients had documentation of a second R/P at a median of 26 months from diagnosis of the first R/P. An early R/P was a risk factor for death, but most patients with an R/P had salvageable disease. A majority of patients are still without R/P at 5 years from diagnosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We generated isogenic leukemia cell clones in which the FLT3 gene was disrupted in a single allele using TALENs. Isogenic clones with mono-allelic disrupted FLT3 were compared to an isogenic wild-type control clone and parental leukemia cells for transcriptional expression, downstream FLT3 signaling and proliferation capacity. The global gene expression profiles of mutant K562 clones and corresponding wild-type controls were compared using RNA-seq. The transcriptional levels and the ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of FLT3 were decreased in the mutant clones. TALENs-mediated FLT3 haplo-insufficiency impaired cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro. These inhibitory effects were maintained in vivo, improving the survival of NOD/SCID mice transplanted with mutant K562 clones. Cluster analysis revealed that the gene expression pattern of isogenic clones was determined by the FLT3 mutant status rather than the deviation among individual isogenic clones. Differentially expressed genes between the mutant and wild-type clones revealed an activation of nonsense-mediated decay pathway in mutant K562 clones as well as an inhibited FLT3 signaling. Our data support that this genome-editing approach is a robust and generally applicable platform to explore the molecular bases of gene mutations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 16.,"Little is known about the real everyday exposure of children in Europe to extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MFs). The aims of this study are to (i) assess personal ELF-MF exposure in children; (ii) to identify factors determining personal and bedroom ELF-MF exposure measurements in children; (iii) to evaluate the reproducibility of exposure summary measures; and (iv) to compare personal with bedroom measurements. In Switzerland and Italy, 172 children aged between 5 and 13 years were equipped with ELF-MF measurement devices (EMDEX II, measuring 40-800 Hz) during 24-72 h twice, in the warm and the cold season. In addition, 24-h measurements were taken in the bedroom of children. In our study, sample geometric mean ELF-MF exposure was 0.04 muT for personal and 0.05 muT for bedroom measurements. Living within 100 m of a highest voltage power line increased geometric mean personal exposure by a factor of 3.3, and bedroom measurements by a factor 6.8 compared to a control group. Repeated measurements within the same subject showed high reproducibility for the geometric mean (Spearman's correlation 0.78 for personal and 0.86 for bedroom measurements) but less for the 95th and 99th percentile of the personal measurements (</=0.42). Spearman's correlation between bedroom and personal exposure was 0.86 for the geometric mean but considerably lower for the 95th and 99th percentiles (</=0.60). Most previous studies on ELF-MF childhood leukaemia used mean bedroom exposure. Our study demonstrates that geometric mean bedroom measurements is well correlated with personal geometric mean exposure, and has high temporal reproducibility.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 16.,"OBJECTIVE: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with mutated nucleophosmin gene (NPM1) has distinctive clinical, hematological and molecular features, and is included as a provisional entity in 2008 World Health Organization classification. In this study, we analyzed the frequency and features of AML with mutated NPM1 in Indian patients. METHODS: One-hundred consecutive patients of de-novo AML were evaluated for NPM1 mutation and their features were compared with unmutated NPM1 patients. RESULTS: AML with mutated NPM1 was seen in 21% cases. There was female preponderance with median age of 51 years. Distinguishing Features in mutated group were less bleeding manifestations and bone pains; more lymphadenopathy; higher median total leukocyte and platelet count; less frequency of pancytopenia and more preserved megakaryocytes. Morphologically, cup-shaped nuclei in peripheral blood blasts correlated with NPM1 mutation (p <0.01), but not bone marrow blasts. Among the French-American-British subtypes, NPM1 mutation was seen in M1, M4 and M2 subtypes but not in M0 and M3. Immunophenotypically, there was statistically significant negativity for CD34, strong association with monocytic markers (especially CD11c), CD123 was seen at higher frequency and higher mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values for CD33 were observed in mutated cases. CONCLUSIONS: Important findings in this study that have not been highlighted in detail in previous studies in NPM1-mutated cases include less bleeding manifestations and bone pains, lower frequency of pancytopenia and more preserved magakaryocytes, higher CD123 expression and higher MFI values for CD33.

Epub 2015 Dec 3.,"BACKGROUND: Limited data exist regarding impact of IDH mutations in Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (Ph-negative MPNs). Prognostic significance of IDH mutations was asessed in 184 Ph-negative MPN patients - 107 essential thrombocythemia (ET) and 77 primary myelofibrosis (PMF). METHODS: High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis was used to detect IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. RESULTS: PMF and ET patients showed no significant difference for prevalence of IDH mutations. Mutant IDH (IDH1 or IDH2) was documented in five of PMF (6.5%) and two of ET patients (1.9%). IDH mutations in ET patients included one IDH1 R132C and one IDH2 R140Q. Of the five IDH-mutated PMF patients, four (80%) displayed IDH1 (three IDH1 R132C and one IDH1 R132S) and one (20%) carried IDH2 (IDH2 R140Q) mutation. Sixty percent (three in five) of IDH-mutated PMF patients carried JAK2V617F with following allele burdens: 31-50%, 5-12.5% and 31-50%, respectively. Three of 77 PMF patients (3.9%) simultaneously harbored IDH and JAK2V617F mutations. IDH mutations in PMF showed a trend towards higher rate in females (100% and 52.8%, respectively). Bleeding complications were significantly higher in IDH-mutated PMF patients compared to IDH wild-type counterparts. Trend towards a lower prevalance of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) use was present in IDH mutant PMF patients compared to wild-type counterparts (20% and 63.9%, respectively). Death rate was higher in IDH-mutated PMF patients compared to IDH wild-type PMF patients (60% and 15.3%). In univariate analysis, a significantly shorter leukemia-free survival (LFS) was observed in IDH-mutated PMF patients. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that IDH mutations indicate a risk for leukemic transformation in PMF.",['NOTNLM'],"['IDH1', 'IDH2', 'Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 14.,"PURPOSE: Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are in morphologic complete remission are typically considered separately from patients with active disease (ie, >/= 5% marrow blasts by morphology) in treatment algorithms for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), which implies distinct outcomes for these two groups. It is well recognized that the presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) at the time of transplantation is associated with adverse post-HCT outcome for those patients in morphologic remission. This effect of pre-HCT MRD prompted us to compare outcomes in consecutive patients in MRD-positive remission with patients with active AML who underwent myeloablative allogeneic HCT at our institution. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 359 consecutive adults with AML who underwent myeloablative allogeneic HCT from a peripheral blood or bone marrow donor between 2006 and 2014. Pre-HCT disease staging included 10-color multiparametric flow cytometry on bone marrow aspirates in all patients. Any level of residual disease was considered to be MRD positive. RESULTS: Three-year relapse estimates were 67% in 76 patients in MRD-positive morphologic remission and 65% in 48 patients with active AML compared with 22% in 235 patients in MRD-negative remission. Three-year overall survival estimates were 26%, 23%, and 73% in these three groups, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, MRD-negative remission status remained statistically significantly associated with longer overall and progression-free survival as well as lower risk of relapse compared with MRD-positive morphologic remission status or having active disease, with similar outcomes between the latter two groups. CONCLUSION: The similarities in outcomes between patients in MRD-positive morphologic remission and those with active disease at the time of HCT support the use of treatment algorithms that use MRD- rather than morphology-based disease assessments.",,,['(c) 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],,,"['J Clin Oncol. 2016 Feb 1;34(4):300-2.

Epub 2015 Dec 14.,"Gene delivery into hCD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) using human immunodeficiency virus, type 1-derived lentiviral vectors (LVs) has several promising therapeutic applications. Numerous clinical trials are currently underway. However, the efficiency, safety, and cost of LV gene therapy could be ameliorated by enhancing target cell transduction levels and reducing the amount of LV used on the cells. Several transduction enhancers already exist, such as fibronectin fragments or cationic compounds. Recently, we discovered Vectofusin-1, a new transduction enhancer, also called LAH4-A4, a short histidine-rich amphipathic peptide derived from the LAH4 family of DNA transfection agents. Vectofusin-1 enhances the infectivity of lentiviral and gamma-retroviral vectors pseudotyped with various envelope glycoproteins. In this study, we compared a family of Vectofusin-1 isomers and showed that Vectofusin-1 remains the lead peptide for HSPC transduction enhancement with LVs pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoproteins and also with modified gibbon ape leukemia virus glycoproteins. By comparing the capacity of numerous Vectofusin-1 variants to promote the modified gibbon ape leukemia virus glycoprotein-pseudotyped lentiviral vector infectivity of HSPCs, the lysine residues on the N-terminal extremity of Vectofusin-1, a hydrophilic angle of 140 degrees formed by the histidine residues in the Schiffer-Edmundson helical wheel representation, hydrophobic residues consisting of leucine were all found to be essential and helped to define a minimal active sequence. The data also show that the critical determinants necessary for lentiviral transduction enhancement are partially different from those necessary for efficient antibiotic or DNA transfection activity of LAH4 derivatives. In conclusion, these results help to decipher the action mechanism of Vectofusin-1 in the context of hCD34+ cell-based gene therapy.",['NOTNLM'],"['Vectofusin-1', 'gene therapy', 'gene transfer', 'hematopoietic stem cells', 'lentiviral vector', 'peptides', 'retrovirus']","['(c) 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0242-386X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

They work by activating T cells to combat tumors. METHODS: This review is based on publications on recently approved T-cell-activating drugs that were retrieved by a selective search in PubMed. RESULTS: Randomized, controlled trials of ""checkpoint"" inhibitors, i.e., inhibitory antibodies for use against tumors, have shown that the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor ipilimumab can prolong the survival of patients with advanced melanoma by 2 to 4 months. No data on median overall survival are yet available for the two programmed-death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors pembrolizumab und nivolumab; the endpoint ""tumor response"" was achieved in 24% and 32% of patients receiving these drugs, respectively. Grade 3 or 4 adverse effects occurred in 50% of patients receiving ipilimumab and in 12 to 13% of those taking either of the two PD-1-inhibitors. Nivolumab prolonged the median survival of patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer from 6 to 9 months. In refractory or recurrent Philadelphia-chromosome-negative pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B-ALL), treatment with the bispecific antibody construct blinatumomab led to complete remission in 43% of the patients, while grade 3, 4 or 5 toxicities occurred in 83%. CONCLUSION: T-cell-directed strategies have been established as a new pillar of treatment in medical oncology. As these drugs have frequent and severe adverse effects, therapeutic decision-making will have to take account not only of the predicted prolongation of survival, but also of the potential for an impaired quality of life while the patient is under treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, two technologies, MNPs and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), were combined to increase detection sensitivity and specificity. A novel technique based on the MNPs-PCR enzyme-linked gene assay (MELGA) was developed for detection of the BCR/ABL abnormal gene in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients. METHODS: An MNPs-labeled BCR forward primer and a biotin-labeled ABL reverse primer were used to specifically amplify the target gene. After magnetic separation, the PCR product bound to MNPs labeled with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase was incubated with the peroxidase substrate and hydrogen peroxide to generate the colorimetric signal. RESULTS: When compared with real-time quantitative-PCR (RQ-PCR), the MELGA technique exhibited an increased sensitivity of <1 fg with high specificity for the BCR/ABL fusion gene in CML patients. In addition, MELGA colorimetric results correlated well with the number of copies obtained from RQ-PCR. CONCLUSION: This simple and cost-effective technique is suitable for monitoring CML patients during targeted therapy (tyrosine kinase inhibitors) especially in rural hospitals.",['NOTNLM'],"['BCR/ABL fusion gene', 'RQ-PCR', 'chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'colorimetric analysis', 'magnetic nanoparticles']","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 15.,"Inhibition of the proteasome has emerged as a clinically effective anticancer therapeutic approach in recent years. Bortezomib (Velcade(R)) showed extremely high potency against a wide range of cancer cell lines. Ixazomib (MLN9708-MLN2238), the second-generation proteasome inhibitor, selectivity and potency were similar to that of bortezomib, is currently being investigated in phase I studies. It shows superior antitumor activity in hematologic malignancy, especially multiple myelomas. In this study, for the first time, we evaluated and compared the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of the novel proteasome inhibitor MLN2238 (the active form of MLN9708) with bortezomib using in vitro chronic myeloid leukemia. Cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of MLN2238 and bortezomib were determined by trypan blue dye exclusion assays, WST-1 cell proliferation assay, increased AnnexinV-PI binding capacity, changes in caspase-3 activity and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (JC-1). Associated with proteasome pathway NFkappaB1 and c-myc mRNA expression levels were examined by the qRT-PCR method. We observed that cytotoxic and apoptotic effects on K562 cells were started at 5 mum of MLN2238 and 1 mum of bortezomib after 24 and 48 h. Also, MLN2238 and bortezomib downregulated NFkappaB1 and c-myc mRNA expression at 24 h. Our result revealed that MLN22238 and bortezomib had significant cytotoxic and apoptotic effects on K562 cells. Here, we first demonstrate in vitro data that support the development of MLN2238, by direct comparison with bortezomib on K562 cells.",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'K562', 'MLN9708', 'bortezomib', 'proteasome inhibitor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While modes of action have been extensively described for human SAMHD1, only little is known about the regulation of SAMHD1 in the mouse. Here, we characterize the antiviral activity of murine SAMHD1 with the help of knockout mice to shed light on the regulation and the mechanism of the SAMHD1 restriction and to validate the SAMHD1 knockout mouse model for the use in future infectivity studies. RESULTS: We found that endogenous mouse SAMHD1 restricts not only HIV-1 but also MLV reporter virus infection at the level of reverse transcription in primary myeloid cells. Similar to the human protein, the antiviral activity of murine SAMHD1 is regulated through phosphorylation at threonine 603 and is limited to nondividing cells. Comparing the susceptibility to infection with intracellular dNTP levels and SAMHD1 phosphorylation in different cell types shows that both functions are important determinants of the antiviral activity of murine SAMHD1. In contrast, we found the proposed RNase activity of SAMHD1 to be less important and could not detect any effect of mouse or human SAMHD1 on the level of incoming viral RNA. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that SAMHD1 in the mouse blocks retroviral infection at the level of reverse transcription and is regulated through cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation. We show that the antiviral restriction mediated by murine SAMHD1 is mechanistically similar to what is known for the human protein, making the SAMHD1 knockout mouse model a valuable tool to characterize the influence of SAMHD1 on the replication of different viruses in vivo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 14.,"BACKGROUND: Mutations in the nucleophosmin (NPM1) gene have been used as molecular biomarkers for prognostication of patients with adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: We designed a rapid and sensitive method using the allele-specific-refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) to detect the most common mutations of NPM1 gene, which are mostly four base pair insertions and compared its efficacy with direct sequencing and capillary electrophoresis which served as the gold standards. RESULTS: The incidence of mutation was 22% (33% of patients with normal karyotypes had mutation compared with 16% of patients with abnormal karyotypes) based on the results obtained with capillary electrophoresis analysis and direct sequencing. All of the specimens determined to be mutation-positive by the gold standard tests were also positive by the ARMS-PCR method. Significantly, the ARMS-PCR test also helped determine the mutation status of an extra set of patients who had low call rates on capillary electrophoresis and appeared normal on direct sequencing. DISCUSSION: The low mutation rate in some patients hindered its detection in the gold standard assays because of the interference of the mutation signal by high background noise. The low sensitivity of the gold standard assays for detecting low copy number mutations rates thus increase their risk of producing false negative results that adversely affects prognostication and therapy. Our results suggest that the mutation detection rate of the ARMS-PCR assay is better than existing tests. This is most probably because of the fact that in an ARMS-PCR-based method, the mutated variant is specifically amplified, based on a mutation-specific primer. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the high sensitivity of the ARMS-based method together with its rapidity and low expense should make it a suitable choice for clinical laboratories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with AML received bone marrow aspiration and the percentages of CD34(+) CD123(+) and CD33(+) CD123(+) cells were tested using flow cytometry method. A total of 24 refractory or relapsed AML patients were enrolled and treated with one cycle of standard chemotherapy combined with CZBG. Bone marrow samples were obtained before and after treatment, and the percentages of CD34(+) CD123(+) and CD33(+) CD123(+) cells were examined by flflow cytometry. RESULTS: Compared with refractory or relapsed AML patients, patients achieved remission had a significant lower percentage of CD34(+) CD123(+) cells(P<0.01) and CD33(+) CD123(+) cells (P<0.01), indicating that controlling the LSC percentage may be important for patients with AML to achieve sustainable remission. Compared with those before treatment, the expression levels of CD34(+) CD123(+) were significantly decreased after CZBG combined with chemotherapy treatment (P<0.01). The percentages of CD34(+) CD123(+) cells and CD33(+) CD123(+) in patients achieving complete remission after CZBG combined with chemotherapy treatment were both significantly lower than those in patients with nonremission (P<0.01).

We investigated the prognostic significance of Trp catabolism in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We quantified serum Trp and Kyn in 96 ATL patients, 38 human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 asymptomatic carriers (HTLV-1 ACs), and 40 healthy adult volunteers. The relationships between various clinical parameters were analyzed. IDO expression was evaluated in the affected lymph nodes of ATL patients. RESULTS: Serum Kyn concentrations and Kyn/Trp ratios were significantly higher in HTLV-1 ACs than in healthy controls. Both increased significantly with progression from HTLV-1 AC to ATL. There were no significant differences in serum Trp concentrations between ATL patients, HTLV-1 ACs and controls. IDO was possibly produced by ATL and/or cells in the microenvironment. Multivariate analyses demonstrated a high serum Kyn/Trp ratio and high Kyn level, but not a high Trp level, to be significant independent detrimental prognostic factors in ATL and aggressive variant ATL. CONCLUSIONS: Quantification of serum Kyn and Trp is prognostically useful for individual ATL patients. Furthermore, ATL is an appropriate disease for testing novel cancer immunotherapies targeting IDO.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These mutations frequently occur in epigenetic regulator genes, and functions of the proteins encoded by these genes in hematopoietic cells have been extensively analyzed, as reported recently. It is noteworthy that several epigenetic regulator genes, such as DNMT3A, TET2 and ASXL1, have also been identified in pre-leukemic stem cells. As targeting pre-leukemic stem cells would be a promising therapeutic approach, further investigations of epigenetic abnormalities in hematopoietic cells are anticipated to lead to the development of novel epigenetic therapies.

Clofarabine is effective in inducing remission thus enabling bridging to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We report the results in treating Hong Kong Chinese pediatric patients with r/rALL by clofarabine/cyclophosphamide/etoposide (CLO-218) combination therapy. A retrospective review of patients treated between January 2009 and December 2014 in the two tertiary referral pediatric oncology units in Hong Kong. Thirteen patients were identified. All were Chinese and seven were male. Median age at clofarabine treatment was 8 years and the median duration of follow-up was 10 months. Nine patients had B-ALL and four had T-ALL. All were refractory to the preceding regimen(s). The median number of prior treatment regimens was 2; two patients had previous HSCT. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in five patients, Complete remission with incomplete counts (CRi) in two, PR in two, and non-remission (NR) in two. All four patients with T-ALL responded with three patients achieving CR. Eight out of nine patients who responded could be bridged to HSCT. Among those who were transplanted, four remained alive and in remission, three relapsed post-HSCT, and one died from transplant-related mortality. Treatment toxicities were common including febrile neutropenia in all subjects and culture-proven bacteremia in five patients. Hepatotoxicity was mild and reversible with no case of veno-occlusive disease. The clofarabine-based regimen is a promising strategy to induce disease remission in r/rALL and bridge to HSCT. Septic complications are, however, frequent necessitating prompt management with adequate supportive care in specialized centers.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Clofarabine', 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Pediatric', 'Refractory', 'Relapse']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical data were obtained from a Phase 2 study of fixed-dose radotinib in 77 Asian patients with CML. The magnitude of radotinib dose adjusted for patient's body weight (Dose/BW) and the probability of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) demonstrated a positive association (Logit[P] = 0.86*[Dose/BW]-4.45, p = 0.001).

Four hundred and sixteen patients were diagnosed with AML, between 2007 and 2011. In those aged </=60 years (n = 20) with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) overall survival (OS) was 100%. For non-APL patients aged </=60 years, OS for those with favorable, intermediate and adverse cytogenetics was not reached, 17 and 9.8 months, respectively (p = 0.0001). Of particular note, intensively treated patients aged >60 years with intermediate cytogenetics and FLT3-/NPM1+ status had a five-year survival of 60% versus median OS of 11 months for other subsets (p = 0.04). Population-based studies reduce selection bias and have utility in studying rarer diseases, particularly in populations that recruit poorly to trials.

However, expression of AML1-ETO is not sufficient to induce transformation in vivo. Consistent with this observation, patients with this translocation harbor additional genetic abnormalities, suggesting a requirement for cooperating mutations. To better define the genetic landscape in AML and distinguish driver from passenger mutations, we compared the mutational profiles of AML1-ETO-driven mouse models of leukemia with the mutational profiles of human AML patients. We identified TET2 and PTPN11 mutations in both mouse and human AML and then demonstrated the ability of Tet2 loss and PTPN11 D61Y to initiate leukemogenesis in concert with expression of AML1-ETO in vivo. This integrative genetic profiling approach allowed us to accurately predict cooperating events in t(8;21)(+) AML in a robust and unbiased manner, while also revealing functional convergence in mouse and human AML.",,,['(c) 2016 Hatlen et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is increasing interest to introduce appropriate bioenergetic assays to describe the therapeutic effect and metabolic subtypes of tumours in clinical oncology. The analysis of 14C-glucose and 14C-acetate oxidation could be a suitable method to examine the metabolic/bioenergetic profiles of tumour cells and tumorous host organisms. The metabolic activity of tumour cells (in vitro cell lines, primary human lymphocytes and leukaemia cells) and the tumourous host organism were examined in vitro and in vivo by detecting the released CO2 levels derived from the radioactive carbon atom labelled energy substrates. We have found that the most cancer cells of solid tumours oxidised glucose more intensively than acetate. It was interesting that AML, CML and CLL cells isolated from blood preferred acetate as an energy substrate in vitro. Furthermore, based on our observations, tumours affected the glucose or acetate oxidation of the organism when applying bioenergetic substrates per os or iv. We provided the first data about the alterations in metabolic profiles of the tumour bearing organism in xenograft models. In summary, according to our results, comparison of the energy substrate oxidation can be an indicative method related to the metabolic profile analysis of tumour cells in vitro and tumorous host organism in vivo.",,,,,,,,,,,,A bioenergetikai profil vizsgalata 14C-glukoz es 14C-acetat oxidaciojanak osszehasonlitasaval tumorsejtekben es tumoros szervezetben.,,,,,

During the TKI era, protocols for assessing response and resistance to treatment were developed. Additional chromosomal abnormalities (ACAs) are strongly associated with disease progression but their prognostic impact and influence on treatment response are yet to be defined. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of ACAs on time to achieve complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), treatment and overall survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Since 2005 until 2013, the data from the Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Department of Fundeni Clinical Institute was collected. In this observational retrospective single centre study, 28 CML patients with ACAs at diagnosis and during TKI treatment were included. RESULTS: From ACAs at diagnosis group, the most frequent major route ACAs were trisomy 8, trisomy 19 and second Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and the most frequent minor route ACAs were monosomies and structural abnormalities (inversions and translocations). From the ACAs during the TKI group, the most frequent major route cytogenetic abnormalities in Ph positive and negative cells were trisomy 8, trisomy 19 and second Ph chromosome and the most frequent minor route cytogenetic abnormalities in Ph positive and negative cells were marker chromosomes and structural abnormalities (inversions, translocations and dicentric chromosomes). CONCLUSIONS: In both groups, the time to CCyR was longer and long-term results were inferior in comparison with standard patients but the differences were not significant and in accordance to published data. The 12 months follow-up after the study's end showed that 26 patients were alive and in long-term CCyR and 2 deaths were reported.

METHODS: Morphological and flow cytometric enumeration and characterization of peripheral blood (PB) neoplastic PCs were performed in 3 PCM patients after complete blood count (CBC) evaluation. RESULTS: Early suspicion of circulating PCs by initial CBC scatter plots and monocytosis led to morphological enumeration of PCs, with low level of concordance between morphologists. Flow cytometric PB analysis permitted accurate quantification and characterization of circulating clonal PCs. CONCLUSIONS: CBC findings can prompt early suspicion of circulating PCs in PCM patients leading to early and accurate flow cytometric analysis of clonal PCs in addition to morphological PB evaluation. The suggested combined approach proved to be most important in the PCL case with discordant morphological evaluations and marginal PC numbers according to current criteria.

During the current pregnancy, she had persistent fever and cough. Although she had treatment with antibiotics, peripheral white blood cell count remained high, with an abnormal lymphocyte count. Given that she was an HTLV-1 carrier, she was diagnosed with unfavorable chronic ATL (aggressive ATL) at 12 weeks gestation. After pregnancy termination, her ATL status became favorable chronic ATL (indolent ATL). Therefore, watchful waiting was performed until disease progression.

Lack of SLCO1B1 expression in leukemic blasts suggested the association might be due to an inherited rather than a somatic effect. rs2291075 was in strong linkage with known functional variants rs2306283 (c.388A>G) and rs4149056 (c.521T>C). Functional studies in vitro determined that four AML-directed chemotherapeutics (cytarabine, daunorubicin, etoposide, and mitoxantrone) are substrates for OATP1B1 and the mouse ortholog Oatp1b2. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies using Oatp1b2-deficient mice further confirmed our results. Collectively, these findings demonstrate an important role for OATP1B1 in the systemic pharmacokinetics of multiple drugs used in the treatment of AML and suggest that inherited variability in host transporter function influences the effectiveness of therapy.",,,['(c) 2015 The American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is unclear if a second course of chemotherapy for early persistent disease will alter outcome in these patients. We conducted a retrospective study of AML patients undergoing induction chemotherapy where diagnostic, interim (around day 14), and recovery (days 21-42) bone marrow (BM) evaluations were available for review. Of the 113 patients included in the final analysis, 99 (87.6%) achieved CR at hematologic recovery. At D14, 90 patients (79.6%) had <5% blasts and of these, 87 (96.7%) ultimately achieved CR. At D14, Twenty-three (20.4%) patients had residual leukemia (>5% blasts). Of these, 11 (47.8%) received a second course of chemotherapy (double induction [DI]) and 12 (52.2%) were observed until count recovery (single induction [SI]). No significant difference in CR rates was observed between these two groups (58.3% DI group vs. 45.5% SI group, P value = 0.684). In our analysis, D14 BM evaluation did not uniformly identify patients with primary induction failure. To unequivocally determine the value of a D14 marrow assessment in AML, prospective studies in the context of large cooperative group trials are required. Considering our findings and similar reports from others, we propose that D14 marrow assessment should be individualized, and that other factors, such as cytogenetics and early peripheral blood blast clearance should be considered, to identify patients most likely to benefit from interim disease assessment during AML induction therapy.",,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, more recent studies reported conflicting results regarding the association between age and outcomes in elderly patients. Therefore, we conducted a large-scale, nationwide retrospective study to examine the impact of age on outcomes of allo-HSCT with reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) for AML patients who were older than 50 years. Of the 757 patients, 89 patients (11.8%) were 50-54, 249 patients (32.9%) were 55-59, 301 patients (39.8%) were 60-64 and 118 patients (15.6%) were >/=65 years old. The 3-year overall survival (OS) (47.8, 45.2, 37.9, and 36.6% for patients aged 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, and >/=65 years, respectively, P = 0.24) and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) (24.0, 22.8, 29.2, and 27.6% for patients aged 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, and >/=65 years, respectively, P = 0.49) were not significantly different among the four age groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that increased age had no significant effect on OS or NRM after adjusting for covariates. These results suggested that advanced patient age is not a contraindication for RIC allo-HSCT in elderly AML patients.",,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The SNP-938 (C>A) (rs2279115), located in the inhibitory P2 promoter of the BCL2 gene, influences differential binding affinities of transcriptional factors thereby affecting BCL2 expression. The present study is an attempt to evaluate the association between BCL2(-938C>A) polymorphism and clinical characteristics of breast cancer patients as well as to analyze BCL2 expression and Ki67 proliferation index with respect to the genotypes. One hundred ten primary breast cancer tumor tissues were genotyped for -938 C>A polymorphism through PCR-RFLP method as well as evaluated for BCL2 expression and ki67 proliferation index by immunohistochemistry. Evaluation of apoptosis level was performed by flowcytometry. The results revealed that AA genotype was associated with an increased risk (AA Vs AC + CC) by 2.86-fold (p = 0.07) for breast cancer development which reflected in elevated A allele frequency also. AA genotype was found to be predominant among BCL2 positive tumors as compared to BCL2 negative tumors. Further, AA genotype was found to be associated with advanced stage tumors, node positive status, and high Ki67 proliferation index compared to CA and CC genotypes indicating that elevated expression of BCL2 gene in the presence of A allele might be associated with decreased apoptosis and enhanced proliferation rate. AA genotype of BCL2-938C>A polymorphism might influence BCL2 gene expression there by associated with elevated risk for breast cancer progression. Probably, failure of apoptosis due to enhanced expression and antiapoptotic protein BCL2 might promote malignant growth.",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'BCL2', 'Breast cancer', 'Flow cytometry', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ki67 proliferation index']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blastic cells were in a CD45-negative and SSC-low fraction, and positive for CD10, CD19, CD34, and HLA-DR expression and rearrangement in the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. Chemotherapy using the HyperCVAD/MA regimen led to a complete cytogenetic response, and after cord blood transplantation, she obtained a complete molecular remission. However, the crisis recurred 6 months later. Another salvage therapy using L-AdVP regimen followed by nilotinib led to a complete molecular remission. Retrospective analyses using flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction revealed a minimal blastic crisis clone present in the initial marrow in chronic phase. This case is informative as it suggests that sudden blastic crisis may occur from an undetectable blastic clone present at initial diagnosis and that leukemic stem cells may survive cytotoxic chemotherapy that eliminates most of the blastic cells.",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'Dasatinib', 'Flow cytometry', 'Gene rearrangement', 'Sudden blastic crisis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shorter duration combination monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy using alemtuzumab and rituximab has been shown to be effective and tolerable treatment for CLL. Standard dose anti-CD20 mAb therapy causes loss of CD20 expression by surviving CLL cells, which can be minimized by decreasing the mAb dose. We report a randomized phase II clinical trial enrolling older (>/= 65 years) patients (median age 76 years, n = 31) with treatment naive progressive CLL. Patients received 8-12 weeks of standard subcutaneous alemtuzumab with either intravenous standard (375 mg/m(2) weekly)(n = 16) or low dose (20 mg/m(2) 3x week)(n = 15) rituximab. This study was closed before full accrual because the manufacturer withdrew alemtuzumab for treatment of CLL. The overall response rate was 90% with an 45% complete response rate, median progression-free survival of 17.9 months and no significant differences in outcome between the low and standard dose rituximab arms. The major toxicities were cytopenia and infection with one treatment fatality caused by progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy but no other opportunistic infections. Combination mAb therapy was effective and tolerable treatment for older and frailer patients with progressive CLL, achieving a high rate of complete remissions. These data support the role of mAb in therapy for less fit CLL patients and the further study of low dose higher frequency anti-CD20 mAb therapy as a potentially more effective use of anti-CD20 mAb in the treatment of CLL.",,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,['2017/03/01 00:00'],,,,,,,

At that time, the patient was in complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR) of CML clone according to European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations and presented clinical and hematological signs of progressive CLL clone. After 24 months of regular monitoring, the patient presented signs of CLL clone expansion. The FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) analysis for CLL prognostic factors, performed before treatment, was positive for tumor protein p53 (TP53) and 13q14.3 mutations. The Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) was considered but TP53 mutation was considered acquired and patient's reduced overall, progression free and disease free survival might sustained that hypothesis.

Fat accumulation can affect bone through the direct effect of adipokines or indirectly through the state of chronic inflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of body composition and adipokines on bone mass in survivors of acute lymphocytic leukemia. This was a cross-sectional study of 56 survivors aged between 15 and 24 years, 44.6 % of whom received cranial radiotherapy (18-24 Gy), assessed according to body fat, lean mass, and bone mineral density (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry), computed tomography scan-derived abdominal adipose tissue, and adipokines by a multiple regression analysis. Both lumbar spine L1-L4 (trabecular bone) and total body (cortical bone) bone mineral density were positively correlated with visfatin (p < 0.050). Lean mass index was positively correlated, while waist-to-height ratio was negatively correlated with cortical bone (p < 0.010). Low bone mineral density for chronological age was detected in 5.4 % of patients in total body, and 8.9 % at the lumbar spine. In survivors of acute lymphocytic leukemia, visfatin may play an important role in the complex relationship between body composition and bone. At present, visfatin may represent a model for further study of bone metabolism, and could possibly explain the unknown mechanisms linking bone metabolism and cancer.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Adipokines', '*Body composition', '*Bone density', '*Metabolic syndrome X', '*Precursor cell lymphoblastic leukemia-lymphoma/complications']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis during outpatient management has not completely protected patients against admission due to infections and neutropenic fever, emphasizing the need to approach infection protection with complementary efforts. In a randomized controlled design, we examined the applicability of patient-performed daily spirometry [forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)] as an early warning tool and explored the effectiveness of positive expiratory pressure (PEP) in preventing pneumonia among 80 AML patients. Twenty-five incidences of pneumonia were detected among 23 patients (6 interventions, 17 controls), giving a prevalence of 28.75% during 5420 days of observation. We found a significant difference in incidence between intervention versus control group (2.17 per 1000 days vs. 6.52 per 1000 days, P = 0.021, respectively). A cross point at 80-76% of the personal FEV1 reference value showed high sensitivity and specificity on pneumonia development. Our data demonstrate the feasibility of educating AML patients in their continuous daily measurement of FEV1 and use of PEP. Daily measures of FEV1 may be an important early warning tool for assessment of pulmonary deterioration during critical phases of neutropenia. We suggest that strategic patient education in the use of spirometry and PEP should be part of standard of care for AML patients undergoing induction chemotherapy.",,,"['(c) 2015 The Authors.

Epub 2015 Dec 30.,"Vitamin A is required for normal body function, including vision, epithelial integrity, growth, and differentiation. All trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), a family member of vitamin A, has been explored in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia and other types of cancer. Dysregulated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and disrupted cadherin-catenin complex often contribute to colorectal malignancy. MED28, a mammalian Mediator subunit, is found highly expressed in breast and colorectal cancers. Our laboratory has also reported that MED28 regulates cell growth, migration, and invasion in human breast cancer cells. In the current study we investigated the effect of ATRA on MED28 and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in colorectal cancer. HCT116, HT29, SW480, and SW620, four human colorectal cancer cell lines representing different stages of carcinogenesis and harboring critical genetic changes, were employed. Our data indicated that regardless of genetic variations among these cells, suppression of MED28 reduced the expression of cyclin D1, c-Myc, and nuclear beta-catenin, but increased the expression of E-cadherin and HMG box-containing protein 1 (HBP1) where HBP1 has been described as a negative regulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. The reporter activity of an HBP1 promoter increased upon MED28 knockdown, but decreased upon MED28 overexpression. ATRA reduced the expression of MED28 and mimicked the effect of MED28 suppression in down-regulating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.

Epub 2015 Dec 11.,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) persisting or relapsing following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has a dismal prognosis. Success with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells offers an opportunity to treat these patients with leukemia-redirected donor-derived T cells, which may be more functional than T cells derived from patients with leukemia but have the potential to mediate graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We, together with others, have previously demonstrated tumor-specific T-cell dysfunction in the allogeneic environment. Here, we studied CAR T-cell function following BMT using an immunocompetent murine model of minor mismatched allogeneic transplantation followed by donor-derived CD19-CAR T cells. Allogeneic donor-derived CD19-CAR T cells eliminated residual ALL with equal potency to those administered after syngeneic BMT. Surprisingly, allogeneic CAR T cells mediated lethal acute GVHD with early mortality, which is atypical for this minor mismatch model. We demonstrated that both allogeneic and syngeneic CAR T cells show initial expansion as effector T cells, with a higher peak but rapid deletion of allogeneic CAR T cells. Interestingly, CAR-mediated acute GVHD was only seen in the presence of leukemia, suggesting CAR-target interactions induced GVHD. Indeed, serum interleukin (IL)-6 was elevated only in the presence of both leukemia and CAR T cells, and IL-6 neutralization ameliorated the severity of GVHD in a delayed donor lymphocyte infusion model. Finally, allogeneic CD4(+) CAR T cells were responsible for GVHD, which correlated with their ability to produce IL-6 upon CAR stimulation. Altogether, we demonstrate that donor-derived allogeneic CAR T cells are active but have the capacity to drive GVHD.",,,,,,['Blood. 2016 Mar 10;127(10):1224-5. PMID: 26965922'],,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 9.,"PURPOSE: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells depend on microenvironmental interactions for proliferation and survival that are at least partially mediated through B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, disrupts BCR signaling and leads to the egress of tumor cells from the microenvironment. Although the on-target effects on CLL cells are well defined, the impact on the microenvironment is less well studied. We therefore sought to characterize the in vivo effects of ibrutinib on the tumor microenvironment. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients received single-agent ibrutinib on an investigator-initiated phase II trial. Serial blood and tissue samples were collected pretreatment and during treatment. Changes in cytokine levels, cellular subsets, and microenvironmental interactions were assessed. RESULTS: Serum levels of key chemokines and inflammatory cytokines decreased significantly in patients on ibrutinib. Furthermore, ibrutinib treatment decreased circulating tumor cells and overall T-cell numbers. Most notably, a reduced frequency of the Th17 subset of CD4(+)T cells was observed concurrent with reduced expression of activation markers and PD-1 on T cells. Consistent with direct inhibition of T cells, ibrutinib inhibited Th17 differentiation of murine CD4(+)T cells in vitro Finally, in the bone marrow microenvironment, we found that ibrutinib disaggregated the interactions of macrophages and CLL cells, inhibited secretion of CXCL13, and decreased the chemoattraction of CLL cells. CONCLUSIONS: In conjunction with inhibition of BCR signaling, these changes in the tumor microenvironment likely contribute to the antitumor activity of ibrutinib and may impact the efficacy of immunotherapeutic strategies in patients with CLL.

Epub 2015 Dec 9.,"Small-molecule inhibitors of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and mTOR pathway currently in the clinic produce a paradoxical reactivation of the pathway they are intended to suppress. Furthermore, fresh experimental evidence with PI3K antagonists in melanoma, glioblastoma, and prostate cancer shows that mitochondrial metabolism drives an elaborate process of tumor adaptation culminating with drug resistance and metastatic competency. This is centered on reprogramming of mitochondrial functions to promote improved cell survival and to fuel the machinery of cell motility and invasion. Key players in these responses are molecular chaperones of the Hsp90 family compartmentalized in mitochondria, which suppress apoptosis via phosphorylation of the pore component, Cyclophilin D, and enable the subcellular repositioning of active mitochondria to membrane protrusions implicated in cell motility. An inhibitor of mitochondrial Hsp90s in preclinical development (gamitrinib) prevents adaptive mitochondrial reprogramming and shows potent antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Other therapeutic strategies to target mitochondria for cancer therapy include small-molecule inhibitors of mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) IDH1 (AG-120) and IDH2 (AG-221), which opened new therapeutic prospects for patients with high-risk acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). A second approach of mitochondrial therapeutics focuses on agents that elevate toxic ROS levels from a leaky electron transport chain; nevertheless, the clinical experience with these compounds, including a quinone derivative, ARQ 501, and a copper chelator, elesclomol (STA-4783) is limited. In light of this evidence, we discuss how best to target a resurgence of mitochondrial bioenergetics for cancer therapy.",,,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of these mutations localize in the zinc finger (ZnF) domains, which mediate GATA-2 DNA binding. Deregulated hematopoiesis with GATA-2 mutation frequently develops in adulthood, yet GATA-2 function in the bone marrow remains unresolved. To investigate this, we conditionally deleted the GATA-2 C-terminal ZnF (C-ZnF) coding sequences in adult mice. Upon Gata2 C-ZnF deletion, we observed rapid peripheral cytopenia, bone marrow failure, and decreased c-Kit expression on hematopoietic progenitors. Transplant studies indicated GATA-2 has a cell-autonomous role in bone marrow hematopoiesis. Moreover, myeloid lineage populations were particularly sensitive to Gata2 hemizygosity, while molecular assays indicated GATA-2 regulates c-Kit expression in multilineage progenitor cells. Enforced c-Kit expression in Gata2 C-ZnF-deficient hematopoietic progenitors enhanced myeloid colony activity, suggesting GATA-2 sustains myelopoiesis via a cell intrinsic role involving maintenance of c-Kit expression. Our results provide insight into mechanisms regulating hematopoiesis in bone marrow and may contribute to a better understanding of immunodeficiency and bone marrow failure associated with GATA-2 mutation.",['NOTNLM'],"['GATA-2 mutation', 'c-Kit', 'hematopoiesis', 'myelopoiesis']",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Epub 2015 Dec 10.,"Recent major advances in understanding the molecular basis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) provide a double-edged sword. Although defining the topology and key features of the molecular landscape are fundamental to development of novel treatment approaches and provide opportunities for greater individualization of therapy, confirmation of the genetic complexity presents a huge challenge to successful translation into routine clinical practice. It is now clear that many genes are recurrently mutated in AML; moreover, individual leukemias harbor multiple mutations and are potentially composed of subclones with differing mutational composition, rendering each patient's AML genetically unique. In order to make sense of the overwhelming mutational data and capitalize on this clinically, it is important to identify (1) critical AML-defining molecular abnormalities that distinguish biological disease entities; (2) mutations, typically arising in subclones, that may influence prognosis but are unlikely to be ideal therapeutic targets; (3) mutations associated with preleukemic clones; and (4) mutations that have been robustly shown to confer independent prognostic information or are therapeutically relevant. The reward of identifying AML-defining molecular lesions present in all leukemic populations (including subclones) has been exemplified by acute promyelocytic leukemia, where successful targeting of the underlying PML-RARalpha oncoprotein has eliminated the need for chemotherapy for disease cure. Despite the molecular heterogeneity and recognizing that treatment options for other forms of AML are limited, this review will consider the scope for using novel molecular information to improve diagnosis, identify subsets of patients eligible for targeted therapies, refine outcome prediction, and track treatment response.",,,['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0312-161X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 10.,"Recent advances in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) biology and its genetic landscape should ultimately lead to more subset-specific AML therapies, ideally tailored to each patient's disease. Although a growing number of distinct AML subsets have been increasingly characterized, patient management has remained disappointingly uniform. If one excludes acute promyelocytic leukemia, current AML management still relies largely on intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), at least in younger patients who can tolerate such intensive treatments. Nevertheless, progress has been made, notably in terms of standard drug dose intensification and safer allogeneic HSCT procedures, allowing a larger proportion of patients to achieve durable remission. In addition, improved identification of patients at relatively low risk of relapse should limit their undue exposure to the risks of HSCT in first remission. The role of new effective agents, such as purine analogs or gemtuzumab ozogamicin, is still under investigation, whereas promising new targeted agents are under clinical development. In contrast, minimal advances have been made for patients unable to tolerate intensive treatment, mostly representing older patients. The availability of hypomethylating agents likely represents an encouraging first step for this latter population, and it is hoped will allow for more efficient combinations with novel agents.",,,['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has led to targeted therapy against mutant driver proteins as well as the development of drugs such as CPX-351 and SGN-CD33A whose mechanisms of action and efficacy may not be dependent on mutational complexity.

Patients with favorable subtypes of AML generally receive chemotherapeutic consolidation, although recent studies have also suggested favorable outcome after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Although allogeneic HSCT (alloHSCT) is considered the preferred type of postremission therapy in poor- and very-poor-risk AML, the place of alloHSCT in intermediate-risk AML is being debated, and autologous HSCT is considered a valuable alternative that may be preferred in patients without minimal residual disease after induction chemotherapy. Here, we review postremission transplantation strategies using either autologous or allogeneic stem cells. Recent developments in the field of alternative donors, including cord blood and haploidentical donors, are highlighted, and we discuss reduced-intensity alloHSCT in older AML recipients who represent the predominant category of patients with AML who have a high risk of relapse in first remission.",,,['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 11.,"Downregulation of the unfolded protein response mediates proteasome inhibitor resistance in multiple myeloma. The Human Immunodeficieny Virus protease inhibitor nelfinavir activates the unfolded protein response in vitro. We determined dose-limiting toxicity and recommended dose for phase II of nelfinavir in combination with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Twelve patients with advanced hematologic malignancies were treated with nelfinavir (2500-5000 mg/day p.o., days 1-14, 3+3 dose escalation) and bortezomib (1.3 mg/m(2), days 1, 4, 8, 11; 21-day cycles). A run in phase with nelfinavir monotherapy allowed pharmakokinetic/pharmakodynamic assessment of nelfinavir in the presence or absence of concomittant bortezomib. End points included dose-limiting toxicity, activation of the unfolded protein response, proteasome activity, toxicity and response to trial treatment. Nelfinavir 2x2500 mg was the recommended phase II dose identified. Nelfinavir alone significantly up-regulated expression of proteins related to the unfolded protein response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and inhibited proteasome activity. Of 10 evaluable patients in the dose escalation cohort, 3 achieved a partial response, 4 stable disease for 2 cycles or more, while 3 had progressive disease as best response. In an exploratory extension cohort with 6 relapsed, bortezomib-refractory, lenalidomide-resistant myeloma patients treated at the recommended phase II dose, 3 reached a partial response, 2 a minor response, and one progressive disease. The combination of nelfinavir with bortezomib is safe and shows promising activity in advanced, bortezomib-refractory multiple myeloma. Induction of the unfolded protein response by nelfinavir may overcome the biological features of proteasome inhibitor resistance.

In line with previous studies in adult recipients of umbilical cord blood transplantation, we found that human cytomegalovirus reactivation accelerated the emergence of mature natural killer cells. Thus, most children displayed a progressive expansion of a memory-like natural killer cell subset expressing NKG2C, a putative receptor for human cytomegalovirus, and CD57, a marker of terminal natural killer cell differentiation. NKG2C(+)CD57(+) natural killer cells were detectable by month 3 following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and expanded until at least month 12. These cells were characterized by high killer Ig-like receptors (KIRs) and leukocyte inhibitory receptor 1 (LIR-1) and low Siglec-7, NKG2A and Interleukin-18Ralpha expression, killed tumor targets and responded to cells expressing HLA-E (a NKG2C ligand). In addition, they were poor Interferon-gamma producers in response to Interleukin-12 and Interleukin-18. The impaired response to these cytokines, together with their highly differentiated profile, may reflect their skewing toward an adaptive condition specialized in controlling human cytomegalovirus.

Epub 2015 Dec 10.,"Does small GTPase K-Ras4A have a single state or two states, one resembling K-Ras4B and the other N-Ras? A recent study of K-Ras4A made the remarkable observation that even in the absence of the palmitoyl, K-Ras4A can be active at the plasma membrane. Importantly, this suggests that K-Ras4A may exist in two distinct signaling states. In state 1, K-Ras4A is only farnesylated, like K-Ras4B; in state 2, farnesylated and palmitoylated, like N-Ras. The K-Ras4A hypervariable region sequence is positively charged, in between K-Ras4B and N-Ras. Taken together, this raises the possibility that the farnesylated but nonpalmitoylated state 1, like K-Ras4B, binds calmodulin and is associated with colorectal and other adenocarcinomas like lung cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. On the other hand, state 2 may be associated with melanoma and other cancers where N-Ras is a major contributor, such as acute myeloid leukemia. Importantly, H-Ras has two, singly and doubly, palmitoylated states that may also serve distinct functional roles. The multiple signaling states of palmitoylated Ras isoforms question the completeness of small GTPase Ras isoform statistics in different cancer types and call for reevaluation of concepts and protocols. They may also call for reconsideration of oncogenic Ras therapeutics.",,,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clonal architecture of CXCR4(WHIM) mutations remains to be delineated. We developed highly sensitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) assays for detecting the most common CXCR4(WHIM) mutations (CXCR4(S338X C>A and C>G) ) in WM. The AS-PCR assays detected CXCR4(S338X) mutations in WM and IgM monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) patients not revealed by Sanger sequencing. By combined AS-PCR and Sanger sequencing, CXCR4(WHIM) mutations were identified in 44/102 (43%), 21/62 (34%), 2/12 (17%) and 1/20 (5%) untreated WM, previously treated WM, IgM MGUS and marginal zone lymphoma patients, respectively, but no chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, multiple myeloma, non-IgM MGUS patients or healthy donors. Cancer cell fraction analysis in WM and IgM MGUS patients showed CXCR4(S338X) mutations were primarily subclonal, with highly variable clonal distribution (median 35.1%, range 1.2-97.5%). Combined AS-PCR and Sanger sequencing revealed multiple CXCR4(WHIM) mutations in many individual WM patients, including homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations validated by deep RNA sequencing. The findings show that CXCR4(WHIM) mutations are more common in WM than previously revealed, and are primarily subclonal, supporting their acquisition after MYD88(L265P) in WM oncogenesis. The presence of multiple CXCR4(WHIM) mutations within individual WM patients may be indicative of targeted CXCR4 genomic instability.",['NOTNLM'],"['CXCR4', 'IgM MGUS', 'MYD88 L265P', 'Marginal Zone Lymphoma', 'WHIM', 'Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia']",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 9.,"The Tec family kinase Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) plays an important signaling role downstream of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs in hematopoietic cells. Mutations in Btk are involved in impaired B-cell maturation in X-linked agammaglobulinemia, and Btk has been investigated for its role in platelet activation via activation of the effector protein phospholipase Cgamma2 downstream of the platelet membrane glycoprotein VI (GPVI). Because of its role in hematopoietic cell signaling, Btk has become a target in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma; the covalent Btk inhibitor ibrutinib was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of these conditions. Antihemostatic events have been reported in some patients taking ibrutinib, although the mechanism of these events remains unknown. We sought to determine the effects of Btk inhibition on platelet function in a series of in vitro studies of platelet activation, spreading, and aggregation. Our results show that irreversible inhibition of Btk with two ibrutinib analogs in vitro decreased human platelet activation, phosphorylation of Btk, P-selectin exposure, spreading on fibrinogen, and aggregation under shear flow conditions. Short-term studies of ibrutinib analogs administered in vivo also showed abrogation of platelet aggregation in vitro, but without measurable effects on plasma clotting times or on bleeding in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that inhibition of Btk significantly decreased GPVI-mediated platelet activation, spreading, and aggregation in vitro; however, prolonged bleeding was not observed in a model of bleeding.",['NOTNLM'],"[""Bruton's tyrosine kinase"", 'glycoprotein VI', 'ibrutinib', 'platelets']",['Copyright (c) 2016 the American Physiological Society.'],['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4188-1935'],,,,,,['2017/03/01 00:00'],,,,,,,

However, at present, the only curative therapy for MF patients is hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). The decision of whether to proceed with HCT, which carries significant risks, or continue with JAK inhibitor therapy is a complicated one. Nevertheless, careful assessment of patient, disease, and transplant-related factors can guide this decision on a case-by-case basis. Difficult questions arise in the decision-making process such as age limits, whether lower-risk patients are suitable candidates, and HCT in patients responding well to JAK inhibitor therapy.

To unravel the immunological requirements for long-term persistence of human memory T cells, we characterized and traced, over several years, T lymphocytes genetically modified to express the thymidine kinase (TK) suicide gene that were infused in 10 patients after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). At 2 to 14 years after infusion and in the presence of a broad and resting immune system, we could still detect effectors/effector memory (TEM/EFF), central memory (TCM), and stem memory (TSCM) TK(+) cells, circulating at low but stable levels in all patients. Longitudinal analysis of cytomegalovirus (CMV)- and Flu-specific TK(+) cells indicated that antigen recognition was dominant in driving in vivo expansion and persistence at detectable levels. The amount of infused TSCM cells positively correlated with early expansion and with the absolute counts of long-term persisting gene-marked cells. By combining T cell sorting with sequencing of integration (IS), TCRalpha and TCRbeta clonal markers, we showed that T cells retrieved long-term were enriched in clones originally shared in different memory T cell subsets, whereas dominant long-term clonotypes appeared to preferentially originate from infused TSCM and TCM clones. Together, these results indicate that long-term persistence of gene-modified memory T cells after haploidentical HSCT is influenced by antigen exposure and by the original phenotype of infused cells. Cancer adoptive immunotherapy might thus benefit from cellular products enriched in lymphocytes with an early-differentiated phenotype.",,,"['Copyright (c) 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.']",,,['Nat Rev Immunol. 2016 Feb;16(2):73.

Although immunological mechanisms are thought to play important roles in NS after HSCT, the exact mechanisms have not been clarified. CASE-DIAGNOSIS/TREATMENT: We report a 4-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who developed NS during the tapering of immunosuppressants 5 months after an allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT). A renal biopsy was performed, and light and electron microscopy revealed minimal change disease (MCD). Although the response to treatment with steroids and tacrolimus was favorable, the child experienced two relapses of NS within the first 9 months after the initial response. A second allo-HSCT was performed to treat the relapse of ALL. After the second allo-HSCT, the remission of NS was maintained without recurrence for 5 years, even after the cessation of immunosuppressants. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient who had ALL and developed NS after his first allo-HSCT, maintained remission from NS after a second allo-HSCT. This suggests that the immune cells from the first donor origin were associated with the pathogenesis of NS.",['NOTNLM'],"['Children', 'Cyclosporine', 'FSGS', 'Nephrotic syndrome', 'Rituximab']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transformation into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) occurs in about 10% of patients. We performed whole-genome mutation analysis of the DLBCL components from two composite lymphomas consisting of clonally related NLPHL and DLBCL as a means to identify candidate tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes in NLPHL. The analysis of LP cells for selected mutations of the DLBCL revealed that most mutations are also present in the LP cells, indicating a close relationship between the two components. The analysis of 62 selected genes in NLPHL by targeted ultra-deep sequencing revealed three novel highly recurrently mutated genes (each mutated in ~50% of cases), that is, DUSP2, SGK1 and JUNB. SGK1 was expressed in the LP cells of primary NLPHL cases and in the NLPHL cell line DEV.

Using intravital microscopy (IVM) of the BM calvariae we demonstrate that the alpha4beta1 integrin is required for MM and CLL cell firm arrest onto the BM microvasculature, while endothelial P-selectin and E-selectin mediate cell rolling. Talin, kindlin-3 and ICAP-1 are beta1-integrin-binding partners that regulate beta1-mediated cell adhesion. We show that talin and kindlin-3 cooperatively stimulate high affinity and strength of alpha4beta1-dependent MM and CLL cell attachment, whereas ICAP-1 negatively regulates this adhesion. A functional connection between talin/kindlin-3 and Rac1 was found to be required for MM cell attachment mediated by alpha4beta1. Importantly, IVM analyses with talin- and kindlin-3-silenced MM cells indicate that these proteins are needed for cell arrest on the BM microvasculature. Instead, MM cell arrest is repressed by ICAP-1. Moreover, MM cells silenced for talin and kindlin-3, and cultured on alpha4beta1 ligands showed higher susceptibility to bortezomib-mediated cell apoptosis. Our results highlight the requirement of alpha4beta1 and selectins for the in vivo attachment of MM and CLL cells to the BM microvasculature, and indicate that talin, kindlin-3 and ICAP-1 differentially control physiological adhesion by regulating alpha4beta1 activity.",,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5513-555X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Modified bases have critical roles in tRNAs, rRNAs, translation, splicing, RNA interference, and other RNA processes, and are now increasingly detected in all types of transcripts. Can new biological principles associated with this diversity of RNA modifications, particularly in mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, be identified? This review will explore this question by focusing primarily on adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing by the adenine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes that have been intensively studied for the past 20 years and have a wide range of effects. Over 100 million adenosine to inosine editing sites have been identified in the human transcriptome, mostly in embedded Alu sequences that form potentially innate immune-stimulating dsRNA hairpins in transcripts. Recent research has demonstrated that inosine in the epitranscriptome and ADAR1 protein establish innate immune tolerance for host dsRNA formed by endogenous sequences. Innate immune sensors that detect viral nucleic acids are among the readers of epitranscriptome RNA modifications, though this does preclude a wide range of other modification effects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In acute myeloid leukemia, upregulation of miR-92a-3p was reported in human in vitro studies. We performed blockage of miR-29a-3p in human acute megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line (M-07e) by using locked nucleic acid (LNA) and cell proliferation; apoptosis and necrosis were assessed. At different time points after LNA-anti-miR92a-3p transfection, miR-92a-3p quantitation was assessed by qRT-real-time PCR, MTT assay and annexin/propidium iodide staining were performed. The data were processed using the ANOVA test. At all three time points, the expression of miR-92a-3p was lower in the LNA-anti-miR group compared with the control groups. Cell viability between LNA-Anti-miR and the control group was statistically significant. Blockage of miR-92a-3p was associated with increment of the ratio of apoptotic cells in the LNA-anti-miR group was higher than the other group. The ratio of necrotic cells in the LNA-antimiR group was higher than the other groups. These assessments indicate that miR-92a-3p blockage can decrease the viability of M-07e cells, which is mainly due to induction of apoptosis and necrosis.

However, currently available mouse leukemia models have critical limitations in the context of analyzing immunological regulation of leukemia development. In this study, we transferred mouse MLL/AF9 leukemia-initiating cells into immunocompetent recipient mice without any pre-conditioning such as irradiation, and then analyzed the spontaneous T cell response to an immunogenic antigen expressed in leukemia cells. When the minimum numbers of leukemia-initiating cells for engraftment were transferred, leukemia cells were eradicated by the adaptive immune response in most, if not all, wild-type mice, but not in Rag2-/- recipient mice, which lack adaptive immunity. By contrast, mice transplanted with larger numbers of leukemia cells always developed leukemia. In mice with advanced leukemia, antigen-specific CTLs were also expanded, but were unresponsive to antigen stimulation and expressed high levels of PD-1 and LAG-3. These results provide the first clear demonstration that the spontaneous CTL response to a tumor-cell antigen has the potential to eradicate leukemia, whereas antigen-specific CTLs are exhausted in animals with advanced leukemia. This immunocompetent mouse leukemia model provides a useful platform for developing effective immunotherapies against leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a non-Hodgkin's B-cell malignancy expressing higher anti-apoptotic proteins providing survival advantage. B-PAC-1, a procaspase activating compound, induces apoptosis by sequestering Zn bound to procaspase-3, but the amino acids holding Zn in Caspase-3 is not known. Here we show that reintroduction of WT caspase-3 or 7 in Caspase3-7 double knock-out (DKO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) promoted B-PAC-1 to induce apoptosis (27-43%), but not in DKO MEFs or MEFs expressing respective Casp3-7 catalytic mutants (12-13%). Using caspase-6 and -9 exosite analysis, we identified and mutated predicted Zn-ligands in caspase-3 (H108A, C148S and E272A) and overexpressed into DKO MEFs. Mutants carrying E272A abrogated Zn-reversal of apoptosis induced by B-PAC-1 via higher XIAP and smac expressions but not in H108A or C148S mutants. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed stronger XIAP-caspase-3 interaction suggesting a novel mechanism of impulsive apoptosis resistance by disrupting predicted Zn-ligands in caspase-3. B-PAC-1 sponsored apoptosis in MCL cell lines (30-73%) via caspase-3 and PARP cleavages accompanied by loss of Mcl-1 and IAPs including XIAP while Zn substantially abrogated B-PAC-1-driven apoptosis (18-36%). In contrary, Zn is dispensable to inhibit staurosporin, bendamustine, ABT199 or MK206-induced apoptosis. Consistent to cell lines, B-PAC-1 stimulated cell death in primary B-lymphoma cells via caspase-3 cleavage with decline in both Mcl-1 and XIAP. This study underscores the first genetic evidence that B-PAC-1 driven apoptosis is mediated via Zn chelation.",['NOTNLM'],"['B-PAC-1', 'MCL', 'Zn-ligands', 'lymphoma', 'pro-caspase-3']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Nov 30.,"To combat tuberculosis (TB), host phagocytic cells need to survive against self-generating oxidative stress-induced necrosis. However, the effect of isoniazid (INH) in protecting cells from oxidative stress-induced necrosis has not been previously investigated. In this in vitro study, the cytotoxic effect of H2O2 generation using glucose oxidase (a model of oxidative stress) was found to be abrogated by INH in a concentration-dependent manner in HL-60 cells (a human promyelocytic leukemia cell). In cells treated with glucose oxidase, both ATP and mitochondrial membrane potential were found to be decreased. However, treatment with INH demonstrated small but significant attenuation in decreasing ATP levels, and complete reversal for the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. Quantitative proteomics analysis identified up-regulation of 15 proteins and down-regulation of 14 proteins which all together suggest that these proteomic changes signal for increasing cellular replication, structural integrity, ATP synthesis, and inhibiting cell death. In addition, studies demonstrated that myeloperoxidase (MPO) was involved in catalyzing INH-protein adduct formation. Unexpectedly, these covalent protein adducts were correlated with INH-induced cytoprotection in HL-60 cells. Further studies are needed to determine whether the INH-protein adducts were causative in the mechanism of cytoprotection.",['NOTNLM'],"['Covalent binding', 'Cytoprotection', 'HL-60 cells', 'Hydrogen peroxide', 'Isoniazid', 'Myeloperoxidase']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Epub 2015 Dec 3.,"BACKGROUND: Imatinib (IM) is a first choice drug for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), with a widely accepted concentration threshold of 1000ng/ml being used as a target for therapeutic drug monitoring. Once adherence to the pharmacotherapeutic regimen is of paramount importance during the long treatment course of CML, the measurement of hair IM concentrations could be a surrogate of the patient's exposure to the drug. METHODS: IM was extracted from a 5mg hair sample by a liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate, and IM-d8 was used as internal standard (IS). After evaporation, and reconstitution in acetonitrile, the extract was injected into a LC-MS/MS system. Compounds were eluted on a C8 column in isocratic mode. IM and IS were identified in positive electrospray ionization mode using ion transitions of m/z 494.5>394.5 and 503.0>394.3 respectively. The method was applied to 102 paired hair and samples obtained from CML patients. Treatment response was evaluated according to the European LeukemiaNet recommendations. RESULTS: The assay was validated in the concentration range of 0.5-25ng/mg, with intra- and inter-assay imprecisions of <13.1% and <9.3%, respectively. The limits of quantification and detection were 0.5 and 0.15ng/mg, respectively. Median hair IM concentrations are significantly smaller in patients with therapeutic failure when compared with patients with partial or optimal response (4.63 vs. 7.93, p=0.040), the same trend presented by median plasma IM concentrations (629.5 vs. 1084.8, p=0.009). An IM hair concentration below 5.8ng/mg has 83% sensibility and 70% specificity to identify patients with therapeutic failure. CONCLUSIONS: A fast, sensitive, and selective LC-MS/MS method allowing quantification of IM in hair samples was developed and validated. CML patients with therapeutic failure had significantly lower hair IM concentrations when compared with patients with optimal response. These preliminary findings may support the use of hair as a matrix for IM monitoring in clinical settings, with significant logistic advantages over the collection of venous blood, particularly in developing countries.",['NOTNLM'],"['Adherence evaluation', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Hair analysis', 'Imatinib', 'Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry', 'Therapeutic drug monitoring']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2015 Dec 2.,"BACKGROUND: 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), a key drug for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), has until recently had no adequate formulation for pediatric patients. Several approaches have been taken but the only oral paraben-free 6-MP liquid formulation named Loulla was developed and evaluated in the target population. Preclinical and clinical evaluations were performed according to a Pediatric Investigation Plan, in order to apply for a Pediatric Use Marketing Authorization. METHODS: The pre-clinical study assessed the maximum tolerated dosage-volume and evaluated local mucosal toxicity of 28 daily administrations in treated compared to controls gold hamsters. The multi-centre clinical study was single-dose, open-label, crossover trial, conducted in 15 ALL children during maintenance therapy. The bioavailability and palatability of a single 50mg fixed dose of Loulla compared to 50mg registered tablets were evaluated in a random order on two consecutive days. Seven blood samples over 9h were obtained each day to determine 6-MP pharmacokinetic parameters, including Tmax, Cmax, AUC0-9 and AUC0-infinity. A questionnaire adapted to children testing Loulla palatability and preference for either Loulla or the usual 6-MP tablet was completed. Occurrence of adverse events was determined at study visits by vital sign measurements, patient's spontaneous reporting, investigator's questioning and clinical examination. RESULTS: The preclinical study in gold hamsters showed that dosage-volume of 75 mg/kg/day was well tolerated. The relative bioavailability of liquid Loulla formulation compared to the reference presentation is 76% for AUC0-9 and AUC0-infinity and 80% for Cmax. The taste of Loulla and the mouth feeling after ingestion compare favorably to the tablet. No adverse event occurred. CONCLUSION: Pharmacokinetic, palatability and safety data support the use of Loulla in children.",['NOTNLM'],"['6-mercaptopurine', 'Bioavailability', 'Leukemia', 'Liquid formulation', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmacokinetics']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Escape from stress-induced apoptosis is one of the mechanisms used by malignant cells to survive unfavorable conditions. B-cell Translocation Gene 1 (BTG1) is a tumor suppressor that is frequently deleted in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and recurrently mutated in diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Moreover, low BTG1 expression levels have been linked to poor outcome in several solid tumors. How loss of BTG1 function contributes to tumor progression is not well understood. Here, using Btg1 knockout mice, we demonstrate that loss of Btg1 provides a survival advantage to primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) under stress conditions. This pro-survival effect involves regulation of Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4), a key mediator of cellular stress responses. We show that BTG1 interacts with ATF4 and positively modulates its activity by recruiting the protein arginine methyl transferase PRMT1 to methylate ATF4 on arginine residue 239. We further extend these findings to B-cell progenitors, by showing that loss of Btg1 expression enhances stress adaptation of mouse bone marrow-derived B cell progenitors. In conclusion, we have identified the BTG1/PRMT1 complex as a new modifier of ATF4 mediated stress responses.",['NOTNLM'],"['ATF4', 'BTG1', 'PRMT1', 'cellular stress', 'leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This reaction is catalysed by the virally encoded enzyme integrase (IN) and is facilitated by viral genus-specific host factors. Herein, cellular serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is identified as a functional IN binding partner exclusive to delta-retroviruses, including human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 and 2 (HTLV-1 and HTLV-2) and bovine leukaemia virus (BLV). PP2A is a heterotrimer composed of a scaffold, catalytic and one of any of four families of regulatory subunits, and the interaction is specific to the B' family of the regulatory subunits. B'-PP2A and HTLV-1 IN display nuclear co-localization, and the B' subunit stimulates concerted strand transfer activity of delta-retroviral INs in vitro.

Epub 2015 Dec 2.,"Fanconi anemia, complementation group D1 with bi-allelic FANCD1 (BRCA2) mutations, is a very rare genetic disorder characterized by early onset of childhood malignancies, including acute leukemia, brain cancer and nephroblastoma. Here, we present a case report of a family with 3 affected children in terms of treatment outcome, toxicity and characterization of the malignancies using comprehensive cytogenetic analysis. The first child was diagnosed with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia when he was 11 months old. During chemotherapy, he suffered from repeated pancytopenia, sepsis and severe vincristine polyneuropathy, and 18 months after primary diagnosis, he succumbed to secondary acute monocytic leukemia. The second child was diagnosed with stage 2 triphasic nephroblastoma (Wilms tumor), when he was 3 years and 11 months old. During chemotherapy, he suffered from vincristine polyneuropathy. Currently, he is in complete remission, 29 months following the initial diagnosis. The third child was diagnosed with medulloblastoma with classical histology, when she was 4 years and 5 months old. After the first cycle of chemotherapy, she suffered from prolonged pancytopenia, sepsis and severe skin and mucosal toxicity. Six weeks after primary diagnosis, a first relapse in the posterior fossa was diagnosed, and at 7 and half months after primary diagnosis, a second relapse was diagnosed that led to the patient's death. Our case report underscores tumor heterogeneity, treatment toxicity and poor outcome in Fanconi anemia patients of complementation group D1.",['NOTNLM'],"['BRCA2', 'FANCD1', 'Fanconi anemia', 'Leukemia', 'Medulloblastoma', 'Wilms tumor']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, auranofin's single agent activity in lung cancer is not well characterized. To determine whether auranofin has single agent activity in lung cancer, we evaluated auranofin's activity in a panel of 10 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. Cell viability analysis revealed that auranofin induced growth inhibition in a subset of NSCLC cell lines with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) below 1.0 muM. Treatment with auranofin elicited apoptosis and necroptosis in auranofin-sensitive cell lines. Moreover, the susceptibility of NSCLC cells to auranofin was inversely correlated with TXNRD1 expression in the cells. Transient transfection of the TXNRD1-expressing plasmid in auranofin-sensitive Calu3 cells resulted in partial resistance, indicating that high TXNRD level is one of causal factors for resistance to auranofin. Further mechanistic characterization with proteomic analysis revealed that auranofin inhibits expression and/or phosphorylation of multiple key nodes in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, including S6, 4EBP1, Rictor, p70S6K, mTOR, TSC2, AKT and GSK3. Ectopic expression of TXNRD1 partially reversed auranofin-mediated PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibition, suggesting that TXNRD1 may participate in the regulation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Administration of auranofin to mice with xenograft tumors derived from NSCLC cells significantly suppressed tumor growth without inducing obvious toxic effects. Our results demonstrated feasibility of repurposing auranofin for treatment of lung cancer.",['NOTNLM'],"['anticancer agent', 'biomarkers', 'drug repurposing', 'lung cancer']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 4.,"The conventional chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX.HCl) is often accompanied by drug resistance which has severely hindered its clinical application. By taking advantage of the self-assembled behavior of amphiphilic polyphosphazenes, we constructed novel polymersomes loading DOX.HCl or desalted DOX with chloroquine phosphate (CQ) as a drug resistance-reversal agent at 1:1 or 2:1 weight ratios via a one-step common dialysis method. The cytotoxicity evaluation of this dual drug-loaded polymersome was performed on DOX-resistant MCF-7/Adr breast cancer and HL60/Adr leukemia cells. Simultaneously, to simulate in vivo cancerous tissue, 3D tumor spheroid was constructed for tissue penetration and anti-cancer effect evaluation. As a result, PEP-DHC-1 containing DOX.HCl and CQ at 1:1 weight ratio exhibited the strongest toxicity. Furthermore, the in vivo tumor inhibition study carried out on a zebrafish xenograft model also validated that PEP-DHC-1 made the outstanding contribution to improve the sensitivity of MCF-7/Adr breast cancer to chemotherapeutics. These findings suggest that this DOX.HCl and CQ co-delivery system based on PEP polymersomes might be promising for drug resistance reversal of cancer therapy and consequently enhanced anti-cancer efficacy.",['NOTNLM'],"['Chloroquine', 'Combination cancer therapy', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug resistance', 'Polymersomes', 'Polyphosphazene']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

These drugs have a good safety profile, but animal studies have shown that they are potentially teratogenic. Therefore, these drugs are not recommended for use during pregnancy or if a female patient plans to conceive. Despite the extensive clinical experience with TKIs, the available information about the effects of TKIs on fertility, pregnancy, and outcome of babies who were exposed to TKIs during pregnancy and lactation is limited. We reported on 1 female CML patient who conceived 3 times while being on different types of TKIs in each pregnancy.

Epub 2015 Dec 14.,"CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 are highly homologous transcriptional coactivators with unique, non-redundant roles that bind a wide array of proteins, including catenins-beta and gamma. ICG-001 is a small-molecule inhibitor that specifically inhibits the CBP/catenin interaction. Importantly, ICG-001 does not inhibit the p300/catenin interaction. We demonstrate that specifically inhibiting the interaction between CBP and catenin with ICG-001 results in the differentiation of quiescent drug-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia-initiating cells (CML LICs), thereby sensitizing them to BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors, for example, Imatinib. Using ICG-001 in a NOD/SCID/IL2Rgamma(-/-) mouse model of engrafted human chronic myelogenous leukemia, we now demonstrate the complete elimination of engrafted leukemia after only one course of combined chemotherapy. Combination-treated animals live as long as their non-engrafted littermates. Results from these studies demonstrate that specifically antagonizing the CBP/catenin interaction with ICG-001 can eliminate drug-resistant CML LICs without deleterious effects to the normal endogenous hematopoietic stem cell population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 14.,"Proteolysis is not only a critical requirement for life, but the executing enzymes also play important roles in numerous pathological conditions, including cancer. Therefore, targeting proteases is clearly relevant for improving cancer patient care. However, to effectively control proteases, a profound knowledge of their mechanistic function as well as their regulation and downstream signalling in health and disease is required. The highly conserved protease Threonine Aspartase1 (Taspase1) is overexpressed in numerous liquid and solid malignancies and was characterized as a 'non-oncogene addiction' protease. Although Taspase1 was shown to cleave various regulatory proteins in humans as well as leukaemia provoking mixed lineage leukaemia fusions, our knowledge on its detailed functions and the underlying mechanisms contributing to cancer is still incomplete. Despite superficial similarity to type 2 asparaginases as well as Ntn proteases, such as the proteasome, Taspase1-related research so far gives us the picture of a unique protease exhibiting special features. Moreover, neither effective genetic nor chemical inhibitors for this enzyme are available so far, thus hampering not only to further dissect Taspase1's pathobiological functions but also precluding the assessment of its clinical impact. Based on recent insights, we here critically review the current knowledge of Taspase1's structure-function relationship and its mechanistic relevance for tumorigenesis obtained from in vitro and in vivo cancer models. We provide a comprehensive overview of tumour entities for which Taspase1 might be of predictive and therapeutic value, and present the respective experimental evidence. To stimulate progress in the field, a comprehensive overview of Taspase1 targeting approaches is presented, including coverage of Taspase1-related patents. We conclude by discussing future inhibition strategies and relevant challenges, which need to be resolved by the field.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study examined the mechanism underlying the development of KMT2A (MLL)-rearranged infant leukemia in response to in utero exposure to etoposide in a mouse model. Fetal liver hematopoietic stem cells were more susceptible to etoposide than maternal bone marrow mononuclear cells. Etoposide-induced Kmt2a breakage was detected in fetal liver hematopoietic stem cells using a newly developed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Assessment of etoposide-induced chromosomal translocation by next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) identified several chimeric fusion messenger RNAs that were generated by etoposide treatment. However, Kmt2a (Mll)-rearranged fusion mRNA was detected in Atm-knockout mice, which are defective in the DNA damage response, but not in wild-type mice. The present findings suggest that in utero exposure to TOP2 inhibitors induces Kmt2a rearrangement when the DNA damage response is defective.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 1.,"Mutations in voltage-gated sodium channel genes cause several types of human epilepsies. Often, individuals with the same sodium channel mutation exhibit diverse phenotypes. This suggests that factors beyond the primary mutation influence disease severity, including genetic modifiers. Mouse epilepsy models with voltage-gated sodium channel mutations exhibit strain-dependent phenotype variability, supporting a contribution of genetic modifiers in epilepsy. The Scn2a(Q54) (Q54) mouse model has a strain-dependent epilepsy phenotype. Q54 mice on the C57BL/6J (B6) strain exhibit delayed seizure onset and improved survival compared to [B6xSJL/J]F1.Q54 mice. We previously mapped two dominant modifier loci that influence Q54 seizure susceptibility and identified Hlf (hepatic leukemia factor) as a candidate modifier gene at one locus. Hlf and other PAR bZIP transcription factors had previously been associated with spontaneous seizures in mice thought to be caused by down-regulation of the pyridoxine pathway. An Hlf targeted knockout mouse model was used to evaluate the effect of Hlf deletion on Q54 phenotype severity. Hlf(KO/KO);Q54 double mutant mice exhibited elevated frequency and reduced survival compared to Q54 controls. To determine if direct modulation of the pyridoxine pathway could alter the Q54 phenotype, mice were maintained on a pyridoxine-deficient diet for 6 weeks. Dietary pyridoxine deficiency resulted in elevated seizure frequency and decreased survival in Q54 mice compared to control diet. To determine if Hlf could modify other epilepsies, Hlf(KO/+) mice were crossed with the Scn1a(KO/+) Dravet syndrome mouse model to examine the effect on premature lethality. Hlf(KO/+);Scn1a(KO/+) offspring exhibited decreased survival compared to Scn1a(KO/+) controls. Together these results demonstrate that Hlf is a genetic modifier of epilepsy caused by voltage-gated sodium channel mutations and that modulation of the pyridoxine pathway can also influence phenotype severity.",['NOTNLM'],"['Epilepsy', 'Genetics', 'Mouse model', 'Seizure', 'Voltage-gated sodium channel']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Thymidine kinase (TK) is a cell enzyme involved in DNA synthesis and is considered a cellular proliferation marker in some solid tumors. METHODS: A cross-sectional prospective and comparative study was performed in the Federico Gomez Children's Hospital in Mexico (HIMFG, in Spanish) in 125 samples of patients of the HIMFG with AL and 138 samples of children without leukemia. Serum TK levels were determined for both groups. RESULTS: Of the children with AL, 90 presented B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL); 13, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL); and 22, acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A median (m) TK level of 23.7 IU (IQR 17-35.7) was observed in the group without AL and 91 IU (IQR 98-392) in the AL group. This difference was statistically significant (p <0.0001). When analyzing TK levels according to the type of leukemia, the m was as follows: 68 IU (IQR 35-118) for B-ALL, 470 IU (IQR 88-750) for AML, and 1678 IU (IQR 288-2108) for T- ALL.

Here, we developed a rapid assay for identifying and measuring the PML-RARA fusion gene in patients with APL using droplet-reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (droplet-RT-PCR) and instant quality-fluorescence in situ hybridization (IQ-FISH). METHODS: RNA for droplet-RT-PCR and fixed-cell suspensions for IQ-FISH were prepared from five patients with APL and three controls. We evaluated the amplification efficiency and reaction time with droplet-RT-PCR and signal clarity and hybridization time with IQ-FISH. RESULTS: The reaction using droplet-RT-PCR was completed in 26min. The PML-RARA fusion gene was detected in all samples from the five patients. IQ-FISH yielded clear signals after 1h of hybridization. There were no significant differences in signal clarity or positive signal ratios between IQ-FISH and conventional FISH.

Epub 2015 Dec 2.,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Vertebroplasty (VP), including balloon kyphoplasty (BKP), has long been accepted as a minimally invasive surgical intervention for the stabilization of painful vertebral compression fractures. In metastatic compression fracture (MCF), cancer often invades the paravertebral structure and involves the posterior column of the vertebrae. PURPOSE: In the present study, we first analyzed how clinical features of MCF affect functional outcomes after VP. Second, we evaluated whether BKP is more beneficial than simple VP (SVP) in MCF. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: This is a retrospective observational study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Three hundred forty-two patients who underwent VP for painful MCF from solid cancer were included. We excluded MCF from hematopoietic cancer, such as leukemia or multiple myeloma. OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain improvement was evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS; range: 0-10), and if the VAS score decreased by at least three points the treatment was considered effective. Postoperative change in Karnofsky performance status (KPS) and drug requirement for pain control were also measured as functional outcomes. METHODS: An institutional database at the National Cancer Center of Korea was searched to identify all patients who underwent VP for painful MCF between March 2002 and September 2013. Demographic data, as well as preoperative and postoperative clinical factors, were collected from patients' medical records. Radiological features, including paravertebral extension of tumors and the extent of three-column involvement, were reviewed from pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs). These clinical and radiological factors were then analyzed for their influence on functional outcomes. RESULTS: The mean preoperative VAS score was 5.8; this improved to a mean of 2.7 after VP. Effective improvement in VAS score (>/=3) was achieved in 206 patients (60%). Patients with radiculopathy, as well as those with involvement of (1) the posterior column or (2) more than four out of six columns, presented with significantly higher pretreatment VAS scores and experienced more effective improvement after treatment (p<.05). Two hundred thirty-eight patients (70%) underwent SVP, whereas the remaining 104 patients underwent BKP. The pretreatment degree of compression was significantly higher in BKP (mean: 47%) than in SVP patients (mean: 30%) (p<.001). However, preoperative VAS scores were not significantly different between the two groups, and the resultant VAS score improvement was also not significantly different. Although BKP patients reported to have a greater chance of more than 3 mL of cement injection (p=.01), the mean amount of cement injected was not different between the two groups. Patients with other bone metastases showed a significantly poorer KPS improvement rate (p=.015). Patients having moderately or slowly growing cancer according to the Tomita classification had a greater chance of reduced drug requirements 1 month after the procedure (p=.004). CONCLUSIONS: Paravertebral extension and posterior column involvement of MCF did not preclude pain improvement after VP. Balloon kyphoplasty for MCF failed to show enhanced pain improvement relative to SVP.

Epub 2015 Dec 10.,"Impaired function of the Ikaros (IKZF1) protein is associated with the development of high-risk B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The mechanisms of Ikaros tumor suppressor activity in leukemia are unknown. Ikaros binds to the upstream regulatory elements of its target genes and regulates their transcription via chromatin remodeling. Here, we report that Ikaros represses transcription of the histone H3K4 demethylase, JARID1B (KDM5B). Transcriptional repression of JARID1B is associated with increased global levels of H3K4 trimethylation. Ikaros-mediated repression of JARID1B is dependent on the activity of the histone deacetylase, HDAC1, which binds to the upstream regulatory element of JARID1B in complex with Ikaros. In leukemia, JARID1B is overexpressed, and its inhibition results in cellular growth arrest. Ikaros-mediated repression of JARID1B in leukemia is impaired by pro-oncogenic casein kinase 2 (CK2). Inhibition of CK2 results in increased binding of the Ikaros-HDAC1 complex to the promoter of JARID1B, with increased formation of trimethylated histone H3 lysine 27 and decreased histone H3 Lys-9 acetylation. In cases of high-risk B-ALL that carry deletion of one Ikaros (IKZF1) allele, targeted inhibition of CK2 restores Ikaros binding to the JARID1B promoter and repression of JARID1B. In summary, the presented data suggest a mechanism through which Ikaros and HDAC1 regulate the epigenetic signature in leukemia: via regulation of JARID1B transcription. The presented data identify JARID1B as a novel therapeutic target in B-ALL and provide a rationale for the use of CK2 inhibitors in the treatment of high-risk B-ALL.",['NOTNLM'],"['ck2', 'hematopoiesis', 'ikzf1', 'lymphocyte', 'signal transduction', 'transcription regulation', 'transcription repressor', 'tumor suppressor gene']","['(c) 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The potential negative impact of AML cells on the therapeutic efficacy of NK cell-based strategies prompted us to analyze the mechanisms underlying NKCAs and to develop approaches to protect NK cells from NKCAs. NKCA induction by the AML leukemia cells target a subpopulation of peripheral blood NK cells and is interleukin-2 independent but is abrogated by a long-term culture of NK (LTNK) cells at 37 degrees C. LTNK cells displayed a significantly enhanced ability to damage AML cells in vitro and inhibited the subcutaneous growth of ML-2 cells grafted into CB17 SCID mice. Actinomycin D restored the susceptibility of LTNK cells to NKCAs while TAPI-0, a functional analog of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) 3, inhibits ML-2 cell-induced NKCAs suggesting that the generation of NK cell resistance to NKCAs involves RNA transcription and metalloproteinase (MPP) inactivation. This conclusion is supported by the reduced susceptibility to AML cell-induced NKCAs of LTNK cells in which TIMP3 gene and protein are over-expressed.

Human CD13-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells proliferate abnormally and escape death. Here, we show that the CNGRC-GG-D(KLAKLAK)2 peptide induces death in AML cell lines (U937, THP-1, NB4, HL-60) and primary blood cells from AML patients. Cell death was characterized as a caspase-independent mechanism, without DNA fragmentation, but phosphatidylserine externalization and membrane disruption. Our results demonstrate in U937 cells that (i) the NGR-peptide triggers the loss of mitochondrial potential(DeltaPsim) and generates superoxide anion (O2-), (ii) N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and extra/intracellular Ca2+ chelators (BAPTA) prevent both O2- production and cell death, (iii) the Ca2+-channel blocker nifedipine prevents cell death (indicating that Ca2+ influx is the initial death trigger), and (iv) BAPTA, but not NAC, prevents DeltaPsim loss (suggesting O2- is a mitochondrial downstream effector). AML cell lines and primary blasts responding to the lethal action of NGR-peptide express promatrix metalloproteinase-12 (proMMP-12) and its substrate progranulin (an 88 kDa cell survival factor). A cell-free assay highlighted proMMP-12 activation by O2-. Accordingly, NGR-peptide's downregulation of 88 kDa progranulin protein was prevented by BAPTA and NAC. Conversely, AML blast resistance to NGR-peptide is associated with the expression of a distinct, 105 kDa progranulin isoform. These results indicate that CNGRC-GG-D(KLAKLAK)2 induces death in AML cells through the Ca2+-mitochondria-O2.-pathway, and support the link between proMMP-12 activation and progranulin cleavage during cell death. Our findings may have implications for the understanding of tumour biology and treatment.",['NOTNLM'],"['calcium', 'leukemia', 'metalloproteinase', 'necrosis', 'superoxide radical']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bendamustine plus rituximab is often used in the relapsed or refractory setting. We assessed the efficacy and safety of adding ibrutinib, an oral covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), to bendamustine plus rituximab in patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. METHODS: The HELIOS trial was an international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study in adult patients (>/=18 years of age) who had active chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma with measurable lymph node disease (>1.5 cm) by CT scan, and had relapsed or refractory disease following one or more previous lines of systemic therapy consisting of at least two cycles of a chemotherapy-containing regimen, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1, and adequate bone marrow, liver, and kidney function. Patients with del(17p) were excluded because of known poor response to bendamustine plus rituximab. Patients who had received previous treatment with ibrutinib or other BTK inhibitors, refractory disease or relapse within 24 months with a previous bendamustine-containing regimen, or haemopoietic stem-cell transplant were also excluded. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by a web-based system to receive bendamustine plus rituximab given in cycles of 4 weeks' duration (bendamustine: 70 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 2-3 in cycle 1, and days 1-2 in cycles 2-6; rituximab: 375 mg/m(2) on day 1 of cycle 1, and 500 mg/m(2) on day 1 of cycles 2-6 for a maximum of six cycles) with either ibrutinib (420 mg daily orally) or placebo until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients were stratified according to whether they were refractory to purine analogues and by number of previous lines of therapy. The primary endpoint was independent review committee (IRC)-assessed progression-free survival. Crossover to ibrutinib was permitted for patients in the placebo group with IRC-confirmed disease progression. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and is continuing for further long-term follow-up. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01611090. FINDINGS: Between Sept 19, 2012, and Jan 21, 2014, 578 eligible patients were randomly assigned to ibrutinib or placebo in combination with bendamustine plus rituximab (289 in each group). The primary endpoint was met at the preplanned interim analysis (March 10, 2015). At a median follow-up of 17 months (IQR 13.7-20.7), progression-free survival was significantly improved in the ibrutinib group compared with the placebo group (not reached in the ibrutinib group (95% CI not evaluable) vs 13.3 months (11.3-13.9) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.203, 95% CI 0.150-0.276; p<0.0001). IRC-assessed progression-free survival at 18 months was 79% (95% CI 73-83) in the ibrutinib group and 24% (18-31) in the placebo group (HR 0.203, 95% CI 0.150-0.276; p<0.0001). The most frequent all-grade adverse events were neutropenia and nausea. 222 (77%) of 287 patients in the ibrutinib group and 212 (74%) of 287 patients in the placebo group reported grade 3-4 events; the most common grade 3-4 adverse events in both groups were neutropenia (154 [54%] in the ibrutinib group vs 145 [51%] in the placebo group) and thrombocytopenia (43 [15%] in each group). A safety profile similar to that previously reported with ibrutinib and bendamustine plus rituximab individually was noted. INTERPRETATION: In patients eligible for bendamustine plus rituximab, the addition of ibrutinib to this regimen results in significant improvements in outcome with no new safety signals identified from the combination and a manageable safety profile.

Epub 2015 Oct 31.,"INTRODUCTION: Multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer represent a major hurdle in chemotherapy. Previously, the methanol extract of the medicinal spice Xylopia aethiopica displayed considerable cytotoxicity against multidrug resistant (MDR) cancer cell lines. METHODS: The present study was designed to assess the cytotoxicity of compounds, 16alpha-hydroxy-ent-kauran-19-oic acid (2), 3,4',5-trihydroxy-6'',6''-dimethylpyrano[2,3-g]flavone (3), isotetrandrine (5) and trans-tiliroside (6) derived from the methanol crude extract of Xylopia aethiopica against 9 drug-sensitive and -resistant cancer cell lines. The resazurin reduction assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of these compounds, whilst caspase-Glo assay was used to detect caspase activation. Cell cycle, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were all analyzed via flow cytometry. RESULTS: Flavonoid 3 and alkaloid 5 also displayed IC50 values ranging from 2.61 microM (towards leukemia CCRF-CEM cells) to 18.60 microM (towards gliobastoma multiforme U87MG.DeltaEGFR cells) and from 1.45 microM (towards HepG2 cells) to 7.28 microM (towards MDA-MB-231-pcDNA cells), respectively. IC50 values ranged from 0.20 microM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 195.12 microM (against CEM/ADR5000 cells) for doxorubicin. Compound 3 induced apoptosis in leukemia CCRF-CEM cells mediated by the disruption of the MMP, whilst 5 induced apoptosis mediated by ROS production. CONCLUSIONS: Compounds 2 and 5 represent potential cytotoxic phytochemicals that deserve more investigations to develop novel antineoplastic drugs against multifactorial drug-resistant cancers.",['NOTNLM'],"[""3,4',5-trihydroxy-6'',6''-dimethylpyrano[2,3-g]flavone"", 'Annonaceae', 'Cancer', 'Cytotoxicity', 'Isotetrandrine', 'Xylopia aethiopica']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Limited options have also been available regarding modalities of administration. Our study objective was to estimate preferences for treatment characteristics (or ""attributes"") in relapsed/refractory (r/r) CLL. Patients, physicians (hematologists/oncologists), and members from the general population from Germany and Sweden completed a conjoint analysis comprising six CLL treatment attributes: (i) overall survival (OS), (ii) progression-free survival (PFS), (iii) fatigue, (iv) nausea, (v) risk of serious infections, and (vi) treatment administration (each described in three levels). We estimated the relative importance of each attribute by fitting a hierarchical Bayesian model. A total of 190 German and 121 Swedish individuals participated. In the pooled sample, OS was the most important attribute (36%), followed by risk of serious infection (21%), treatment administration (13%), fatigue (12%), PFS (11%), and nausea (7%). Treatment administration was more important to patients (all p<0.004), OS was more important to physicians (all p<0.001), and risk of serious infections was more important to the general population than to physicians (p<0.001). Our results could be helpful to align therapeutic decision-making in r/r CLL with patient preferences to improve care satisfaction and treatment compliance.",['NOTNLM'],"['Clinical practice', 'Decision-making', 'Discrete-choice experiment', 'Hematology', 'Leukemia']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Response rates to standard salvage chemotherapy regimens are low and the outlook on relapse is very poor and associated with significant morbidity and mortality hence the need for newer targeted approaches. Inotuzumab ozogamicin (previously known as CMC-544) is an antibody-drug conjugate and consists of a monoclonal anti-CD22 antibody bound to calicheamicin. The target, CD22, is widely expressed on acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells making it a potential therapeutic target. The calicheamicin is delivered intracellularly and causes leukaemia cell apoptosis. Overall response rates of 57% were observed in a Phase II study and the final results of a Phase III randomised controlled trial comparing this drug to the investigator choice 'standard of care' chemotherapy are eagerly awaited.

In clinical practice, transplantation associated complications greatly affected the final therapeutical outcomes. Currently, primary disease relapse, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and infections remain the three leading causes of a high morbidity and mortality in allo-HSCT patients. Various strategies have been investigated in the past several decades including human gammadelta T cell-based therapeutical regimens. In different microenvironments, human gammadelta T cells assume features reminiscent of classical Th1, Th2, Th17, NKT and regulatory T cells, showing diverse biological functions. The cytotoxic gammadelta T cells could be utilized to target relapsed malignancies, and recently regulatory gammadelta T cells are defined as a novel implement for GVHD management. In addition, human gammadelta Tau cells facilitate control of post-transplantation infections and participate in tissue regeneration and wound healing processes. These features potentiate gammadelta T cells a versatile therapeutical agent to target transplantation associated complications. This review focuses on insights of applicable potentials of human gammadelta T cells reconciling complications associated with allo-HSCT. We believe an improved understanding of pertinent gammadelta T cell functions would be further exploited in the design of innovative immunotherapeutic approaches in allo-HSCT, to reduce mortality and morbidity, as well as improve quality of life for patients after transplantation.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*Graft versus host disease', '*Infection', '*Leukemia', '*Relapse', '*gammadelta T cells']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2015 Dec 23.,"The mitochondrial kinase inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA) has recently received attention in oncology due to its ability to target glycolysis. However, DCA molecule exhibits poor bioavailability and cellular uptake with limited ability to reach its target mitochondria. To overcome these biases, we have synthesized novel DCA-loaded compounds. The selection of the most promising therapeutic molecule was evaluated by combining in vitro assays, to test the antitumoral potential on leukemic cells, and a preliminary characterization of the molecule stability in vivo, in mice. Among the newly synthesized compounds, we have selected the multiple DCA-loaded compound 10, characterized by a tertiary amine scaffold, because it exhibited enhanced (>30-fold) in vitro antitumor activity with respect to DCA and increased in vivo stability. On the basis of these results, we believe that compound 10 should be considered for further preclinical evaluations for the treatment of cancers and/or other diseases characterized by altered metabolic origin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Nov 30.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Total body irradiation (TBI) is a common component of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) conditioning regimens. Preclinical studies suggest prolonged bone marrow (BM) injury after TBI could contribute to impaired engraftment and poor hematopoietic function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied the longitudinal changes in the marrow environment in patients receiving allogeneic HCT with myeloablative (MA, n=42) and reduced intensity (RIC, n=56) doses of TBI from 2003-2013, including BM cellularity, histologic features of injury and repair, hematologic and immunologic recovery. RESULTS: Following MA conditioning, a 30% decrease in the marrow cellularity persisted at 1 year post-transplant (p=0.03). RIC HCT marrow cellularity transiently decreased but returned to baseline by 6 months even though the RIC group received mostly umbilical cord blood (UCB) grafts (82%, vs. 17% in the MA cohort, p<0.01). There was no evidence of persistent marrow vascular damage or inflammation. Recipients of more intensive conditioning did not show more persistent cytopenias with the exception of a tendency for minimal thrombocytopenia. Immune recovery was similar between MA and RIC. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that TBI associated with MA conditioning leads to prolonged reductions in marrow cellularity, but does not show additional histological evidence of long-term injury, which is further supported by similar peripheral counts and immunologic recovery.",['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow transplantation', 'Marrow cellularity', 'Total body irradiation']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Epub 2015 Dec 14.,"OBJECTIVE: Appendectomy remains one of the most common surgical procedures, but possible long-term consequences for health and disease are incompletely investigated. The appendix forms part of the secondary lymphoid system and appendectomy has been associated with increased risks of hematolymphoproliferative malignancies in some studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the risk of lymphoid neoplasms in a large cohort of 337,437 appendectomised patients <60 years of age in Sweden 1975-2009. We estimated relative risks of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and major subtypes, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), myeloma, and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) versus the general population using standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: There was no increased risk of NHL (SIR = 0.97, 95%CI 0.88-1.06), major NHL subtypes, CLL (SIR = 0.87, 95%CI 0.70-1.06), myeloma (SIR = 1.14, 95%CI 0.96-1.33) or ALL (SIR = 1.10, 95%CI 0.80-1.47) following appendectomy. An increased risk of HL was observed among patients diagnosed with appendicitis (SIR = 1.29, 95%CI 1.07-1.54, p=0.007), especially individuals aged <20 years at surgery (SIR = 1.43, 95%CI 1.11-1.82), and for the nodular sclerosis subtype of HL (SIR = 1.55, 95%CI 1.01-2.27). A marginally increased risk of myeloma was noted among men, but the association was limited to the first few years of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Appendectomy is not associated with any notable increase in risk of lymphoid neoplasms. A small increased risk of HL following appendicitis (rather than appendectomy per se) could reflect a true association, or shared susceptibility to infection/inflammation among individuals prone to develop HL. The association observed for myeloma may be explained by chance or surveillance bias.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'Hodgkin lymphoma', 'appendectomy', 'appendicitis', 'chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'myeloma', 'non-Hodgkin lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with CLL are typically older, with a median age in the 70s, and are at risk for certain complications due to the disease itself and due to the therapies imparted for this. Patients with CLL are at a higher risk of infections, partly due to disease and partly due to the immune dysfunction induced by treatment, such as purine analogous-based chemoimmunotherapy, which leads to lymphocyte depletion. Infections are a leading cause of complications and death in CLL patients. Also, CLL patients have been shown to have a higher incidence of other malignancies. Despite this knowledge, there are no definite guidelines as to what is the best approach to manage or prevent these associated complications of CLL.

To explore this impact, we treated primary human foreskin fibroblasts with rapamycin and observed a decrease in cell proliferation without causing cell death. Upon rapamycin treatment chromosomes 18 and 10 were repositioned to a location similar to that of fibroblasts induced into quiescence by serum reduction. Although similar changes in positioning occurred, comparative transcriptome analyses demonstrated significant divergence in gene expression patterns between rapamycin-treated and quiescence-induced fibroblasts. Rapamycin treatment induced the upregulation of cytokine genes, including those from the Interleukin (IL)-6 signaling network, such as IL-8 and the Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), while quiescent fibroblasts demonstrated up-regulation of genes involved in the complement and coagulation cascade.

Identification of the functions of special signaling pathway in cell-to-cell interaction from the very first contact will help characterize the mechanism underlying the interaction and advance new drug discovery. METHODS: This paper reported a case study of characterizing initial interaction between leukemia cancer cells and bone marrow stromal cells, through the use of an optical tweezers-based cell manipulation tool. Optical traps were used to assemble leukemia cells at different positions of the stromal cell layer and enable their interactions by applying a small trapping force to maintain the cell contact for a few minutes. Specific drug was used to inhibit the binding of molecules during receptor-ligand-mediated adhesion. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the amount of adhesion molecule could affect cell adhesion during the first few minutes contact. We also found that leukemia cancer cells could migrate on the stromal cell layer, which was dependent on the adhesion state and activation triggered by specific chemokine. The reported approaches provided a new opportunity to investigate cell-to-cell interaction through single cell adhesion manipulation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied TSLPR expression, TSLP-induced signal transduction and its antibody-mediated inhibition in long-term cultures of primary cells derived from B-precursor ALL patients. METHODS: TSLPR expression was determined by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis, cell proliferation, signal transduction via the JAK/STAT pathway was analysed by Western blot detection of STAT tyrosine phosphorylation and by measuring TSLP-dependent activation of a STAT-specific reporter gene construct. For inhibition studies a recently introduced antagonistic antibody to the TSLPRalpha-subunit was used. RESULTS: TSLPR surface expression was observed in leukemic lymphoblasts from two out of ten patients with BCP-ALL. Upon TSLP stimulation, the cells with the highest TSLPR expression level showed enhanced proliferation and JAK/STAT-mediated gene regulation in a dose-dependent manner. By employment of an inhibitory antibody to the TSLPR, both TSLP-triggered cell proliferation and STAT transcription factor activation were specifically inhibited. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that blockade of the TSLPR might be a therapeutic option for a subset of BCP-ALL patients.",['NOTNLM'],"['B-precursor ALL', 'Cytokine receptors', 'Inhibitory antibody', 'TSLP']",['Copyright (c) 2015.

LSD1 is a drug target for certain cancers, due to important functions of methylated H3K4 or LSD1 overexpression. We report the design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationships of 3-(piperidin-4-ylmethoxy)pyridine containing compounds as potent LSD1 inhibitors with Ki values as low as 29 nM. These compounds exhibited high selectivity (>160x) against related monoamine oxidase A and B. Enzyme kinetics and docking studies suggested they are competitive inhibitors against a dimethylated H3K4 substrate and provided a possible binding mode.

Design and implementation of training programs for parents whose children have been diagnosed with leukemia, as the primary caregivers of children, will have a special significance and can contribute to better taking care of such children. The main purpose of the present study was to examine the impact of conducting group discussion, as care program training, on the quality of life parents whose children were suffering from leukemia. METHODS: This quasi-experimental before-after intervention study encompassed two groups of parents (in total 41) of leukemia children. To collect data, a demographic questionnaire and the shortened version of SF-36 questionnaire were used to determine the quality of life of parents. Both groups completed the quality of life questionnaires before and two months after the intervention. RESULTS: Comparison of the parents' quality of life mean scores, obtained before and two months after training, showed that promotion in 6 domains of bodily pain, general health, emotional health, role limitation due to emotional problems, social functioning, and vitality were occurred. (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Considering the important role of parents in taking care of children suffering from leukemia, introduction of care program training can be a positive step to help these parents and empower them to manage their children's problems more systematically and will ultimately lead to improved quality of life of parents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transgenic (over)expression of chemotherapy resistance (CTX-R) genes in hematopoietic stem- and progenitor cells represents a potential strategy to overcome this problem. To apply this concept in the context of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasia, we have investigated the overexpression of the multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) and the cytidine deaminase (CDD) gene conferring resistance to anthracyclines and cytarabine (Ara-C), the two most important drugs in the treatment of these diseases. METHODS: State-of-the-art, third generation, self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vectors were utilized to overexpress a human CDD-cDNA and a codon-optimized human MDR1-cDNA corrected for cryptic splice sites from a spleen focus forming virus derived internal promoter. Studies were performed in myeloid 32D cells as well as primary lineage marker negative (lin(-)) murine bone marrow cells and flow cytometric analysis of suspension cultures and clonogenic analysis of vector transduced cells following cytotoxic drug challenge were utilized as read outs. RESULTS: Efficient chemoprotection of CDD and MDR1 transduced hematopoietic 32D as well as primary lin(-) cells was proven in the context of Ara-C and anthracycline application. Both, CTX-R transduced 32D as well as primary hematopoietic cells displayed marked resistance at concentrations 5-20 times the LD50 of non-transduced control cells. Moreover, simultaneous CDD/MDR1 gene transfer resulted in similar protection levels even when combined Ara-C anthracycline treatment was applied. Furthermore, significant enrichment of transduced cells was observed upon cytotoxic drug administration. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate efficient chemoprotection as well as enrichment of transduced cells in hematopoietic cell lines as well as primary murine hematopoietic progenitor cells following Ara-C and/or anthracycline application, arguing for the efficacy as well as feasibility of our approach and warranting further evaluation of this concept.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, alpha-helix mimetics capable of mimicking such amphiphilic helical peptides should possess higher binding affinity and specificity to target proteins. Here we describe an efficient method for generating amphiphilic alpha-helix mimetics. One-face alpha-helix mimetics having hydrophobic side chains on one side was readily converted into amphiphilic alpha-helix mimetics by introducing appropriate charged residues on the opposite side.

Epub 2015 Dec 9.,"BACKGROUND: During hospitalization for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), patients experience a steep deterioration in quality of life (QOL) and mood. To our knowledge, the impact of this deterioration on patients' QOL and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms after HCT is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a prospective longitudinal study of patients hospitalized for HCT. They assessed QOL using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplantation (FACT-BMT) and depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at the time of admission for HCT, during hospitalization, and 6 months after HCT. We also used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to measure patients' anxiety and depression symptoms at baseline and during HCT hospitalization. The PTSD Checklist was used to assess for PTSD symptoms. Multivariable linear regression models were used to identify predictors of QOL and PTSD symptoms at 6 months. RESULTS: We enrolled 90 of 93 consecutively eligible patients (97%) undergoing autologous and allogeneic HCT. Data at 6 months were available for 67 participants. At 6 months, 28.4% of participants met the criteria for PTSD and 43.3% had clinically significant depression. On multivariable regression analyses adjusting for significant covariates, changes in QOL and depression scores from week 2 of HCT hospitalization to baseline predicted worse QOL (changes in scores between week 2 and baseline [Delta] QOL: beta, 0.94 [P<.0001] and Delta PHQ-9: beta, -2.59 [P = 0.001]) and PTSD symptoms (Delta QOL: beta, -0.40 [P<.0001] and Delta PHQ-9: beta, 1.26 [P<.0001]) at 6 months after HCT. CONCLUSIONS: Six months after HCT, a significant percentage of patients met the criteria for PTSD and depression. A decline in QOL and an increase in depressive symptoms during hospitalization for HCT were found to be the most important predictors of 6-month QOL impairment and PTSD symptoms. Therefore, managing symptoms of depression and QOL deterioration during HCT hospitalization may be critical to improving QOL at 6 months and reducing the risk of PTSD. Cancer 2016;122:806-812.

Epub 2016 Jan 8.,"The aetiology of childhood cancers remains largely unknown. It has been hypothesized that infections may be involved and that mini-epidemics thereof could result in space-time clustering of incident cases. Most previous studies support spatio-temporal clustering for leukaemia, while results for other diagnostic groups remain mixed. Few studies have corrected for uneven regional population shifts which can lead to spurious detection of clustering. We examined whether there is space-time clustering of childhood cancers in Switzerland identifying cases diagnosed at age <16 years between 1985 and 2010 from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. Knox tests were performed on geocoded residence at birth and diagnosis separately for leukaemia, acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL), lymphomas, tumours of the central nervous system, neuroblastomas and soft tissue sarcomas. We used Baker's Max statistic to correct for multiple testing and randomly sampled time-, sex- and age-matched controls from the resident population to correct for uneven regional population shifts. We observed space-time clustering of childhood leukaemia at birth (Baker's Max p = 0.045) but not at diagnosis (p = 0.98). Clustering was strongest for a spatial lag of <1 km and a temporal lag of <2 years (Observed/expected close pairs: 124/98; p Knox test = 0.003). A similar clustering pattern was observed for ALL though overall evidence was weaker (Baker's Max p = 0.13). Little evidence of clustering was found for other diagnostic groups (p > 0.2). Our study suggests that childhood leukaemia tends to cluster in space-time due to an etiologic factor present in early life.",['NOTNLM'],"['Europe', 'cancer registry', 'central nervous system tumours', 'leukaemia', 'soft tissue sarcoma']",['(c) 2015 UICC.'],,,,,['Int J Cancer. 2017 Mar 15;140(6):E2-E12.

We investigated the extent to which adipogenic differentiation in normal MSCs alters hematopoietic supportive capacity and we undertook an in-depth comparative study of human bone marrow MSCs derived from newly diagnosed AML patients and healthy donors, including an assessment of adipogenic differentiation capacity. FINDINGS: MSCs from healthy controls with partial induction of adipogenic differentiation, in comparison to MSCs undergoing partial osteogenic differentiation, expressed increased levels of hematopoietic factors and induced greater proliferation, decreased quiescence and reduced in vitro hematopoietic colony forming capacity of CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Moreover, we observed that AML-derived MSCs had markedly increased adipogenic potential and delayed osteogenic differentiation, while maintaining normal morphology and viability. AML-derived MSCs, however, possessed reduced proliferative capacity and decreased frequency of subendothelial quiescent MSCs compared to controls. CONCLUSION: Our results support the notion of a bone marrow microenvironment characterized by increased propensity toward adipogenesis in AML, which may negatively impact normal hematopoiesis. Larger confirmatory studies are needed to understand the impact of various clinical factors. Novel leukemia treatments aimed at normalizing bone marrow niches may enhance the competitive advantage of normal hematopoietic progenitors over leukemia cells.",['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Adipogenesis', '*Bone marrow microenvironment', '*Hematopoietic niche', '*Mesenchymal stromal cells', '*Osteogenesis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Presence of B haplotype KIR in donors is associated with a lower relapse risk for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT). However, the association of KIR and HLA repertoire with disease development and other clinical features is not well studied for AML. In this study, 206 Chinese patients with AML were analyzed for their FAB subtypes, risk groups, and chemo-responsiveness to assess possible association with their KIR and HLA profile. The results revealed that a B-content score of 2 was significantly more prevalent in AML patients when compared to normal controls. Notably, there is also a differential frequency in the distribution of B haplotype KIR across distinct FAB subtypes, where the M3 subtype had significantly lower frequencies of B haplotype KIR compared to the M5 subtype (p < 0.05). In addition, the stronger inhibitory KIR ligands HLA-C2 and HLA-Bw4-80I were present in significantly higher frequencies in the prognostically ""poor"" risk group compared to those with ""favourable"" risk (p < 0.01). Taken together, these associations with clinical features of AML suggest a role of the KIR-HLA repertoire in the development and biological behavior of AML.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Genetic association', 'HLA', 'KIR']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ZW2-1 performed anti-population growth effect which was in a concentration-dependent manner (2-12 muM) by inducing both apoptosis and autophagy in cells. The compound also caused differentiation of HL-60 and NB4 cells as shown by increasing expression of CD11b, CD14, and CD38 at moderate concentration (4 muM). At relatively high concentration (8 muM), ZW2-1 significantly decreased intracellular histone deacetylase 1 level which was also observed.

Garrahan, between 1991 and 2014. Chromosomal abnormalities were evaluated by G-banding and FISH. Since December 2002, RT-PCR determinations were systematically carried out for BCR-ABL1, KMT2A-AFF1, ETV6-RUNX1, and TCF3-PBX1 rearrangements in children, adding KMT2A-MLLT3 and KMT2A-MLLT1 in infants. The percentage of abnormalities detected by cytogenetics was 70.1%. Four novel abnormalities, t(2;8)(p11.2;p22), inv(4)(p16q25), t(1;7)(q25;q32), and t(5;6)(q21;q21), were found in this cohort. We compared cytogenetic and RT-PCR results for BCR-ABL1, KMT2A-AFF1 and TCF3-PBX1 rearrangements in 497 children evaluated by both methods. The results were highly concordant (p < 0.7), and interestingly, FISH was relevant to confirm G-banding findings that were discordant with RT-PCR studies. This study showed the importance of performing G-banding, FISH and RT-PCR simultaneously to improve the detection of chromosomal abnormalities considering their important value in the diagnosis and prognosis of childhood ALL patients. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first series of cytogenetic findings in children with ALL reported in Argentina.",['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Chromosomal abnormalities', 'FISH', 'RT-PCR']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Nov 23.,"Quercetin, a natural flavonoid, inhibits the growth of leukemia cells and induces apoptosis. Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) has been reported to promote the development of leukemia by protecting tumor cells from apoptosis through various mechanisms. The present study investigated the effects of small hairpin (sh)RNA-mediated HSP27 knockdown on the anticancer effects of quercetin in U937 human leukemia cells. Cells were transfected with recombinant lentiviral vector pCMVGNRU6shHSP27 (shHSP27), which expressed shRNA specifically targeting the HSP27 gene, alone or in combination with quercetin. The results showed that shHSP27 and quercetin synergistically inhibited U937 cell proliferation and induced apoptosis by decreasing the Bcl2-to-Bax ratio. Furthermore, this combined treatment significantly suppressed the infiltration of tumor cells and the expression of angiogenesisassociated proteins HIF1alpha and VEGF. Compared with shHSP27 or quercetin alone, shHSP27 plus quercetin markedly decreased the protein expression of cyclinD1 and thus blocked the cell cycle at G1 phase. The Notch/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is important in tumor aggressiveness; quercetin plus shHSP27 significantly decreased Notch 1 expression and the phosphorylation levels of the downstream signaling proteins AKT and mTOR. The inhibitory effects of quercetin plus shHSP27 on this pathway may thus have been responsible for the cell cycle arrest, inhibition of proliferations and infiltration as well as enhancement of apoptosis. Therefore, these findings collectively suggested that suppression of HSP27 expression amplified the anticancer effects of quercetin in U937 human leukemia cells, and that quercetin in combination with shHSP27 represents a promising therapeutic strategy for human leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies to determine incidence and prognostic significance of somatic mutations in CMML have relied on candidate gene sequencing, although an unbiased mutational search has not been conducted. As many of the genes commonly mutated in CMML were recently associated with age-related clonal hematopoiesis (ARCH) and aged hematopoiesis is characterized by a myelomonocytic differentiation bias, we hypothesized that CMML and aged hematopoiesis may be closely related. We initially established the somatic mutation landscape of CMML by whole exome sequencing followed by gene-targeted validation. Genes mutated in 10% of patients were SRSF2, TET2, ASXL1, RUNX1, SETBP1, KRAS, EZH2, CBL and NRAS, as well as the novel CMML genes FAT4, ARIH1, DNAH2 and CSMD1. Most CMML patients (71%) had mutations in 2 ARCH genes and 52% had 7 mutations overall. Higher mutation burden was associated with shorter survival. Age-adjusted population incidence and reported ARCH mutation rates are consistent with a model in which clinical CMML ensues when a sufficient number of stochastically acquired age-related mutations has accumulated, suggesting that CMML represents the leukemic conversion of the myelomonocytic-lineage-biased aged hematopoietic system.",,,,,,,"['CCM and MWD report a potential related conflict of interest of research funding', 'from Agilent Technologies, Inc.

Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) has recently been reported to interact with Cn in neuronal cells and is implicated in MLL leukemia. Our biochemical studies clearly demonstrated that Cn was able to interact with GSK-3beta in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells, and that this interaction was direct, leading to an increased catalytic activity of GSK-3beta, possibly through autophosphorylation of Y216. Sensitivity to GSK-3 inhibitor treatment correlated with altered GSK-3beta phosphorylation and was more prominent in T-ALL with Pre/Pro immunophenotype. In addition, dual Cn and GSK-3 inhibitor treatment in T-ALL cells promoted sensitization to apoptosis through proteasomal degradation of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). Consistently, resistance to drug treatments in primary samples was strongly associated with higher XIAP protein levels. Finally, we showed that dual Cn and GSK-3 inhibitor treatment in vitro and in vivo is effective against available models of T-ALL, indicating an insofar untapped therapeutic opportunity.",,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3629-4330'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 9.,"The transcription factor forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) is a validated oncoprotein in solid cancers, but its role in malignant plasma cell tumors such as multiple myeloma (MM) is unknown. We analyzed publicly available MM data sets and found that overexpression of FOXM1 prognosticates inferior outcome in a subset (~15%) of newly diagnosed cases, particularly patients with high-risk disease based on global gene expression changes. Follow-up studies using human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs) as the principal experimental model system demonstrated that enforced expression of FOXM1 increased growth, survival and clonogenicity of myeloma cells, whereas knockdown of FOXM1 abolished these features. In agreement with that, constitutive upregulation of FOXM1 promoted HMCL xenografts in laboratory mice, whereas inducible knockdown of FOXM1 led to growth inhibition. Expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) and NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2) was coregulated with FOXM1 in both HMCLs and myeloma patient samples, suggesting interaction of these three genes in a genetic network that may lend itself to targeting with small-drug inhibitors for new approaches to myeloma therapy and prevention. These results establish FOXM1 as high-risk myeloma gene and provide support for the design and testing of FOXM1-targeted therapies specifically for the FOXM1(High) subset of myeloma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 9.,"Intensive chemotherapy regimens containing cytarabine have substantially improved remission durability and overall survival in younger adults with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). However, there have been no long-term follow-up results for patients treated with these regimens. We present long-term survival outcomes from a pivotal phase II trial of rituximab, hyper-fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone alternating with methotrexate and cytarabine (R-HCVAD/MA). At 15 years of follow-up (median: 13.4 years), the median failure-free survival (FFS) and overall survival (OS) for all patients was 4.8 years and 10.7 years, respectively. The FFS seems to have plateaued after 10 years, with an estimated 15-year FFS of 30% in younger patients (</=65 years). Patients who achieved complete response (CR) after 2 cycles had a favourable median FFS of 8.8 years. Six patients developed myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia (MDS/AML) whilst in first CR. The 10-year cumulative incidence of MDS/AML of patients in first remission was 6.2% (95% confidence interval: 2.5-12.2%). In patients with newly diagnosed MCL, R-HCVAD/MA showed sustained efficacy, with a median OS exceeding 10 years in all patients and freedom from disease recurrence of nearly 15 years in almost one-third of the younger patients (</=65 years).",['NOTNLM'],"['hyper-CVAD', 'mantle cell lymphoma', 'methotrexate', 'secondary malignancy', 'treatment']",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7988-1565', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1824-2337']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Feb 3.,"The impact of the immune microenvironment on the behavior and therapeutic strategies for hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms is being increasingly recognized. Many functional studies of natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxic responses in myelodysplasia (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exist, but with limited data on these lymphocyte proportions and related T-cell subsets. The proportions of these cells and their prognostic implications were therefore investigated in 89 AML, 51 MDS, and 20 control marrows by flow cytometry. The median proportion of NK cells (relative to the total lymphocytes) was lower in AML versus controls (P = 0.01). Among AML, a lower proportion of NK cells predicted better survival, whereas a higher NK cell proportion was associated with the poor prognostic AML category (P = 0.002). NK cell proportions were similar in MDS, MDS subgroups, and control marrows. The relative proportion of the mature NK cell subset (CD56(dim) CD16/57(bright) ) was lower in AML and MDS versus controls (P = 0.006, P = 0.0002, respectively). The proportion of mature NK cells was not a prognostic indicator although fewer were seen in poor prognosis AML. In contrast, a lower proportion of mature NK cells correlated with worse survival in MDS (P = 0.027). A higher proportion of NK-like T-cells (of total lymphoid cells) was found in MDS compared to controls (P = 0.01). A lower proportion of NK-like T-cells predicted better survival in AML but not in MDS. Thus, the proportions of NK, NK-cell subsets, and NK-like T-cells vary in myeloid neoplasms, may potentially impact immunomodulatory therapies, and may impact outcome.

Epub 2015 Dec 9.,"Both Dasision and ENESTnd trials had many exclusion criteria, with a possible selection bias compared with the real-life. To address the impact of this bias on the first-line treatment in the current clinical practice, we revised 207 unselected newly diagnosed chronic phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients [M/F 108/99, median age 58.8 years, interquartile range 42.3-70.2] treated with front-line imatinib from June 2002 to June 2013 at our Institution, and evaluated how many of them would have been excluded from enrolment in the two trials. Twenty-eight patients (13.5%) should have been excluded by both trials because of polycomorbidities (12), severe cardiomyopathy (five), age > 80 with frailty (three), drug abuse (two) or other severe concomitant diseases (six). In addition, eight patients should have been excluded by Dasision due to isolated chronic obstructive broncopulmonar disease, and 19 patients should have been excluded by ENESTnd due to isolated diabetes (10), arrhythmia (four), acute myocardial infarction > 6 months before CML diagnosis (two), chronic pancreatic disease (two) and peripheral arterial obstructive disease (one). On the whole, 36 patients (17.4%) would have been excluded by Dasision trial and 47 (22.7%) by ENESTnd trial. The patients potentially not eligible for both trials were significantly older and with imatinib had a worse outcome compared with patients potentially eligible. Our data highlight that an automatic transposition of results available in clinical controlled trials into the frontline real-life management of CML patients should be regarded with caution.

Eighty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups that received distilled water (control) or daily doses of 5 mg/kg body weight, 10 mg/kg, or 15 mg/kg AQ for 2 weeks. Testes morphology was analyzed using hematoxylin-and-eosin staining, terminal dUTP nicked-end labeling (TUNEL), and immunostaining whereas protein expression was determined by Western blotting. AQ dose-dependently led to abnormal spermatogenesis. Disruption of the blood-testis barrier and increased germ cell apoptosis were observed in all three AQ-treated groups. Interestingly, AQ-induced damage of spermatogenesis recovered over time, based on the survival of promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger (PLZF)-positive, undifferentiated spermatogonia. Serum levels of luteinizing hormone and testosterone, as well as testicular testosterone levels, were not significantly altered in AQ-treated groups compared with controls. Collectively, our study suggests that AQ exerts substantial acute side effects on the reproductive systems of adult male rats by inducing the apoptosis of differentiating spermatogenic cells and disruption of blood-testis barrier function.",,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 7.,"SIRT2, one of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent class histone deacetylase family proteins, has been found to be involved in the proliferation and survival of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. However, its effect on drug resistance on chemoresistant AML cells is unclear. In the present study, we first found that SIRT2 was expressed at higher level in the relapsed AML patients than the newly diagnosed patients. Consistent with this observation, the expression level of SIRT2 was higher in HL60/A cells than that in HL60 cells. Depletion of SIRT2 by shRNAs in HL60/A cells resulted in decreased MRP1 level, enhanced drug accumulation and triggered more apoptosis. By contrast, overexpression of SIRT2 in HL60 cells led to increased MRP1 level, drug efflux and attenuated drug sensitivity. Moreover, the decreased expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 was detected in SIRT2-depleted HL60/A cells and increased expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 was observed in SIRT2 overexpressed HL60 cells. Furthermore, blockage of ERK1/2 signaling pathway with the chemical inhibitor PD98059, further induced apoptosis of HL60/A cells conferred by SIRT2 depletion. Importantly, ERK1/2 inhibition was able to reverse the drug resistance of HL60 conferred by SIRT2 overexpression. Thus, our findings collectively suggested that the expression level of SIRT2 has a positive relationship with DNR/Ara-C resistance and activity of ERK1/2 signaling pathway. SIRT2 might regulate DNR/Ara-C sensitivity in AML cells at least partially through the ERK1/2 pathway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 8.,"Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) comprise multiple classes of transcripts that have no protein-coding ability but play critical roles as RNA regulators in various cellular processes. To date, the well-studied ncRNAs are microRNAs (miRs) that generally act as regulators of gene expression through binding to target mRNAs. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have led to the discovery of thousands of unannotated noncoding transcripts, especially long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). These lncRNAs are being increasingly recognized as key regulators in diverse biological processes via a variety of mechanisms. Aberrant expression of miRs and lncRNAs has been shown to be associated with many human diseases and cancers. Increasing ncRNAs have been identified as biomarkers for patient prognosis and potential therapeutic agents for cancers. Furthermore, it is worth noting that progresses have been made in understanding the functional involvement of ncRNAs in Bcr-Abl-induced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Here, we highlight the pathogenesis of CML, functional significance of miRs and lncRNAs in regulation of CML development and involved mechanisms underlying their action.",['NOTNLM'],"['Bcr-Abl', 'CML', 'cancer', 'lncRNAs', 'microRNAs']","['(c) The Author 2015.

Epub 2015 Dec 8.,"PURPOSE: Relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (rrDLBCL) is fatal in 90% of patients, and yet little is known about its biology. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using exome sequencing, we characterized the mutation profiles of 38 rrDLBCL biopsies obtained at the time of progression after immunochemotherapy. To identify genes that may be associated with relapse, we compared the mutation frequency in samples obtained at relapse to an unrelated cohort of 138 diagnostic DLBCLs and separately amplified specific mutations in their matched diagnostic samples to identify clonal expansions. RESULTS: On the basis of a higher frequency at relapse and evidence for clonal selection, TP53, FOXO1, MLL3 (KMT2C), CCND3, NFKBIZ, and STAT6 emerged as top candidate genes implicated in therapeutic resistance. We observed individual examples of clonal expansions affecting genes whose mutations had not been previously associated with DLBCL including two regulators of NF-kappaB: NFKBIE and NFKBIZ We detected mutations that may be affect sensitivity to novel therapeutics, such as MYD88 and CD79B mutations, in 31% and 23% of patients with activated B-cell-type of rrDLBCL, respectively. We also identified recurrent STAT6 mutations affecting D419 in 36% of patients with the germinal center B (GCB) cell rrDLBCL. These were associated with activated JAK/STAT signaling, increased phospho-STAT6 protein expression and increased expression of STAT6 target genes. CONCLUSIONS: This work improves our understanding of therapeutic resistance in rrDLBCL and has identified novel therapeutic opportunities especially for the high-risk patients with GCB-type rrDLBCL.

We have studied 58 pediatric patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation who suffered from CMV reactivation to reveal which functional T cell subset is best correlating with successful reactivation resolution and which protects from reactivation episode. METHODS: Detection of 30 combinatorial subsets of four types of response to ex vivo CMV stimulation (IFNgamma secretion, IL-2 secretion, CD40L upregulation and degranulation) that were detectable on either CD8+ or CD4+ T cells through flow cytometry intracellular cytokine staining was used. RESULTS: We found that the presence of CD8+ dual positive (IFNgamma+ and IL-2+) cells is the most accurate functional parameter that can predict fast resolution of CMV reactivation. Next, we show that the presence of CD8+ dual positive (IFNgamma+ and IL-2+) and CD8+ IFNgamma+ cells provides a protective effect (a hazard risk of 0.28 (confidence interval 0.18 - 0.43) and 0.45 (CI 0.27 - 0.75), respectively) and the presence of corticotherapy increases the risk of reactivation (HR 2.47 (CI 1.82-3.36)). Thus, a patient without corticotherapy and with both of the critical T cell subsets present has a cumulative 19.6 times lower risk of developing CMV reactivation than a patient on corticotherapy and without CD8+ dual positive (IFNgamma+ and IL-2+) or CD8+ IFNgamma+ cells. CONCLUSIONS: We have established parameters of CMV specific functional response ex vivo that can be used in assisting clinical management of patients with CMV reactivation.

We tested whether folate consumption during the 12 months prior to conception induced DNA methylation modifications at birth in healthy neonates with a genome-wide and agnostic approach. We hypothesized that DNA methylation in genes involved in neural tube development and/or cancer susceptibility would be affected by folate exposure. We retrospectively assessed folate exposure at the time of conception by food-frequency questionnaires administered to the mothers of 343 healthy newborns. We measured genome-wide DNA methylation from neonatal blood spots. We implemented a method based on bootstrap resampling to decrease false-positive findings. Folate was inversely associated with DNA methylation throughout the genome. Among the top folate-associated genes that were replicated in an independent Gambian study were TFAP2A, a gene critical for neural crest development, STX11, a gene implicated in acute myeloid leukemia, and CYS1, a candidate gene for cystic kidney disease. Reduced periconceptional folate intake was associated with increased methylation and, in turn, decreased gene expression at these 3 loci. The top folate-sensitive genes defined by their associated CpG sites were enriched for numerous transcription factors by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, including those implicated in cancer development (e.g., MYC-associated zinc finger protein). The influence of estimated periconceptional folate intake on neonatal DNA methylation levels provides potential mechanistic insights into the role of this vitamin in the development of neural tube defects and childhood cancers.",['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'cancer prevention', 'developmental origin of health and disease', 'epigenetics', 'folate', 'neural tube defects']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

remains challenging. Therefore, this study aims at establishing novel prognostic tumor DNA methylation biomarkers. In total, 396 low- and high-risk primary tumors were analyzed, of which 87 were profiled using methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) sequencing for differential methylation analysis between prognostic patient groups. Subsequently, methylation-specific PCR (MSP) assays were developed for 78 top-ranking differentially methylated regions and tested on two independent cohorts of 132 and 177 samples, respectively. Further, a new statistical framework was used to identify a robust set of MSP assays of which the methylation score (i.e. the percentage of methylated assays) allows accurate outcome prediction. Survival analyses were performed on the individual target level, as well as on the combined multimarker signature. As a result of the differential DNA methylation assessment by MBD sequencing, 58 of the 78 MSP assays were designed in regions previously unexplored in neuroblastoma, and 36 are located in non-promoter or non-coding regions. In total, 5 individual MSP assays (located in CCDC177, NXPH1, lnc-MRPL3-2, lnc-TREX1-1 and one on a region from chromosome 8 with no further annotation) predict event-free survival and 4 additional assays (located in SPRED3, TNFAIP2, NPM2 and CYYR1) also predict overall survival. Furthermore, a robust 58-marker methylation signature predicting overall and event-free survival was established. In conclusion, this study encompasses the largest DNA methylation biomarker study in neuroblastoma so far.

The CXCR4 ligand (CXCL12) stimulates CXCR4 promoting cell survival and proliferation, and may contribute to the tropism of leukemia cells towards lymphoid tissues. Therefore, strategies targeting CXCR4 may constitute an effective therapeutic approach for CLL. To address that question, we studied the effect of Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564), a fully human IgG4 anti-CXCR4 antibody, using a stroma--CLL cells co-culture model. We found that Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) inhibited CXCL12 mediated CXCR4 activation-migration of CLL cells at nanomolar concentrations. This effect was comparable to AMD3100 (Plerixafor--Mozobil), a small molecule CXCR4 inhibitor. However, Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) but not AMD3100 induced apoptosis in CLL at nanomolar concentrations in the presence or absence of stromal cell support. This pro-apoptotic effect was independent of CLL high-risk prognostic markers, was associated with production of reactive oxygen species and did not require caspase activation. Overall, these findings are evidence that Ulocuplumab (BMS-936564) has biological activity in CLL, highlight the relevance of the CXCR4-CXCL12 pathway as a therapeutic target in CLL, and provide biological rationale for ongoing clinical trials in CLL and other hematological malignancies.",['NOTNLM'],"['BMS-936564', 'CXCR4', 'Ulocuplumab', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'reactive oxygen species']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, DNA lesions can be repaired by activities of DNA repair systems. Increasing evidence have shown that enhanced DNA damage repair capacity contributes to chemotherapy resistance in leukemia cells. Thus, targeting DNA repair mechanisms is a promising strategy for novel leukemia treatment. SIRT1 expressions were downregulated by lentivirus-delivered SIRT1 shRNA in myeloid leukemia cells. SIRT1 mRNA and protein levels were analyzed by real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. Flow cytometry was carried out to analyze cell cycle progression, apoptosis and DNA damage repair efficiency. DNA damage levels were assessed by alkaline comet assay, and H2AX phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. A mouse leukemia model was established by transplanting lentivirus-infected K562 cells containing SIRT1 shRNA into sublethally irradiated NOD/SCID mice, and tumorigenesis was evaluated by detecting tumor weights and mice survival. SIRT1 expressions were upregulated in myeloid leukemic patients. Downregulation of SIRT1 by RNAi promoted etoposide-induced DNA damage in myeloid leukemia cells accompanied by reduced NHEJ activity, and increased Ku70 acetylation. Furthermore, SIRT1 knockdown resulted in cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis and reduction of K562 cell proliferation accompanied by enhanced p53 and FOXO1 acetylation in K562 cells after etoposide treatment. Importantly, SIRT1 downregulation reduced the tumorigenesis ability of K562 cells in mouse xenografts following chemotherapy treatment. These results revealed that SIRT1 promotes the NHEJ repair pathway by deacetylating Ku70 in K562 cells, suggesting that SIRT1 is a novel therapeutic target for treating myeloid leukemia.",['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage repair', 'Ku70', 'SIRT1', 'non-homologous end joining']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its incidence increases with age, from 0.09/100 000 at </=15 years old to 7.88/100 000 at >/=75 years old. There are several biological and clinical differences between pediatric and adult CML. Markedly increased leukocyte count and a higher incidence of splenomegaly are characteristic features at diagnosis in pediatric patients. The therapeutic approach to CML has changed since the introduction of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib, followed by dasatinib and nilotinib. Given the efficacy of TKI in adult CML, TKI are regarded as the established first-line treatment in adult patients. In 2011, a prospective phase IV study in pediatric patients showed the excellent efficacy and safety of imatinib. Imatinib is also accepted as a first-line option for childhood chronic phase CML. Although the efficacy of dasatinib and nilotinib reported in adult studies seems very attractive for pediatric patients, neither drug has been prospectively investigated in a large pediatric cohort. TKI are designed to inhibit BCR-ABL1 kinase, but they have unfavorable effects, so-called ""off-target"" complications, such as growth impairment. Long-term morbidity due to TKI is unknown. Furthermore, the adverse effects on growing children have not been clearly elucidated, even though the exposure period to imatinib is relatively short. To establish the standard therapeutic management for pediatric CML, it is important to prospectively confirm the attractive outcomes obtained in adult studies via pediatric clinical trials with a careful monitoring system for TKI-induced adverse effects, especially in growing children.",['NOTNLM'],"['child', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'imatinib mesylate', 'stem cell transplantation', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",['(c) 2015 Japan Pediatric Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we looked at 14 studies then scatterplots and linear regressions were used to estimate the relationship between the dose of gemtuzumab and its toxicity and efficacy. A non-significant increase in bilirubin level and in incidence of veno-occlusive disease was seen with higher doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin when used as single-agent. In terms of efficacy, even a low dose of 3 mg/m(2) of gemtuzumab ozogamicin can have antileukemic effect, but available data do not allow conclusions on its dose-dependency. Data indicate that higher doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin account for more adverse events. The data do not show that a high dose is required for anti-leukemic efficacy of gemtuzumab ozogamicin.

RESULTS: An 8-year-old boy with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) received chemotherapy, but relapsed 3 months after discontinuation of treatment. Subsequent chemotherapy was ineffective, and then, while in non-complete remission, he developed pulmonary and cerebral mucormycosis. On gene analysis the fungus was identified as Lichtheimia ramosa.

Aberrant expression levels of ion channels and Sig1R have been detected in tumors and cancer cells, such as myeloid leukemia and colorectal cancer, but the link between ion channel regulation and Sig1R overexpression during malignancy has not been established. In this study, we found that Sig1R dynamically controls the membrane expression of the human voltage-dependent K(+) channel human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) in myeloid leukemia and colorectal cancer cell lines. Sig1R promoted the formation of hERG/beta1-integrin signaling complexes upon extracellular matrix stimulation, triggering the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Consequently, the presence of Sig1R in cancer cells increased motility and VEGF secretion. In vivo, Sig1R expression enhanced the aggressiveness of tumor cells by potentiating invasion and angiogenesis, leading to poor survival. Collectively, our findings highlight a novel function for Sig1R in mediating cross-talk between cancer cells and their microenvironment, thus driving oncogenesis by shaping cellular electrical activity in response to extracellular signals. Given the involvement of ion channels in promoting several hallmarks of cancer, our study also offers a potential strategy to therapeutically target ion channel function through Sig1R inhibition.",,,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 8.,"PURPOSE: The metabolism and disposition of the first-in-class DOT1L inhibitor, EPZ-5676 (pinometostat), was investigated in rat and dog. Metabolite profiles were compared with those from adult patients in the first-in-man phase 1 study as well as the cross-species metabolism observed in vitro. METHODS: EPZ-5676 was administered to rat and dog as a 24-h IV infusion of [(14)C]-EPZ-5676 for determination of pharmacokinetics, mass balance, metabolite profiling and biodistribution by quantitative whole-body autoradiography (QWBA). Metabolite profiling and identification was performed by radiometric and LC-MS/MS analysis. RESULTS: Fecal excretion was the major route of elimination, representing 79 and 81% of the total dose in and rat and dog, respectively. QWBA in rats showed that the radioactivity was well distributed in the body, except for the central nervous system, and the majority of radioactivity was eliminated from most tissues by 168 h. Fecal recovery of dose-related material in bile duct-cannulated animals as well as higher radioactivity concentrations in the wall of the large intestine relative to liver implicated intestinal secretion as well as biliary elimination. EPZ-5676 underwent extensive oxidative metabolism with the major metabolic pathways being hydroxylation of the t-butyl group (EPZ007769) and N-dealkylation of the central nitrogen. Loss of adenine from parent EPZ-5676 (M7) was observed only in rat and dog feces, suggesting the involvement of gut microbiota. In rat and dog, steady-state plasma levels of total radioactivity and parent EPZ-5676 were attained rapidly and maintained through the infusion period before declining rapidly on cessation of dosing. Unchanged EPZ-5676 was the predominant circulating species in rat, dog and man. CONCLUSIONS: The excretory and metabolic pathways for EPZ-5676 were very similar across species. Renal excretion of both parent EPZ-5676 and EPZ-5676-related material was low, and in preclinical species fecal excretion of parent EPZ-5676 and EPZ007769 accounted for the majority of drug-related elimination.",['NOTNLM'],"['DOT1L', 'Drug disposition', 'Drug metabolism', 'Epigenetics', 'Histone methyltransferase inhibitor', 'MLL-r leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The study included three children with a clinical picture suggestive of PRES, HII, and ATL of different etiologies who were diagnosed and treated at a tertiary pediatric medical center in 2011 to 2014. RESULTS: All patients presented with blindness following seizures with asphyxia/aspiration in a syndromatic child, too-rapid lipid infusion in a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and repeated vomiting in a child with cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus, and malfunction of ventriculoperitoneal shunt. All patients had cortical blindness and high-signal foci in the cortical and subcortical regions on magnetic resonance imaging. All children improved. CONCLUSIONS: Familiarity with the clinical and radiological characteristics of neurological conditions leading to reversible cortical blindness is essential for diagnosis and management. Distinguishing PRES from HII and ATL can be challenging. Our cases most likely combined these etiologies, with the first patient diagnosed with PRES with HII, the second with PRES with ATL, and the third with focal HII. Given the diversity of the findings and the unclear prognostic significance, studies of the pathophysiology of PRES are warranted.",,,['Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart . New York.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are more than 302 000 people living with acute and chronic leukemia in the United States. Treatment has been shown to have both positive and negative effects on health-related quality of life (HRQOL). OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to examine psychometric properties of symptom and HRQOL instruments and to provide implications for the assessment in adults with acute leukemia relevant to clinical practice and future research. METHODS: Systematic literature search was conducted from 1990 to 2014 using electronic databases and manual searches. Psychometric studies were considered eligible for inclusion if (1) the psychometric paper was published using at least 1 HRQOL or symptom instrument, and (2) adults with acute leukemia were included in the sample. Studies were excluded if the age groups were not adults, or if the instrument was in a language other than English. RESULTS: Review identified a total of 7 instruments (1 cancer generic HRQOL, 2 symptom related, 3 HRQOL combined with symptom questions, and 1 disease specific). The most commonly used instrument was the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30, followed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: An acute leukemia diagnosis can have a significant impact on HRQOL. Our recommendations include using both an HRQOL and symptom instrument to capture patient experiences during and after treatment. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The availability of comprehensive, valid, and reliable HRQOL and symptom instruments to capture the experiences of adults with acute leukemia during and after treatment is limited.",,,,,,,"['Dr. Reeve has a conflict of interest with Patient Reported Outcomes and', 'Behavioral Evidence (PROBE) Advisory Board.

We tested multiple alignment and variant calling algorithms and validated ~200,000 putative SNVs by sequencing them to depths of ~1,000x. Additional targeted sequencing provided over 10,000x coverage and ddPCR assays provided up to ~250,000x sampling of selected sites. We evaluated the effects of different library generation approaches, depth of sequencing, and analysis strategies on the ability to effectively characterize a complex tumor.

Epub 2015 Oct 31.,"BACKGROUND: This research studies the effects of activation and inhibition of Wnt3A signaling pathway in buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) embryonic stem (ES) cell-like cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To carry on this experimental study, the effects of activation and inhibition of Wnt3A signaling in buffalo ES cell-like cells were examined using Bio (0.5 mM) combined with WNT3A (200 ng/ml), as an activator, and Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1, 250 ng/ml), as an inhibitor, of the pathway. ES cells were cultured up to three weeks in ES cell medium without fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), but in the presence of Bio, WNT3A, Bio+WNT3A and Dkk1. The effects of these supplements were measured on the mean area of ES cell colonies and on the expression levels of a number of important genes related to pluripotency (Oct4, Nanog, Sox2 and c-Myc) and the Wnt pathway (beta-catenin). ES cell colonies cultured in ES cell medium that contained optimized quantities of LIF and FGF-2 were used as the control. Data were collected for week-1 and week-3 treated cultures. In addition, WNT3A-transfected ES cells were compared with the respective mock-transfected colonies, either alone or in combination with Dkk1 for expression of beta-catenin and the pluripotency-related genes. Data were analyzed by ANOVA, and statistical significance was accepted at P<0.05. RESULTS: Among various examined concentrations of Bio (0.5-5 mM), the optimum effect was observed at the 0.5 mM dose as indicated by colony area and expressions of pluripotency-related genes at both weeks-1 and -3 culture periods. At this concentration,the expressions of Nanog, Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc and beta-catenin genes were nonsignificantly higher compared to the controls. Expressions of these genes were highest in the Bio+WNT3A treated group, followed by the WNT3A and Bio-supplemented groups, and lowest in the Dkk1-treated group. The WNT-transfected colonies showed higher expressions compared to both mock and Dkk1-treated mock transfected colonies. CONCLUSION: WNT3A functions to maintain the pluripotency of ES cell-like cells both as an exogenous growth factor as well as an endogenously expressed gene. It complements the absence of FGF-2 and LIF, otherwise propounded essential for buffalo ES cell culture. WNT3A antagonizes the inhibitory effects of Dkk1 and acts in combination with its activator, Bio, to activate the Wnt signaling pathway.",['NOTNLM'],"['Bio', 'Buffalo', 'Dkk1', 'Embryonic Stem Cells', 'WNT3A']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a rare case of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia / small lymphocytic lymphoma associated with a cutaneous metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in a cervical lymph node. In the affected lymph node, it was observed an effacement of the normal architecture by neoplastic lymphocytes and it was noted the presence of neoplastic invasive epithelial islands. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that lymphocytic proliferation was positive for CD20, CD5, CD23 and Kappa, and negative for CD3, CD10, Cyclin D1 and Lambda. The morphological and immunohistochemical profile lead to a phenotype of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia / small lymphocytic lymphoma. The epithelial cells were positive for CK5, thus rendering the diagnosis of synchronous metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. Literature supports the poor prognosis in cases that present coexistence of squamous cell carcinoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia / small lymphocytic lymphoma. Thus, it is necessary to be aware about this unusual finding in order to provide specific treatment.

Epub 2015 Dec 7.,"PURPOSE: This study evaluated the efficacy of pediatric-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy in adults with lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective phase II study in adults 18 to 59 years old with previously untreated LL. Patients were treated with an adapted pediatric-like ALL protocol, which included a corticosteroid prephase, a five-drug induction reinforced by sequential cyclophosphamide administration, dose-dense consolidation, late intensification, CNS prophylaxis, and a 2-year maintenance phase. Treatment response was assessed by computed tomography and optional positron emission tomography. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant was offered to selected patients in first complete remission (CR) or unconfirmed CR. RESULTS: The study enrolled 148 patients (131 with T-lineage LL [T-LL] and 17 with B-lineage LL [B-LL]). A total of 119 patients with T-LL (90.8%) and 13 with B-LL (76.5%) reached CR/unconfirmed CR, including 26 with T-LL and two with B-LL who needed a second induction salvage course. Relapse occurred in 34 patients with T-LL and four with B-LL. In patients with T-LL, 3-year event-free survival was 63.3% (95% CI, 54.2% to 71.0%), disease-free survival was 72.4% (95% CI, 63.0% to 79.7%), and overall survival was 69.2% (95% CI, 60.0% to 76.7%). Multivariate analysis identified serum lactate dehydrogenase level and the NOTCH1/FBXW7/RAS/PTEN oncogene (a four-gene oncogenetic classifier) status but not positron emission tomography or hematopoietic stem cell transplant as independent prognostic factors for outcome in T-LL. CONCLUSION: In adults with LL, an intensive pediatric-like ALL treatment protocol was associated with a good response rate and outcome. In patients with T-LL, the four-gene oncogenetic classifier and lactate dehydrogenase level were independent prognostic indicators.",,,['(c) 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a case of a 5-year-old boy who presented to the emergency department with gross hematuria, abdominal pain, and vomiting and was ultimately diagnosed with uric acid nephrolithiasis and acute renal failure secondary to spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome in the setting of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Tumor lysis syndrome is considered an oncologic emergency, and in this case, the child required urgent treatment with potassium-binding agents, rasburicase, and hemodialysis. This case demonstrates that occult hematologic malignancy should be suspected in cases of nephrolithiasis and acute renal failure when found in conjunction with hyperuricemia despite a normal complete blood count at the time of presentation.",,,['Copyright (c) 2016 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 7.,"PURPOSE: Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), a calicheamicin-conjugated mAb against CD33, has been used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We evaluated the impact of the addition of GO to standard chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) in patients withFLT3/ITD. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed children withFLT3/ITD-positive AML (n= 183) treated on two consecutive Children's Oncology Group AML trials (NCT00070174andNCT00372593). Outcomes were assessed forFLT3/ITD patients receiving standard chemotherapy with or without GO (GO vs. No-GO, respectively), and the impact of consolidation HCT for high-riskFLT3/ITD patients [highFLT3/ITD allelic ratio (ITD-AR)]. RESULTS: For allFLT3/ITD patients, complete remission (CR) rates for the GO versus No-GO cohorts were identical (64% vs. 64%;P= 0.98). Relapse rate (RR) after initial CR was 37% for GO recipients versus 59% for No-GO recipients (P= 0.02), disease-free survival (DFS) was similar (47% vs. 41%;P= 0.45), with higher treatment-related mortality (TRM) in GO recipients (16% vs. 0%;P= 0.008). Among high-riskFLT3/ITD patients with high ITD-AR, those who received HCT in first CR with prior exposure to GO had a significant reduction in RR (15% vs. 53%;P= 0.007), with a corresponding DFS of 65% versus 40% (P= 0.08), and higher TRM (19% vs. 7%;P= 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: CD33 targeting with HCT consolidation may be an important therapeutic strategy in high-riskFLT3/ITD AML and its efficacy and associated toxicity warrant further investigation.",,,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Print 2016 Feb 15.,"Stem cell phenotypes are reflected by posttranslational histone modifications, and this chromatin-related memory must be mitotically inherited to maintain cell identity through proliferative expansion. In human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), bivalent genes with both activating (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3) histone modifications are essential to sustain pluripotency. Yet, the molecular mechanisms by which this epigenetic landscape is transferred to progeny cells remain to be established. By mapping genomic enrichment of H3K4me3/H3K27me3 in pure populations of hESCs in G2, mitotic, and G1 phases of the cell cycle, we found striking variations in the levels of H3K4me3 through the G2-M-G1 transition. Analysis of a representative set of bivalent genes revealed that chromatin modifiers involved in H3K4 methylation/demethylation are recruited to bivalent gene promoters in a cell cycle-dependent fashion. Interestingly, bivalent genes enriched with H3K4me3 exclusively during mitosis undergo the strongest upregulation after induction of differentiation. Furthermore, the histone modification signature of genes that remain bivalent in differentiated cells resolves into a cell cycle-independent pattern after lineage commitment. These results establish a new dimension of chromatin regulation important in the maintenance of pluripotency.",,,"['Copyright (c) 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Decreased Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) expression has been observed in AML, but how decreased KLF4 contributes to AML pathogenesis is largely unknown. We demonstrate decreased KLF4 expression in AML patient samples with various cytogenetic aberrations, confirm that KLF4 overexpression promotes myeloid differentiation and inhibits cell proliferation in AML cell lines, and identify new targets of KLF4. We have demonstrated that microRNA 150 (miR-150) expression is decreased in AML and that reintroducing miR-150 expression induces myeloid differentiation and inhibits proliferation of AML cells. We show that KLF family DNA binding sites are necessary for miR-150 promoter activity and that KLF2 or KLF4 overexpression induces miR-150 expression. miR-150 silencing, alone or in combination with silencing of CDKN1A, a well-described KLF4 target, did not fully reverse KLF4-mediated effects. Gene expression profiling and validation identified putative KLF4-regulated genes, including decreased MYC and downstream MYC-regulated gene expression in KLF4-overexpressing cells. Our findings indicate that decreased KLF4 expression mediates antileukemic effects through regulation of gene and microRNA networks, containing miR-150, CDKN1A, and MYC, and provide mechanistic support for therapeutic strategies increasing KLF4 expression.",,,"['Copyright (c) 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Epub 2015 Nov 28.,"Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly P. carinii) is an opportunistic fungus responsible for pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. Pneumocystosis in non-HIV-infected patients differs from AIDS-associated pneumocystosis in mostly two aspects: diagnosis is more difficult, and prognosis is worse. Hence, efforts should be made to target immunocompromised patients at higher risk of pneumocystosis, so that they are prescribed long-term, low-dose, trimethoprime-sulfamethoxazole, highly effective for pneumocystosis prophylaxis. Patients at highest risk include those with medium and small vessels vasculitis, lymphoproliferative B disorders (chronic or acute lymphocytic leukaemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma), and solid cancer on long-term corticosteroids. Conversely, widespread use of prophylaxis in all patients carrier of inflammatory diseases on long-term corticosteroids is not warranted. The management of pneumocystosis in non-AIDS immunocompromised patients follows the rules established for AIDS patients. The diagnosis relies on the detection of P. jiroveci cyst on respiratory samples, while PCR does not reliably discriminate infection from colonization, in 2015. High-doses trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is, by far, the treatment of choice. The benefit of adjuvant corticosteroid therapy for hypoxic patients, well documented in AIDS patients, has a much lower level of evidence in non-HIV-infected patients, most of them being already on corticosteroid by the time of pneumocystosis diagnosis anyway. However, based on its striking impact on morbi-mortality in AIDS patients, adjuvant corticosteroid is recommended in hypoxic, non-HIV-infected patients with pneumocystosis by many experts and scientific societies.",['NOTNLM'],"['*HIV', '*Hematological malignancy', '*Hemopathie maligne', '*Inflammatory diseases', '*Maladies systemiques', '*Pneumocystis jiroveci', '*Solid organ transplant', ""*Transplantation d'organe solide"", '*Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole', '*Trimethoprime-sulfamethoxazole', '*VIH', '*Vascularite', '*Vasculitis']","['Copyright (c) 2015 Societe nationale francaise de medecine interne (SNFMI).', 'Published by Elsevier SAS.

Xenotransplantation of SF3B1 mutant HSCs leads to persistent long-term engraftment restricted to myeloid lineage. Moreover, genetically diverse evolving subclones of mutant SF3B1 exist in mice, indicating a branching multi-clonal as well as ancestral evolutionary paradigm. Subclonal evolution in mice is also seen in the clinical evolution in patients. Sequential sample analysis shows clonal evolution and selection of the malignant driving clone leading to AML transformation. In conclusion, our data show SF3B1 mutations can propagate from HSCs to myeloid progeny, therefore providing a therapeutic target.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 8.,"Alterations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cell metabolism have been studied by several investigators. Unlike normal B lymphocytes or other leukemia cells, CLL cells, like adipocytes, store lipids and utilize free fatty acids (FFA) to produce chemical energy. None of the recently identified mutations in CLL directly affects metabolic pathways, suggesting that genetic alterations do not directly contribute to CLL cells' metabolic reprogramming. Conversely, recent data suggest that activation of STAT3 or downregulation of microRNA-125 levels plays a crucial role in the utilization of FFA to meet the CLL cells' metabolic needs. STAT3, known to be constitutively activated in CLL, increases the levels of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) that mediates lipoprotein uptake and shifts the CLL cells' metabolism towards utilization of FFA. Herein, we review the evidence for altered lipid metabolism, increased mitochondrial activity and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in CLL cells, and discuss the possible therapeutic strategies to inhibit lipid metabolism pathways in patient with CLL.",['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'STAT3', 'lipoprotein lipase', 'metabolism', 'oxidative phosphorylation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One hundred and nine patients (median age 54 years) were treated from January 2012 to December 2013. Increased incidence of high risk patients were detected according to stratification (26% according to Sokal score, 19% according to Euro score and 16% according to EUTOS) when compared to company sponsored studies. Median time from diagnosis to start of dasatinib was 18 days. Ten patients received unscheduled starting dose (6 patients 50mg and 4 patients 80 mg QD), whereas 99 patients started with 100mg QD. At 3 months, 92% of patients achieved a BCR-ABL ratio less than 10%. At 6 months, the rate of CCyR was 91% and the rate of MR3 was 40%, with 8% of the patients reaching MR4.5. Ninety-three patients were evaluable at 12 months: the rate of MR3 was 62%, with MR4.5 being achieved by 19% of the patients. At a median follow-up of 12 months, 27 patients (24.7%) were receiving the drug at reduced dose. Two patients (1.8%) experienced a lymphoid blast crisis and the overall incidence of resistance was 8%. As regards safety, the major side effects recorded were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and pleural effusions, which occurred in 22%, 10% and 8% of patients, respectively.

Our previous studies have reported that rhArg could induce autophagy and apoptosis in lymphoma cells and inhibiting autophagy could enhance the efficacy of rhArg on lymphoma. However, whether rhArg could induce autophagy and what roles autophagy plays in leukemia cells are unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that rhArg treatment could lead to the formation of autophagosomes and the upregulation of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 II (LC3-II) in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells and human acute T cell leukemia Jurkat cells. Furthermore, inhibiting autophagy using 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or chloroquine (CQ) could significantly enhance rhArg-induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis.

Epub 2015 Dec 8.,"The optimal treatment for use as a bridge to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at the decision for transplantation has not been established in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We retrospectively evaluated the clinical outcomes after the decision for transplantation in our patients with MDS or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) secondary to MDS, aged more than 15 years, who underwent transplantation between 2007 and 2012. A total of 124 patients were included. We classified patients into two groups according to the bridge treatment selected at the decision for transplantation: Group 1, supportive care (n = 79), immunosuppressive therapy (n = 7), low-dose chemotherapy (n = 12); Group 2, AML-type induction chemotherapy (ICT: n = 22), azacitidine (Aza: n = 4). The rate of blasts in the bone marrow significantly influenced the treatment selection at the time of decision. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the rate of overall survival (OS) from the decision (73.1% vs 80.4% at 1 year) or from transplantation (59.0% vs 59.2% at 1 year). A significant difference was not observed even after patients were stratified according to either the rate of blasts in the bone marrow at the time of decision or the propensity score. In conclusion, the bridge treatment selected at the decision for transplantation did not affect the outcomes of transplantation in patients with MDS. However, this analysis did not include patients who could not undergo transplantation after the decision, and thus a prospective study is warranted.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventeen relapsed or refractory (R/R) and five previously untreated (FL) CLL patients were enrolled in the trial. In the R/R cohort, four different dose levels of lenalidomide (maximum 15 mg/d) were used. In the FL cohort, lenalidomide was dose escalated from 5 mg/d to 15 mg/d. Bendamustine was used at doses of 50 or 90 mg/m(2) for R/R or FL treatment, respectively. 375 mg/m(2) Rituximab were used for the first and 500 mg/m(2) for subsequent treatment courses. Treatment consisted of up to six courses of 28 d. RESULTS: The maximal tolerable dose of lenalidomide was 5 mg/d. The response rate was 47.1% in R/R and 60% in FL patients. Median progression-free survival was 8.0 months. Median overall survival was 22.9 and 12.3 months, respectively, in R/R and FL patients. Grade 3/4 hematological toxicity was observed in 71.4%, and severe infections in 47.6% of patients. Due to high toxicity and low response rate of BRL, the trial was closed prematurely. CONCLUSION: BRL was associated with a high toxicity rate, a high number of treatment interruptions, and a low remission rate. Therefore, BRL cannot be considered an appropriate treatment option for patients with CLL.",['NOTNLM'],"['combination treatment with lenalidomide', 'dose levels', 'dose limiting toxicity', 'overall response rate', 'toxicity']",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The aim of the investigation was to study the ability of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) derived from the bone marrow of patients with leukemia to maintain normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. METHODS: MSCs were obtained from the bone marrow of 14 patients with acute lymphoblastic (ALL), 25 with myeloid (AML), and 15 with chronic myeloid (CML) leukemia. As a control, MSCs from 22 healthy donors were used. The incidence of cobblestone area forming cells (CAFC 7-8 d) in the bone marrow of healthy donor cultivated on the supportive layer of patients MSCs was measured. RESULTS: The ability of MSCs from AML and ALL patients at the moment of diagnosis to maintain normal CAFC was significantly decreased when compared to donors. After chemotherapy, the restoration of ALL patients' MSCs functions was slower than that of AML. CML MSCs maintained CAFC better than donors' at the moment of diagnosis and this ability increased with treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of patients' MSCs to maintain normal hematopoietic progenitor cells was shown to change in comparison with MSCs from healthy donors and depended on nosology. During treatment, the functional capacity of patients' MSCs had been partially restored.",['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'cobblestone area forming cells', 'multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells']",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

10.1084/jem.20150452. Epub 2015 Dec 7.,"Leukemogenesis occurs under hypoxic conditions within the bone marrow (BM). Knockdown of key mediators of cellular responses to hypoxia with shRNA, namely hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) or HIF-2alpha, in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples results in their apoptosis and inability to engraft, implicating HIF-1alpha or HIF-2alpha as therapeutic targets. However, genetic deletion of Hif-1alpha has no effect on mouse AML maintenance and may accelerate disease development. Here, we report the impact of conditional genetic deletion of Hif-2alpha or both Hif-1alpha and Hif-2alpha at different stages of leukemogenesis in mice. Deletion of Hif-2alpha accelerates development of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) and shortens AML latency initiated by Mll-AF9 and its downstream effectors Meis1 and Hoxa9. Notably, the accelerated initiation of AML caused by Hif-2alpha deletion is further potentiated by Hif-1alpha codeletion. However, established LSCs lacking Hif-2alpha or both Hif-1alpha and Hif-2alpha propagate AML with the same latency as wild-type LSCs. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the HIF pathway or HIF-2alpha knockout using the lentiviral CRISPR-Cas9 system in human established leukemic cells with MLL-AF9 translocation have no impact on their functions. We therefore conclude that although Hif-1alpha and Hif-2alpha synergize to suppress the development of AML, they are not required for LSC maintenance.",,,['(c) 2015 Vukovic et al.'],,,['J Exp Med. 2015 Dec 14;212(13):2187-8.

METHODS: Forty-three patients with MDS, thirteen AML patients diagnosed in the Hematology Department of General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, and sixteen healthy controls were enrolled in this study. The expressions of CD96 and CD123 on CD34+CD38- bone marrow cells (BMC) of these patients and controls were measured by FACS. CD114 (GCSFR), EPOR, and CD110 (TPOR) expression on their CD34+CD38-CD96+ and CD34+CD38-CD96- BMC and these cells' apoptosis (Annexin V) were also detected by FACS. RESULTS: MDS patients had a significantly higher proportion of CD34+CD38-/CD34+ BMC (22.72 +/- 23.91%) than normal controls (8.63 +/- 9.35%) (p < 0.01). The expressions of CD34+CD38-CD96+/CD34+CD38- BMC and CD34+ CD38-CD123+/CD34+CD38- BMC of MDS patients (21.18 +/- 24.06%, 31.62 +/- 28.42%, respectively) were significantly higher than those of normal controls (11.23 +/- 17.91%, 9.29 +/- 12.63%) (p < 0.01). The expressions of CD34+CD38-CD96+/CD34+CD38- BMC and CD34+CD38-CD123+/CD34+CD38- BMC in the high-risk MDS group (26.25 +/- 27.64%, 37.56 +/- 31.01%) was significantly higher than those in the low-risk group (11.44 +/- 10.88, 15.53 +/- 10.96%) (p < 0.05). The expression levels of CD123 and CD96 were significantly correlated with the proportion of bone marrow blasts (r = 0.384, p < 0.05; r = 0.625, p < 0.05). The expressions of CD114, CD110, and Annexin V in CD34+CD38-CD96+ BMC (7.23 +/- 10.25%, 0.52 +/- 1.23%, 2.96 +/- 3.84%, respectively) were significantly lower than those in CD34+CD38-CD96- BMC (24.35 +/- 21.74%, 12.03 +/- 10.91%, 13.69 +/- 17.98%, respectively) of MDS patients (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There was a higher proportion of CD34+CD38-CD96+ and CD34+CD38-CD123+ cells in bone marrow of MDS patients. Those cells expressed lower cytokine receptors and displayed lower apoptosis. Leukemia stem cells (LSC) in MDS might be contained in those cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improvement in DLI efficacy requires dissociation of graft-versus-leukemia effect from graft-versus-host disease. Minor histocompatibility antigens with tissue restriction and leukemia or tumor-associated antigens represent ideal antigenic targets. A brief overview of the existing methods of DLI administration is the topic of this article.

We present a spectroscopic optical coherence tomography (OCT) technique to detect changes in subcellular morphology related to apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. OCT data were acquired from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells treated with cisplatin over a 48-h period. The backscatter spectrum of the OCT signal acquired from the cell samples was characterized by calculating its in vitro integrated backscatter (IB) and spectral slope (SS). The IB increased with treatment duration, while the SS decreased, with the most significant changes occurring after 24 to 48 h of treatment. These changes coincided with striking morphological transformations in the cells and their nuclei. Similar trends in the spectral parameter values were observed in vivo in solid tumors grown from AML cells in mice, which were treated with chemotherapy and radiation. Our results provide a strong foundation from which future experiments may be designed to further understand the effect of cellular morphology and kinetics of apoptosis on the OCT signal and demonstrate the feasibility of using this technique in vivo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 7.,"BACKGROUND: Irreversible inhibition of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) by ibrutinib represents an important therapeutic advance for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, ibrutinib also irreversibly inhibits alternative kinase targets, which potentially compromises its therapeutic index. Acalabrutinib (ACP-196) is a more selective, irreversible BTK inhibitor that is specifically designed to improve on the safety and efficacy of first-generation BTK inhibitors. METHODS: In this uncontrolled, phase 1-2, multicenter study, we administered oral acalabrutinib to 61 patients who had relapsed CLL to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of acalabrutinib. Patients were treated with acalabrutinib at a dose of 100 to 400 mg once daily in the dose-escalation (phase 1) portion of the study and 100 mg twice daily in the expansion (phase 2) portion. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 62 years, and patients had received a median of three previous therapies for CLL; 31% had chromosome 17p13.1 deletion, and 75% had unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable genes. No dose-limiting toxic effects occurred during the dose-escalation portion of the study. The most common adverse events observed were headache (in 43% of the patients), diarrhea (in 39%), and increased weight (in 26%). Most adverse events were of grade 1 or 2. At a median follow-up of 14.3 months, the overall response rate was 95%, including 85% with a partial response and 10% with a partial response with lymphocytosis; the remaining 5% of patients had stable disease. Among patients with chromosome 17p13.1 deletion, the overall response rate was 100%. No cases of Richter's transformation (CLL that has evolved into large-cell lymphoma) and only one case of CLL progression have occurred. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the selective BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib had promising safety and efficacy profiles in patients with relapsed CLL, including those with chromosome 17p13.1 deletion.

Epub 2015 Dec 7.,"BACKGROUND: Risk factors for the development of therapy-related leukemia (TRL), an often lethal late complication of cytotoxic therapy, remain poorly understood and may differ for survivors of different malignancies. Survivors of breast cancer (BC) now account for the majority of TRL cases, making the study of TRL risk factors in this population a priority. METHODS: Subjects with TRL after cytotoxic therapy for a primary BC were identified from the TRL registry at The University of Chicago. Those with an available germline DNA sample were screened with a comprehensive gene panel covering known inherited BC susceptibility genes. Clinical and TRL characteristics of all subjects and those with identified germline mutations were described. RESULTS: Nineteen of 88 survivors of BC with TRL (22%) had an additional primary cancer and 40 of the 70 survivors with an available family history (57%) had a close relative with breast, ovarian, or pancreatic cancer. Of the 47 subjects with available DNA, 10 (21%) were found to carry a deleterious inherited mutation in BRCA1 (3 subjects; 6%), BRCA2 (2 subjects; 4%), TP53 (tumor protein p53) (3 subjects; 6%), CHEK2 (checkpoint kinase 2) (1 subject; 2%), and PALB2 (partner and localizer of BRCA2) (1 subject; 2%). CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of BC with TRL have personal and family histories suggestive of inherited cancer susceptibility and frequently carry germline mutations in BC susceptibility genes. The data from the current study support the role of these genes in TRL risk and suggest that long-term follow-up studies of women with germline mutations who are treated for BC and functional studies of the effects of heterozygous mutations in these genes on bone marrow function after cytotoxic exposures are warranted.

Alpha- 1-acid glycoprotein may reduce drug efficacy through its ability to interact with IM and blocks it from reaching its target, while protein glycoprotein (PGP) may reduce the intracellular concentration of the drug via an active pump mechanism. We thus investigated the correlation between AGP and PGP levels and the resistance/response to treatment. A total of 26 CML patients were investigated for AGP and PGP levels at diagnosis and during treatment. There was no significant difference or correlation between AGP levels and the different groups of patients. There was also no significant difference in the fluorescence intensities of PGP levels among the different patient groups.

The currently reported case of pathologically-proven Aspergillus appendicitis was identified by computerized search of pathology database at William Beaumont Hospital, 1999-2014. Prior cases were identified by computerized literature search. Among 10980 pathology reports of pathologically-proven appendicitis, one case of Aspergillus appendicitis was identified (rate = 0.01%). A young boy with profound neutropenia, recent chemotherapy, and acute myelogenous leukemia presented with right lower quadrant pain, pyrexia, and generalized malaise. Abdominal computed tomography scan showed a thickened appendiceal wall and periappendiceal inflammation, suggesting appendicitis. Emergent laparotomy showed an inflamed, thickened appendix, which was resected. The patient did poorly postoperatively with low-grade-fevers while receiving antibacterial therapy, but rapidly improved after initiating amphotericin therapy. Microscopic examination of a silver stain of the appendectomy specimen revealed fungi with characteristic Aspergillus morphology, findings confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Primary Aspergillus appendicitis is exceptionally rare, with only 3 previously reported cases. All three cases presented with (1)-neutropenia, (2)-recent chemotherapy, (3)-acute leukemia, and (4)-suspected appendicitis; (5)-the two prior cases initially treated with antibacterial therapy, fared poorly before instituting anti-Aspergillus therapy. The current patient satisfied all these five criteria. Based on these four cases, a clinical pentad is proposed for Aspergillus appendicitis: clinically-suspected appendicitis, neutropenia, recent chemotherapy, acute leukemia, and poor clinical response if treated solely by antibacterial/anti-candidial therapy. Patients presenting with this proposed pentad may benefit from testing for Aspergillus infection by silver-stains/immunohistochemistry and considering empirical anti-Aspergillus therapy pending a tissue diagnosis.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myelocytic leukemia', 'Appendicitis', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus appendicitis', 'Chemotherapy', 'Fungal appendicitis', 'Neutropenia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to evaluate calreticulin mRNA expression levels in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) compared with other hematologic malignancies, and to investigate the clinicopathological characteristics associated with expression in AML patients. The study group included 43 patients diagnosed with AML, 57 with other hematologic malignancies, and 21 benign hematologic conditions. CALR mRNA quantification using real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed it to be significantly higher in AML compared with other hematologic malignancies (P < 0.0001). There was no difference in CALR mRNA expression between AML subgroups by karyotype (P = 0.3201). No differences were found in age, white blood cell counts, platelet counts, bone marrow blast percentage, calcium, lactate dehydrogenase or CD34 expression rate between the high and low CALR groups (CALR mRNA >/= 1.2 fold and <1.2 fold, respectively), although hemoglobin and sex differences were observed. Although statistically not significant, there was a trend that Relapse rate was lower (54.5% vs. 84.6%) (P = 0.1063) and disease-free survival was longer (22 months vs. 7 months) (P = 0.0784) in low CALR group, whereas overall survival was similar between the two groups (11 months and 8 months).

With respect to the hydrophobic characteristics and the high level of protein binding of these uremic toxins, hydrophobic adsorber materials might be an alternative to remove these substances from the plasma of the chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Here nanoporous microparticles prepared from poly(ether imide) (PEI) with an average diameter of 90 +/- 30 mum and a porosity around 88 +/- 2% prepared by a spraying/coagulation process are considered as candidate adsorber materials. A prerequisite for the clinical application of such particles is their biocompatibility, which can be examined i.e. indirectly in cell culture experiments with the particles' extracts. In this work we studied the effects of aqueous extracts of PEI microparticles on the viability of THP-1 cells, a human leukemia monocytic cell line, as well as their macrophage differentiation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and inflammation.A high cell viability of around 99 +/- 18% and 99 +/- 5% was observed when THP-1 cells were cultured in the presence of aqueous extracts of the PEI microparticles in medium A and medium B respectively. The obtained microscopic data suggested that PEI particle extracts have no significant effect on cell death, oxidative stress or differentiation to macrophages. It was further found that the investigated proinflammatory markers in THP-1 cells were not up-regulated. These results are promising with regard to the biocompatibility of PEI microparticles and in a next step the hemocompatibility of the microparticles will be examined.",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic kidney disease (CKD)', 'cytotoxicity', 'human monocytic (THP-1) cells', 'poly(ether imide) microparticles', 'reactive oxygen species (ROS)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 6.,"BACKGROUND: New treatments have improved outcomes for patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but complete remissions remain uncommon. Venetoclax has a distinct mechanism of action; it targets BCL2, a protein central to the survival of CLL cells. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 dose-escalation study of daily oral venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) to assess safety, pharmacokinetic profile, and efficacy. In the dose-escalation phase, 56 patients received active treatment in one of eight dose groups that ranged from 150 to 1200 mg per day. In an expansion cohort, 60 additional patients were treated with a weekly stepwise ramp-up in doses as high as 400 mg per day. RESULTS: The majority of the study patients had received multiple previous treatments, and 89% had poor prognostic clinical or genetic features. Venetoclax was active at all dose levels. Clinical tumor lysis syndrome occurred in 3 of 56 patients in the dose-escalation cohort, with one death. After adjustments to the dose-escalation schedule, clinical tumor lysis syndrome did not occur in any of the 60 patients in the expansion cohort. Other toxic effects included mild diarrhea (in 52% of the patients), upper respiratory tract infection (in 48%), nausea (in 47%), and grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (in 41%). A maximum tolerated dose was not identified. Among the 116 patients who received venetoclax, 92 (79%) had a response. Response rates ranged from 71 to 79% among patients in subgroups with an adverse prognosis, including those with resistance to fludarabine, those with chromosome 17p deletions (deletion 17p CLL), and those with unmutated IGHV. Complete remissions occurred in 20% of the patients, including 5% who had no minimal residual disease on flow cytometry. The 15-month progression-free survival estimate for the 400-mg dose groups was 69%. CONCLUSIONS: Selective targeting of BCL2 with venetoclax had a manageable safety profile and induced substantial responses in patients with relapsed CLL or SLL, including those with poor prognostic features.

We retrospectively analyzed the kinetics of white blood cell (WBC) count, blast cell percentage (BCP), and blast cell count (BCC) in PB in 78 patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia who underwent a uniform induction chemotherapy between December 2001 and December 2015 at Jichi Medical University. By a repeated-measures analysis of variance, the interaction of the decline in BCP with the achievement of complete remission (CR) was stronger than those of the decline in WBC or BCC. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for the achievement of CR showed that the areas under the curve for the decline in WBC, BCP, and BCC were 0.592, 0.703, and 0.634, respectively, and a decline in BCP of 9.25%/day within 4 or 5 days from induction chemotherapy was the optimal cutoff value. A multivariate analysis showed that a rapid decline in BCP (>/=9.25%/day) was a significant predictive factor for CR, independent of the cytogenetic risk (p = 0.0096).

In our study, MSI2 mRNA levels of 119 childhood patients with newly-diagnosed ALL were examined and analyzed with regard to clinical characteristics and outcomes. ALL patients demonstrated significantly higher MSI2 mRNA levels than healthy controls. In addition, MSI2 mRNA levels were correlated with the disease status and IK6 mutation status. Survival analyses showed that higher MSI2 mRNA levels predicted worse outcomes in patients with childhood ALL. Moreover, in multivariate analyses, MSI2 mRNA overexpression retained its value as an independent risk factor for overall survival (OS), but not for event free survival (EFS). We conclude that high MSI2 mRNA level predicts adverse prognosis and seems to be useful as a novel prognostic factor for patients with childhood ALL.",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*childhood', '*musashi-2', '*overall survival', '*prognosis.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 7.,"In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) the level of minimal residual disease (MRD) after therapy is an independent predictor of outcome. Given the increasing number of new agents being explored for CLL therapy, using MRD as a surrogate could greatly reduce the time necessary to assess their efficacy. In this European Research Initiative on CLL (ERIC) project we have identified and validated a flow-cytometric approach to reliably quantitate CLL cells to the level of 0.0010% (10(-5)). The assay comprises a core panel of six markers (i.e. CD19, CD20, CD5, CD43, CD79b and CD81) with a component specification independent of instrument and reagents, which can be locally re-validated using normal peripheral blood. This method is directly comparable to previous ERIC-designed assays and also provides a backbone for investigation of new markers. A parallel analysis of high-throughput sequencing using the ClonoSEQ assay showed good concordance with flow cytometry results at the 0.010% (10(-4)) level, the MRD threshold defined in the 2008 International Workshop on CLL guidelines, but it also provides good linearity to a detection limit of 1 in a million (10(-6)). The combination of both technologies would permit a highly sensitive approach to MRD detection while providing a reproducible and broadly accessible method to quantify residual disease and optimize treatment in CLL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 6.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) primarily affects older persons who often have coexisting conditions in addition to disease-related immunosuppression and myelosuppression. We conducted an international, open-label, randomized phase 3 trial to compare two oral agents, ibrutinib and chlorambucil, in previously untreated older patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. METHODS: We randomly assigned 269 previously untreated patients who were 65 years of age or older and had CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma to receive ibrutinib or chlorambucil. The primary end point was progression-free survival as assessed by an independent review committee. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 73 years. During a median follow-up period of 18.4 months, ibrutinib resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than did chlorambucil (median, not reached vs. 18.9 months), with a risk of progression or death that was 84% lower with ibrutinib than that with chlorambucil (hazard ratio, 0.16; P<0.001). Ibrutinib significantly prolonged overall survival; the estimated survival rate at 24 months was 98% with ibrutinib versus 85% with chlorambucil, with a relative risk of death that was 84% lower in the ibrutinib group than in the chlorambucil group (hazard ratio, 0.16; P=0.001). The overall response rate was higher with ibrutinib than with chlorambucil (86% vs. 35%, P<0.001). The rates of sustained increases from baseline values in the hemoglobin and platelet levels were higher with ibrutinib. Adverse events of any grade that occurred in at least 20% of the patients receiving ibrutinib included diarrhea, fatigue, cough, and nausea; adverse events occurring in at least 20% of those receiving chlorambucil included nausea, fatigue, neutropenia, anemia, and vomiting. In the ibrutinib group, four patients had a grade 3 hemorrhage and one had a grade 4 hemorrhage. A total of 87% of the patients in the ibrutinib group are continuing to take ibrutinib. CONCLUSIONS: Ibrutinib was superior to chlorambucil in previously untreated patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma, as assessed by progression-free survival, overall survival, response rate, and improvement in hematologic variables.

To better understand their genomic landscape, here we perform whole-genome sequencing on a cohort of patients enriched with these cytogenetic characteristics. Mutations in known CLL drivers are seen in only 33% of this cohort, and associated with normal cytogenetics and unmutated IGHV. The most commonly mutated gene in our cohort, IGLL5, shows a mutational pattern suggestive of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) activity. Unsupervised analysis of mutational signatures demonstrates the activities of canonical AID (c-AID), leading to clustered mutations near active transcriptional start sites; non-canonical AID (nc-AID), leading to genome-wide non-clustered mutations, and an ageing signature responsible for most mutations. Using mutation clonality to infer time of onset, we find that while ageing and c-AID activities are ongoing, nc-AID-associated mutations likely occur earlier in tumour evolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study covers 15 anticancer drugs--both conventional and new-generation. Four parameters were analyzed simultaneously in Jurkat leukemia cells, treated by drugs or 2-DDG (separately or in combination): cell viability, induction of apoptosis, levels of ROS, and level of protein-carbonyl products. Very well-expressed synergistic cytotoxic effects were found after 48-h treatment of Jurkat cells with 2-DDG in combination with: palbociclib, everolimus, lonafarnib, bortezomib, and barasertib.

This study aimed to investigate whether these genes are also altered in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression profiles of nine circadian clock genes of peripheral blood (PB) leukocytes from patients with newly-diagnosed AML (n=41), ALL (n=23) and healthy individuals (n=51) were investigated. RESULTS: In AML, the expression of period 1 (PER1), period 2 (PER2), period 3 (PER3), cryptochrome 1 (CRY1), cryptochrome 2 (CRY2), brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)-like 1 (BMAL1), and timeless (TIM) was significantly down-regulated, while that of CK1epsilon was significantly up-regulated. In ALL, the expression of PER3 and CRY1 was significantly down-regulated, whereas those of CK1epsilon and TIM were significantly up-regulated. Recovery of PER3 expression was observed in both patients with AML and those with ALL who achieved remission but not in patients who relapsed after treatment. CONCLUSION: Circadian clock genes are altered in patients with acute leukemia and up-regulation of PER3 is correlated with a better clinical outcome.",['NOTNLM'],"['Circadian clock genes', 'acute lymphoid leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia']","['Copyright(c) 2015 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study focused on investigating the effects of the natural compounds oleanolic acid (OA) and ursolic acid (UA) on proliferation and differentiation of human APL HL-60 cells in vitro and murine APL WEHI-3 cells in vivo. Results demonstrated that OA and UA significantly inhibited cellular proliferation of HL-60 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Non-cytotoxic concentration of OA exhibited a marked differentiation-inducing effect on HL-60 and enhanced ATRA-induced HL-60 differentiation. In contrast, UA showed only a moderate effect. Activation of MAPK/NF-kappaB signaling pathway was likely found to be involved in the mechanism. Moreover, OA increased survival duration of WEHI-3 transplanted BALB/c mice, and decreased leukemia cells infiltration in the liver and spleen.

Epub 2015 Dec 4.,"In vitro evidence suggests that the bone marrow microenvironment (BMME) is altered in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). Here, we study the BMME in MDS in vivo using a transgenic murine model of MDS with hematopoietic expression of the translocation product NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13). This model exhibits a prolonged period of cytopenias prior to transformation to leukemia and is therefore ideal to interrogate the role of the BMME in MDS. In this model, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) were decreased in NHD13 mice by flow cytometric analysis. The reduction in the total phenotypic HSPC pool in NHD13 mice was confirmed functionally with transplantation assays. Marrow microenvironmental cellular components of the NHD13 BMME were found to be abnormal, including increases in endothelial cells and in dysfunctional mesenchymal and osteoblastic populations, whereas megakaryocytes were decreased. Both CC chemokine ligand 3 and vascular endothelial growth factor, previously shown to be increased in human MDS, were increased in NHD13 mice. To assess whether the BMME contributes to disease progression in NHD13 mice, we performed transplantation of NHD13 marrow into NHD13 mice or their wild-type (WT) littermates. WT recipients as compared with NHD13 recipients of NHD13 marrow had a lower rate of the combined outcome of progression to leukemia and death. Moreover, hematopoietic function was superior in a WT BMME as compared with an NHD13 BMME. Our data therefore demonstrate a contributory role of the BMME to disease progression in MDS and support a therapeutic strategy whereby manipulation of the MDS microenvironment may improve hematopoietic function and overall survival.",,,['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6969-239X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The outcome of patients with HT has traditionally been considered dismal with a median overall survival (OS) of around 1 year in most of the published studies. This prompted many authors to include stem cell transplant (SCT) as part of the treatment strategy for young and fit patients with HT. However, recent articles suggest that the outcome of patients with transformed lymphoma might be improving, questioning the need for such intensive therapies. The management of patients with HT is challenged by the heterogeneity of the population in terms of previous number and type of therapy lines and from their exclusion from prospective clinical trials.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), success has been less obvious. Nonetheless, among the few drugs shown to improve survival in recent randomized trials is the CD33 antibody-drug conjugate gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Significant antileukemic activity is also well documented for radioimmunoconjugates targeting CD33, CD45, or CD66. These therapeutics can intensify conditioning before hematopoietic cell transplantation, but their effect on patient outcomes needs clarification. Emerging data now suggest clinical antileukemic activity of several novel antibodies and perhaps some adoptive T-cell immunotherapies and vaccines. In parallel, numerous other agents targeting a wider variety of antigens are currently being explored. However, the antigenic heterogeneity characteristic of AML is a considerable limitation for all these therapeutics, and many important questions related to the ideal target antigen(s), disease situation in which to use these therapies, most suitable patient populations, exact treatment modalities, and details of supportive care needs remain open. Addressing such questions in upcoming studies will be required to ensure that antigen-directed therapies become an effective tool in AML, a disease for which outcomes with standard ""3 + 7""-based chemotherapy have remained unsatisfactory in many patients.",,,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.

RDD is a benign disorder that presents with massive lymphadenopathy, but can have extranodal involvement. In most cases, RDD is self-limited and observation is the standard approach. Treatment is restricted to patients with life-threatening, multiple-relapsing, or autoimmune-associated disease. JXG is a pediatric histiocytosis characterized by xanthomatous skin lesions that usually resolve spontaneously. In a minority of cases, systemic disease can occur and can be life threatening. Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), as well as germline mutations in NF1 and NF2, have been reported in children with JXG. Recent whole-exome sequencing of JXG cases did not show the BRAF-V600E mutation, although 1 patient had PI3KCD mutation. ECD is an adult histiocytosis characterized by symmetrical long bone involvement, cardiovascular infiltration, a hairy kidney, and retroperitoneal fibrosis. Central nervous system involvement is a poor prognostic factor. Interferon-alpha is the standard as front-line therapy, although cladribine and anakinra can be effective in a few refractory cases. More than one-half of ECD patients carry the BRAF-V600E mutation. Currently, >40 patients worldwide with multisystemic, refractory BRAF-V600E(+) ECD have been treated with vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, which was found to be highly effective. Other recurrent mutations of the MAP kinase and PI3K pathways have been described in ECD.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized commonly by a fusion between the PML gene and the RARA gene, genes targetable by arsenic (ATO) and retinoic acid (ATRA), respectively. A mutation in GATA1, common in AML of Down syndrome (ML-DS), renders cells more susceptible to cytarabine and anthracyclines, thus permitting targeted dose reductions to preserve high survival rates while reducing toxicity. In all other patients, Ras pathway mutations, KMT2A and other methyltransferase mutations, FLT3 mutations, and KIT mutations are all relatively common in childhood AML and all are potentially ""druggable"". The focus of this review is on those therapies likely to be clinically available in the near future. The preclinical and clinical data providing a rationale for testing in children of specific agents in children is discussed. Whether the expression of a potential target is sufficient to predict response to a targeted therapy is an open question in childhood AML.

It has become clear that as treatment has intensified, more children are cured but at the expense of increased toxicity which for some can cause significant long-term morbidity and even mortality. The drive in more recent years has been to identify sensitive markers of disease and response to treatment to allow a reduction in therapy in those who do not require it and more intensive treatment in those who do. Clinical characteristics have been used to stratify patients into different risk groups and this, coupled with following response at a molecular level, has done much to tailor treatment to the patient. Considerable research has been focused on the molecular characteristics of the leukemia itself to elucidate the biologic mechanisms underlying both the disease and the comparative or absolute resistance of some types of leukemia. These molecular markers can also act as targets for novel therapies, which require newer trial methodologies to prove their utility. There has been less focus on the biology of the patient but it is clear that some patients are more susceptible to adverse events and toxicities than others. Through the use of pharmacogenomics, modification to therapy may be appropriate in certain patients based on their genetic profile.

Minimal residual disease screening is permitting not only a better stratification of patients, but has also allowed to reconsider the role of autologous stem cell transplant for a set of patients who do not have a donor or are not eligible for an allo-SCT.

The major subgroup in which this approach does not result into satisfactory efficacy is in CLL with 17p deletion (17p-) or TP53 mutation (TP53mut). Likewise, patients with a short initial response duration (i.e., <24-26 months) have a dismal outcome with chemoimmunotherapy salvage. Therefore, these patients have been referred to as ""ultra high risk,"" and, in these subgroups, novel agents such as signaling kinase inhibitors (also termed B-cell receptor signaling inhibitors; e.g., ibrutinib targeting Bruton tryosine kinase, idelalisib targeting phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and BCL2 antagonists (venetoclax, formerly ABT-199/GDC-0199) have shown dramatic efficacy. Ibrutinib and idelalisib are currently approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CLL or frontline treatment of 17p-/TP53mut CLL regardless of fitness. Therefore, these agents are challenging the concept of adjusting treatment to fitness and TP53 status, because they offer remarkable efficacy combined with exceptional tolerability.

Allogenic stem cell transplantation should still be considered for eligible patients and may be the only current therapy capable of delivering a cure. In the past few years, many of the molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis and progression have been revealed and are likely to lead to the development of novel targeted approaches.",,,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.

However, with these positive changes comes the new challenge of managing patients who relapse after these agents. The number of patients who have relapsed after taking idelalisib and ibrutinib is low, but as the drugs gain wider use and patients are treated for longer, this number is likely to grow. Because these patients can be challenging to manage effectively, coordinated efforts now to determine how and why patients relapse along with optimal treatment strategies are required to better serve our patients in the future. As well, identification of mechanisms of resistance is crucial to develop rational strategies for management. Current work has identified mechanisms of resistance to ibrutinib, and resistance to idelalisib is also under active investigation. In this review, we will discuss these mechanisms of resistance, as well as current and potential strategies for the management of kinase inhibitor-resistant CLL.",,,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.

The MPNs are characterized by dysregulated JAK-STAT signaling pathways. PV and ET are associated with an increased risk of thrombo-hemorrhagic complications, risk of progression to MF and leukemia. Presentation of patients with PV and ET is variable and usually as a result of abnormal full blood count indices (raised hemoglobin and hematocrit, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis). Presentation with thrombosis or splenomegaly occurs in ~30% of patients. Historically thought of as indolent compared with MF, patients with PV and ET have significant disease symptom burden which does not directly correlate to the current clinical prognostic classifications. The mainstay of therapy is reserved for patients with high-risk disease and thus excludes a population of patients with significant symptom related morbidity impacting their quality-of-life and survival. Recent treatment strategies have aimed to incorporate disease burden assessment into the selection of therapeutic interventions such as JAK2 inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors.

These studies have revealed aCML to be a genetically more heterogeneous disease than CNL, however, several groups have reported that SETBP1 and ASXL1 mutations occur at a high frequency and carry prognostic value in both diseases. We also report a novel finding-our study reveals a high frequency of U2AF1 mutations at codon Q157 associated with CSF3R mutant myeloid neoplasms. Collectively, these findings will refine the WHO diagnostic criteria of aCML and CNL and help us understand the genetic lesions and dysregulated signaling pathways contributing to disease development. Novel therapies that emerge from these genetic findings will need to be investigated in the setting of a clinical trial to determine the safety and efficacy of targeting various oncogenic drivers, such as JAK1/2 inhibition in CSF3R-T618I-positive aCML and CNL.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to identify BCR-ABL1 in interphase nuclei and mutational analysis of the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain (KD) are used in certain clinical circumstances. As most patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) achieve complete cytogenetic responses (CCyRs), qPCR with its increased sensitivity and dynamic range has become the main tool used to monitor CML patients. Landmark analyses of large TKI trials have established MR milestones that identify patients with high risk of failure, are the basis of consensus management guidelines, and have led to a strong push toward qPCR test standardization. Today many laboratories report BCR-ABL1 qPCR results on the international scale (IS), a system based on the conversion of laboratory-specific numerical values to conform to a universal scale. The fact that qPCR is technically demanding and liable to assay variations poses considerable challenges for its routine clinical use. This is important as the prevalence of patients on chronic TKI therapy increases and critical clinical decisions are made based on qPCR results, for example if discontinuation of TKI therapy should be considered.

Most adult patients are diagnosed to have systemic mastocytosis (SM). Based on histological findings and disease-related organ damage, SM is classified into indolent SM (ISM), smoldering SM (SSM), SM with an associated hematologic non-MC-lineage disease (SM-AHNMD), aggressive SM (ASM), and MC leukemia (MCL). The clinical picture, course, and prognosis vary profoundly among these patients. Nonetheless, independent of the category of SM, neoplastic cells usually exhibit the KIT point-mutation D816V. However, in advanced SM, additional molecular defects are often detected and are considered to contribute to disease progression and drug resistance. These lesions include, among others, somatic mutations in TET2, SRSF2, ASXL1, CBL, RUNX1, and RAS. In SM-AHNMD, such mutations are often found in the ""AHNMD component"" of the disease. Clinical symptoms in mastocytosis result from (1) the release of proinflammatory and vasoactive mediators from MCs, and (2) SM-induced organ damage. Therapy of SM has to be adjusted to the individual patient and the SM category: in those with ISM and SSM, the goal is to control mediator secretion and/or mediator effects, to keep concomitant allergies under control, and to counteract osteoporosis, whereas in advanced SM (ASM, MCL, and SM-AHNMD) anti-neoplastic drugs are prescribed to suppress MC expansion and/or to keep AHNMD cells under control. Novel drugs directed against mutated KIT and/or other oncogenic kinase targets are tested currently in these patients.

Unfortunately, despite recent advances in molecular and immunologic techniques, the etiology remains unproven in the overwhelming majority of cases. This review presents a practical approach to the diagnosis and treatment of patients presenting with unexplained marked eosinophilia. A brief overview of the mechanisms of eosinophilia and eosinophil pathogenesis is also provided.",,,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology. All rights reserved.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is now well-established that mutations in HAX1 and ELANE (and more rarely in other genes) are the genetic cause of SCN. In contrast, it has remained unclear how these mutations affect neutrophil development. Innovative models based on induced pluripotent stem cell technology are being explored to address this issue. These days, most SCN patients receive life-long treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, CSF3). CSF3 therapy has greatly improved the life expectancy of SCN patients, but also unveiled a high frequency of progression toward myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and therapy refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Expansion of hematopoietic clones with acquired mutations in the gene encoding the G-CSF receptor (CSF3R) is regularly seen in SCN patients and AML usually descends from one of these CSF3R mutant clones. These findings raised the questions how CSF3R mutations affect CSF3 responses of myeloid progenitors, how they contribute to the pre-leukemic state of SCN, and which additional events are responsible for progression to leukemia. The vast (sub)clonal heterogeneity of AML and the presence of AML-associated mutations in normally aged hematopoietic clones make it often difficult to determine which mutations are responsible for the leukemic process. Leukemia predisposition syndromes such as SCN are unique disease models to identify the sequential acquisition of these mutations and to interrogate how they contribute to clonal selection and leukemic evolution.",,,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.

Print 2016 Feb 15.,"UNLABELLED: Gibbon ape leukemia viruses (GALVs) are part of a larger group of pathogenic gammaretroviruses present across phylogenetically diverse host species of Australasian mammals. Despite the biomedical utility of GALVs as viral vectors and in cancer gene therapy, full genome sequences have not been determined for all of the five identified GALV strains, nor has a comprehensive evolutionary analysis been performed. We therefore generated complete genomic sequences for each GALV strain using hybridization capture and high-throughput sequencing. The four strains of GALV isolated from gibbons formed a monophyletic clade that was closely related to the woolly monkey virus (WMV), which is a GALV strain that likely originated in a gibbon host. The GALV-WMV clade in turn formed a sister group to the koala retroviruses (KoRVs). Genomic signatures of episodic diversifying selection were detected among the gammaretroviruses with concentration in the env gene across the GALV strains that were particularly oncogenic and KoRV strains that were potentially exogenous, likely reflecting their adaptation to the host immune system. In vitro studies involving vectors chimeric between GALV and KoRV-B established that variable regions A and B of the surface unit of the envelope determine which receptor is used by a viral strain to enter host cells. IMPORTANCE: The gibbon ape leukemia viruses (GALVs) are among the most medically relevant retroviruses due to their use as viral vectors for gene transfer and in cancer gene therapy. Despite their importance, full genome sequences have not been determined for the majority of primate isolates, nor has comprehensive evolutionary analysis been performed, despite evidence that the viruses are facing complex selective pressures associated with cross-species transmission. Using hybridization capture and high-throughput sequencing, we report here the full genome sequences of all the GALV strains and demonstrate that diversifying selection is acting on them, particularly in the envelope gene in functionally important domains, suggesting that host immune pressure is shaping GALV evolution.",,,"['Copyright (c) 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) isolated from human blood are frequently used as a normal comparator in AML studies. Previous studies have reported changes in the transcriptional program of genes involved in proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and homing when HSPCs were expanded ex vivo. The intrinsic functional differences between quiescent and dividing CD34+ HSPCs prompted us to determine whether fresh or cytokine-induced cord blood-derived CD34+ HSPCs are a more appropriate normal control compared to AML blasts. Based on principal component analysis and gene expression profiling we demonstrate that CD34+ HSPCs that do not undergo ex vivo expansion are transcriptionally similar to minimally differentiated AML blasts. This was confirmed by comparing the cell cycle status of the AML blasts and the HSPCs. We suggest that freshly isolated CD34+ HSPCs that do not undergo ex vivo expansion would serve as a better control to identify novel transcriptional targets in the AML blast population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 4.,"S-phase progression of the cell cycle is accelerated in tumors through various genetic abnormalities, and, thus, pharmacologic inhibition of altered cell-cycle progression would be an effective strategy to control tumors. In the current study, we analyzed the antileukemic activity of three available small molecules targeting CDK4/CDK6 against lymphoid crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-LC) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph(+) ALL), and found that all three molecules showed specific activities against leukemic cell lines derived from CML-LC and Ph(+) ALL. In particular, PD0332991 exhibited extremely high antileukemic activity against CML-LC and Ph(+) ALL cell lines in the nanomolar range by the induction of G0-G1 arrest and partially cell death through dephosphorylation of pRb and downregulation of the genes that are involved in S-phase transition. As an underlying mechanism for favorable sensitivity to the small molecules targeting CDK4/CDK6, cell-cycle progression of Ph(+) lymphoid leukemia cells was regulated by transcriptional and posttranscriptional modulation of CDK4 as well as Cyclin D2 gene expression under the control of BCR-ABL probably through the PI3K pathway. Consistently, the gene expression level of Cyclin D2 in Ph(+) lymphoid leukemia cells was significantly higher than that in Ph(-) lymphoid leukemia cells.

Its causes are unknown and no preventive strategies have been implemented. We hypothesized that leukemia is due mainly to vitamin D deficiency, which is due mainly to low solar ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiance. To test this hypothesis, we estimated age-standardized cloud-cover-adjusted winter UVB irradiance using cloud cover data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project, latitudes of population centroids, and standard astronomical calculations. Incidence rates for 172 countries, available from the International Agency for Cancer Research, were plotted according to cloud-adjusted UVB irradiance. We used multiple regression to account for national differences in elevation and average life expectancy. Leukemia incidence rates were inversely associated with cloud-adjusted UVB irradiance in males (p </= 0.01) and females (p </= 0.01) in both hemispheres. There were few departures from the trend line, which was parabolic when plotted with the equator at the center of the display, northern hemisphere countries on the right side and southern hemisphere countries on the left. The bivariate association displayed by the polynomial trend line indicated that populations at higher latitudes had at least two times the risk of leukemia compared to equatorial populations. The association persisted in males (p </= 0.05) and females (p </= 0.01) after controlling for elevation and life expectancy. Incidence rates of leukemia were inversely associated with solar UVB irradiance. It is plausible that the association is due to vitamin D deficiency. This would be consistent with laboratory studies and a previous epidemiological study. Consideration should be given to prudent use of vitamin D for prevention of leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

including papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Although BRAF(V600E) inhibitors are available, lack of response has been frequently observed. To study the mechanism underlying intrinsic resistance to the mutant BRAF(V600E) selective inhibitor vemurafenib, we established short-term primary cell cultures of human metastatic/recurrent BRAF(V600E)-PTC, intrathyroidal BRAF(V600E)-PTC, and normal thyroid (NT). We also generated an early intervention model of human BRAF(V600E)-PTC orthotopic mouse. We find that metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells elicit paracrine-signaling which trigger migration of pericytes, blood endothelial cells and lymphatic endothelial cells as compared to BRAF(WT)-PTC cells, and show a higher rate of invasion. We further show that vemurafenib therapy significantly suppresses these aberrant functions in non-metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells but lesser in metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells as compared to vehicle treatment. These results concur with similar folds of down-regulation of tumor microenvironment-associated pro-metastatic molecules, with no effects in BRAF(WT)-PTC and NT cells. Our early intervention preclinical trial shows that vemurafenib delays tumor growth in the orthotopic BRAF(WT/V600E)-PTC mice. Importantly, we identify high copy number gain of MCL1 (chromosome 1q) and loss of CDKN2A (P16, chromosome 9p) in metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells which are associated with resistance to vemurafenib treatment. Critically, we demonstrate that combined vemurafenib therapy with BCL2/MCL1 inhibitor increases metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cell death and ameliorates response to vemurafenib treatment as compared to single agent treatment. In conclusion, short-term PTC and NT cultures offer a predictive model for evaluating therapeutic response in patients with PTC. Our PTC pre-clinical model suggests that combined targeted therapy might be an important therapeutic strategy for metastatic and refractory BRAF(V600E)-positive PTC.",['NOTNLM'],"['BRAFV600E papillary thyroid cancer pre-clinical model', 'MCL1 and P16/CDKN2A somatic copy number', 'microenvironment', 'vemurafenib resisatnce']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Certain of these receptors also play regulatory roles in neuronal activity and osteoclast development. The activation of LILRBs on immune cells by their ligands may contribute to immune evasion by tumors. Recent studies found that several members of LILRB family are expressed by tumor cells, notably hematopoietic cancer cells, and may directly regulate cancer development and relapse as well as the activity of cancer stem cells. LILRBs thus have dual concordant roles in tumor biology - as immune checkpoint molecules and as tumor-sustaining factors. Importantly, the study of knockout mice indicated that LILRBs do not affect hematopoiesis and normal development. Therefore LILRBs may represent ideal targets for tumor treatment.

However, both cases developed progressive sensorimotor and radiculo-myelo-encephalopathy and the patients died 3 and 6 days after the incidents due to decerebration. A number of cases of accidental intrathecal vincristine administration have occurred in recent years in other settings, and we add our events to emphasize the need for a preventative and strictly followed protocol in oncology treatment units to prevent further unnecessary deaths. The best 'cure' for mistakenly administered vincristine via lumbar puncture is prevention, which can be improved by strict adherence to a comprehensive guideline. Oncologic treatment centers should be aware of this guideline and evaluate their protocol for vincristine administration to prevent future incidents.

In particular, CDK9 was found to be highly elevated in serum, monocytes and artery plaque samples of CAD patients. Furthermore, there was high infiltration of CD14+ monocytes/macrophages within artery plaques correlated with the expression of CDK9. Moreover, Flavopiridol (CDK9 inhibitor) could inhibit THP-1 cell (monocytic acute leukemia cell line) proliferation by targeting CDK9. Altogether, These findings indicate that CDK9 represent an important role for inflammation in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. It may be a potential biomarker of atherosclerotic inflammation and offer insights into the pathophysiology and targeted therapy for atherosclerotic CAD.",['NOTNLM'],"['CDK9', 'atherosclerosis', 'inflammation', 'proteomics', 'serum']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We designed and synthesized livin-specific small interference RNA (siRNA). Transfected K562 cells were cultured. Reverse-transcription polymer chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect livin mRNA expression. Protein expression for livin was detected using Western blotting. A non-transfected group was used as a control. Meanwhile, vectors carrying enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were transfected as a positive control and flow cytometry was used to determine the transfection efficiency by detecting green fluorescence. The rate of apoptosis was determined using the annexin V and propidium iodide double-staining method. ELISA was used to determine the activity of Caspase-3. RESULTS: The transfection efficiency of electroporation was as high as 50%. The siRNA sequences could knockdown livin gene expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Apoptosis rate of the cells was 27.41 +/- 2.30% 48 h after transfection with specific siRNA. This was significantly higher than that of the control group (9.63 +/- 0.89%, p < 0.05). The 48-h apoptosis rate of the combined effect group VP-16 (5 micromol/L) and transfection rate was 45.1 +/- 4.40%, which was significantly elevated (p < 0.05) compared with the groups treated with only VP-16 or by transfection. CONCLUSIONS: Caspase-3 activity in cells transfected with siRNA was significantly elevated compared to the cells in the non-transfected groups (p < 0.05).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 111 consecutive cases from March 2002 to March 2012 in our center were analyzed. The median age of patients was 10 (3-14) years old. All patients received unmanipulated combined marrow and peripheral blood stem cells for transplant after conditioning with busulfan and cyclophosphamide (Cy)/Cy and total body irradiation (TBI) plus antithymocyte globulin (ATG). RESULTS: Durable hematopoietic reconstitution was seen in 98% of recipients. Engraftment failure occurred in 3 cases including 2 cases of father to daughter transplants. One-hundred-day transplant-related mortality (TRM) was only 4.5%. The cumulative incidences of grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) and chronic GvHD (cGvHD) were 47.6% and 28.3%, respectively. With the median follow-up of 32 (12-134) months, 2-year and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates for all patients were 82.1% and 79.2%, respectively. Five-year OS rates for patients in early, intermediate and advanced disease were 84.0%, 81.0%, and 57.1%, respectively (p = 0.08). Five-year OS of transplants in father to son, father to daughter, mother to son, and mother to daughter were was 88.1%, 57.1%, 70.6%, and 82.6%, respectively (p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Under current protocol, children with leukemia tolerate haplo-HSCT from their parent very well with lower TRM, less cGvHD, and better OS compared with our published data. Pre-transplant disease status and donor- recipient relationship and the recipient age have significant impact on survival.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At diagnosis, qualitative PCR demonstrated the presence of a typical e14a2 configuration, and chromosome analysis showed an apparently normal female karyotype. However, FISH with BCR-ABL1 dual fusion probes gave a positive signal in 152/200 analyzed nuclei, with the fusion signal detected on the long arm of a cytogenetically normal chromosome 9. Using locus-specific probes for chromosome 9 and 22 telomeres, a third chromosome involvement was excluded. Furthermore, microarray analysis from the same specimens showed a normal result. Due to a high Charlson Comorbidity Index, the patient was treated with a reduced dose of imatinib, achieving a rapid hematological response after 1 month. However, after 6 months of imatinib therapy, she had to be considered as warning (Ph+ 26.5%, BCR-ABL1 >1%) according to the European LeukemiaNet 2013 recommendations. In conclusion, we confirmed the importance of a combination of cytogenetic and molecular techniques for the diagnosis and therapy monitoring of masked Ph CML, but, different from what has been reported in the literature so far, we cannot completely exclude the fact that the unusual cytogenetic pattern of this patient may have negatively influenced her response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.",,,"['(c) 2015 S.

Epub 2014 Sep 24.,"Overexpression of anti-apoptotic members of the BCL2 family has been found in all types of cancer. A member of the family, BCLxl (B-cell lymphoma extra-large), is known to be associated with the progression of leukemogenesis. In the present study, we focused on understanding the domains of BCLxl responsible for in vivo oncogenic potency. To this end, we utilized engineered BCLxl proteins with alternative transmembrane domains (TM) or chimeric BCLxl proteins containing domains from a less potent BCL2-like protein, BCLb. As expected, mice receiving MYC-only expressing bone marrow develop leukemia by 100 days, whereas co-expression of MYC with wild-type BCLxl led to aggressive myeloid leukemia with an average latency of ~25 days. Interestingly, mice injected with bone marrow co-expressing MYC and BCLxl targeted specifically to either mitochondria or ER also succumbed to leukemia with an average latency of ~25 days. Further, our study was extended to examine the role of the BH4 domain in driving potent leukemogenesis. Mice injected with bone marrow co-expressing MYC and BCLb succumb to leukemia in an average of ~55 days, but interestingly a BCLxl protein containing only the loop region of BCLb drove MYC-induced leukemogenesis with the same latency as wild-type BCLxl. These data suggest that the localization of exogenous BCLxl to either mitochondria or ER is not a steadfast dictator of in vivo oncogenic potency. Further, our findings suggest that the loop domain of BCLb and BCLxl is not responsible for dictating the in vivo leukemogeneic potency. This study provides further mechanistic details into the biochemical functions of BCLxl.",['NOTNLM'],"['BCL2L1', 'BCL2L10', 'BH4', 'MYC', 'apoptosis', 'leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under high oxidative stress (300 microM) conditions, cell apoptosis increased at high concentrations of bevacizumab (1.33 and 2.67 mg/mL), but it did not correlate with Bcl-2 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Withdrawal of vascular endothelial growth factor can lead to RPE cell apoptosis and influences the expression of anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-2 under oxidative stress conditions. Since oxidative stress levels of each patient are unknown, repeated injections of intravitreal bevacizumab, as in eyes with age-related macular degeneration, might influence RPE cell survival.",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Bcl-2', 'Bevacizumab', 'Retinal pigment epithelial cell']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The method was used to survey serum samples of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast cancer (BC), and nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Peptides were identified from serum samples containing phosphorylation, acetylation, lysine methylation, and arginine methylation. Of the PTMs identified, lysine acetylation (AcK) and arginine mono-methylation (Rme) were more prevalent than other PTMs. Label-free quantitative analysis of AcK and Rme peptides was performed for sera from AML, BC, and NSCLC patients. Several AcK and Rme sites showed distinct abundance distribution patterns across the three cancer types. The identification and quantification of posttranslationally modified peptides in serum samples reported here can be used for patient profiling and biomarker discovery research.",,,"['(c) 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pneumococcal serotype distribution among these patients was different from serotypes causing IPD in the general population. The serotype coverages of PCV13 and PPSV23 were 57% and 64%, respectively, lower than in the general population. This reflects a higher predisposition to IPD in vaccinated patients with haematological malignancies and possibly less benefit of herd immunity gained with the wide use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in the general population.

They are characterized by qualitative morphological abnormalities of one or more myeloid lineages responsible for an ineffective hematopoiesis, and therefore cytopenias of central origin contrasting with a usually rich bone marrow wealth. The MDS are asymptomatic in half of the cases and their discovery is a result of systematic blood analysis or tests to explore another disease. The evolution is marked by worsening cytopenias, and the risk of acute myeloid leukemia transformation with poor prognosis because frequently chemoresistant. The diagnosis of MDS is pronounced after a clinico-biological confrontation to discuss the differential diagnosis taking into account all clinical and cytological data, results of conventional cytogenetics and evolution after vitamin therapy. Knowledge more depth on MDS refine MDS classification criteria by developing successive classifications (FAB 1982, WHO 2001 and 2008) which aim the identification of MDS groups with clinical, biological and common prognostic. The treatment of MDS is essentially symptomatic. The development of new targeted therapeutic strategies enables high hopes in a context where treatment options are a difficult choice, because the advanced age of most patients.

In the multicenter CBF-2006 study, a prospective monitoring of peripheral blood and bone marrow samples was performed every 3 months and every year, respectively, for 2 years following intensive chemotherapy in 94 patients in first complete remission. A complete molecular remission was defined as a (RUNX1-RUNX1T1/ABL1)x100 </= 0.001%. After the completion of consolidation therapy, a bone marrow complete molecular remission was observed in 30% of the patients, but was not predictive of subsequent relapse. Indeed, 8 patients (9%) presented a positive bone marrow minimal residual disease for up to 2 years of follow-up while still remaining in complete remission. Conversely, a peripheral blood complete molecular remission was statistically associated with a lower risk of relapse whatever the time-point considered after the completion of consolidation therapy. During the 2-year follow-up, the persistence of peripheral blood complete molecular remission was associated with a lower risk of relapse (4-year cumulative incidence, 8.2%), while molecular relapse confirmed on a subsequent peripheral blood sample predicted hematological relapse (4-year cumulative incidence, 86.9%) within a median time interval of 3.9 months. In t(8;21)(q22;q22) acute myeloid leukemia, minimal residual disease monitoring on peripheral blood every 3 months allows for the prediction of hematological relapse, and to identify patients who could potentially benefit from intervention therapy.

The functional differences in the viral transcriptional regulators Tax and HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) between each subgroup and the relationships between subgroups and the clinical and laboratory characteristics of HAM/TSP patients were evaluated. The results of these analyses indicated the following: (1) distinct nucleotide substitutions corresponding to each subgroup were associated with nucleotide substitutions in viral structural, regulatory, and accessory genes; (2) the HBZ messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in HTLV-1-infected cells was significantly higher in HAM/TSP patients with subgroup-B than in those with subgroup-A; (3) a positive correlation was observed between the expression of HBZ mRNA and its target Foxp3 mRNA in HAM/TSP patients with subgroup-B, but not in patients with subgroup-A; (4) no clear differences were noted in clinical and laboratory characteristics between HAM/TSP patients with subgroup-A and subgroup-B; and (5) no functional differences were observed in Tax and HBZ between each subgroup based on reporter gene assays. Our results indicate that although different HTLV-1 subgroups are characterized by different patterns of viral and host gene expression in HAM/TSP patients via independent mechanisms of direct transcriptional regulation, these differences do not significantly affect the clinical and laboratory characteristics of HAM/TSP patients.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Foxp3', '*HAM/TSP', '*HBZ', '*HTLV-1', '*Tax', '*Virus subgroup']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 3.,"PURPOSE: This study was performed to determine whether the investigational proteasome inhibitor ixazomib demonstrated selective antineoplastic activity against acute myelogenous leukemia cells expressing a mutated nucleophosmin-1 gene and to gain a better understanding of its mechanisms of action. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The cytotoxic effects of ixazomib treatment were analyzed in human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell lines and primary AML samples expressing wild-type or mutated NPM1 (NPMc(+)). The potential roles of oxidative stress in mediating cytotoxic activity were determined using flow cytometry, enzyme-based assays, and Western blots. RESULTS: Apoptosis induced by ixazomib was abrogated by knockdown of NPM1/NPMc(+)expression using an inducible shRNA construct and enhanced by NPMc(+)overexpression. Cytotoxicity was associated with superoxide generation and was reduced by the addition of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. AML cells expressing NPMc(+)had significantly reduced levels of intracellular glutathione and NADPH associated with reduced antioxidant responses to drug treatment. Treatment of 3 patients with relapsed NPMc(+)AML resulted in an antileukemic effect in 1 patient as demonstrated by a marked reduction of leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood. Efficacy was associated with superoxide generation, reduced glutathione levels, and reduced mRNA and protein expression of antioxidant effectors in responding cells. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a direct association was observed between NPMc(+)expression in AML, reduced antioxidant responses, and enhanced sensitivity to an oral proteasome inhibitor that induces oxidative stress. These data suggest that intracellular determinants of antioxidant responses may be good predictors of therapeutic response to ixazomib.",,,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sepsis is a serious and common condition with high mortality and morbidity. The public awareness, knowledge, and perception of sepsis in Sweden are unknown. Methods. A survey was performed using an online interview distributed to adults, aged 18-74, between March 6 and 9, 2015. Results. A total of 1001 people responded to the survey. Twenty-one percent of participants had heard of sepsis, whereas more than 86% had heard of each of the other conditions listed; for example, stroke (95%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (95%), and leukemia (92%). Of those who had heard of sepsis, 93% responded that it is an infection or blood poisoning in an open question. The respondents who had heard of each disease estimated its mortality. For sepsis, the mortality was estimated at an average of 30%, which was at the same level as estimated mortalities for prostate and breast cancer but lower than for stroke, COPD, and leukemia. Conclusions. The awareness and knowledge of sepsis is low. The mortality for sepsis is not as overestimated as for many other diseases. The lack of awareness of sepsis might be a target to improve the outcome for sepsis patients by reducing the prehospital delay and hence enable early interventions. An increased general awareness might also raise interest for funding for research in this area and for its priority in healthcare support.",['NOTNLM'],"['awareness', 'knowledge', 'sepsis', 'septic chock', 'severe sepsis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: In this study we aim to screen and investigate the in vitro anti-tumor activities of ten species of plants commonly grown in Southern Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the MTT colorimetric assay to evaluate the cytotoxic activities of the methanol extracts of these plants on various tumor cell lines. The IC50 was calculated as a scale for this evaluation. RESULTS: Satureja bachtiarica, Satureja hortensis, Thymus vulgaris, Thymus daenensis and Mentha lonigfolia showed the inhibitoriest effects on Jurkat cells with > 80% inhibition at 200 microg/mL. Satureja hortensis (IC50: 66.7 microg/mL) was the most effective. These plants also strongly inhibited K562 cell growth; Satureja bachtiarica (IC50: 28.3 microg/mL), Satureja hortensis (IC50: 52 microg/mL) and Thymus vulgaris (IC50: 87 microg/mL) were the most effective extracts. Cichorium intybus, Rheum ribes, Alhagi pseudalhagi and Glycyrrihza glabra also showed notable effects on the leukemia cell lines. The Raji cell line was mostly inhibited by Satureja bachtiarica and Thymus vulgaris with approximately 40% inhibition at 200microg/ml. The influence of these extracts on solid tumor cell lines was not strong. Fen cells were mostly affected by Glycyrrihza glabra (IC50: 182 microg/mL) and HeLa cells by Satureja hortensis (31.6% growth inhibitory effect at 200 microg/mL).

The standard hydrodynamic approach requires two fluids to be injected into the microfluidic device: one containing the sample and the other one, called the sheath fluid, allows squeezing the sample fluid into a narrow stream. The major drawback of this approach is the high complexity of the layout for microfluidic devices when parallel streams are required. In this work, we present a novel parallelized microfluidic device that enables hydrodynamic focusing in each microchannel using a single feed flow. At each of the parallel channels, a cross-filter region is present that allows removing fluid from the sample fluid. This fluid is used to create local sheath fluids that hydrodynamically pinch the sample fluid. The great advantage of the proposed device is that, since only one inlet is needed, multiple parallel micro-channels can be easily introduced into the design. In the paper, the design method is described and the numerical simulations performed to define the optimal design are summarized. Moreover, the operational functionality of devices tested by using both polystyrene beads and Acute Lymphoid Leukemia cells are shown.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Changes in nucleosome position and occupancy, histone variants and modifications, and chromatin remodeling are also critical elements of dynamic transcriptional regulation, but poorly understood at enhancers. We investigated glucocorticoid receptor-associated (GR) nucleosome dynamics at enhancers in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. RESULTS: For the first time, we demonstrate functionally distinct modes of nucleosome remodeling upon chromatin binding by GR, which we term central, non-central, phased, and minimal. Central and non-central remodeling reflect nucleosome eviction by GR and cofactors, respectively. Phased remodeling involves nucleosome repositioning and is associated with rapidly activated enhancers and induction of gene expression. Minimal remodeling sites initially have low levels of enhancer-associated histone modification, but the majority of these regions gain H3K4me2 or H3K27Ac to become de novo enhancers. Minimal remodeling regions are associated with gene ontologies specific to decreased B cell number and mTOR inhibition and may make unique contributions to glucocorticoid-induced leukemia cell death.

Serving both effector and memory functions for the immune system, T cells make an obvious candidate for adoptive cell immunotherapy. By modifying native T cells with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), these cells can theoretically be targeted against any extracellular antigen. To date, the best-studied and clinically validated CAR T cells recognize CD19, a cell surface molecule on B cells and B cell malignancies. These CD19-directed T cells have shown clinical utility in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, with some patients achieving long-term disease remissions after treatment. This review will briefly summarize the current data supporting the use of adoptively transferred CAR T cells for the treatment of CD19-positive malignancies.

AIM: To report the results of AML treatment at the Catholic University of Chile Clinical Hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Review of medical records of patients with AML. RESULTS: 63 patients, median age 55.4 years (range:16-89), treated between 2010 and 2014. Admission laboratory values showed (median values): leukocytes 45.989/mm(3), hemoglobin 9.1 g/dl, platelets 75.548/mm(3), peripheral blood blasts 38% and bone marrow blasts 74%. According to cytogenetic risk classification we observed the following groups: favorable 8% (n = 5), intermediate 51% (n = 32), unfavorable 13% (n = 8) and unknown 28% (n = 17). Seventy five percent of patients received induction chemotherapy and 25% palliative care. Median survival of treated and palliative care patients was 27.3 and 1 month respectively. Induction chemotherapy (IC) mortality (ICM) was 4.2%. Seventy percent (n = 33) of patients who received IC had complete response (CR) with a 3-year relapse free survival (RFS) of 25% and overall survival (OS) of 31%. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that achievement of CR, cytogenetic risk group and receiving consolidation chemotherapy were significantly associated with better RFS and OS. CONCLUSIONS: AML treatment with standard chemotherapy in our center achieves similar results to what has been described in international series regarding induction rates and ICM, however RFS and OS are still very low, especially in intermediate and high cytogenetic risk groups.",,,,,,,,,,,,Resultados en el tratamiento de pacientes con leucemia mieloide aguda no promielocitica en el Hospital Clinico de la Pontificia Universidad Catolica entre los anos 2010-2014.,,,,,

During hospitalization for neutropenic fever, a 19-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia, who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, developed a generalized folliculocentric eruption following initiation of antifungal therapy for newly diagnosed C. krusei fungemia. Despite adequate antifungal coverage and negative blood cultures, the follicular-based erythematous papules persisted. Biopsies demonstrated yeast within ruptured follicles, without angiotropism or involvement of the interfollicular dermis, subcutaneous tissue, or stratum corneum. Concurrent skin tissue cultures confirmed C. krusei. The patient remained febrile despite aggressive antifungal therapy, with relapse of leukemia and subsequent death. Our case is unusual given the development of cutaneous lesions following clearance of fungemia, with yeast limited to ruptured follicular lumina, possibly indicating a primary cutaneous source or early transfollicular/transepidermal elimination. Given the limited available descriptions of cutaneous histopathology for C. krusei, we seek to add to the understanding of its pathophysiology and aid in the diagnosis and treatment of this often fatal infection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 2.,"Monocytes/macrophages (MOs/MPhis) are suggested to be crucial for skeletal muscle repair and remodeling. This has been attributed to their proangiogenic potential, secretion of growth factors, and clearance of tissue debris. Skeletal muscle injury increases the number of MPhis in the tissue, and their importance for muscle regeneration has been supported by studies demonstrating that depletion of MOs/MPhis greatly impairs repair after muscle injury. Whether noninjurious exercise leads to induced expression of chemoattractants for MOs/MPhis is poorly investigated. To this end, we analyzed the expression of CX3CL1 (fractalkine), CCL2 (MCP-1), and CCL22 (MDC) in human skeletal muscle after a bout of exercise, all of which are established MO/MPhi chemotactic factors that are expressed by human myoblasts. Muscle biopsies from the musculus vastus lateralis were obtained up to 24 h after 1 h of cycle exercise in healthy individuals and in age-matched nonexercised controls. CX3CL1 increased at both the mRNA and protein level in human skeletal muscle after one bout of exercise. It was not possible to distinguish changes in CCL2 or CCL22 mRNA levels between biopsy vs. exercise effects, and the expression of CCL22 was very low. CX3CL1 mainly localized to the skeletal muscle endothelium, and it increased in human umbilical vein endothelial cells stimulated with tissue fluid from exercised muscle. CX3CL1 increased the expression of proinflammatory and proangiogenic factors in THP-1 monocytes (a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) and in human primary myoblasts and myotubes. Altogether, this suggests that CX3CL1 participates in cross-talk mechanisms between endothelium and other muscle tissue cells and may promote a shift in the microenvironment toward a more regenerative milieu.",['NOTNLM'],"['cross-talk', 'endothelium', 'exercise', 'fractalkine', 'skeletal muscle']",['Copyright (c) 2016 the American Physiological Society.'],['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2854-7262'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development of early prediction methods is therefore of importance. Our aim was to analyze the usefulness of early donor chimerism monitoring after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in T cells and in CD4+ and CD8+ (lineage chimerism) for GvHD prediction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Chimerism was analyzed in 76 consecutive adult patients using RQ-PCR TaqMan technology on DNA extracted from Pan T, CD4+, and CD8+ cell subsets on Day 5, 10, 15 and 30 after allo-HSCT. RESULTS: The threshold of chimerism predictive for GvHD was the same for all tested cell subsets. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients treated with myeloablative conditioning (MAC), the threshold predictive for acute graft versus host disease was 95% and 99% for Day 10 and Day 15, respectively. In patients treated with reduced intensity conditioning (RIC), the threshold predictive for chronic graft versus host disease was 98% on Day 10. The differences were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Chimerism analysis in T cell subsets by RQ-PCR on Day 10 and Day 15 after transplantation is useful for prediction of aGvHD (AML patients after MAC) and cGvHD (patients after RIC). However, there was no difference in the results between chimerism in the T cell subsets.

METHODS: Bone marrow samples from 50 CML patientsincluding 33 patients in chronic phase, 7 in accelerated phase and 10 in blast crisisand peripheral blood specimens of 20 healthy donors were collected. The expression of C/EBPalpha gene and the effect of Imatinib on its expression was detected by RT- PCR. C/EBPalpha gene was inserted into lentivirus expression vector pLVX- EGFP- 3FLAG- Puro by recombinant DNA technology to construct C/EBPalpha stable expression in K562 cells. Cell proliferation was assayed by CCK-8. The expressions of Foxo3a and Bim genes were detected by RT-PCR. RESULTS: The level of C/EBPalpha expression was significantly declined in CML patients compared with that of normal control groupP<0.01and had negative correlation with bcr- abl expressionSpearman r= 0.505, P<0.01). The stable K562- C/EBPalpha cell line was successfully established and confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot. Cell proliferation ability was lower in the K562- C/EBPalpha group than that in the non- transfection and mock-vehicle groups. The expressions of Foxo3a and Bim genes were 1.06 +/- 0.06 and 0.53 +/- 0.07, respectively, which was higher than that of nontransfection and mock-vehicle groupsP<0.01, P<0.05).

METHODS: Every one of 6 laboratories prepared 10 cDNA samples from tyrosine kinase inhibitors resistant BCR-ABL (P210 or P190) positive patients'bone marrow or peripheral blood. Each cDNA sample was divided into 6 aliquots and delivered to the laboratories. All 6 laboratories tested BCR-ABL point mutations of 60 samples according to their own protocols. Peking University People's Hospital analyzed the comparison results based on both the reports and sequencing chromatogram from all laboratories. RESULTS: All laboratories reported the same nucleotide and corresponding amino acid mutations in 37 samples (61.7%. Of 60 samples, 53 had confirmed mutation types, and a total of 23 types were included; 1 had no mutation; mutation types of 6 samples could not be determined because of the big differences among chromatograms from different laboratories. Low percentages of mutants were significantly related to results inconsistency (P=0.008). Inconsistent result of one sample was caused by the unique chromatogram of the mutant L248V, and one by the non-coverage amplification of PCR product from different laboratories. Amplification was failed in 3 samples. Testing or sequencing mistakes occurred in 7 samples. The differences in the mutant percentages among laboratories were less than 20% in the 80.6% of samples with confirmed results. Low internal control gene copies (ABL<10 000) were significantly related to both failed amplification and big differences among chromatograms from different laboratories (P=0.005 and <0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Problems in the clinical routine detection of BCR-ABL point mutation could be exposed and improvement could be achieved by sample exchange and comparison. Low percentage of mutant is the main reason which causes the discrepancy of BCR-ABL point mutation results among different laboratories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So identification of new MERTK inhibitors is of extreme importance. In this study, 107 MERTK inhibitors with known activities were gathered to generate a ligand-based pharmacophore model (ADDHH.4), followed by building a 3D-QSAR model, which had high value of coefficient of determination (R(2)=0.9061) and high value of coefficient of determination (Q(2)=0.7442). For the pharmacophore model, two hydrogen bond donors (D), one hydrogen bond receptor (A), and two hydrophobic groups (H) were considered as the key elements contributing to ligand activity. The model then served to search a drug-like database with 1.5 million molecules, and 47832 hits were obtained. Subsequently, docking procedure was applied on these hits, and 840 compounds were obtained through high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS). Standard precision (SP), extra precision (XP) and rule of five were also used in virtual screening protocol.

Epub 2015 Nov 3.,"BACKGROUND: Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) has been used with variable success in a variety of hematologic malignancies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients who were treated with DLI for persistent or relapsed disease at the Temple University Bone Marrow Transplant Unit from July 1, 1993 to December 31, 2013 to evaluate the effect of the type of DLI (fresh vs. cryopreserved) on event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Median follow-up was 64.8 months (range, 0.3-142.6 months). RESULTS: We found that EFS and OS were similar between patients receiving cryopreserved cells and those receiving fresh DLI (median OS for cryopreserved cells, 0.39 years; median OS for fresh cells, 0.32 years; P = .793; median EFS for cryopreserved cells, 0.410 years; median EFS for fresh cells, 0.420 years; P = .4264). In the setting of relapsed disease, treatment with any chemotherapy regimen before receiving DLI did not significantly impact OS (n = 63; P = .2203) or EFS (n = 40; P = .542). A subgroup analysis limited to patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (32 patients) showed that differences in OS and EFS between cryopreserved and fresh DLI approached significance (median OS for cryopreserved cells, 0.34 years; median OS for fresh cells, 0.17 years; P = .16; median EFS for cryopreserved cells, 0.37 years; median EFS for fresh cells, 0.094 years; P = 0.11). CONCLUSION: We conclude that the use of fresh cells versus cryopreserved cells does not have an impact on outcomes, and selected patients can achieve long-term survival with DLI for treatment of relapse after transplantation, although the overall outcomes remain dismal.",['NOTNLM'],"['Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI)', 'Event-free survival', 'Overall survival', 'Persistent or relapsed disease']",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2015 Nov 26.,Children with Down Syndrome (DS) are at markedly increased risk for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The ALL is of B cell precursor (BCP) phenotype. T-ALL is only rarely diagnosed as well as infant leukemia. Gene expression profiling and cytogenetics suggest that DS-ALL is an heterogeneous disease. More than half of the leukemias are characterized by aberrant expression of the thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) receptor CRLF2 caused by genomic rearrangements. These rearrangements are often associated with somatic activating mutations in the receptors or in the downstream components of the JAK-STAT pathway. The activation of JAK-STAT pathway suggests that targeted therapy with JAK or downstream inhibitors may be effective for children with DS-ALL. The basis of the increased risk of BCP-ALL and in particular of the CRLF2 aberrations is presently unknown. Neither is it known which genes on the trisomic chromosome 21 are involved.,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Down Syndrome']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Analysis of TYK2 loss-of-function revealed its important role in immunity to infection, (auto-) immunity and (auto-) inflammation. TYK2-deficient patients unravelled high similarity between mice and men with respect to cellular signalling functions and basic immunology. Genome-wide association studies link TYK2 to several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases as well as carcinogenesis. Due to its cytokine signalling functions TYK2 was found to be essential in tumour surveillance. Lately TYK2 activating mutants and fusion proteins were detected in patients diagnosed with leukaemic diseases suggesting that TYK2 is a potent oncogene. Here we review the cell intrinsic and extrinsic functions of TYK2 in the characteristics preventing and enabling carcinogenesis.

Epub 2015 Nov 26.,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) represents the most effective immunotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myeloid malignancies. However, disease relapse remains the most common cause of treatment failure. By performing a second allo-HCT, durable remission can be achieved in some patients. However, a second allo-HCT is of no benefit for the majority of patients, so this approach requires further understanding. We present a retrospective cohort of 116 patients diagnosed with AML, myelodysplastic syndromes, and myeloproliferative disorders who consecutively underwent a second allo-HCT for disease relapse. The median age was 38 years (range, 4 to 69 years). Sixty-three patients were alive at last follow-up. The median follow-up of the whole cohort was 193 days (range, 2 to 6724 days) and the median follow-up of survivors was 1628 days (range, 52 to 5518 days). Overall survival (OS) at 5 years was 32% (SE +/- 4.7%). Multivariate analysis identified active disease status (P < .001) and second allo-HCT < 430 days (the median of the time to second transplantation) after the first transplantation (P < .001) as factors for poor prognosis, whereas the use of an HLA-identical sibling donor for the second allo-HCT was identified as a good prognostic factor (P < .05) for OS. The use of myeloablative conditioning (P = .01), active disease (P = .02), and a donor other than an HLA-identical sibling (others versus HLA-identical siblings) (P = .009) were factors statistically significant for nonrelapse mortality in multivariate analysis. Time to second transplantation was statistically significant (P = .001) in the relapse multivariate analysis, whereas multivariate analysis identified active disease status (P < .001) and time to second transplantation (P < .001) as poor prognosis factors for disease-free survival. This study confirms active disease and early relapse as dismal prognostic factors for a second allo-HCT. Using a different donor at second allo-HCT did not appear to change outcome, but using an HLA-identical sibling donor for a second transplantation appears to be associated with better survival. Further studies are warranted.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Myeloid malignancies', 'Relapse', 'Second allogeneic stem cell transplantation']","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

SIRT3 (sirtuin 3) is the major deacetylase within the mitochondrial matrix that promotes aerobic metabolism and controls reactive oxygen species (ROS) by deacetylating and activating isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). There is controversy as to whether SIRT3 acts as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, and here we investigated its role in B cell malignancies. In mantle cell lymphoma patient samples, we found that lower SIRT3 protein expression was associated with worse overall survival. Further, SIRT3 protein expression was reduced in chronic lymphocytic leukemia primary samples and malignant B cell lines compared to primary B cells from healthy donors. This lower level of expression correlated with hyperacetylation of IDH2 and SOD2 mitochondrial proteins, lowered enzymatic activities, and higher ROS levels. Overexpression of SIRT3 decreased proliferation and diminished the Warburg-like phenotype in SIRT3-deficient cell lines, and this effect is largely dependent on deacetylation of IDH2 and SOD2. Lastly, depletion of SIRT3 from malignant B cell lines resulted in greater susceptibility to treatment with an ROS scavenger but did not result in greater sensitivity to inhibition of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha pathway, suggesting that loss of SIRT3 increases proliferation via ROS-dependent but hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha-independent mechanisms. Our study suggests that SIRT3 acts as a tumor suppressor in B cell malignancies, and activating the SIRT3 pathway might represent a novel therapeutic approach for treating B cell malignancies.",['NOTNLM'],"['B cell', 'ROS', 'Warburg effect', 'acetylation', 'cancer', 'cell proliferation', 'isocitrate dehydrogenase', 'sirtuins', 'superoxide dismutase (SOD)']","['(c) 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The peptides were evaluated for their ability to deliver two molecular cargos, fluorescence-labeled cell-impermeable negatively charged phosphopeptide (F'-GpYEEI) and fluorescence-labeled lamivudine (F'-3TC), intracellularly in human leukemia cancer (CCRF-CEM) cells. We investigated the role of cyclization and the number of amino acids in improving the transporting ability of the peptides. The flow cytometry studies suggested that the synthesized peptides were able to work efficiently as transporters for both cargos. Among all compounds, cyclic [CR]4 was found to be the most efficient peptide in transporting the cargo into cells. For instance, the cellular uptake of F'-3TC (5muM) and F'-GpYEEI (5muM) was enhanced by 16- and 20-fold, respectively, in the presence of cyclic [CR]4 compared to that of the parent compound alone. The mechanism of F'-GpYEEI uptake by cells was found to be energy-independent. The results showed that the number of amino acids and their cyclic nature can impact the efficiency of the peptide in transporting the molecular cargos.",['NOTNLM'],"['Arginine', 'Cysteine', 'Drug delivery', 'Formulation', 'Peptide']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2015 Dec 2.,"There is interest in using leukemia-gene panels and next-generation sequencing to assess acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) response to induction chemotherapy. Studies have shown that patients with AML in morphologic remission may continue to have clonal hematopoiesis with populations closely related to the founding AML clone and that this confers an increased risk of relapse. However, it remains unknown how induction chemotherapy influences the clonal evolution of a patient's nonleukemic hematopoietic population. Here, we report that 5 of 15 patients with genetic clearance of their founding AML clone after induction chemotherapy had a concomitant expansion of a hematopoietic population unrelated to the initial AML. These populations frequently harbored somatic mutations in genes recurrently mutated in AML or myelodysplastic syndromes and were detectable at very low frequencies at the time of AML diagnosis. These results suggest that nonleukemic hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, harboring specific aging-acquired mutations, may have a competitive fitness advantage after induction chemotherapy, expand, and persist long after the completion of chemotherapy. Although the clinical importance of these ""rising"" clones remains to be determined, it will be important to distinguish them from leukemia-related populations when assessing for molecular responses to induction chemotherapy.",,,['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5141-0745', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4266-6700', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1650-0555', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5892-1553', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7753-1091', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7710-1171']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 2.,"The transcription factor Myb plays a key role in the hematopoietic system and has been implicated in the development of leukemia and other human cancers. Inhibition of Myb is therefore emerging as a potential therapeutic strategy for these diseases. However, because of a lack of suitable inhibitors, the feasibility of therapeutic approaches based on Myb inhibition has not been explored. We have identified the triterpenoid Celastrol as a potent low-molecular-weight inhibitor of the interaction of Myb with its cooperation partner p300. We demonstrate that Celastrol suppresses the proliferative potential of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells while not affecting normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. Furthermore, Celastrol prolongs the survival of mice in a model of an aggressive AML. Overall, our work demonstrates the therapeutic potential of a small molecule inhibitor of the Myb/p300 interaction for the treatment of AML and provides a starting point for the further development of Myb-inhibitory compounds for the treatment of leukemia and, possibly, other tumors driven by deregulated Myb.",,,['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 2.,"Formed from a reciprocal translocation t(9:22)(q34;q11) of genetic material between the long arms of human chromosomes 9 and 22, the constitutively active breakpoint cluster region (BCR) Abelson 1 (ABL) tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL is known to be causative of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In 98% of CML patients harboring the t(9:22)(q34;q11) translocation, known as the Philadelphia chromosome, the chimeric BCR-ABL oncogene is created through cleavage of the BCR gene within its major breakpoint region (M-BCR) and breakage of the ABL gene within a 100-kbp region downstream of exon 2a. Clinical detection of the fused BCR-ABL oncogene currently relies on direct visualization by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), a relatively tedious assay that typically offers a detection limit of ca. 2%. Here, we describe a novel assay that uses droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) technology to reliably measure M-BCR status and the presence of BCR-ABL. When applied to cell-line models of CML, the assay accurately quantifies BCR-ABL frequency to a detection limit of 0.25%. It therefore offers improved specificity relative to FISH, and may allow identification of variant translocation patterns, including derivative chromosome 9 deletions.",['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'Cancer diagnostics', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Digital PCR', 'Molecular diagnostics', 'Philadelphia chromosome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To fully assess this association, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of available evidence from observational cohort studies. All such longitudinal studies of patients diagnosed with CLL that enabled quantitative assessment of the risk of melanoma compared with the general population were eligible. We identified seven studies from a search of all published literature to July 2014 in Medline, Embase and ISI science citation index databases. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. There was an almost four-fold increase in the risk of melanoma in patients with CLL compared with the general population (pooled standardized incidence ratio 3.88 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.08-7.22]), although significant heterogeneity was evident among studies (I2=96.0%, P(het)<0.001). The risk of melanoma was higher for men with CLL (3.41; 95% CI 1.49-7.80) than women (2.61; 95% CI 1.13-6.01). CLL patients are at high risk of developing melanoma and the magnitude of the risk is higher than that found in other immunosuppressed populations. Our findings suggest that patients with CLL, as they are also at a higher risk of developing the more common skin cancers, would benefit from regular skin examinations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies showed a threshold of 40% of deleted cells to be optimal for showing that clinical differences in terms of TFT and OS within 11q- CLLs. In patients with >/=40% of losses in 11q (11q-H) (74%), the median TFT was 19 months compared with 44 months in CLL patients with <40% del(11q) (11q-L) (P<0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, only the presence of 11q-L, mutated IGHV status, early Binet stage and absence of extended lymphadenopathy were associated with longer TFT. Patients with 11q-H had an OS of 90 months, while in the 11q-L group the OS was not reached (P = 0.008). The absence of splenomegaly (P = 0.02), low LDH (P = 0.018) or beta2M (P = 0.006), and the presence of 11q-L (P = 0.003) were associated with a longer OS. In addition, to detect the presence of mutations in the ATM, TP53, NOTCH1, SF3B1, MYD88, FBXW7, XPO1 and BIRC3 genes, a select cohort of CLL patients with losses in 11q was sequenced by next-generation sequencing of amplicons. Eighty % of CLLs with 11q- showed mutations and fewer patients with low frequencies of 11q- had mutations among genes examined (50% vs 94.1%, P = 0.023). In summary, CLL patients with <40% of 11q- had a long TFT and OS that could be associated with the presence of fewer mutated genes.",,,,,,,,,"['Grupo Cooperativo Espanol de Citogenetica Hematologica (GCECGH) and Grupo Espanol', 'de Leucemia Linfatica Cronica (GELLC)']",,,,,,,,

On the basis of the structure of PCI-32765 (ibrutinib), a BTK kinase inhibitor that was recently reported to bear FLT3 kinase activity through a structure-guided drug design approach, we have discovered compound 18 (CHMFL-FLT3-122), which displayed an IC50 of 40 nM against FLT3 kinase and achieved selectivity over BTK kinase (over 10-fold). It significantly inhibited the proliferation of FLT3-ITD positive AML cancer cell lines MV4-11 (GI50 = 22 nM), MOLM13/14 (GI50 = 21 nM/42 nM). More importantly, 18 demonstrated 170-fold selectivity between FLT3 kinase and c-KIT kinase (GI50 = 11 nM versus 1900 nM) in the TEL-fusion isogenic BaF3 cells indicating a potential to avoid the FLT3/c-KIT dual inhibition induced myelosuppression toxicity. In the cellular context it strongly affected FLT3-ITD mediated signaling pathways and induced apoptosis by arresting the cell cycle into the G0/G1 phase. In the in vivo studies 18 demonstrated a good bioavailability (30%) and significantly suppressed the tumor growth in MV4-11 cell inoculated xenograft model (50 mg/kg) without exhibiting obvious toxicity. Compound 18 might be a potential drug candidate for FLT3-ITD positive AML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The level of PMP22 expression in CD34(+) cells isolated from CML patients' bone marrow samples (BMMCs) and peripheral blood samples (PBMCs) was determined by RT-PCR. In addition, PMP22-siRNA and scrambled control siRNA were transfected into human CML cell line K562 with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Cell viability and apoptosis were, respectively, determined by MTT assay and flow cytometry. Besides, the level of caspase 3 and Bcl-xL was then detected using Western blot. The level of PMP22 expression in CML patients' CD34(+) cells isolated from both PBMCs and BMMCs was significantly higher than the control group. PMP22 expression in K562 cells was successfully knocked down by siRNA. MTT analysis showed that knockdown of PMP22 inhibited the proliferation of CML cells. Flow cytometry showed that knockdown of PMP22 promoted the apoptosis of CML cells. Besides, Bcl-xL expression markedly decreased, while the expression of caspase 3 in CML cells significantly increased after knockdown of PMP22 expression. Our findings indicate that high expression of PMP22 may promote cell proliferation and inhibit cell apoptosis via upregulation of Bcl-xL or inhibition of caspase 3 activation, and thus may contribute to the development of CML. PMP22 may serve as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of CML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 14.,"The B-cell-specific Moloney leukemia virus inset site 1 gene (BMI-1) has attracted considerable attention in recent years because of its key role in breast cancer development and metastasis. The downregulation of BMI-1 expression via small interfering RNA (siRNA) effectively inhibits tumor growth. However, the successful application of this therapy is limited by the unavailability of an appropriate vector for siRNA transfer. Therefore, this study aimed to construct a novel laminarin-based nonviral gene transfer vector to carry a constructed BMI-1-targeting siRNA and to investigate the in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects of this siRNA on breast cancer cells. To enhance the siRNA-carrying capacity, we introduced polyethylenimine (PEI) to laminarin's surface via N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole, which produced the cationic PEI-modified laminarin conjugate nLP. Subsequent in vitro experiments indicated that nLP not only formed a nanoparticle with a diameter of 200 nm through electrostatic interactions with siRNA but also showed high efficiency (95.0%) in the delivery siRNA to MCF-7 cells. The nanoparticle targeting BMI-1 (nLP/siBMI-2) reduced BMI-1 expression in breast MCF-7 cells by 90.9% reduction. An in vivo tumor suppression experiment demonstrated that the nLP/siBMI-2 nanoparticle had relatively low toxicity and good gene-therapeutic efficacy, with a tumor inhibition rate of 46.6%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results showed that resveratrol significantly decreased cell viability and triggered cell apoptosis in K562 cells. Resveratrol-induced apoptosis of K562 cells was associated with the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. Furthermore, the up-regulation of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, the activation of caspase-3 and increased cleaved PARP was also observed in K562 cells treated with resveratrol.

Genetic and functional studies implicate B-cell receptor signaling as a pivotal pathway in its pathogenesis. Full B-cell receptor activation requires tumor-microenvironment interactions in lymphoid tissues. Spleen tyrosine kinase, Bruton's tyrosine kinase, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) delta isoform are essential for B-cell receptor signal transduction but also mediate the effect of other pathways engaged in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in the tissue-microenvironment. Orally bioavailable inhibitors of spleen tyrosine kinase, Bruton's tyrosine kinase, or PI3Kdelta, induce high rates of durable responses. Ibrutinib, a covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, and idelalisib, a selective inhibitor of PI3Kdelta, have obtained regulatory approval in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Ibrutinib and idelalisib are active in patients with high-risk features, achieving superior disease control in difficult-to-treat patients than prior best therapy, making them the preferred agents for chronic lymphocytic leukemia with TP53 aberrations and for patients resistant to chemoimmunotherapy. In randomized trials, both ibrutinib, versus ofatumumab, and idelalisib in combination with rituximab, versus placebo with rituximab improved survival in relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Responses to B-cell receptor inhibitors are mostly partial, and within clinical trials treatment is continued until progression or occurrence of intolerable side effects. Ibrutinib and idelalisib are, overall, well tolerated; notable adverse events include increased bruising and incidence of atrial fibrillation on ibrutinib and colitis, pneumonitis and transaminase elevations on idelalisib. Randomized trials investigate the role of B-cell receptor inhibitors in first-line therapy and the benefit of combinations. This review discusses the biological basis for targeted therapy of chronic lymphocytic leukemia with B-cell receptor inhibitors, and summarizes the clinical experience with these agents.",,,['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study was performed in male rats using two models of a neurodegenerative disorder. Cognitive deficit in rats was induced by injection of the beta-amyloid fragment 25-35 (betaA 25-35) into the giant-cell nucleus basalis of Meynert or by coinjection of betaA 25-35 and ibotenic acid into the hippocampus. To evaluate cognitive functions in animals, three tests were used: the novel object recognition test, the conditioned passive avoidance task and the Morris maze. Comparative analysis of the data demonstrated that the neuroprotective activity of HLDF-6-NH2, evaluated by improvement of cognitive functions in animals, surpassed that of the native HLDF-6-OH peptide. The greater cognitive/ behavioral effects can be attributed to improved kinetic properties of the amide form of the peptide, such as the character of biodegradation and the half-life time. The effects of HLDF-6-NH2 are comparable to, or exceed, those of the reference compounds. Importantly, HLDF-6-NH2 exerts its effects at much lower doses than the reference compounds.",['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease (AD)"", 'HLDF-6 peptide', 'Human leukemia differentiation factor (HDLF)', 'beta-amyloid fragment 25-35 (betaA 25-35)', 'neuroprotection', 'nootropic activity']",['(c) The Author(s) 2015.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Irrespective of mutation status, the development of aggressive leukemias is enabled by increasing dependence on signaling networks. We demonstrate that a hyperactive signalosome drives addiction of AML cells to a tumor-specific Hsp90 species (teHsp90). Through genetic, environmental, and pharmacologic perturbations, we demonstrate a direct and quantitative link between hyperactivated signaling pathways and apoptotic sensitivity of AML to teHsp90 inhibition. Specifically, we find that hyperactive JAK-STAT and PI3K-AKT signaling networks are maintained by teHsp90 and, in fact, gradual activation of these networks drives tumors increasingly dependent on teHsp90. Thus, although clinically aggressive AML survives via signalosome activation, this addiction creates a vulnerability that can be exploited with Hsp90-directed therapy.",,,['Copyright (c) 2015 The Authors.

Epub 2015 Dec 1.,"The irreversible Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor ibrutinib has shown efficacy against B-cell tumors such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Fcgamma receptors (FcgammaR) on immune cells such as macrophages play an important role in tumor-specific antibody-mediated immune responses, but many such responses involve Btk. Here we tested the effects of ibrutinib on FcgammaR-mediated activities in monocytes. We found that ibrutinib did not affect monocyte FcgammaR-mediated phagocytosis, even at concentrations higher than those achieved physiologically, but suppressed FcgammaR-mediated cytokine production. We confirmed these findings in macrophages from Xid mice in which Btk signaling is defective. Because calcium flux is a major event downstream of Btk, we tested whether it was involved in phagocytosis. The results showed that blocking intracellular calcium flux decreased FcgammaR-mediated cytokine production but not phagocytosis. To verify this, we measured activation of the GTPase Rac, which is responsible for actin polymerization. Results showed that ibrutinib did not inhibit Rac activation, nor did the calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester). We next asked whether the effect of ibrutinib on monocyte FcgammaR-mediated cytokine production could be rescued by IFNgamma priming because NK cells produce IFNgamma in response to antibody therapy. Pretreatment of monocytes with IFNgamma abrogated the effects of ibrutinib on FcgammaR-mediated cytokine production, suggesting that IFNgamma priming could overcome this Btk inhibition. Furthermore, in monocyte-natural killer cell co-cultures, ibrutinib did not inhibit FcgammaR-mediated cytokine production despite doing so in single cultures. These results suggest that combining ibrutinib with monoclonal antibody therapy could enhance chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell killing without affecting macrophage effector function.",['NOTNLM'],"['Btk', 'Fcgamma receptor', 'cancer therapy', 'ibrutinib', 'immunotherapy', 'interferon', 'monocyte', 'signal transduction']","['(c) 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathways responsible for IFNalpha/beta signaling during the innate immune response to acute HSV-1 infection in the cornea are incompletely understood. Using a murine ocular infection model, we hypothesized that the stimulator of IFN genes (STING) mediates resistance to HSV-1 infection at the ocular surface and preserves the structural integrity of this mucosal site. Viral pathogenesis, tissue pathology, and host immune responses during ocular HSV-1 infection were characterized by plaque assay, esthesiometry, pachymetry, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and small interfering RNA transfection in wild-type C57BL/6 (WT), STING-deficient (STING(-/-)), and IFNalpha/beta receptor-deficient (CD118(-/-)) mice at days 3-5 postinfection. The presence of STING was critical for sustained control of HSV-1 replication in the corneal epithelium and resistance to viral neuroinvasion, but loss of STING had a negligible impact with respect to gross tissue pathology. Auxiliary STING-independent IFNalpha/beta signaling pathways were responsible for maintenance of corneal integrity. Lymphatic vessels, mast cells, and sensory innervation were compromised in CD118(-/-) mice concurrent with increased tissue edema. STING-dependent signaling led to the upregulation of tetherin, a viral restriction factor we identify is important in containing the spread of HSV-1 in vivo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Nov 16.,"Canonical siRNA design algorithms have become remarkably effective at predicting favorable binding regions within a target mRNA, but in some cases (e.g., a fusion junction site) region choice is restricted. In these instances, alternative approaches are necessary to obtain a highly potent silencing molecule. Here we focus on strategies for rational optimization of two siRNAs that target the junction sites of fusion oncogenes BCR-ABL and TMPRSS2-ERG. We demonstrate that modifying the termini of these siRNAs with a terminal G-U wobble pair or a carefully selected pair of terminal asymmetry-enhancing mismatches can result in an increase in potency at low doses. Importantly, we observed that improvements in silencing at the mRNA level do not necessarily translate to reductions in protein level and/or cell death. Decline in protein level is also heavily influenced by targeted protein half-life, and delivery vehicle toxicity can confound measures of cell death due to silencing. Therefore, for BCR-ABL, which has a long protein half-life that is difficult to overcome using siRNA, we also developed a nontoxic transfection vector: poly(lactic-coglycolic acid) nanoparticles that release siRNA over many days. We show that this system can achieve effective killing of leukemic cells.

Epub 2015 Nov 16.,"PDZ domains are abundant protein interaction modules and typically recognize a short motif at the C terminus of their ligands, with a few residues in the motif endowing the binding specificity. The sequence-based rules, however, cannot fully account for the specificity between the vast number of PDZ domains and ligands in the cell. Plexins are transmembrane receptors that regulate processes such as axon guidance and angiogenesis. Two related guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), PDZ-RhoGEF and leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG), use their PDZ domains to bind class B plexins and play critical roles in signaling. Here, we present the crystal structure of the full-length cytoplasmic region of PlexinB2 in complex with the PDZ domain of PDZ-RhoGEF. The structure reveals that, in addition to the canonical C-terminal motif/PDZ interaction, the 3D domain of PlexinB2 forms a secondary interface with the PDZ domain. Our biophysical and cell-based assays show that the secondary interface contributes to the specific interaction between plexin and PDZ-RhoGEF and to signaling by plexin in the cell. Formation of secondary interfaces may be a general mechanism for increasing affinity and specificity of modular domain-mediated interactions.",['NOTNLM'],"['PDZ', 'plexin', 'protein interaction module', 'signaling', 'specificity']",,,['PDB/5E6P'],,,,,,,,,,,,

MLL-AF9 and other MLL fusion proteins aberrantly recruit epigenetic regulatory proteins, including histone deacetylases (HDAC), histone methyltransferases, bromodomain-containing proteins, and transcription elongation factors to mediate chromatin remodeling and regulate tumorigenic gene expression programs. We conducted a small-molecule inhibitor screen to test the ability of candidate pharmacologic agents targeting epigenetic and transcriptional regulatory proteins to induce apoptosis in leukemic cells derived from genetically engineered mouse models of MLL-AF9-driven acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We found that the CDK inhibitor dinaciclib and HDAC inhibitor panobinostat were the most potent inducers of apoptosis in short-term in vitro assays. Treatment of MLL-rearranged leukemic cells with dinaciclib resulted in rapidly decreased expression of the prosurvival protein Mcl-1, and accordingly, overexpression of Mcl-1 protected AML cells from dinaciclib-induced apoptosis. Administration of dinaciclib to mice bearing MLL-AF9-driven human and mouse leukemias elicited potent antitumor responses and significantly prolonged survival. Collectively, these studies highlight a new therapeutic approach to potentially overcome the resistance of MLL-rearranged AML to conventional chemotherapies and prompt further clinical evaluation of CDK inhibitors in AML patients harboring MLL fusion proteins.",,,['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we describe identification of a potent Shp2 inhibitor, Fumosorinone (Fumos) from entomogenous fungi, which shows selective inhibition of Shp2 over other tested PTPs. Using a surface plasmon resonance analysis, we further confirmed the physical interaction between Shp2 and Fumos. Fumos inhibits Shp2-dependent activation of the Ras/ERK signal pathway downstream of EGFR, and interrupts EGF-induced Gab1-Shp2 association. As expected, Fumos shows little effects on the Shp2-independent ERK1/2 activation induced by PMA or oncogenic Ras. Furthermore, Fumos down-regulates Src activation, inhibits phosphorylation of Paxillin and prevents tumor cell invasion. These results suggest that Fumos can inhibit Shp2-dependent cell signaling in human cells and has a potential for treatment of Shp2-associated diseases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrate that the AML maintenance function of BRD4 requires its interaction with NSD3, which belongs to a subfamily of H3K36 methyltransferases. Unexpectedly, AML cells were found to only require a short isoform of NSD3 that lacks the methyltransferase domain. We show that NSD3-short is an adaptor protein that sustains leukemia by linking BRD4 to the CHD8 chromatin remodeler, by using a PWWP chromatin reader module, and by employing an acidic transactivation domain. Genetic targeting of NSD3 or CHD8 mimics the phenotypic and transcriptional effects of BRD4 inhibition. Furthermore, BRD4, NSD3, and CHD8 colocalize across the AML genome, and each is released from super-enhancer regions upon chemical inhibition of BET bromodomains. These findings suggest that BET inhibitors exert therapeutic effects in leukemia by evicting BRD4-NSD3-CHD8 complexes from chromatin to suppress transcription.",,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Our research group has previously demonstrated the potential anti-cancer benefits of several natural health products (NHPs), prompting further studies into other NHPs, such as Neem (Azadarichta indica), a tree native to India and has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for over 4000 years. The objective of this study is to determine the possible anti-cancer potential of aqueous and ethanolic Neem leaf extracts (NLEs) and to identify the specific mode(s) of action. METHODS: Cells were treated with NLE and cell viability was then assessed using a water-soluble tetrazolium salt. Cell death was confirmed using the fluorescent dye propidium iodide and apoptosis was identified using the Annexin-V binding assay. Mitochondrial membrane permeabilization was visualized using JC-1 staining and the production of whole cell and mitochondrial ROS was measured with 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) and Amplex Red, respectively. In vivo efficacy of aqueous NLE was assessed in human tumour xenografts in CD-1 nu/nu immunocompromised mice. RESULTS: Results indicate that both ethanolic and aqueous extracts of Neem leaf were effective in inducing apoptosis in leukemia and colon cancer cells, following destabilization of the mitochondrial membrane. Furthermore, an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed in cancer cells treated with NLEs, indicating that oxidative stress may play a role in the mechanism of cell death. Additionally, in vivo results showed that aqueous NLE (delivered orally) was well tolerated and inhibited tumour growth of human xenografts in mice. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the potential of NLEs as safer and effective alternatives to conventional chemotherapy. This article is open to POST-PUBLICATION REVIEW.

Cancer patients self-medicate to relieve the side effects associated with chemotherapy, improve disease outcome and to regain control of their medical care. However, there is limited empirical evidence on potential drug-nutraceutical interactions and their resulting effect on chemotherapy efficacy. METHOD: To investigate drug-nutraceutical interactions we created and screened a library of commonly used nutraceuticals for their modulatory effects on the activity of cytarabine and daunorubicin, two primary chemotherapeutics used to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Combination screening was performed in 3 AML cell lines (OCI-AML2, KG1a and U937) using the MTS viability assay. Lead compounds were validated using with the Annexin V/ Propidium iodide assay and CalcuSyn drug combination software. RESULTS: We identified zinc as a nutraceutical that enhanced AML chemotherapy efficacy with combination index (CI) values of 0.649, 0.632 and 0.615 at EC 25, 50 and 75, respectively; CI values <0.9, >1.1 or between 0.9-1.1 denote statistical synergy, antagonism or additivity, respectively. In contrast, we show that echinacea hindered AML chemotherapy efficacy by significantly reducing the ability of cytarabine to induce cell death. CONCLUSION: Given the positive and negative effects of nutraceuticals, patients undergoing chemotherapy must consult with their oncologist before consuming over-the-counter supplements.

Here we show that H3.3 is a dynamic determinant of functional properties in adult GBM. H3.3 is repressed by mixed lineage leukemia 5 (MLL5) in self-renewing GBM cells. MLL5 is a global epigenetic repressor that orchestrates reorganization of chromatin structure by punctuating chromosomes with foci of compacted chromatin, favoring tumorigenic and self-renewing properties. Conversely, H3.3 antagonizes self-renewal and promotes differentiation. We exploited these epigenetic states to rationally identify two small molecules that effectively curb cancer stem cell properties in a preclinical model.

Nano-carriers of drugs show great potential for such task due to their capability of accumulating and releasing their payload specifically, at the tumor site. RESULTS: FLT3 inhibitor - gold nanoparticle conjugates were fabricated to serve as vehicles for the delivery of anti-tumor drugs. Lestaurtinib, midostaurin, sorafenib, and quizartinib were selected among the FLT3 inhibitor drugs that are currently used in clinics for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. The drugs were loaded onto nanoparticle surface using a conjugation strategy based on hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions with the Pluronic co-polymer used as nanoparticle surface coating. Optical absorption characterization of the particles in solution showed that FLT3 inhibitor-incorporated gold nanoparticles were uniformly distributed and chemically stable regardless of the drug content. Drug loading study revealed a high drug content in the case of midostaurin drug which also showed increased stability. Drug release test in simulated cancer cell conditions demonstrated more than 56 % release of the entrapped drug, a result that correlates well with the superior cytotoxicity of the nano-conjugates comparatively with the free drug. CONCLUSIONS: This is a pioneering study regarding the efficient loading of gold nanoparticles with selected FLT3 inhibitors. In vitro cytotoxicity assessment shows that FLT3-incorporated gold nanoparticles are promising candidates as vehicles for anti-tumor drugs and demonstrate superior therapeutic effect comparatively with the bare drugs.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Drug-loaded gold nanoparticles', 'FLT3 inhibitors', 'Pluronic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mean S-phase fraction was 2.6%, with 24/40 (60%) having low and 16/40 (40%) high S-phase fractions. No correlation was noted with standard ALL risk and treatment response factors with DI values or S-phase data, except for a positive correlation of low S-phase with high NCI risk category (p=0.032). Overall frequency of hyperdiploidy in our cohort of B-ALL patients was very high (65%). No correlation between hyperdiploidy B and low TLC or common B-phenotype was observed in our study as 42% cases with DI 1.10-1.6 had TLC> 50 x 109 and 57.1% CD 10 negativity. The study also highlighted that S-phase fraction analysis does not add any prognostic information and is not a useful parameter for assessment in ALL cases. However, larger studies with long term outcome analysis are needed to derive definitive conclusions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, data from Pakistan are scarce. Therefore we reviewed the demographic and clinical profile along with risk stratification of APL patients at our center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this descriptive cross sectional study, 26 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia were enrolled from January 2011 to June 2015. Data were analyzed with SPSS version 22. RESULTS: The mean age was 31.8 +/- 1.68 years with a median of 32 years. The female to male ratio was 2:1.2. The majority of our patients had hypergranular variant (65.4%) rather than the microgranular type. The major complaints were bleeding (80.7%), fever (76.9%), generalized weakness (30.7%) and dyspnea (15.38%). Physical examination revealed petechial rashes as a predominant finding detected in 61.5% followed by pallor in 30.8%. The mean hemoglobin was 8.04 +/- 2.29 g/dl with the mean MCV of 84.7 +/- 7.72 fl. The mean total leukocyte count of 5.44 +/- 7.62 x 10(9)/l; ANC of 1.08 +/- 2.98 x 10(9)/l and mean platelets count were 38.84 +/- 5.38 x 10(9)/l. According to risk stratification, 15.3% were in high, 65.4% in intermediate and 19.2% in low risk groups. CONCLUSIONS: Clinico-epidemiological features of APL in Pakistani patients appear comparable to published data. Haemorrhagic diathesis is the commonest presentation. Risk stratification revealed predominance of intermediate risk disease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BAALC and ERG expression was detected in the bone marrow of both patients and controls using real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: BAALC and ERG expression was detected in 52% of cases but not in any controls. There was a statistically significant correlation between BAALC and ERG gene expression and age (p- value=0.004 and 0.019, respectively). No statistical significance was noted for sex, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, other hematological findings, immunophenotyping and FAB sub-classification except for ERG gene and FAB (p-value=0.058).

The present study was a retrospective analysis of chronic phase CML patients registered to a Hematology Clinic in Kermanshah, Iran, with checking of treatment options. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2002 and 2014, 85 CML patients referred to our hematology clinic were enrolled in our study. We surveyed age, sex, B-symptoms, splenomegaly, Sokal score, Hasford score, treatment and survival in all patients. Philadelphia chromosome analysis was conducted for each patient by conventional cytogenetics. We compared treatment in the patients with three drugs, imatinib, hydroxyurea (HU) and interferon alpha (IFN-alpha). RESULTS: The mean age of the patients at diagnosis was 47.5 +/- 14.5 years (range, 23-82 years), with 43 (50.6%) being male. Some 13 (15.3%) were referred to our clinic for the first time with B-symptoms and 44 patients (51.8%) had splenomegaly. The Sokal score for 77 (90.6%) was low, 4 (4.7%) was intermediate and 4(4.7%) was high, but Hasford (Euro) scores for all patients were low. The 5-year survival rate for treated patients with imatinib, imatinib plus HU and imatinib plus HU plus IFN-alpha was 90.5%, 81.1% and 55.6%, respectively CONCLUSIONS: The results show that imatinib therapy alone provides better survival in CML patients compared to HU or IFN-alpha.

ETV6-RUNX1 positive pALL patients have good prognosis as compared to ETV6-RUNX1 negative counterparts. Therefore, frequencies of these two patient groups have a huge consideration in treatment strategies of pALL in a given population. Different geographical locations have been reported to have different frequencies of ETV6-RUNX1 ranging from 10% in Southeast Asia to 30% in Australia. AIM: Therefore, the objective of this study was to establish the ETV6-RUNX1 status of Saudi Arabian pALL patients and its association with clinical parameters and early remission. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical parameters and ETV6-RUNX1 status (using FISH technique) of pALL patients attending the Pediatric Oncology Clinic, King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh from 2006 to 2011 were studied. Comparisons between ETV6-RUNX1 positive and negative groups were accomplished using chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). RESULTS: Out of 54 patients, 33 were male and 21 were females (ratio 1.57:1). B- and T-cell lineages were found in 47 (87%) and 7 (13%) patients respectively. Only 5 (9.3%) patients were ETV6-RUNX1 positive while 49(80.7%) were ETV6-RUNX1 negative. All ETV6-RUNX1 patients (100%) were of B-cell lineage and 80% (4/5) were in the 3-7 year age group. None of the ETV6-RUNX11 patients had >/= 5% blasts (no remission) at day 14 as compared with 9% in the ETV6-RUNX1 negative group (Figure 1). CONCLUSIONS: Frequency of ETV6-RUNX1 positive patients (less than 10%) in our pALL patients is much lower than reported for most European countries, North America, Australia and Japan while it is in accordance with ETV6-RUNX1 frequencies from Egypt (11.6%), Pakistan (10%), Spain (2%) and India (5-7%). This shows ethnic differences in genetics of pALL as well as higher frequencies of ETV6-RUNX1 positive pALL mostly in more industrialized countries, probably due to some industrial pollutants or westernized lifestyle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2014 Feb 16.,"BACKGROUND: Antibiotic exposure is common among children with leukemia. However, limited data exist regarding the risk of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) across anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam antibiotics commonly used for fever and neutropenia. METHODS: A multicenter cohort of children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was established from 43 freestanding children's hospitals from 1999 to 2009. Patients were followed until their index CDI event, defined by the CDI ICD-9 code plus a C difficile test charge, or until 180 days from ALL diagnosis. Cox proportional hazards models were performed to identify the hazards of CDI after exposure to anti-pseudomonal beta-lactams, adjusting for demographics, other antibiotic exposures, severity of illness, antacids, gastrointestinal manipulation, and confounding by hospital. RESULTS: A cohort of 8268 ALL patients was assembled; median age was 5.5 years (interquartile range, 3.26-10.58). Two-hundred sixty-eight (3.2%) patients developed CDI within 180 days of ALL diagnosis. Each 1-day increase in exposure to an anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam within the prior 30 days was associated with a significantly increased risk for CDI (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01, 1.09). Ceftazidime (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02, 1.08) and cefepime (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02, 1.12) were each independently associated with CDI. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to reduce total exposure to anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam agents may help to reduce the risk of CDI in children with newly diagnosed ALL. Cefepime and ceftazidime were independently associated with CDI, whereas anti-pseudomonal penicillins and carbapenems were not. These findings, if confirmed, have potential implications for antibiotic choice during periods of fever and neutropenia.",['NOTNLM'],"['Clostridium difficile', 'leukemia', 'pediatrics.']","['(c) The Author 2014.

Epub 2014 Jan 15.,"BACKGROUND: The risk of second bacteremia during antibiotic treatment for initial bacteremia is unknown in high-risk populations. Our objectives were to describe the prevalence of second bacteremia during treatment and identify risk factors in children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study that included children and adolescents with de novo, non-M3 AML who were diagnosed and treated between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2004 at 15 Canadian centers. Patients were monitored for bacteremia during chemotherapy until completion of treatment, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, relapse, refractory disease, or death. RESULTS: There were 290 episodes of bacteremia occurring in 185 (54.3%) of 341 children. Eighteen (6.2%) had a second bacteremia while receiving antibiotic treatment. Two episodes of second bacteremia were complicated by sepsis; there were no infection-related deaths. Eleven episodes (61.1%) had either an initial Gram-positive and subsequent Gram-negative bacteremia or initial Gram-negative followed by Gram-positive bacteremia. Days receiving corticosteroids (odds ratio [OR], 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.12; P < .0001), cumulative dose of corticosteroids (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00-1.08; P = .035), and days of neutropenia from start of course to initial bacteremia (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.12; P = .007) were significantly associated with second bacteremia. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric AML, 6% of patients will experience a second bacteremia during antibiotic treatment; duration of corticosteroid exposure and neutropenia are risk factors. These patients remain at high risk for second bacteremia after identification of the initial bacteremia and warrant continued broad-spectrum treatment during profound neutropenia.",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'children', 'infection', 'neutropenia', 'second bacteremia']","['(c) The Author 2014.

Therefore there is need to improve AML treatment. The overexpression of the BCL-2 family anti-apoptotic members, like BCL-2 or BCL-xL has been largely reported in lymphoid tumors but also in AML and other tumors. To counteract the anti-apoptotic effect of BCL-2, BH3 mimetics have been developed to target cancer cells. An increase in activity of ERK1/2 mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase has also been reported in AML and might be targeted by MEK1/2 inhibitors. Hence, in the current work, we investigated whether the association of a BH3 mimetic such ABT-263 and the MEK1/2 inhibitor pimasertib (MEKI), was efficient to target AML cells. A synergistic increasing of apoptosis was observed in AML cell lines and in primary cells without affecting normal bone marrow cells. Such cooperation was confirmed on tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model of AML. In addition we demonstrated that MEKI sensitized the cells to apoptosis through its ability to promote a G1 cell cycle arrest. So, this combination of a MAP Kinase pathway inhibitor and a BH3 mimetic could be a promising strategy to improve the treatment of AML.",['NOTNLM'],"['BH3 mimetic drugs', 'MEK inhibitors', 'acute myeloid leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We uncovered that MLL, EP400, PRDM2, ANK3 and CHD5 exclusively altered in recurrent BCs. Specifically, the recurrent BCs and bladder cancer cells with MLL mutation displayed increased histone H3 tri-methyl K4 (H3K4me3) modification in tissue and cell levels and showed enhanced expression of GATA4 and ETS1 downstream. What's more, MLL mutated bladder cancer cells obtained with CRISPR/Cas9 showed increased ability of drug-resistance to epirubicin (a chemotherapy drug for bladder cancer) than wild type cells. Additionally, the BC patients with high expression of GATA4 and ETS1 significantly displayed shorter lifespan than patients with low expression.

The role of glutamine in fueling the tricarboxylic acid cycle of leukemia cells was however recently identified confirming its status of major anaplerotic precursor in solid tumors. Here we examined whether glutamine metabolism could represent a therapeutic target in leukemia cells and whether resistance to this strategy could arise. We found that glutamine deprivation inhibited leukemia cell growth but also led to a glucose-independent adaptation maintaining cell survival. A proteomic study revealed that glutamine withdrawal induced the upregulation of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) and phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT), two enzymes of the serine pathway. We further documented that both exogenous and endogenous serine were critical for leukemia cell growth and contributed to cell regrowth following glutamine deprivation. Increase in oxidative stress upon inhibition of glutamine metabolism was identified as the trigger of the upregulation of PHGDH. Finally, we showed that PHGDH silencing in vitro and the use of serine-free diet in vivo inhibited leukemia cell growth, an effect further increased when glutamine metabolism was blocked. In conclusion, this study identified serine as a key pro-survival actor that needs to be handled to sensitize leukemia cells to glutamine-targeting modalities.",['NOTNLM'],"['PHGDH', 'glutamine', 'leukemia', 'metabolism', 'serine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In ATL patient samples, the tumor suppressor, p53, is infrequently mutated; however, it has been shown to be inactivated by the viral protein, Tax. Here, we show that another HTLV-1 protein, HBZ, represses p53 activity. In HCT116 p53+/+ cells treated with the DNA-damaging agent, etoposide, HBZ reduced p53-mediated activation of p21/CDKN1A and GADD45A expression, which was associated with a delay in G2 phase-arrest. These effects were attributed to direct inhibition of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of p300/CBP by HBZ, causing a reduction in p53 acetylation, which has be linked to decreased p53 activity. In addition, HBZ bound to, and inhibited the HAT activity of HBO1. Although HBO1 did not acetylate p53, it acted as a coactivator for p53 at the p21/CDKN1A promoter. Therefore, through interactions with two separate HAT proteins, HBZ impairs the ability of p53 to activate transcription. This mechanism may explain how p53 activity is restricted in ATL cells that do not express Tax due to modifications of the HTLV-1 provirus, which accounts for a majority of patient samples.",['NOTNLM'],"['HBZ', 'adult T-cell leukemia', 'histone acetyl transferase activity', 'human T-cell leukemia virus type-1', 'p53']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the reported expression and constitutive activation of BTK in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, there has been recent interest in investigating the anti-AML activity of ibrutinib. We noted that ibrutinib had limited single-agent toxicity in a panel of AML cell lines and primary AML samples, and therefore sought to identify ibrutinib-sensitizing drugs. Using a high-throughput combination chemical screen, we identified that the poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) inhibitor ethacridine lactate synergized with ibrutinib in TEX and OCI-AML2 leukemia cell lines. The combination of ibrutinib and ethacridine induced a synergistic increase in reactive oxygen species that was functionally important to explain the observed cell death. Interestingly, synergistic cytotoxicity of ibrutinib and ethacridine was independent of the inhibitory effect of ibrutinib against BTK, as knockdown of BTK did not sensitize TEX and OCI-AML2 cells to ethacridine treatment. Thus, our findings indicate that ibrutinib may have a BTK-independent role in AML and that PARG inhibitors may have utility as part of a combination therapy for this disease.",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'BTK', 'PARG', 'ethacridine lactate', 'ibrutinib']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to correct the ASXL1 homozygous nonsense mutation present in the CML cell line KBM5, which lacks ASXL1 protein expression. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ASXL1 homozygous correction resulted in protein re-expression with restored normal function, including down-regulation of Polycomb repressive complex 2 target genes. Significantly reduced cell growth and increased myeloid differentiation were observed in ASXL1 mutation-corrected cells, providing new insights into the role of ASXL1 in human myeloid cell differentiation. Mice xenografted with mutation-corrected KBM5 cells showed significantly longer survival than uncorrected xenografts.

Epub 2015 Jul 21.,"Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine; DAC) is a well-tolerated alternative to aggressive chemotherapy for leukemia, which induces differentiation and apoptosis of leukemic cells as a DNA hypomethylating agent. The aim of the present study was to investigate the feasibility of DAC sequentially combined with chemotherapy to reverse drug resistance. HL-60/ADR multidrug-resistant leukemia cells cultured in 96-well plates were pretreated with DAC for 72 h; varying concentrations of aclacinomycin (ACLA) were then added to the wells, cell proliferation was tested using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) protein expression was detected by western blot analysis. Furthermore, we analyzed the therapeutic efficacy in 7 patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) receiving induction therapy with DAC sequentially combined with cytarabine, ACLA and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (CAG regimen). The proliferation inhibition rate of HL-60/ADR cells treated with DAC at concentrations of 0.5 and 1.0 micromol/l sequentially combined with ACLA was significantly higher compared with that with ACLA alone (P<0.001 for both). DNMT1 expression was significantly repressed following treatment with 1.0 micromol/l DAC. Of the 11 patients, 8 (72.7%) received induction therapy with DAC sequentially combined with CAG agents and achieved complete remission (CR) after 2 cycles of treatment; however, 3 (27.3%) patients did not achieve remission. Myelosuppression was observed in all 11 patients and pulmonary infections developed in 9 patients (81.8%) during the course of the study. At the last follow-up, 7 of the 8 patients who achieved CR remained in remission. The median follow-up was 6 months (range, 3-18 months). Therefore, pretreatment with DAC may increase the sensitivity of HL-60/ADR cells to ACLA via the epigenetic modulation of demethylation and the sequential administration of DAC and CAG regimen appears to be safe and effective for the treatment of patients with high-risk AML.",['NOTNLM'],"['CAG regimen', 'HL-60/ADR cells', 'decitabine', 'high-risk acute myeloid leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study aimed to investigate the pattern of HOTAIR expression in AML and to evaluate its clinical significance in tumor progression. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to examine the HOTAIR expression in mononuclear cells from the bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood specimens of 85 patients with newly diagnosed AML. The association of HOTAIR expression with the clinicopathological factors and prognosis of AML patients was statistically analyzed. The expression of HOTAIR was significantly upregulated in the AML patients compared with the healthy controls (mean expression value, 3.87+/-0.29 vs. 1.28+/-0.09; P<0.001), and markedly decreased in the patients post-treatment compared with pre-treatment (4.76+/-0.47 vs. 2.81+/-0.27; P<0.001). Moreover, high levels of HOTAIR were associated with higher white blood cell and BM blast counts (P<0.001 and P=0.001, respectively), and lower hemoglobin and platelet counts (P=0.007 and 0.001, respectively). Patients with a high level of HOTAIR expression had relatively poor overall survival (OS; 20.5 vs. 32.1 months, P=0.001) and relapse-free survival (21.5 vs. 33.6 months, P=0.001) times compared with those with a low level of HOTAIR expression.

In order to explore this question, 25 patients with CML with normal platelet counts (CML-N), 40 patients with CML with elevated platelet counts (CML-E) and 33 healthy adults were recruited. The association of platelet count with mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet large cell ratio (P-LCR) and platelet distribution width (PDW) was examined. Bone marrow smears were also reviewed to assess the proliferation and abnormal lobation of megakaryocytes. The results showed that the two CML groups exhibited higher MPV, P-LCR and PDW values than those of the controls (P<0.05). Furthermore, the CML-N group was more heterogeneous in terms of thrombopoiesis than the CML-E group, as demonstrated by a higher PDW (P<0.05) and higher ratio of multinucleated dysmegakaryocytes (12.17 vs. 4.69%; chi(2)=29.79; P=0.000). In addition, no correlation between platelet count and MPV, P-LCR or PDW was observed in the CML-N group (r=-0.102, -0.051 and -0.049, and P=0.619, 0.828 and 0.810, respectively).

The expression levels of AnxA6 are closely associated with melanoma, cervical cancer, epithelial carcinoma, breast cancer, gastric cancer, prostate cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, large-cell lymphoma and myeloma. AnxA6 exhibits dual functions in cancer, acting either as a tumor suppressor or promoter, depending on the type of cancer and the degree of malignancy. In several types of cancer, AnxA6 acts via Ras, Ras/MAPK and/or FAK/PI3K signaling pathways by mainly mediating PKCalpha, p120GAP, Bcr-Abl and YY1.

Accumulating evidence has indicated that PU.1 plays a key role in hematopoiesis, and reduced expression of PU.1 leads to the pathogenesis of human myeloid leukemia. As a multi-functional factor, PU.1 is also required for mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) stem cell potential and the development of MLL. However, the function of PU.1 in human non-MLL leukemia and its molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. In the present study, PU.1 siRNA was demonstrated to efficiently inhibit the transcription level of oncogene MEIS1 in the human acute myeloid non-MLL leukemia U937 cell line. In addition, PU.1, as a positive regulator of MEIS1, performed a crucial role in maintaining cell proliferation. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and luciferase reporter assay, previously unexplored evidence that PU.1 activated the MEIS1 promoter through a conserved binding motif in vitro and in vivo was further defined. Overall, the present study provides insight into the molecular mechanism of the contribution of PU.1 to the pathogenesis of non-MLL U937 cells, which is mediated by direct regulation of MEIS1 transcription. The present data reveal the possibility of developing an alternative therapy for non-MLL leukemia by targeting PU.1-mediated MEIS1 gene activation.",['NOTNLM'],"['MEIS1', 'PU.1', 'leukemia', 'transcription']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It predominantly affects the elderly, with a predilection for the sun-exposed skin of the head and neck. Risk factors include immune-suppressing diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma, organ transplantation, and the presence of the newly-identified Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV). Diagnosis is based on pathological findings, primarily the immunohistochemical determination of cytokeratin 20 positivity. By contrast, staging relies on conventional imaging methods, such as ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine techniques, such as sentinel lymph node scintigraphy, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS), and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) or alternative radiopharmaceuticals. The treatment of MCC is primarily surgical, with possible adjuvant radiation, while the use of chemotherapy appears to be an alternative therapeutic option that is used only in specific cases. The present study describes the case of a 43-year-old HIV-positive Caucasian man with MCC located on the posterior surface of the left thigh, which was identified by cytological and histological examination of tissue sampled by fine needle aspiration and biopsy performed under CT. SRS demonstrated a high uptake of (111)In-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid-octreotide at the affected site. Therefore, the lesion was surgically excised, and the patient received chemotherapy and adjuvant radiotherapy. Three months subsequent to treatment, the patient underwent a PET/CT scan with (18)F-FDG that demonstrated uptake in the cervical lymph nodes and the area of the excised lesion. These findings indicated that the disease was in remission. The aim of the present study was to highlight the value and contribution of nuclear medicine in the diagnosis, staging and follow-up, using PET/CT, octreoscan and sentinel lymph node scintigraphy, of patients with MCC, as well as the therapeutic strategy of radiolabelled somatostatin analogue scintigraphy.",['NOTNLM'],"['merkel cell carcinoma', 'nuclear medicine', 'positron emission tomography-computed tomography', 'sentinel lymph node scintigraphy', 'somatostatin receptor scintigraphy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Western blotting was also used to assess SHP2 expression in thyroid cancer cell lines (SW579, IHH-4, FTC-133, TPC-1, DRO, TA-K, and ML-1) and Nthy-ori3-1 normal thyroid cells. In addition, SHP2 antisense oligonucleotides were used to block SHP2 expression in SW579 cells, and growth inhibition assays were conducted. Increased SHP2 expression was detected in the tumour tissues compared with that of the normal thyroid tissues (P<0.05). SHP2 expression was significantly correlated with poor tumour differentiation (P<0.05), late TNM stage (P<0.05) and lymph node metastasis (P<0.05), suggesting that SHP2 may represent a potential target for thyroid cancer therapy.",['NOTNLM'],"['SHP2', 'expression', 'thyroid cancer', 'tumour proliferation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In total, 31 patients with refractory APL were administered with CRNIT treatment alternately with chemotherapy. The complete remission (CR) and relapse rates were estimated by bone marrow (BM) examination. The expression of the promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARalpha) fusion protein and the apoptosis rate in the retinoic acid (RA)-resistant NB4-R1 cell line administered with CRNIT treatment in vitro were measured by western blot analysis and flow cytometry, respectively. The patients were followed up for 12-60 months, with a median follow-up time of 43 months. The total continuous CR rate was 90.32% (28/31), and the duration of response was between 10.3 and 60 months (median, 42.4 months). The total relapse rate was 9.68% (3/31), and the median time of relapse was 13 months (range, 8-27 months). During the treatment with CRNITs, there was no evident BM depression and only limited side-effects were experienced. Additionally, in vitro cell molecular biology results revealed that CRNIT treatment resulted in a marked induction of apoptosis and degradation of the PML-RARalpha fusion protein. The present results revealed that CRNIT treatment in combination with chemotherapy is an effective and feasible therapy for the treatment of patients with refractory APL.",['NOTNLM'],"['PML-RARalpha', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'chemotherapy', 'compound realgar natural indigo tablets']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By contrast, the cytotoxicity of bifunctional alkylators, including carmustine (BCNU) and melphalan (MEL), depends on interstrand crosslinks formed through O(6)-alkylguanine, which is repaired by nucleotide excision repair and recombination. O(6)-alkylguanine is removed by O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of TMZ, BCNU and MEL in two different leukemic cell lines (HL-60 and MOLT-4) in the context of DNA repair. The transcript levels of MGMT, ERCC1, hMLH1 and hMSH2 were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, the proliferation was measured using the trypan blue exclusion assay. Drug sensitivity was found to vary between the two cell lines. Treatment of the cells with TMZ, BCNU or MEL in combination with O(6)-benzylguanine, an MGMT inhibitor, was demonstrated to sensitize the two cell lines to these agents. However, the extent of sensitization was not found to be correlated with the expression levels of MGMT transcripts. Furthermore, the drug sensitivity was also not associated with the transcript levels of ERCC1, hMLH1 and hMSH2.

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been approved as a chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, and the combination of ATO and cisplatin has been revealed to demonstrate synergistic effects in ovarian and small cell lung cancer cells. Thus, it was hypothesized that ATO may also be active against cisplatin-resistant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) PC-9/CDDP and PC-14/CDDP cells. The present study also evaluated the effects of ATO on the cisplatin-sensitive NSCLC PC-9 and PC-14 cell lines. Notably, ATO demonstrated a markedly decreased IC50 in the cisplatin-resistant PC-9/CDDP and PC-14/CDDP cells compared with the IC50 in the cisplatin-sensitive parental PC-9 and PC-14 cells. Additionally, it was found that arsenite accumulation in the PC-9 cell line was affected through the downregulation of GS-X pump systems.

This rearrangement is referred to as the Philadelphia chromosome. At a molecular level, this translocation results in the formation of the BCR-ABL fusion oncogene, which translates into a BCR-ABL oncoprotein.

Thus, therapeutic strategies that focus on targeting Drp1 and its related signaling pathway pave a new way to address the ineffectiveness of traditional cancer therapies. Micheliolide (MCL), a guaianolide sesquiterpene lactone, can selectively eradicate acute myeloid leukemia stem or progenitor cells. But the effect of MCL on the mitochondrial dynamics of cancer cells is still not well demonstrated. In this study, we show that MCL inhibited the growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, accompanied by increased mitochondrial fission and upregulation of Drp1. The results obtained from overexpression experiments of wild or dominant-negative mutant type of Drp1 demonstrate that Drp1 is both necessary and sufficient to induce MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell death. Furthermore, mitochondrial membrane potential decreased, whereas reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, cytochrome c release, and PARP cleavage were enhanced after overexpression of Drp1 wild type. On the other hand, overexpression of Drp1-K38A (a dominant-negative mutant of Drp1) rescued cells from increased apoptosis, confirming the role of MCL-induced Drp1 in the observed apoptosis.

However, there is no consensus concerning the optimal consolidation and maintenance therapies after induction therapy. In this study, we explored a new therapeutic strategy for APL that may be simple, effective, and safe. METHODS: The patients in our study were divided into high white blood cell (WBC) group and low WBC group according to the numeration of leukocytes at the first visit. The low WBC group received ATRA and ATO until complete remission (CR), and the high WBC group received anthracycline, ATRA, and ATO until CR. After achieving hematologic CR, ATO was alternated with chemotherapy for consolidation therapy. Three cycles were completed in the 1st year with no maintenance therapy. The patients were followed for a median of 5 years after their initial treatment. RESULTS: After induction therapy, the rate of CR for the 18 patients was 100%. The rate of negativity for the PML/RARalpha fusion gene following induction therapy was 100%. There was no mortality during the treatment. Both the 5-year event-free survival rate and 5-year overall survival rate were 100%. No relapses occurred during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: This study proposes a novel treatment for APL that is efficient, well-tolerated, and very simple to perform.",['NOTNLM'],"['acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'all-trans retinoic acid', 'arsenic trioxide', 'consolidation therapy', 'new therapeutic strategy', 'survival']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, RNA sequencing, splice isoform-specific quantitative RT-PCR, lentiviral transduction, and in vivo humanized mouse model studies demonstrated that malignant reprogramming of progenitors into self-renewing blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia stem cells (BC LSCs) was partially driven by decreased MBNL3. Lentiviral knockdown of MBNL3 resulted in reversion to an embryonic alternative splice isoform program typified by overexpression of CD44 transcript variant 3, containing variant exons 8-10, and BC LSC proliferation. Although isoform-specific lentiviral CD44v3 overexpression enhanced chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) progenitor replating capacity, lentiviral shRNA knockdown abrogated these effects. Combined treatment with a humanized pan-CD44 monoclonal antibody and a breakpoint cluster region - ABL proto-oncogene 1, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (BCR-ABL1) antagonist inhibited LSC maintenance in a niche-dependent manner. In summary, MBNL3 down-regulation-related reversion to an embryonic alternative splicing program, typified by CD44v3 overexpression, represents a previously unidentified mechanism governing malignant progenitor reprogramming in malignant microenvironments and provides a pivotal opportunity for selective BC LSC detection and therapeutic elimination.",['NOTNLM'],"['CD44v3', 'MBNL3', 'RNA splicing', 'adhesion molecules', 'self-renewal']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematological malignancies in pregnant women are rare, but the attending physicians should be aware that the use of cytotoxic drugs, tyrosine-kinase inhibitors or differentiating agents such as all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) during the first trimester of pregnancy might be teratogenic and, in turn, induce fetal abnormalities or abortion. Thus, in pregnant patients with either acute or chronic leukemia presenting with symptomatic hyperleukocytosis, leukocytapheresis (LA) could be considered as a bridge therapeutic option. Furthermore, sickle cell disease (SCD) in pregnant women is usually managed only with supportive care, i.e. packed red blood cell (RBC) transfusion to prevent excessive hemoglobin decrease, hydration and prevention of acute sickling crisis. Nevertheless, selected patients at high risk for placental detachment due to vasoocclusive acute crisis or with multiple pregnancies may benefit from prophylactic erythrocyte exchange (EEX). Both LA and EEX must be carried out by well trained personnel and the patients (and the fetus) must be under close clinical and instrumental monitoring.

The current study examined whether resveratrol suppressed the production of inflammatory Th2 cytokines in cultured rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells. Cells pre-treated with resveratrol nontoxic at 1-25 muM were sensitized with anti-dinitrophenyl (anti-DNP), and subsequently stimulated by dinitrophenyl-human serum albumin (DNP-HSA) antigen. Resveratrol dose-dependently diminished the secretion of interleukin (IL)-3, IL-4, IL-13 as well as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha by the antigen stimulation from sensitized cells. It was found that resveratrol mitigated the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK elevated in mast cells exposed to Fc epsilon receptor I (FcepsilonRI)-mediated immunoglobulin E (IgE)-antigen complex. The FcepsilonRI aggregation was highly enhanced on the surface of mast cells following the HSA stimulation, which was retarded by treatment with 1-25 muM resveratrol. The IgE-receptor engagement rapidly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Src-related focal adhesion protein paxillin involved in the cytoskeleton rearrangement. The FcepsilonRI-mediated rapid activation of c-Src and paxillin was attenuated in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the paxillin activation entailed p38 MAPK and ERK-responsive signaling, but the JNK activation was less involved. Consistently, oral administration of resveratrol reduced the tissue level of phosphorylated paxillin in the dorsal skin of DNP-HSA-challenged mice. The other tyrosine kinase Tyk2-STAT1 signaling was activated in the dorsal epidermis of antigen-exposed mice, which was associated with allergic inflammation.

We studied the presence of BCL2, BCL6 and MYC breaks by fluorescence in situ hybridization and the expression of BCL2, MUM1, CD10, P53 and Ki67 in large clinical trial cohorts of 540 advanced-stage FL cases and 116 early-stage disease FL patients treated with chemotherapy regimens and radiation, respectively. A total of 86% and 53% of advanced- and early-stage FLs were BCL2-breakpoint-positive, respectively. BCL2 was expressed in almost all FLs with BCL2 break and also in 86% and 69% of BCL2-breakpoint-negative advanced- and early-stage FLs, respectively. CD10 expression was significantly reduced in BCL2-breakpoint-negative FLs of all stages and MUM1 and Ki67 expression were significantly increased in BCL2-break-negative early-stage FLs. Patient characteristics did not differ between FLs with and without BCL2 breaks and neither did survival times in advanced-stage FLs.

Epub 2015 Dec 1.,"Natural killer (NK) cells are key components of the innate immune system, providing potent antitumor immunity. Here, we show that the tumor growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)/SMAD signaling pathway is an important mechanism for NK cell immune evasion in childhood B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We characterized NK cells in 50 consecutive children with B-ALL at diagnosis, end induction and during maintenance therapy compared with age-matched controls. ALL-NK cells at diagnosis had an inhibitory phenotype associated with impaired function, most notably interferon-gamma production and cytotoxicity. By maintenance therapy, these phenotypic and functional abnormalities partially normalized; however, cytotoxicity against autologous blasts remained impaired. We identified ALL-derived TGF-beta1 to be an important mediator of leukemia-induced NK cell dysfunction. The TGF-beta/SMAD signaling pathway was constitutively activated in ALL-NK cells at diagnosis and end induction when compared with healthy controls and patients during maintenance therapy. Culture of ALL blasts with healthy NK cells induced NK dysfunction and an inhibitory phenotype, mediated by activation of the TGF-beta/SMAD signaling pathway, and abrogated by blocking TGF-beta. These data indicate that by regulating the TGF-beta/SMAD pathway, ALL blasts induce changes in NK cells to evade innate immune surveillance, thus highlighting the importance of developing novel therapies to target this inhibitory pathway and restore antileukemic cytotoxicity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have identified Metastasis suppressor 1 (Mtss1/MIM) to be downregulated in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from leukemic transgenic SCLtTA/Bcr-Abl mice and in patients with CML at diagnosis, and Mtss1 was restored when patients achieved complete remission. Forced expression of Mtss1 decreased clonogenic capacity and motility of murine myeloid progenitor cells and reduced tumor growth. Viral transduction of Mtss1 into lineage-depleted SCLtTA/Bcr-Abl bone marrow cells decreased leukemic cell burden in recipients, and leukemogenesis was reduced upon injection of Mtss1-overexpressing murine myeloid 32D cells. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy and reversion of Bcr-Abl expression increased Mtss1 expression but failed to restore it to control levels. CML patient samples revealed higher DNA methylation of specific Mtss1 promoter CpG sites that contain binding sites for Kaiso and Rest transcription factors. In summary, we identified a novel tumor suppressor in CML stem cells that is downregulated by both Bcr-Abl kinase-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Restored Mtss1 expression markedly inhibits primitive leukemic cell biology in vivo, providing a therapeutic rationale for the Bcr-Abl-Mtss1 axis to target TKI-resistant CML stem cells in patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These nanoparticles were formulated by micro-emulsion technique with 70% drug trap competence. AP9-cd-SLNs were regular, solid, globular particles in the range of 100-200 nm, which were confirmed by electron microscopic studies. Moreover, AP9-cd-SLNs were found to be stable for up to six months in terms of color, particle size, zeta potential, drug content and entrapment. AP9-cd-SLNs have 30-50% higher cytotoxic and apoptotic potential than the AP9-cd alone. The augmented anticancer potential of AP9-cd-SLNs was observed in cytotoxic IC50 value, apoptosis signaling cascade and in Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) model. AP9-cd-SLNs induce apoptosis in Molt-4 cells via both intrinsic and extrinsic pathway. Moreover, the dummy nanoparticles (SLNs without AP9-cd) did not have any cytotoxic effect in cancer as well as in normal cells. Consequently, SLNs of AP9-cd significantly augment the apoptotic and antitumor potential of AP9-cd. The present study provides a podium for ornamental the remedial latent via novel delivery systems like solid lipid nanoparticles.",['NOTNLM'],"['AP9-cd', 'Apoptosis', 'Cedrus deodara', 'Ehrlich ascites tumor', 'SLN']",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Epub 2015 Dec 1.,"Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease that is, in general, associated with a very poor prognosis. Multiple cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities that characterize different forms of AML have been used to better prognosticate patients and inform treatment decisions. Indeed, risk status in patients with this disease has classically been based on cytogenetic findings; however, additional molecular characteristics have been shown to inform risk assessment, including FLT3, NPM1, KIT, and CEBPA mutation status. Advances in sequencing technology have led to the discovery of novel somatic mutations in tissue samples from patients with AML, providing deeper insight into the mutational landscape of the disease. The majority of patients with AML (>97%) are found to have a clonal somatic abnormality on mutational profiling. Nevertheless, our understanding of the utility of mutation profiling in clinical practice remains incomplete and is continually evolving, and evidence-based approaches to application of these data are needed. In this Review, we discuss the evidence-base for integrating mutational data into treatment decisions for patients with AML, and propose novel therapeutic algorithms in the era of molecular medicine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 1.,"A fundamental goal of epidemiologic research is to investigate the relationship between exposures and disease risk. Cases of the disease are often considered a single outcome and assumed to share a common etiology. However, evidence indicates that many human diseases arise and evolve through a range of heterogeneous molecular pathologic processes, influenced by diverse exposures. Pathogenic heterogeneity has been considered in various neoplasms such as colorectal, lung, prostate, and breast cancers, leukemia and lymphoma, and non-neoplastic diseases, including obesity, type II diabetes, glaucoma, stroke, cardiovascular disease, autism, and autoimmune disease. In this article, we discuss analytic options for studying disease subtype heterogeneity, emphasizing methods for evaluating whether the association of a potential risk factor with disease varies by disease subtype. Methods are described for scenarios where disease subtypes are categorical and ordinal and for cohort studies, matched and unmatched case-control studies, and case-case study designs. For illustration, we apply the methods to a molecular pathological epidemiology study of alcohol intake and colon cancer risk by tumor LINE-1 methylation subtypes. User-friendly software to implement the methods is publicly available.",['NOTNLM'],"['heterogeneity test', 'molecular pathologic epidemiology', 'omics', 'pathogenesis', 'pathology']","['Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6907-0056'],,,,,,['2017/02/28 00:00'],,,,,,,

These cells are known as the cancer stem cells marked by the presence of surface biomarkers, multi-drug resistance pumps and deregulated self-renewal pathways (SRPs). They have a crucial role in provoking cancer cells leading to tumorigenesis and its progressive metastasis. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are much alike to normal stem cells in their self-renewal mechanisms. However, deregulations in the SRPs are seen in CSCs, making them resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic agents resulting in the tumor recurrence. Current treatment strategies in cancer fail to detect and differentiate the CSCs from their non-tumorigenic progenies owing to absence of specific biomarkers. Now, it has become imperative to understand complex functional biology of CSCs, especially the signaling pathways to design improved treatment strategies to target them. It is hopeful that the SRPs in CSCs offer a promising target to alter their survival strategies and impede their tumorigenic potential. However, there are many perils associated with the direct targeting method by conventional therapeutic agents such as off targets, poor bioavailability and poor cellular distribution. Recent evidences have shown an increased use of small molecule antagonists directly to target these SRPs may lead to severe side-effects. An alternative to solve these issues could be an appropriate nanoformulation. Nanoformulations of these molecules could provide an added advantage for the selective targeting of the pathways especially Hedgehog, Wnt, Notch and B-cell-specific moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 in the CSCs while sparing the normal stem cells. Hence, to achieve this goal a complete understanding of the molecular pathways corroborate with the use of holistic nanosystem (nanomaterial inhibition molecule) could possibly be an encouraging direction for future cancer therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A need for a rapid and sensitive diagnostic tool for early recognition of a zygomycetes fungus in clinical samples to the species level will lead to prompt and accurate therapy and the PathoChip provides one such platform. We utilized a pathogen array technology referred to as PathoChip, comprised of oligonucleotide probes that can detect all the sequenced viruses as well as known pathogenic bacteria, fungi and parasites and family-specific conserved probes, thus providing a means for detecting previously uncharacterized members of a family. We rapidly identified a zygomycetous fungus, Rhizomucor pusillus, an otherwise challenge for the clinical laboratories, predominantly in a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia.

A four-tube 10-color FCM panel used for diagnosis of acute leukemia (AL), showed cells in the blast gate (CD45dim/low SSC) and were positive for CD4(bright), CD33(dim), CD56(heterogenous), CD123(bright), CD36, CD38, HLA-DR, CD71. Seven patients received front-line induction therapy with HyperCVAD with an overall response rate of 86%. Five of six responders underwent planned allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). For a median follow up of 13.3 months, the 1-year disease free survival and overall survival were 56 and 67%, respectively. An accurate diagnosis of BPDCN can be made by 10-color FCM using a four-tube AL panel demonstrating a characteristic pattern of antigen expression. Front-line induction chemotherapy with HyperCVAD can yield high remission rates, but allo-HCT is required for long-term durable remissions.",,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 May 3.,"BACKGROUND: There is scarcity of data regarding invasive mold infections (IMIs) in children with cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients (18 years old or younger) with malignant disease who developed proven or probable IMIs (European Organization for Research on the Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group criteria) during a 10-year period (1998-2008). We reviewed their risk factors and clinical characteristics and assessed their crude mortality rates and treatment outcomes 12 weeks after IMI diagnosis. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (30 males) were identified, 30 (63%) of whom had a proven IMI. The most prevalent mold were Aspergillus species (40%), followed by Mucorales (20%) and Fusarium species (11%). Acute leukemia was the most common underlying malignancy (39 patients, [81%]). Twenty-three (59%) of them had refractory leukemia. Neutropenia was present at the day of IMI diagnosis in 67% of the patients. Sixty-two percent of the patients received prior corticosteroids. The dominant site of infection was the lungs (79%), followed by skin (29%) and sinuses (10%). Seventy-one percent of patients had radiological findings suggestive of fungal pneumonia (either nodules or masses). The mainstay of antifungal therapy was a lipid formulation of amphotericin B. Antifungal therapy resulted in 54% response rate (33% complete) at 12 weeks. The crude 12-week mortality rate was 31%. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that monocytopenia (P = .013), malnutrition (P = .012), and intensive care admission in the month prior to IMI diagnosis (P = .027) were risk factors for death within 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Although Aspergillus spp. was the most common mold in our pediatric cancer population, the epidemiology of the IMIs was diverse. Adults and children share similar risk factors for and epidemiology of IMIs.",,,"['(c) The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the', 'Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society.

Epub 2015 Nov 30.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a variable disease; therefore, markers to identify aggressive forms are essential for patient management. Here, we have shown that expression of the costimulatory molecule and microbial sensor SLAMF1 (also known as CD150) is lost in a subset of patients with an aggressive CLL that associates with a shorter time to first treatment and reduced overall survival. SLAMF1 silencing in CLL-like Mec-1 cells, which constitutively express SLAMF1, modulated pathways related to cell migration, cytoskeletal organization, and intracellular vesicle formation and recirculation. SLAMF1 deficiency associated with increased expression of CXCR4, CD38, and CD44, thereby positively affecting chemotactic responses to CXCL12. SLAMF1 ligation with an agonistic monoclonal antibody increased ROS accumulation and induced phosphorylation of p38, JNK1/2, and BCL2, thereby promoting the autophagic flux. Beclin1 dissociated from BCL2 in response to SLAMF1 ligation, resulting in formation of the autophagy macrocomplex, which contains SLAMF1, beclin1, and the enzyme VPS34. Accordingly, SLAMF1-silenced cells or SLAMF1(lo) primary CLL cells were resistant to autophagy-activating therapeutic agents, such as fludarabine and the BCL2 homology domain 3 mimetic ABT-737. Together, these results indicate that loss of SLAMF1 expression in CLL modulates genetic pathways that regulate chemotaxis and autophagy and that potentially affect drug responses, and suggest that these effects underlie unfavorable clinical outcome experienced by SLAMF1(lo) patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both experimental and ongoing clinical studies indicate that PARP-1 inhibitors are potent and promising anticancer agents. However, the outcome of treatment with PARP-1 inhibitors depends on the expression of PARP-1 protein in the tumor cells. This study aimed to assess PARP-1 expression in peripheral blood CD34+ leukemic cells before and after 12 hours of prednisone administration as well as the relation between PARP-1 expression and early treatment response to initial therapy and other prognostic factors (immunophenotype, age, initial peripheral blood white blood count [WBC], and risk factor group). The study comprised 43 children with de novo ALL. Cytospins of peripheral blood were stained with mouse anti-CD34-FITC and anti-PARP-1 antibody followed by goat anti-mouse APC-conjugated antibody. DNA was counterstained with PI (propidium iodide). Cellular fluorescence was measured by a laser scanning cytometer. Statistically significant differences in baseline PARP-1 expression with respect to early treatment response (good vs. poor), ALL immunophenotype (ALL B vs. ALL T), age (children < 1 years and > 6 years vs. children 1-6 years), initial WBC (< 20 000/microl vs. >/= 20 000/microl), and risk factor group (SR vs. IR vs. HR) were not found. PARP-1 expression was increased 12 hours after treatment in poor early treatment responders, whereas it remained statistically unchanged with respect to ALL immunophenotype, age, initial WBC, risk factor group and early treatment response. The overexpression of PARP-1 in poor early treatment responders suggests that it may contribute to treatment failure in this group of children with ALL. Our observation - if confirmed by other studies - may form the rationale for administration of PARP inhibitors in selected subsets of ALL children.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 10.,"FLI1 (Friend leukemia integration 1) is a metazoan transcription factor that is upregulated in a number of cancers. In addition, rearrangements of the fli1 gene cause sarcomas, leukemias, and lymphomas. These rearrangements encode oncogenic transcription factors, in which the DNA binding domain (DBD or ETS domain) of FLI1 on the C-terminal side is fused to a part of an another protein on the N-terminal side. Such abnormal cancer cell-specific fusions retain the DNA binding properties of FLI1 and acquire non-native protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid interactions of the substituted region. As a result, these fusions trigger oncogenic transcriptional reprogramming of the host cell. Interactions of FLI1 fusions with other proteins and with itself play a critical role in the oncogenic regulatory functions, and they are currently under intense scrutiny, mechanistically and as potential novel anticancer drug targets. We report elusive crystal structures of the FLI1 DBD, alone and in complex with cognate DNA containing a GGAA recognition sequence. Both structures reveal a previously unrecognized dimer of this domain, consistent with its dimerization in solution. The homodimerization interface is helix-swapped and dominated by hydrophobic interactions, including those between two interlocking Phe362 residues. A mutation of Phe362 to an alanine disrupted the propensity of this domain to dimerize without perturbing its structure or the DNA binding function, consistent with the structural observations. We propose that FLI1 DBD dimerization plays a role in transcriptional activation and repression by FLI1 and its fusions at promoters containing multiple FLI1 binding sites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chemical structures were determined based on extensive spectroscopic measurements 1D (1H, 13C and DEPT) and 2D (COSY, HSQC and HMBC) NMR, UV, IR and MS. The new compounds 1 and 2 were evaluated for their antimicrobial and antitumor activities. 1 and 2 were active against multidrug- resistant bacteria with MICs ranged from 2.2 to 4.5 muM. No toxicity was recorded for the two tested compounds up to 5 muM using Artemia salina as a test organism. Compound 2 showed excellent antifungal activity against some pathogenic fungi such as Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans (MIC 2.2-2.5 muM) and antitumor activity against both Ehrlich ascites carcinoma and lymphocytic leukemia (LD50 5.0 muM).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
